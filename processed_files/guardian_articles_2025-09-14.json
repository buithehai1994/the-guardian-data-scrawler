It’s like Deliverance in the HighlandsLucy ManganSun 14 Sep 2025 17.00 EDTShareAndrew Lincoln has been Rick Grimes – the leader of a group of survivors of a zombie plague in Frank Darabont’s at first mesmeric and then mesmerically dull post-apocalyptic series The Walking Dead – for 15 years. Off and on (and in a spin-off) but mostly on. Now, at last, he is free. He’s had a shower, a haircut and – thank God – cleared his throat after a decade and a half of rattling phlegmily through increasingly ropey scripts and pretending to care about his son Carl, and is appearing on stage in The Lady from the Sea at the Bridge theatre, London and on our screens in the fairly bananas thriller Coldwater.‘It will be frightening but you have to do it’: Andrew Lincoln and Alicia Vikander’s nerve-shredding stage returnRead moreYou can see what attracted Lincoln to the part. John is the anti-Grimes. We meet him (once the obligatory opening scene of the character covered in blood and running through some woods is over and we’ve flashed back to “Two months earlier”) fleeing the sight of a man in the playground beating up a woman, so panic-stricken that he leaves one of his two children there and has to go back for her. The family then moves to Scotland for a fresh start, although his high-flyer wife, Fiona (Indira Varma), seems far too intelligent for us to believe that she would countenance this as the answer to his post-playground PTSD and/or be married to a berk.For a berk John is. A supposedly willing househusband, he is bad with the kids and fails to keep on top of domestic matters, dumping them all back on Fiona the minute she walks in the door after work. He also can’t manage sex with her, though he’s OK when left to his own devices in the shower. I don’t know who to write to in order to beg for a different way of announcing that a show is going to deal with the crisis in modern masculinity, but there has to be someone. Or at least a helpline I can call.Still, the petty grievances of marriage are nicely interwoven with its vital practicalities in a way that helps keep the storyline engaging, when it could easily have devolved into complete nonsense. Conversations about feeling “old and shit” take place around compiling shopping lists; a laugh about “lady vicars” is shared amid a row about going next door for dinner; the sex thing matters but does not matter; rage and resentment fester for lack of time as much as unwillingness to deal with them – truly all of marital life is here.But John is still a berk. Also an unlucky berk, who becomes the target of a local bully, Angus Gillespie (Lorn Macdonald), after seeing him trying to intimidate the village’s young shop assistant, Catriona (Lois Chimimba). Plus, his new neighbours are a married Christian couple whose vibe is … distinctly off. Rebecca (Eve Myles) is a (lady) vicar who doesn’t believe in God but possibly believes in sapphism with the woman next door. Tommy (Ewen Bremner, head shaved, unblinking stare turned up to 11, no way this is going anywhere good, even before it is revealed that Tommy is almost as obsessed with serial killers as he is with leading them to salvation) really does believe in God and senses in John fruit ripe for the picking.Before you know it, but long after you’ve predicted it, Angus and John meet again, this time in those dark woods we saw John run through in the opening scene. Angus tries to throttle him; John brains him with a rock too many times to claim it was self-defence, and runs home only to be intercepted by the evangelical Christian with a serial killer obsession who offers to help clear up the mess. John, the berk, accepts – and then we’re really off to the races.By episode two, Coldwater has developed overtones of Deliverance-in-the-Highlands as Tommy begins upping the ante, Rebecca’s character becomes more fully fleshed out, and their relatively normal son grows suspicious of the increasing shenanigans (and the box of trinkets in Daddy’s shed). Catriona throws her own spanner in the works and there is a growing sense that the rest of the Bible study group wants watching too.It’s quality hokum, and if the examination of toxic masculinity and marriage gets subsumed along the way, I think I’d rather have a Highland village filling with murders than another shower scene by quite some distance.Coldwater aired on ITV1 and is on ITVX now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewAndrew LincolnreviewsShareReuse this content"

It was easy then to imagine him in a past life, stealing through Victorian Manchester as a gaunt fingersmith, his nimble hands relieving rich men of their excessive wealth. But the gory marks on his face always brought us back to the jolting present and his bruising reality as a young and aspiring boxer.In 2003, when I interviewed him for the first of many times in the atmospheric setting of that converted factory turned into a boxing gym, Hatton was 24 years old. The troubles of the future lay deep in the unknown because everything Hatton did then burned with an immediacy and urgency. He didn’t care that his gaunt and sickly face was mottled with dark blue bruises and crimson nicks which had yet to scab over and start to heal. “Basic wear and tear,” he said with a little grin, “and my skin’s abnormal”. “When I go out into the sun, no matter how long I spend outside, I stay deathly pale. I change colour in the ring. I mark up and I cut.”Ricky Hatton, former boxing world champion, dies aged 46Read moreHatton also changed his character between the ropes. The friendly young man turned intothe ferocious “Hitman”, as he was nicknamed, while he tore into sparring partners or hammered home withering punches into a body protector which could not stop his trainer, Billy Graham, telling me how it felt like he was being “murdered” by Hatton.“You hold your breath as you get knocked back,” Graham said as he described the full force of being hit by Hatton. “You try to move away. He nails you with another and another. You’re still holding your breath. It’s like having your head held under water.”As he pummelled his trainer, or crumpled tough old bruisers brought in for sparring, Hatton let slip eerie little cries and shrieks. Seeing Hatton hit so hard gave me my most vivid insight into how seriously dangerous yet dramatically thrilling boxing was in stark close up.After all the decades of hanging around gyms, watching fighters at work, only the memories of Mike Tyson at his most destructive in sparring can rival the vivid images I carry of the young Ricky Hatton. He was utterly lost in boxing – and he soon turned it into a spectacle which won him a vast and roaring army of fans.British boxing seemed a little lost then, as it does now, drifting between eras. The great nights of the 1990s had been elevated by the simmering rivalries between Michael Watson, Chris Eubank Sr and Nigel Benn.Boxingin that decade had also been shaped by the crossover appeal of fighters as complicated and contrasting as Frank Bruno and Naseem Hamed.But they were all lost or faded when Hatton stepped out of the shadows in a new century and instilled fresh vigour into the battered old fight business. He brought with him legions of new fans who followed him with rising fervour – partly because hewas so exciting to watchin the ring and partly because it seemed as if he really was just one of them, a seemingly ordinary working class kid who liked to drink, swear, watch football and have a laugh.View image in fullscreenTens of thousands of fans followed Ricky Hatton to Las Vegas for his fight in 2007 against Floyd Mayweather Jr.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersSix years later, when we were together in Las Vegas while he prepared for his penultimate fight, which resulted in him being knocked out chillinglyby Manny Pacquiao in 2009, Hatton spoke earnestly of how much it mattered to him that he was so loved. “They see me as an ordinary bloke,” he said of his fans, “and their mate”.Tens of thousands of his supporters arrived in Vegas that week, undeterred by the fact that Hatton had been knocked out two years earlier in that same gaudy cityby Floyd Mayweather Jr, and they kicked up an almighty racket for the fighter they regarded as one of their own.But, in his fleeting prime, Hatton was extraordinary. In the early summer of June 2005 he came through fire to outfight and ultimatelyoverwhelm the brilliant Kostya Tszyuat a rocking and near hysterical MEN Arena in Manchester. It remains one of the greatest nights in the history of British boxing – and the magnificent peak of Hatton’s tumultuous career. Victory brought him even more adoration, money and the demons of fame.As hard as he tried to stress his normality, by buying drinks for blurring strangers in heaving pubs as he matched them pint for pint, Hatton could feel himself slipping away. Years of hard drinking between fights also diluted his ability to maintain his once voracious work rate. His vulnerability outside the ring soon became evident in that unforgiving space between the ropes. Defeat against Mayweather and Pacquiao crushed him.When Iinterviewed him years later, as he made an ill-advised comeback in 2012, Hatton cut to the heart of his anguish: “It was criminal what I used to do to my body – drinking so much between fights and ballooning up in weight. We all laughed at Ricky Fatton but it was a miracle I got away with it so long. But I didn’t really get away with anything, did I? Life kicked my arse with a vengeance.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

My blood pressure was through the roof and I was 15st 6lb. My doctor said I was on the verge of a heart attack. What he didn’t know was how close, or how often, I’d already come to killing myself. I’ve had so many problems with depression, drugs, drink, the newspapers, fallouts. Every fuck-up you could make in life I did it.“It got to a point where I didn’t care if I lived or I died. I’d been this working-class hero, this down‑to‑earth Manchester lad, who people liked so much that 25,000 of them flew to Las Vegas to watch me fight, singing: ‘There’s only one Ricky Hatton.’ Look what they ended up with? Another fucking Ricky Hatton altogether – a drunk crying in the corner of a pub. They used to say of me: ‘What a fighter! What a cracking lad!’ And then they saw this weeping wreck.”View image in fullscreenRicky Hatton was extraordinary in his prime, overwhelming Kostya Tszyu in 2005.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersIn that interview Hatton also told me: “I was literally thinking: ‘I’m going to drink myself to death here.’ Jennifer [Dooley, his girlfriend and the mother of his daughter Millie] would find me there. Or she would get home and see me with a knife at my wrist. She would take the knife away and calm me down. That was happening on a daily basis at one time – Jennifer taking knives off me or me having panic attacks. I hated the person I’d become.”Hatton was just as hurt bya bitter estrangement from his parents, to whom he had once been so close, and his years in retirement seemed haunted by a yearning to find himself as he had once been – driven by the consuming dream of one day becoming a world champion. He fulfilled that dream, and did much more, but life was never again as pure and simple as it had been in the days with Billy “The Preacher” Graham.It seems telling that Hatton was planning yet another comeback at the age of 46 and, a few days before his death, he posted images of himself preparing for a planned exhibition bout in Dubai.There is often tragedy in boxing and the death of such a great middle‑aged fighter is another grievous loss. But he lived and burned with a furious intensity and, as the truth of his death sinks in, the memories of that ghost‑faced urchin in the broiling old hat factory rise up again. Ricky Hatton was unforgettable then – and he remains so now.Explore more on these topicsRicky HattonBoxingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Yet another sign tells visitors that this majestic landscape of water and sky inspired Seamus Heaney’s Nobel-winning poetry.View image in fullscreenPeople feed ducks and sea gulls on the algae-covered shores of the lake.Photograph: Paul Faith/AFP/Getty ImagesBeauty, ecology, heritage, tourism, fishing – the UK’s biggest lake, sitting in the heart ofNorthern Ireland, had bragging rights to fill a hundred signs. But now they line the shoreline as testaments to hubris because of an environmental disaster.The 400 sq km (150 sq mile) freshwater lough ischoking on recurring toxic algal bloomsthat coat the surface, kill wildlife, unleash stenches and make the lake all but unusable. Eel fishing has been suspended and tourists have fled.The lough and surrounding watercourses are on course torecord their worst year, with at least 171 detections of cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) growths, according to agovernment pollution tracker. The algae’s return was a “distressing but timely reminder of the need to urgently turn the tide on the ecological crisis”, Northern Ireland’s environment minister, Andrew Muir, said in a statement.View image in fullscreenThe algae on Lough Neagh forms patterns and swirls said to be reminiscent of works by Gustav Klimt.Photograph: Paul Faith/AFP/Getty ImagesThe main cause is an overload of phosphorus and nitrogen from agriculture, including farm runoff, fertilisers and animal waste. Inadequate wastewater treatment facilities and septic tank leakage aggravate the problems. Additional factors are sand extraction, warming water and proliferating zebra mussels, an invasive species.The Stormont executive agreed arescue plan last yearbut has balked at reining in polluters, prompting condemnation from Claire Hanna, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party: “Lough Neagh is dying in front of our eyes. Images of fish and eels gasping for life on the surface are not just shocking – they are a stark warning of total ecological collapse.”This week an activist, Bea Shrewsbury, attempted to present a “Lough Neagh smoothie”, drawn from the lake, to assembly members at Stormont. Police escorted her away.The lough supplies 40% of Northern Ireland’s drinking water, which is treated and said to be safe. Not everyone is convinced. “I’ve not drunk from the tap in a year,” said Brigid Laverty, 67, who lives by the lake. This week the Food Standards Agency said toxins have been found in the flesh of some fish for the first time but that commercially harvested fish remained safe to eat.View image in fullscreenA sign by Lough Neagh extols the lake’s history and ecology.Photograph: Rory Carroll/The GuardianThe water should be light brown but has turned green, said Peter Harper, an environmental officer with theLough Neagh Partnership, a nonprofit group. In some places the sludge – so widespread it isvisible from space– forms mosaic-type patterns and swirls redolent of Gustav Klimt, said Harper. “It can be weirdly beautiful.”The impact on wildlife is incalculable, making the tourism-themed shoreline signs a grim joke. “What lies beneath?” says one. “A world of ancient history and astounding myths is waiting just below the surface.

Use the DAERA dead wild bird reporting tool service if you find dead gulls, waders, ducks or swans.”DAERA is the department of agriculture, environment and rural affairs – a bureaucracy that critics say prioritised the farms and agrifood companies that expanded pig, chicken and cattle numbers in the past decade and overloaded the soil’s ability to absorb nutrients. They did so with official blessing in a “going for growth” strategy.“It was not thought through,” said Gerry Darby, the manager of the Lough Neagh Partnership. “I’ll put it another way.

He said the lake could die unless action is taken to clean it up.Photograph: Rory Carroll/The GuardianMuir, of the Alliance party, said his department had completed or made good progress on most of the 37 points in an action plan agreed last year, but said Stormont faced “difficult decisions” over key measures. Sinn Féin and theDemocratic Unionist party, who dominate the executive, appear to have stalled the nutrients action programme over fears of a farmer backlash.Darby said there was no magical solution, only trade-offs, but still expressed confidence that politicians would take the necessary measures. “The lake is not dead,” he said. “It could be dead if things continue as they are.”Explore more on these topicsNorthern IrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

She went on: “Apart from commemorating a deceased person’s life, you’ll be hard pushed to find a really bad moment in your feed.” Here, it seemed, was a modern iteration of the opiumalways purveyed by free-market capitalism, resulting in a constant stream of personal happiness and precious little recognition of life’s more difficult aspects: social strife, inequality, disagreement.Of course, users still post impossibly upbeat depictions of who they are and what they do. But for the most part, we now live in a completely different era. A lot of explanations for this centre on what has become the internet’s most rampant kind of content: the short-form video popularised by TikTok, and then spread further by such imitations as Instagram’s Reels and YouTube Shorts. Those innovations have triggered a complete upending of the online world: rather than posts about personal contentment and bliss, as our fingers scroll and swipe, we are now fed a diet of violence, prejudice, damage and social unrest. It is warping our understanding of the world, and rapidly reshaping our politics.Be in no doubt: this is how the political future is being decided, as the past week has vividly demonstrated.Before his murder, the rightwing US activist Charlie Kirk had amassed more than seven million TikTok followers – and as oneUS writer put it, the essential story of his assassination was about “an influencer shot to death at a school in front of a crowd of smartphones”. Consider also what happened on Saturday in London – when, after months of rallying cries going out online, an estimated 110,000 people gathered at the instigation of the agitator and influencer known as Tommy Robinson, and wereaddressed via the internet by Elon Musk.Aside from the latter’s platform-cum-hellhole X, Robinson (whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon)has been thrown offmost of the big social media platforms. But that actually speaks volumes about how his activities are sustained and boosted by material that works in much more insidious ways. And TikTok –which banned him in April 2020– is full of it: everyday, mundane-looking content that now provides the mood music to so many countries’ lurch to the right.What is the endgame in this toxic immigration debate: is it friends and neighbours thrown out of the country? | Jonthan LiewRead moreIn June, the London Review of Books published asuperb articleby the academic and writer William Davies, referring to this phenomenon as “Faragist TikTok”. He described opening an account and sampling what then poured into his “for you” feed: “Clips of masked men cutting down ultra-low emission zone cameras with angle-grinders. Clips of supermarket shelves displaying inflated new prices. Clips of fights breaking out in the street.” More than anything else, he said, he was presented with footage that constantly conveyed the same flailing fury: “Clips of men and women addressing their phones while sitting in cars or out walking, lamenting the state of ‘Starmer’s Britain’, their words appearing in TikTok’s distinctive pink-highlighted font.”When I read this, I instantly recognised what he was talking about. On the occasions I had tried to digest what Musk had done to X, scenes of that kind were exactly what I had found. Scrolling through Instagram was sometimes similar. I then did the same thing as Davies and got half-immersed inTikTok(at 55, I had previously assumed it was not for me). Soon enough, what I was expecting materialised: a disused warehouse in Manchester that had been set on fire, a group of hooded youths being arrested by a gaggle of cops, and a crowd of neo-Nazis, marching in front of a union jack and joylessly reciting the chant that echoed around the capital at the weekend: “Keir Starmer is a wanker.”View image in fullscreenPolice hold back protesters at the ‘unite the kingdom’ rally in London, 13 September 2025.Photograph: Tayfun Salcı/EPAWhat does this do to people? Where you live might seem stable, uneventful and full of people who are law-abiding. Most places, after all, are like that. But if you are one of the social media users in Britain who spends mind-boggling amounts of time on TikTok (on Android devices, the average was recently put at49.5 hours a month), the spectacle that erupts on your screens might suggest that venturing outside will soon plunge you into disorder, crime and chaos – and that those things really do define life elsewhere. This, I think, at least partly explains the place of the archetypal city in some people’s modern paranoia: the idea that multiculturalism has turned London into a crime-infestedno-go area, or that Washington DC, Chicago and Los Angeles are in such a state of social disrepair that Trump has no option but tosend in the national guard.A decade after Trump opened his first term with that apocalyptic speech about “American carnage”, British voices along a rightwing continuum have followed suit.Robinson tells his followersthat “a massive civil war is going to happen in Britain”. The shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, says the UK is “like a tinderbox”. Reform UK’s Nigel Farage – who has 1.3 million TikTok followers,more than all other MPscombined – constantly talks about social collapse: when I went to Reform’s recent conference, it was not hard to find people who endorsed his claims that Britain is on the brink of “major civil disorder”. As proved by the fact that the summer failed to explode into the riots that some politicians and media voices predicted, the real world shows this is so much hyperbolic rubbish, but Farage contests any such suggestion with a nod and a wink to his supporters. “I don’t think anybody in London even understands how close we are to civil disobedience on a vast scale in this country,”he says, a claim that comes with an implied instruction: “Have a look at your phone. See?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Again, look atwhat happened in London on Saturday: clashes with police that were all filmed, edited and uploaded. This is how reality and its representation online fall into a feedback loop. Phone videos show ever-increasing chaos, and people are convinced to join the massing forces who think the only answer is some kind of nativist authoritarianism. The crowds duly swell, unrest ensues, and our “for you” feeds are filled with even more material.All this presents a big problem for orthodox politicians. Back in the aforementioned era of innocence, one of the then Tory leader David Cameron’sattack lines against the governmentwas that it was presiding over “broken” Britain, which now looks like an early, milquetoast try-out of the new right’s catastrophism. In 2008, Gordon Brown attempted a rebuttal inthe speech he madeat the Labour party conference. “The Conservatives say our country is broken – but this country has never been broken by anyone or anything,” he said. “This country wasn’t broken by fascism, by the cold war, by terrorists. Of course there are problems, but this is a country being lifted up every day by the people who love it.”When I read those words and thought about that great ocean of online video, a thought came to mind: these days, could anyone imagine a Labour politician saying anything similar? And, if they did, would they not look like the epitome of complacency and denial? And then I once again realised how absurd all of this is, and how much the supposed reality that politicians have to deal with is now confected, overblown and often completely illusory. Such is life in the modern society of the spectacle, and such is the huge change in how people understand the world and their place in it that it starts to look like a sinister kind of magic.John Harris is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The mass starvation is quieter. Even images of dead children rarely pierce Israel’s media bubble. The war appears in protests over the hostages, political debates, stickers with the faces of fallen soldiers on walls and bus stops. Palestinian suffering – by contrast – remains distant, abstract, unmoving.After two years, Israeli society is adapting: the army has developed a practice of not calling reservists who are likely to dodge the draft; instead, it turns to former soldiers in need of cash or employment, offering them to fill the ranks of its combat units. At times, special arrangements are made so that reservists can keep working in their old jobs, practically doubling their income. Civilian contractors are hired to systematically raze whole neighborhoods in the Strip; they are paid by the house. The IDF is becoming a new military, adjusted for permanent operations inGaza, the West Bank and the northern borders. The rest of the public goes on with their lives. War is the new normal.In early August, Israel’s security cabinet ordered the military to occupy Gaza City, where some of Hamas’s leadership is supposedly hiding. The assault began with the toppling of high-rise buildings last week. Yet the term “occupation” is misleading: Israel has no intention of ruling over the more than 1 million Palestinians sheltering in the city. Emboldened by US support, the military has ordered residents to move to a so-called “humanitarian city” in the south, while Gaza City will be leveled to the ground. This would mark another step toward realizing the far-right fantasy of removing Palestinians from the territory altogether. Until then, they will remain crammed into a corner of the Strip, given only the bare minimum to keep them alive – and at times, not even that.What used to be political discourse on the conflict is giving way to a mythical language of victimizationThis week, several countries – among them France, the UK and Australia – intend to recognize the state of Palestine during the UN general assembly. Many people have long deemed the two-state solution dead, and nothing could seem further away from it than the dystopian reality on the ground. But the recognition is a sign of international engagement and a much-needed message for Israelis, who have moved into a creepy fantasy land: a recently leakedAmerican-Israeli presentation, reportedly debated in the White House, imagines a new Gaza as a kind of futuristic theme park placed under US trusteeship and refashioned by international corporations into a glossy “Riviera of the Middle East” of smart cities, tourism and tech hubs.Yet the real danger in Israel today is that nobody imagines a future at all: the society is locked in a permanent present. The war is unpopular, but enough are willing to serve it and only few are actively protesting against it. The liberal opposition movement and the protests over the hostages have morphed into each other, along with the pre-war domestic fights over the government’s plans to weaken the judiciary. Together, they have created a sense of never-ending crisis that Netanyahu and his coalition have managed to turn into an asset.View image in fullscreenIsrael Defense Forces helicopters fly over the Tel Aviv beach and boardwalk during sunset in Israel.Photograph: Alexi J Rosenfeld/Getty ImagesA recentpollfound most people are not interested in getting more news from Gaza. The major networks broadcast cooking shows, reality TV and sports. Big Brother just had one of its most watched seasons, interrupted only for a brief moment when three anti-war protesters managed tostorm the studio stage. “Everything is fine,” said the host. “Keep those votes coming in!”At times, it seems as if confusion and frustration lie beneath the acceptance of the atrocities carried out in our name: a society that lost its way, is unsure how to end the war, fearful of the reckoning that awaits, and resorts to violent tantrums instead.At other moments, a backward-looking narrative takes hold, one that is more coherent but also more perilous: what used to be political discourse on the conflict is giving way to a mythical language of victimization. It is a story in which 7 October 2023 is the continuation of the Holocaust, Hamas are the new Nazis, and the current war is our biblical retribution.The idea that Jews and Palestinians are locked in an eternal, zero-sum battle for the same land ֹ... narrows our political imaginationSigns for this old-new vocabulary are everywhere. It is common among Jews, for example, to add the initials for “blessed his memory” next to the name of the dead – but in this war, almost every soldier or civilian victim is memorialized with the phrase “Hashemyikomdamo” (God will avenge his blood). Verses and quotes such as “I have pursued mine enemies and destroyed them” (2 Samuel 22:38) appear in military headquarters and battle orders; a calendar distributed by the military rabbinate early in the war placed the Gaza campaign on a mythical timeline that included David’s victory over Goliath and Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza in 1967.This turn toward mythical thinking – the idea that Jews and Palestinians are locked in an eternal, zero-sum battle for the same land ֹ– dominates not just Israeli society, but much of the political thinking abroad. It obscures the more mundane reality that has enabled today’s carnage: a political system where one people rules and the other is ruled. It also narrows our political imagination, reducing the range of what is possible and fostering passivity precisely when action is most urgently needed.Tomorrow Is Yesterday is the fitting title for anew bookby two former negotiators and experts on the conflict. Hussein Agha and Robert Malley observe that the current war is not just a regression to a pre-peace process era decades ago. Nor is the systematic destruction of Gaza just a repetition of the Nakba, the Palestinian mass expulsion during Israel’s war of independence. There is something fundamental in both societies that looks into the past for political meaning, a core of their identity that surfaces now.Malley, a key member of Bill Clinton’s Middle East negotiating team, is the son of an anti-Zionist Egyptian Jew who sympathized with the Palestinian cause and knew the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. As a young diplomat, Malley had been present at the Camp David summit in 2000, which was supposed to bring about a lasting Israeli-Palestinian peace deal, but ended up catalyzing the start of the second intifada 25 years ago this month. Later he served as Obama’s Middle East coordinator and as an envoy to the Iran nuclear talks. Agha, an intellectual of Iranian, Iraqi and Lebanese heritage who teaches at Oxford, was a longtime adviser to Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas, often operating as their envoy in formal and informal negotiations channels.Their unique backgrounds – Hussein, who was viewed as Palestinian by choice rather than by heritage, and Malley’s anti-imperialist upbringing – often made the two a dissenting voice in diplomatic circles, insiders and outsiders at the same time. After the Camp David failure they challenged the dominant view, expressed by President Clinton and the senior members of his peace team, which placed all the blame for the failure on Arafat and the Palestinian side for not accepting “Israel’s generous offer”.View image in fullscreenFrom left to right, Ehud Barak, then Israeli prime minister; Bill Clinton; and Yasser Arafat take a walk during the Middle East peace summit on 11 July 2000 at Camp David, Maryland.Photograph: Stephen Jaffe/AFP/Getty ImagesA year after the summit, in a much debatedpiecein the New York Review of Books, Malley and Agha pointed to the ways in which a deep-rooted American bias toward Israel led to poor preparation for the summit, unrealistic expectations and fundamental misunderstandings on all sides. To blame Palestinians alone, they warned, was not only unjust, but a recipe for disaster.More than two decades later, the two have returned with a more radical diagnosis, shaped also by their experiences in subsequent talks. In Tomorrow Is Yesterdaytheyargue the peace process was doomed from the start – not by tactical missteps or bad faith, though these existed in abundance, but because it fundamentally misunderstood the conflict itself.Now both sides are resorting to familiar roles: Israelis to triumphalist violence, Palestinians to resistance and survivalThe negotiations, Malley and Agha now write, attempted to suppress history itself, since what drives Israelis and Palestinians are not just tangible interests but existential longings rooted in history. For Jews, these flow from centuries of displacement and persecution, culminating in the Holocaust, and from what they call “the long, frustrated quest for a normal, recognized, and accepted homeland”. For many religious Israelis, this translates into a sacred claim over the entire land:Kol Israel(roughly, “all of Israel are responsible for one another”). These, rather than the liberal peace camp, are the deep, authentic voices driving the society.For Palestinians, the core demands are equally elemental: to redress a history of dispossession and massacres, expulsion and dispersal, discrimination and denied dignity. Accepting Israel as a Jewish state is not, in this view, a pragmatic compromise but an intolerable “affront” – a move that would legitimize the very catastrophe that created their exile and retroactively criminalize their decades of struggle. Israelis seek something close to eternal security, which easily becomes eternal dominance; Palestinians want a return to a pre-Israel life that no longer exists.View image in fullscreenIsraeli soldiers shoot at stone-throwing Palestinian teenagers in Khan Younis in the Gaza Strip during the second intifada on 24 October 2000.Photograph: Thomas Coex/AFP/Getty ImagesThe two-state solution, concludes the duo who devoted much of their life to reaching it, “is not the natural resting place for either Israelis or Palestinians [as] it runs counter to the essence of their national identities and aspirations”. The attempt to reach it was doomed because “both groups cannot accept a definitive closure”, since “neither is prepared to relinquish otherworldly dreams for the sake of an earthly understanding”.What emerged was an artificial process, sustained through bias and denial. By privileging Israel and suppressing Palestinian claims, ignoring more radical or religious stakeholders, and prioritizing security over justice, US-led diplomacy built not peace but a pressure cooker. It blew up on 7 October.Since 7 October, my therapy patients have asked themselves: who are our people?Read moreMalley and Agha’s account is clear-eyed and unsparing, rejecting the very conventions that upheld the imbalance at the heart of the process. It reads like the work of people who have burned their bridges – and it fits the gravity of the moment.Hamas’s murderous attack, they say, was not an aberration but “Palestinian through and through” – an explosion of grievances over decades of displacement and humiliation that the peace process never addressed. Israel’s brutal response, in turn, was equally revealing: less the product of Netanyahu’s extremism than of a longstanding pattern, in which Palestinian resistance is met with overwhelming force designed to restore deterrence, dominance and territorial control.Now both sides are resorting to familiar roles: Israelis to triumphalist violence, Palestinians to resistance and survival.Once the cloud of grief over 7 October began lifting, something vile and wicked entered the Israeli public discourse: a certain enjoyment of the humiliation of Palestinians and their sympathizers that in the past was only found on the political margins.Every criticism of Israel, any sympathy for the Palestinians, any pressure to end the war, is seen today as a form of antisemitismThe minister for interior security, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has made it a habit of posting images of bent, blindfolded and handcuffed prisoners, and supporting cutting down their food rations or banning Red Cross and family visits (according to Israel’s own records, only one-fourth of the people arrested in Gaza are fighters, but all detainees are portrayed as terrorists in the media). Hanoch Daum, a popular commentator and writer, recently drew massive social media engagement with an AI-generated imagemocking Palestinian hunger as a hoax. The climate activist Greta Thunberg, who leads flotillas to Gaza, is another favorite target for ridicule. Expelled after her first attempt to reach the Strip, authorities made a point of seating her on the worst seat on the plane, passengers hurled insults at her, and the pilot announced his support for the IDF on the speakers.Every criticism of Israel, any sympathy for the Palestinians, any pressure to end the war, is seen today as a form of antisemitism – even endorsement of Hamas. Over 60% of Israelis, according torecent polls, believe “nobody in Gaza is innocent.” Along with Israel’s sense of impunity, this popular notion explains how this war has turned into a genocide.The core of Palestinian identity, most Israelis believe, is the physical destruction of their state, as manifested in the 7 October attack. “It was each and every Palestinian, for nearly eight decades, who wished, believed and acted to bring this exact moment,” wrote Einat Wilf, a former member of the Knesset for the Independence and Labor parties, in a new book she co-authored about the right of return. ”Hamas was the one who fulfilled their dream.” Her conclusion: There is no solution at hand; Israel must be willing to fight Palestinians “for generations”.Oddly enough, these words echo Malley and Agha’s observations, and their view of the conflict as a clash of narratives. “[It] is not essentially about territory,” they recently wrote inthe New Yorker. “It is not about roads and dunes and hills. It is about people, their lives, emotions, anger, grief, attachments, and history.”View image in fullscreenA Palestinian throws stones at Israeli soldiers on 23 March 2012, in protest against the closure of a road by Jewish settlers during the second intifada  in the West Bank village of Kafr Qaddum.Photograph: Jaafar Ashtiyeh/AFP/Getty ImagesYet the reality is not of two sides arguing over myths but one sovereign power ruling over millions of people without rights. It is not just a conflict, but a problem inherent to a regime. The most important local dynamic is a de facto one-state condition in which half the population – namely, the Palestinians – is excluded from the political system.Israel controls every border, every checkpoint, every natural resource, every aspect of the economy. It decides where Palestinians can work, travel, or build; it denies them legal protection, allows their property to be vandalized or taken and leaves them exposed to violence.Racism and ethnic hatred, even the endorsement of old myths – these are not intrinsic to Jews or Palestinians, but are byproducts of this system of segregation and dominance. This is what Ta-Nehisi Coates observed when he visited the West Bank on the eve of 7 October. “What my eyes now saw … was a world where separate and unequal was alive and well, where rule by the ballot for some and the bullet for others was policy,” he wrote in his recent book, The Message. “I was seeking a world beyond plunder – but my proof of concept was just more plunder.” Yet, he writes elsewhere, “even plunderers are human beings whose violent ambitions must contend with the guilt that gnaws at them when they meet the eyes of their victims. And so a story must be told.” In Israel, Coates recognized the colonizer’s sense of “fragile triumphalism”.We must recognize that violent instability is baked into any system where one side has power and rights and the other has noneIt is Palestinians’ lack of rights, their existence in a political no-man’s land, that makes them expendable to a system that largely conditions protection on political rights. It allows the US and Israel to toy with ideas of mass deportation and real estate ventures. Thisisa conflict about hills and territory: Palestinians have been pushed outside the system that governs people and nations, so now they can be pushed (again) out of their land. The besieged Gaza – a territory belonging to nobody, governed for decades by an unrecognized militant group – was the physical embodiment of the Palestinian condition.The danger now is surrendering to fatalism: the idea that ancient hatreds or religious attachments make the current trajectory inevitable.Whether held by outside observers such as Malley and Agha or rightwing Israelis, this view misreads how religion and identity work in politics. These doctrines may claim to be eternal, but they shift according to the needs of the moment. Orthodox Jews once rejected Zionism as sacrilege; they became the most rightwing Israelis as their dependence on the state grew. Israeli rabbis banned prayer on the Temple Mount; since its fate became an object in peace talks, they began endorsing it. The Likud’s original symbol included the kingdom of Jordan within the Jewish state, now even the most rightwing Jew imagines the entire land of Israel without it. Interests and circumstances, not ancient beliefs, construct political imagination.More importantly, the idea of clashing identities easily becomes another justification for murder, as is happening in Israel today. Instead, we must recognize that violent instability is baked into any system where one side has power and rights and the other has none.The destruction of Palestine is breaking the world | Moustafa BayoumiRead moreSince the Oslo process in the 1990s, much of the world has accepted the Israeli framing: Palestinian rights would be recognized only after a peace process was completed. In other words, rights were treated as conditional on Israeli interests – a prize to be granted at the end rather than a foundation to guide negotiations. This is the root of past failures. But if rights become the starting point, then the two peoples could finally choose their political future: one state, two, or some in-between like a federation. No choice would need to be final; states can divide or unite, agreements can evolve. The very idea of a definite end point is an illusion.Recently, there are signs that the west is opening its eyes to the horror in Gaza, mainly due to sustained civil society activism. It is not surprising that the United States is mounting unprecedented opposition to the countries deciding to recognize Palestine, including by withholding visas from Palestinian officials seeking to travel to the UN. For Washington too, Palestinians exist only on Israel’s terms. So far, the countries leading the recognition effort are not deterred; pushing against American hegemony over diplomacy is another positive byproduct of recognition.As limited as the recognition of Palestine – a state with no territory or sovereignty – is, it is a step in the right direction, because it re-establishes the existence and the rights of Palestinians as individuals and as a collective. It finally moves up the end goal, which should have been a precondition to the talks all along. More urgently, it strengthens the Palestinian case in international institutions and further justifies the demand for sanctions that could end the war.Steps against Israeli ministers who advocate ethnic cleansing and genocide, assome countries are considering, are another positive development. More should follow, and more rapidly; as the destruction of Gaza is happeningnow. We need more political engagement and risk-taking, and a willingness to break old taboos.History’s myths may feel eternal, but like the violence they sustain, they are choices – and choices can be remade.Noam Sheizaf is a journalist and documentary film-maker based in Tel Aviv.

Now, cases among young women are on the rise and doctors are baffled. Could air pollution be behind it?Anna MooreSun 14 Sep 2025 09.00 EDTShareTowards the end of 2019, Becca Smith’s life was full and hectic. At 28, she had taken on a unit in Chester to convert into a yoga studio, poured in all her savings and hired teachers, while at the same time working as a personal trainer. Her days started at 5am; she was driven, stressed, excited, and had no time for the back pain that just would not subside.“It kept moving around,” she says. “Every day it would be in a different part of my back. I was strapping on heat packs and ice packs just to get to work.” Smith saw her GP, her physiotherapist and a chiropractor, all of whom suspected a torn muscle. “What really worried me,” she says, “the worst-case scenario, was a slipped disc.” One day in March 2020, the pain was so intense that Smith took to her bed, fell asleep and woke with a crashing migraine and blurred vision. Her mum took her to the optician who shone a light behind Smith’s eyes, saw haemorrhaging and sent her straight to the hospital. Once there, Smith was admitted, and over the course of a week, had an MRI, a CT scan, and a biopsy taken from the cells in her back.Smith was alone in her bed when two doctors appeared, closed the curtains, and told her that she had cancer in her lungs that had spread down her spine and up into her brain. It was stage four. “They said there was nothing they could do for me,” says Smith. “All I remember is ringing my mum and screaming down the phone. The doctors told my parents that I probably had about two weeks to live.” This was the early days of Covid, and Smith chose to go home for palliative care. “I think I’ve blocked a lot of it out, as you do when you go through trauma,” says Smith. “My friends all came to say goodbye. They were sitting at the end of my bed crying their eyes out. I’ve still got a whole book of the letters they wrote me.”View image in fullscreenBecca Smith had planned to open a yoga studio before she became ill.Photograph: HandoutFor decades, lung cancer has been viewed as a disease of older men, a “smokers’ disease”, heavily stigmatised and until very recently, grossly underfunded.One analysis from 2010found it received only 6% of cancer research funding, despite being thethird most common cancer in the UK.In recent years though, the patient profile has shifted. Smoking remains the main risk factor, but cases among fit, young, non-smoking women have risen, both as a proportion and in absolute numbers. And while screening is now available in England for those over 55 with a history of smoking –76% of the lung cancer cases identified by screening are at stage one or two andpotentially curable – young, non-smoking women like Smith tend to be diagnosed only after the cancer has spread.Dr Alex Georgiou, a consultant medical oncologist at Guy’s and St Thomas’ hospital, has analysed the data of his lung cancer patients to understand these changes. “Between 2010 and 2021, the number of patients at our clinic who haven’t smoked has increased every year,” he says. “In 2010, it was 5% of cases. By 2021, it was 14%.”Of these non-smoking lung cancer cases, 68% were women, compared with 43% of those with a history of smoking. There was also a higher proportion of younger patients: 16% of the non-smoking patients were aged below 50 compared with 5% from the smoking group – and more Black and Asian patients too. White people made up 72% of the smoking cases, compared with just 44% of the non-smoking.“We might expect a high proportion of Asian patients, as non-smoking lung cancer is very prevalent in south-east Asia,” says Georgiou. “But the higher number of black patients is less recognised. They made up 17% of the non-smoking cases versus 5% from the group with a smoking history.” There were also clear differences in stage of presentation and disease progression. Two-thirds of the non-smoking patients presented at stage four, the most advanced stage, and 38% had cancer that had spread to the brain. “It’s not only that the demographics are different,” says Georgiou. “The biology of the cancer is different too.”These findings reflect worldwide trends but, as yet, none of it is fully understood. According to Cecilia Pompili, a thoracic surgeon and clinical senior lecturer at Hull York Medical School, we are just beginning to ask the questions. “For so long, we didn’t think of lung cancer as a disease of young women and often haven’t even included them in clinical research trials,” she says. (For example,men have made up 65% of participantsin groundbreaking immunotherapy trials for lung cancer.) Pompili is interviewing women with lung cancer about their early symptoms and diagnosis pathway, for a study funded by the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation.Adenocarcinoma is the most common lung cancer diagnosed in non-smokers, and while some women experience the “classic” persistent cough, and also coughing up blood, for others, symptoms are more vague and non-specific, such as weight loss, or back pain. “We want to understand the symptom trajectory and also whether women are treated differently by their health provider,” says Pompili. “We know from some patients that a 40-year-old, fit woman with a persistent cough is more likely to be diagnosed with an allergy, asthma or an infection than an older male smoker who will be sent for a chest X-ray.”Identifying why lung cancer is rising in women requires much more research, says Pompili. Hormones could play a part. Worldwide, indoor air pollution caused by wood-burning stoves and biomass fuels used for cooking and heating has been identified as a significant risk factor. In the UK,outdoor air pollution is believed to cause around one in 10 lung cancers. “Air pollution has been demonstrated to be significant for both genders, especially in younger patients,” says Pompili. It’s possible that women’s smaller lungs and narrower airways lead to a higher concentration of pollutants and a greater likelihood of fine particulate matter – 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter – becoming trapped.Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, whose nine-year-old daughter Ella was the first person in the world to have air pollution listed as a cause of death on her death certificate, is not surprised. “Ella had asthma but there are 700 diseases impacted by air pollution,” she says. “When I think of younger women with lung cancer, I wonder about the school run, the time sitting in cars or buses in heavy traffic. When I think about the higher number of black and brown people, I think of economics. Who takes buses, and waits at bus stops, and lives in social housing and cheaper housing close to main roads?“London is the most congested city in Europe. Worldwide, we are number five,” continues Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, who campaigns for cleaner air through theElla Roberta Foundation. “Yet somehow, officially, Ella is still the only person who has died because of air pollution. We’ve got to the point where the burden of ill health caused by air pollution is so huge, I’m asking myself: ‘What will it take to make the public demand more action?’”Also key here – but again, not fully understood – is the role of genetic mutations, especially in younger non-smoking women. Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are the most common,believed to cause 10-15% of lung cancers in the UK.Recent researchhas identified how air pollution might “wake up” dormant cells in the lungs that carry these cancer-causing mutations, promoting their growth.Sarah Li, a 42-year-old freelance film-maker, was diagnosed with EGFR-positive lung cancer last year. A non-smoker and a vegan, Li lives in London and was signed up for her seventh marathon at the time.“I’d had a persistent cough but I wasn’t worried,” she says. “I’d had a cold first and the cough just seemed to come off the back of it.” Li was also experiencing pain in her right shoulder. “Looking back, that was another symptom but I didn’t know enough to join the dots.” A physio suggested shoulder exercises and a pharmacist sold Li syrup for her cough. After four months though, as the cough worsened, Li saw her GP, expecting antibiotics for a chest infection. Instead, she was referred for a chest X-ray, then fast-tracked for a CT scan. In April 2024, Li learned she had inoperable lung cancer, with a tumour on her left lung, and cancer also present in nodules in her right lung.“Even now, I find it strange when I say I have lung cancer,” says Li. “I can say I have cancer – so many people get cancer – but the idea of lung cancer still feels quite foreign. How am I the face of lung cancer? When I was first diagnosed, I went through everything, asking: ‘Why? What did I do?’ I think I led a healthy lifestyle, but I lived in India for four years, in Hyderabad, a busy city. I feel strange blaming any one thing or focusing on what I might have done wrong. Nobody wants this.”View image in fullscreenSarah Li was diagnosed with lung cancer last year.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianAlthough Li had only been with her partner Robin for 18 months, they had to have difficult conversations about fertility and future children. “Did I want to freeze my eggs before treatment? We decided it was better to keep me alive and start treatment as soon as possible.” In fact, the impact of lung cancer on fertility has only just become an area of research. The International Pregnancy and LungCancerRegistry was launched in December 2023. “Understanding how lung cancer and its treatment impacts young women in all ways – their whole lives, their fertility, their young family and caring responsibilities, their career, is only just beginning,” says Pompili. “It’s something we have done for breast cancer – but not lung cancer.”After years of underfunding (widely attributed to lung cancer’s link with smoking), pioneering treatments are developing fast – especially for cancers like Li’s, driven by genetic mutations. In the last decade, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence hasrecommended 48 new treatmentsfor lung cancer – six times more than in the previous decade.Li’s first round of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy led to massive reductions in her tumours. However, in January, a small lesion was found on her brain. She is now having a targeted therapy – a daily pill – and more chemo. “Life is more intense now,” she says. “There’s more vividness to everything. Like today, I’m just so happy that I’m feeling well enough to be outside, to have a nice lunch. Those little things you take for granted … you’re just way more appreciative of it all. The idea of talking about ‘two years’ time’ or ‘five years’ time’ like my friends do? I can’t. I know that eventually the cancer will outsmart the treatment I’m on. Hopefully, by then, there’ll be another treatment pathway.”Smith is in the same position. A few weeks into her palliative care, the family were informed by phone that the biopsy taken from Smith’s back showed a genetic mutation, ALK-positive lung cancer, and a treatment was available. She began taking eight tablets a day – targeted cancer drugs, ALK inhibitors – with monthly blood tests and scans every three months. “It went well, there was a big reduction in cancer,” she says. “After two years, I got some progression in my brain, so I’m on the second line of treatment now.”Explaining her disease to others is exhausting. “You always get the same reaction,” she says. “‘But you don’t smoke?’ ‘You’re so young?’ There’s such a community around breast cancer – more power to it – but with lung cancer, there really isn’t. It feels like it’s just you.” This is despite the fact that the diseasekills as many womenas breast, ovarian and cervical cancers combined.Smith is a pilates teacher now – this summer, she went on a yoga retreat in Bali. Her partner, Sammy, flew out to join her in July and, during a walk on the beach, he proposed. “This is my dream. I’m enjoying my life,” she says. “I’ve gone through so much. I lost the yoga studio, I lost a lot of money, but the things you think matter? They really don’t. All I care about is my family and friends, and being happy and healthy.“I still feel sadness and I’m scared – I’m terrified because I don’t know what’s to come,” she continues. “Scans never get easier, but you get better at dealing with them. It’s a cliche but I genuinely live for today now – and five years on, I’ve finally reached a stage where I can be grateful for that.”Explore more on these topicsLung cancerCancerHealthYoung peopleAir pollutionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is core to our country’s values,” the prime minister said in a statement to the Guardian. “But we will not stand for assaults on police officers doing their job or for people feeling intimidated on our streets because of their background or the colour of their skin.”He added: “Britain is a nation proudly built on tolerance, diversity and respect. Our flag represents our diverse country and we will never surrender it to those that use it as a symbol of violence, fear and division.”Robinson and Farage’s ‘civil war’ narrative is warping voters’ minds. How is any government supposed to counter it? | John HarrisRead morePolice estimated that between 110,000 and 150,000 people attended the event on Saturday, which was addressed by Elon Musk. Musk told the crowd that “violence is coming” and that “you either fight back or you die”.He said: “I really think that there’s got to be a change of government in Britain. We don’t have another four years, or whenever the next election is, it’s too long. Something’s got to be done. There’s got to be a dissolution of parliament and a new vote held.”Starmer’s forthright commentsmay settle some nerves in Labour, where there has been growing concern that the prime minister has not yet done enough to take on the attacks of the right.View image in fullscreenRiot police push a protester during the ‘Unite the Kingdom’ demonstration in London on Saturday.Photograph: Krisztián Elek/SOPA Images/ShutterstockHowever,parliament’s black caucus, led by the Labour MP Dawn Butler, issued a statement condemning “racism, abuse and anti-migrant hatred” and called for greater leadership on the issue.“The government must show leadership. It must take urgent steps to reduce tensions, call out and challenge racist rhetoric and behaviour wherever it occurs, and take far more seriously the threat posed by the far right – which police have identified as the UK’s fastest-growing threat,” the group said in a statement.Other MPs issued their own strongly worded condemnation on social media, including the former shadow cabinet minister Rosena Allin-Khan and new MPs Lizzi Collinge, Kevin McKenna and Ben Goldsborough. McKenna particularly condemned Musk’s address to the rally, describing it as “a call for violence against the British state, from a foreign national who controls a major propaganda engine, and has engineered it to monetise hate”.Before the march, the anti-fascist group Hope Not Hatesent a letter to the prime ministerasking him to make public condemnation of growing racist rhetoric. The call was echoed by a number of senior MPs who said Labour had a duty to counter growing rightwing extremism.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said moments like the demonstration were “klaxon calls to us in public life to redouble our efforts to address the big concerns that people right across our country have, and immigration is a big concern”.The Labour MP Stella Creasy tweeted: “In spirit of free speech I disagree with Peter Kyle – we can defend right of people to protest and still be concerned that for many watching yesterday purpose behind this event is not freedom but fear.“They must be able to march and we must challenge message as not who we are.”The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, suggested the Conservatives should also speak out to condemn the violent rhetoric. He said: “Elon Musk openly called for violence on our streets yesterday. I hope politicians from all parties come together to condemn his deeply dangerous and irresponsible rhetoric. Britain must stand united against this clear attempt to undermine our democracy.”Twenty-six officers were injured in clashes as projectiles were hurled on Saturday, and the Metropolitan police said on Sunday that 24 people were arrested for a range of offences including common assault and violent disorder.A man who said on camera that “Keir Starmer needs to be assassinated” and “someone needs to shoot Keir Starmer”, and whose comments were published online, is among those being sought by police.Robinson was among those who addressed the crowds from a stage, along with a range of other far-right figures. However, there were no-shows by promised speakers including Steve Bannon, the former Trump strategist, and Jordan Peterson, the Canadian psychologist and culture warrior.Others who appeared on the stage included the former Reform UK deputy leader Ben Habib, who is setting up a rival party to the right of Reform known as Advance UK, which Robinson says he has joined.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerLabourFar rightImmigration and asylumTommy RobinsonnewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianExclusive: The duke talks about the cost of war, his portrayal in the press and boxing as the Guardian joins him on a visit to KyivByNick Hopkins; photographs byDavid LeveneSun 14 Sep 2025 13.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 14 Sep 2025 21.32 EDTShareIt’s about midnight. It’s raining. A small group is huddled around a lonely roadside cafe somewhere near the border between Poland andUkraine, getting wet in the drizzle, sharing cartons of chips and bottles of beer.One of the bedraggled men wonders out loud why on earth the owner of the cafe would choose to close now, when surely this must have been the busiest it has ever been, stuck out here in the middle of nowhere, with a captive and hungry audience.Everyone laughs. It turns out,Prince Harrycan be quite funny.It helps to keep things jolly as the security detail work out how to ferry everyone from here to the train that will take them on a secretly planned trip to Kyiv.View image in fullscreenPrince Harry stops for a bite to eat at a roadside food truck.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianThe aim of the visit is to promote the work of the Duke of Sussex’s Invictus Games Foundation (IGF), and to celebrate the recovery and rehabilitation of the thousands of veterans there who have suffered life-changing injuries since the war with Russia began three years ago.Because of the sheer numbers of wounded, Invictus has become increasingly well-known in Ukraine, and Harry, somewhat surprisingly, has achieved cult-hero status.The Guardian accompanies him on the journey to the capital – something of a gamble for both sides, as Harry noted. He is suspicious of the media, and the Guardian has long been critical of the monarchy.And over the next 36 hours, we learn a lot – big and small – about this complex, conflicted man. He doesn’t like posing for staged photographs, and he doesn’t like cycling (“I have a bony ass”); he likes to box to relieve his frustration – “hitting the hell out of a bag”, he says, helps him to decompress.View image in fullscreenThe prince and his team travel from Medyka in Poland, on the border with Ukraine, on an overnight sleeper train.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianIn private he is very informal, padding around in his socks on the train to and from Kyiv and making dad jokes.In public he has a confident voice and an easy charm with strangers, but on his own he is softly spoken and asks questions about people, and about politics. He has views.He is not, he says, the unhappy man some of the press like to portray him as, but yes, he wants to spend more time in the UK.Does he regret putting his side of the story in the very public way that he has? No he doesn’t. “My conscience is clear.”He talks a little about his mother, Diana, and his father too. If Invictus is his professional priority, it seems clear his father is a personal one.But all that comes out on the way back to the UK; what is happening in Ukraine is his immediate concern, and for good reason.‘One of the saddest things I have ever seen. Also one of the most beautiful’View image in fullscreenThe Duke of Sussex visits a memorial in Maidan Square, Kyiv to soldiers killed in the war.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianThe statistics are shocking and they are on the rise.The war in Ukraine has left at least 130,000 people with life-changing injuries, many of them double and triple amputees or with disfigured faces.With no sign of the conflict ending, the Ukrainian government has put using sport as a way to help the recovery and rehabilitation of these veterans at the heart of a national policy, and the country’s prime minister, Yuliia Svyrydenko, has turned to Invictus for inspiration and help.View image in fullscreenThe Ukrainian prime minister, Yuliia Svyrydenko, shows Prince Harry the top floor of  the Ukrainian government cabinet building, which was hit by a Russian missile attack a week ago.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianView image in fullscreenThe remnants of the missile remain on the floor.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianView image in fullscreenHarry with Yuliia Svyrydenko.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianUkrainians themselves have embraced the whole concept. The men and women who have taken part in the biennial Invictus Games have become national heroes and front-page news.But these competitions only involve small numbers, and the need is vast.So Invictus has been devising programmes to help veterans all over the country get access to sports facilities. At a reception on Friday morning, the IGF team are guests at the National Museum of the History of Ukraine in the Second World War, where they meet ministers and dozens of the recovering wounded.View image in fullscreenPrince Harry at the National Museum of the History of Ukraine in the Second World War.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianView image in fullscreenA veteran takes a selfie at the Superhumans event at the museum.Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian“Sports recovery and rehabilitation did not exist in Ukraine before Invictus,” Ruslan Prykhodko, the deputy minister for veterans affairs, tells the Guardian.“Now we are creating a whole system with different kinds of training and preparing teams in all kinds of sports.”View image in fullscreenHarry speaks with veterans at the event.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianAnd it’s here that Harry’s popularity among Ukrainians becomes very clear.The injured want to talk to him, the mothers and fathers of the wounded and dead want to shake his hand, or hug him. He is cheered and clapped at every turn, as are his colleagues.View image in fullscreenHarry with Olga Rudnieva, visiting the site of a missile strike last month in the residential Solomienka district in Kyiv, where more than 20 people were killed.Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian“It’s amazing. We never expected this level of recognition,” says Olga Rudnieva, the founder and CEO of the Superhumans trauma centre in Lviv, which has worked closely with Invictus in Ukraine.“Ordinary people know who he is. We honestly didn’t know he had become such a celebrity. I think Prince Harry coming here is a symbol of victory and power. People look at him and his military experience and they see he is not afraid to come to Ukraine. It is so important that he came.”View image in fullscreenPrince Harry speaks on stage at the Superhumans veterans event.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianFor this, and for the other causes he is passionate about, Harry accepts his “front and centre” role and does it willingly. Encouraging those who have been seriously injured to find a purpose outside the military is one of his messages.“I would say that I have been fortunate,” he says. “The one thing that people miss when they hang up their uniform is purpose.“Losing a sense of community and being part of a team, and of course the camaraderie and adrenaline. But at the heart of it is your job, your role is serving a purpose larger than yourself.”His work for Invictus, he says, has given him that after his military career. It “saved me”.View image in fullscreenPrince Harry speaking with Nick Hopkins during a break after attending a Superhumans veterans event.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianChanging attitudes across society about disabled people is another core message.“Seeing people with prosthetics and life-changing injuries is going to be the norm in Ukraine for the coming decades,” he tells the Guardian.“Nobody should feel embarrassed or ashamed about their disabilities. It’s about flipping from sympathy to admiration and respect.”Such is the need for men and women to fight the war, some of the wounded have even ended up back in the military.“A lot of the participants in the Invictus Games go back to active service,” says Helen D’Oyley, the IGF’s chief growth officer. “Ukraine has become our key strategic priority because of the need there is here.”Later in the day, the team stops at Maidan Square in the heart of Kyiv, where an unofficial memorial to the dead has sprung up. It is a moving and ever growing field of photos of the dead, flags, messages and flowers.Harry wanted to lay a wreath, but as the crowds grow around him, he steps into the thick of the memorial to be on his own.View image in fullscreenPrince Harry at the memorial to soldiers killed in the war.Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian“I wanted to find a spot to lay the wreath in peace away from everyone. My God it’s like a maze in there. I didn’t appreciate how far back it went. Honestly, it is one of the saddest things I have ever seen. But also one of the most beautiful.” The war, he suggests, could and should have been avoided. “It is all so unnecessary.”After this visit, the prince disappears. His car heads off away from the convoy for about an hour and when he returns to the group, he is coy and tight-lipped.The suspicion is that he has gone to meet Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but neither he nor the president wants to admit it.Zelenskyy is a champion of the Invictus Games and had made it known he wanted to meet the prince. The British government had made it known to Zelenskyy it would rather he did not. That was the chat in diplomatic circles, at least.The theory was that giving the rebel royal a platform might not be smart politics on a day that Britain’s new foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, was also in town.But only one Briton is making any headlines in Ukraine on Friday.View image in fullscreenPrince Harry says goodbye, before boarding the train in Kyiv to begin his journey back to London.Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian‘I am very happy with who I am and I like the life that I live’The trip to Kyiv comes at the end of a busy week for Harry.From Monday to Thursday he was in the UK, undertaking a series of events related to the causes he supports. He also met his father, King Charles, for the first time since February 2024. On an overnight train heading back to Poland, Harry says he thinks the whole week has gone well, and feels hopeful about the future.During the trip, some elements of the tabloid press have published stories that left his team with their heads in their hands.It appears to make Harry more certain of the need to take on the papers who, he says, have unfairly targeted him and his family.The prince, along with Doreen Lawrence and Elton John among others, is suing Associated Newspapers, the publisher of the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday.A trial is due to start in January.“Yes, I have enjoyed the week,” says Harry. “I have always loved the UK and I always will love the UK. It’s been good to reconnect with the causes I am passionate about. I have been able to spend some time with people that I have known for so long. It is hard to do it from far away.”He adds: “It is only in certain elements of the press where you see this talk about me being down or saying I am not smiling. This comes from people who think they know what I am thinking and how I am feeling. They are wrong.“I think parts of the British press want to believe that I am miserable, but I’m not. I am very happy with who I am and I like the life that I live.”If he hasn’t always seemed cheerful, then that is hardly surprising, given what he has been going through, he says.“I have certainly had to deal with some very stressful events over the last four years. There has been the uncertainty and stress of the litigation and finding out certain things that have really, really hurt.”But he believes there is a disconnect between what is written about him by some commentators, and what most other people think.View image in fullscreenPrince Harry after attending a Superhumans veterans eventPhotograph: David Levene/The Guardian“I feel a lot of support from the British public. Even now, when I feel like I have been destroyed by certain members of the British press.“It serves them to think that the British public feels the same way about me as they do.“But I don’t feel that and I don’t see that. For as long as I have known, certain elements of the British press have tried to speak on behalf of the nation. I think they are out of touch with the nation on lots of things.“They hope to bring the public with them, but … I think the British public can speak and think for themselves.”Would he like to spend more time in the UK? To bring his children one day, despite the issues over his security arrangements?“Yes I would. This week has definitely brought that closer.”Harry won’t talk about his father, but he seems to suggest he wants, and needs, to see his father more often.Over the coming year, he says, “the focus really has to be on my dad”.Harry mentions his wife, Meghan, only once by name, a reference to something she told him about how telling the truth “is the most efficient way to live”.“She said ‘just stick to the truth’. It is the thing I always fall back on. Always.“And if you think like that, who would be stupid enough to lie? It takes up too much time and effort.”Which brings him to the very public things he has said about his life; the interviews, the TV series and the book he wrote, Spare.“I know that [speaking out] annoys some people and it goes against the narrative. The book? It was a series of corrections to stories already out there. One point of view had been put out and it needed to be corrected.”He adds: “I don’t believe that I aired my dirty laundry in public. It was a difficult message, but I did it in the best way possible. My conscience is clear.”Being called stubborn slightly rankles with him. “It’s not stubbornness, it is having principles.”It seems he does not want to prolong any legal battles.He does not ever expect to get positive coverage from some quarters – a ceasefire is, perhaps, the best he can hope for.“It is not about revenge, it is about accountability,” he says.Nor does he want to prolong any divisions with his family.But in life, he says, “you cannot have reconciliation before you have truth”.Harry, who turns 41 on Monday, appears a bit bemused by his popularity in Ukraine.View image in fullscreenPrince Harry receives gifts during a Superhumans fundraising lunch at the Fairmont hotel in Kyiv.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianView image in fullscreenPeople film Harry during his visit to Maidan Square.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianBy the end of the visit he has so many bags of presents to take home, including a dagger hidden inside an ornate walking stick, they take up most of the free space in the back of the private jet that returns him to the UK.He puts it down to the fact he served 10 years in the army, and the way Ukrainians have adopted the ideas of the Invictus Foundation.He is told that Rudnieva thought part of the reason people liked him was because he is quite Ukrainian in his attitude to life: he does his own thing, in his own way.“You know who else did that?” says the prince. “My mum.”Explore more on these topicsPrince HarryUkraineMonarchyinterviewsShareReuse this content"

It came after details of the appearance were published bythe Sunday Times.In a statement, the MP said he had emailed details of the trip to his office but said: “Unfortunately, these submissions were not added to the register. This was an error … A correction to the record will be made tomorrow along with an apology to the registrar.”According to a parliamentary code of conduct, MPs must register any visits outside the UK that cost more than £300 and where the trip is not “wholly” paid for by the MP or by public funds. They must also separately report any “fees” or “payments in kind”. The deadline for doing so is 28 days.In his statement, Farage said the trip was “remunerated in three separate instalments over the course of two months” but did not say who had paid for it. He added that he had paid for the travel arrangements himself.Daisy Cooper, the Liberal Democrat deputy leader, said: “Nigel Farage needs to come clean on who’s bankrolling his trips abroad to badmouth Britain. He uses every opportunity he can to talk down Britain and suck up to Trump while failing to represent his constituents in parliament.“The public deserve to know whether the Trump administration and their cronies are funding these trips, using Farage as a puppet to meddle in British politics.”Farage missed prime minister’s questions the day before the “Disruptors’ dinner” in Tallahassee, which was organised by the Republican party, on 20 March.Farage has faceddays of scrutinyover the purchase of a house in Clacton, Essex, which initially he said he had bought himself. He later said it was bought by his long-term partner, Laure Ferrari.This arrangement would have saved the MP an estimated £44,000 in the higher rate of stamp duty to which he would have been liable given that he already owns other properties.Farage’s lawyers, Grosvenor Law, said last week that they had received written advice from a senior barrister that “concludes that there is no underpayment of SDLT [stamp duty land tax], that SDLT paid was properly calculated and that there is no basis to suggest there has been any improper avoidance or evasion of tax in respect of the purchase”.Anna Turley MP, the Labour party chair, said: “Nigel Farage has failed to disclose who funded this US trip, refused to answer questions about his tax affairs, and changed his story about where he lives.“Rather than representing his constituents in the UK parliament to which the people of Clacton elected him, he’s been jetting off abroad to call for sanctions against our country, putting British jobs at risk.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Titled Don’t Mention the Children, the poem was written in 2014 in response toa Guardian articleabout the Israeli government banning a radio advert naming children killed in Gaza. It begins:Don’t mention the children.Don’t name the dead children.The people must not know the namesof the dead children.“The first time I read Michael Rosen’s poem, not only was I profoundly moved, I was also in shock,” Pearce told the Guardian.“Rosen’s brutal commands stare directly into our soul and force us to confront the cruelty of erasing a child, erasing their name, their memory and their life.”Others featured include the actors Ambika Mod, Joely Richardson, Juliet Stevenson, Denise Gough, Khalid Abdalla, Zawe Ashton and Indira Varma; as well as the presenters Laura Whitmore and Nadia Sawalha, the model Poppy Delevingne, the emergency doctor Dr Mo Mustafa, the activist Stephen Kapos, and the poem’s creator, Michael Rosen.The project is paired with renewed calls by Save the Children and Choose Love for the UK government to “end its complicity in the horrors unfolding in Gaza and the West Bank”.They are urging the public to sign apetitiondemanding “the immediate suspension of all arms transfers to Israel; all perpetrators to be held to account and an end to Israel’s impunity; and decisive action to be taken to bring Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory to an end”.“We have all seen the devastating images of children inGaza, but with time comes a dangerous desensitisation – people look away, or the suffering is ignored, let alone justified by the perpetrators or those complicit,” Pearce said. “The simplicity of this poem doesn’t allow that escape.”He added: “Taking part in this recital was, for me, a matter of conscience. Every day in Gaza, children are being killed, maimed or starved – trapped in a nightmare they did nothing to create. We cannot allow this horror to be normalised. I urge everyone to speak out and to act. Silence is complicity.”At least 20,000 children have been killed in Gaza since October 2023, according to the health authorities in Gaza, though independent surveys suggest the figure is far higher. The photographer and Oscar-nominated director Misan Harriman, who spearheaded the film project, said children in Gaza had “endured a relentless stream of atrocities” for nearly two years.“Their homes, schools and hospitals destroyed, the deliberate use of starvation as a weapon. And still, the world does nothing to stop it,” he said.Save theChildrenhas been working in Gaza for decades, running primary healthcare centres and providing essential services including screening and treatment for malnutrition. But the aid organisation said it had been unable to get any of its own aid into Gaza since 2 March.Rosen said: “I wrote Don’t Mention the Children 11 years ago in response to an attempt to silence the names of children killed in Gaza. It is heartbreaking that the poem is still so relevant today – in fact, the situation for children has only grown worse.“Behind every number, every statistic, is a child with a name and a future that has been stolen. We cannot allow them to be erased. To deny their names is to deny their humanity, and we must resist that erasure at every turn.”Explore more on these topicsGazaChildrenPalestinian territoriesWest BankIsraelGuy PearceAnnie LennoxnewsShareReuse this content"

They also supported adding more money to protect members of Congress, but they deferred to the legislative branch on further steps.News of the request comes as House Democrats prepare to hold avirtual security briefingon Sunday evening, following Kirk’s death. The briefing will be with the House sergeant at arms and the Capitol police chief.Last week, rightwing activist and Trump allyCharlie Kirkwas killed while speaking at an event at a university in Utah and a suspect wasarrested. Despite the shooter’s motive still beingunconfirmed, conservatives have expressed anger and concern, blaming liberals and leftwing activists for Kirk’s killing. The right has declared war on the left, leading prominent politicians to cancel events over safety concerns and threats.Charlie Kirk’s death raises fears of ‘beginning of a darker chapter’ for US violenceRead moreAs the Guardianreportedon Sunday, instances of political violence have been rapidly increasing in recent years.More than 520 plots and acts of terrorism and targeted violence occurred in nearly all US states during the first six months of 2025. At least 96 people have died and 329 injured from that violence. That number is also a nearly 40% increase over the first six months of 2024, according theStudy of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorismat the University of Maryland.Last week, House speaker Mike Johnson said congressional leaders were reviewing security for members of congress.“We have to protect people who run for public office, or no one will and that is heavy on our hearts and minds,” Johnson said.The Trump administration’s request for an additional $58m in security comes as the deadline for government funding is approaching at the end of the month.

He remains in custody on suspicion of rape. The woman is continuing to receive support as the investigation continues.In a statement released through the Sikh Federation, the victim expressed her gratitude to her community. “I want to sincerely thank everyone for supporting me and my family during this very difficult time,” she said. “We are going through a lot, but the strength and kindness shown by the right people in the community has been incredible, and I can’t thank them enough for being my voice.“I would never wish this on anyone. All I was doing was going about my day on my way to work, and what has happened has deeply affected us. Through it all, my family has been my rock, and my community has stood strong beside me.“The police are doing their best to find those responsible and I truly hope they are caught so that this doesn’t happen to anyone else.”Ch Supt Kim Madill, of West Midlands police, described the arrest as a “significant development in the investigation”. She said: “We want to thank the community for their continuing support. The investigation remains ongoing and we would urge people not to speculate as we work to identify and trace all those who may have been involved.”Police previously said they were looking for two white men in connection with the attack. The first was described as having a shaved head and a heavy build, wearing a dark sweatshirt with gloves. The second was said to be wearing a grey top with a silver zip.Local MPs expressed their shock after initial reports of the attack. Sarah Coombes, Labour’s MP for West Bromwich, which includes Oldbury, said the incident was “absolutely horrible”, adding that such “violence and hatred has no place in our society”.Gurinder Singh Josan, the Labour MP for Smethwick, previously said the “truly horrific attack” was being treated as a hate crime, while Preet Kaur Gill, the Labour MP for Birmingham Edgbaston, said she had been contacted by concerned constituents. She said: “Our Sikh community and every community has the right to feel safe, respected and valued. Racism and misogyny have no place in Oldbury, or anywhere in Britain.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

If it happened inUkraine, by Ukrainian definitions, that would be regarded as a 100% success,” he said.Natoannounced on Fridaythat it would deploy more jets to the alliance’s eastern flank to protect against future drone attacks. On Saturday, Polish and allied aircraft were again deployed due to a renewed threat of drone strikes in western Ukraine. The airport in the eastern Polish city of Lublin was closed and people in border areas received SMS alerts to exercise caution. However, there was no reported incursion this time.On Saturday, Romaniabecame the latest Nato member state to report a Russian drone incursionin its airspace, scrambling two F-16 fighter jets to monitor the situation. The country’s defence ministry said it strongly condemned Russia’s actions, which were described by the EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, as unacceptable.Sikorski said the Polish response would have been “much tougher” if last week’s attack had caused injuries or deaths in its territory, but declined to elaborate on how such a response could look in a future scenario. “With an aggressor and a liar like Putin, only the toughest counter-pressures work,” he said.Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, last week said the incursion had brought his country closer to military conflict “than at any time since the second world war”. Sikorski rejected the suggestion byDonald Trumpthat “it could have been a mistake”, saying too many drones were involved. “You can believe that one or two veer off target, but 19 mistakes in one night, over seven hours, sorry, I don’t believe it,” he said.View image in fullscreenThe Polish president, Karol Nawrocki, visits the country’s largest airbase in Krzesiny, after the Russian drone incursion.Photograph: Łukasz Cynalewski/Agencja Wyborcza.pl/ReutersPolish anti-drone teams will receive training from Ukrainian operators to help defend against future attacks, said Sikorski. “The Ukrainians have better equipment for dealing with Russian drones, and they have much deeper and more up-to-date experience of resisting the Russian army,” he said.“This is something that the public and the governments in the west need urgently to integrate in their thinking … that it is the Ukrainians who will be training us how to stand up to Russia, not the other way around,” he added. Training for Polish teams on Ukrainian anti-drone best practice would take place at a Nato training centre inPoland, a “safer environment” than doing it in Ukraine.Sikorski was speaking on the sidelines of an annual conference in Kyiv that gathered the Ukrainian elite and international politicians to discuss prospects for the country after more than three years of full-scale war.Ukraine war briefing: Zelenskyy tells allies ‘stop looking for excuses’ on sanctions as Russian drone flies over RomaniaRead moreTrump addressed the Yalta European Strategy conference with a short video message, making his oft-repeated claim that the war would not have started if he were president, and claiming that “we’ve made more progress toward peace in the past three months than Joe Biden made in the whole three years”.Trump’s Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, was also in Kyiv, and told the conference the US president was becoming “exasperated” with Putin. But he cautioned European leaders who were frustrated with Trump’s apparent softness on the Russian leader not to push him too hard.“One thing I would advise anyone who is working with President Trump – do not put him in a position where he thinks he’s being used, that is probably the worst place you can be with him,” said Kellogg.Sikorski said he hoped Trump would receive the Nobel peace prize if he could achieve “a fair peace” in the conflict, which he described as “Ukraine within defensible borders and a Ukraine that is integrating with the west”. When it was suggested that Trump had so far showed not much sign of pressuring Putin to accept such an outcome, he said: “He has his personal style, we respect it, but we will judge it by results.”At a meeting in Paris earlier this month, 26 countriespromised to contribute to a postwar security missionfor Ukraine, some with boots on the ground. Some European countries have floated the idea that Ukraine, while unlikely to be admitted to Nato any time soon, could be given “article 5-like” guarantees after a future peace settlement, to prevent Russia attacking again.“Somecountries are talking about boots on the ground. We really want it because this is real deterrence which will be needed for Ukraine,” said Ihor Zhovkva, a senior aide to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Poland has said it would not contribute troops to such a mission and Sikorski, speaking to the conference, cautioned against grand rhetoric when it came to future guarantees.“Security guarantees are meant to deter a potential adversary … So what we are saying is that if there is some kind of peace, the next time Russia tries anything against Ukraine, we might go to war with Russia. Now I find that not very credible. Because if you want to go war with Russia, you can do it today and I see no volunteers. And there is nothing more dangerous in international relations than giving a guarantee that is not credible,” he said.Explore more on these topicsPolandUkraineRussiaDrones (military)Donald TuskDonald TrumpKarol NawrockinewsShareReuse this content"

Flags are also being hoisted in Scotland and Wales, to a lesser extent.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianExplanations abound as to the genesis of the flag-hoisting and street furniture painting. Some associate the outbreak with its most extreme cheerleaders, of whom Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson, may be the best-known.It was certainly an initiative Robinson had been been keen to exploit before his so-called free speech rally in London on Saturday, to which an estimated 110,000 people were drawn and where 26 police officers were injured in skirmishes.Among the firebrand speakers addressing a turbulent sea of St George crosses and the red, white and blue of the union jack was the French far-right politician Éric Zemmour, who claimed the UK was enduring “the great replacement of our European people by peoples coming from the south and of Muslim culture”.Others, wearily, or indeed angrily, reject claims that there is anything fundamentally “far-right” or racist about what is going on around the country, regarding condemnation of the flag phenomenon as confirmation that the “uniparty” that has run Britain for decades in cahoots with “the mainstream media” cannot be trusted. But there is at least one thing on which there is agreement: it was in Weoley Castle (pronounced Wee-lee), a neighbourhood of largely postwar council stock homes, where the first organised flag display got going.View image in fullscreenFlags fly in Weoley Castle in Birmingham.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianThe key men behind the spark-that-spread, a 45-year-old heating engineer known as Sean Doolan and his brother, have been notably shy about explaining their motivations.“A group of proud English men with a common goal to show Birmingham and the rest of the country of how proud we are of our history, freedoms and achievements,” Doolan’s self-styled Weoley Warriors wrote on their crowdfunding page. “Giving hope to local communities that all isn’t lost and they are not alone.”Any army marches on its stomach, and the “lads”, as approving local people describe the 20 or so core members of these warriors, have been nourished by the two ladies buttering white sliced loaf at the Castle Snax cafe on the south side of “the square”.View image in fullscreenFlags on lamp-posts in Weoley Castle in Birmingham.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianBetween filling the sandwiches, Nicole Moy and Shazza McCormack collect donations for the flags and pass on quietly offered suggestions by local people, anxious about possible illegality, as to where the flaggers should visit next with their ladders and cherrypickers.Spending time with Moy and McCormack, along with those hoisting the colours elsewhere around the country, and speaking to those who despair at the emergence of the flags and those who celebrate them, is a journey of discovery – about what is being said and what is being heard.Ali Raza Khaki, a senior lecturer at the Al Mahdi Islamic studies institute in Weoley Castle, said he had an open-mind, but wondered what lay behind it. “In principle, it’s fine, but when it’s done with an agenda, that’s where the problem lies. So we don’t know.”Can an angry protest also be a celebration? Can such a visual street-by-street campaign against immigration policy avoid feeling like an attack on first, second and third-generation immigrant families? Is it responsible to use what are supposed to be national symbols of unity to pursue such a campaign? Is it responsible for the authorities to let them carry on, or indeed to stop them?West Midlands:‘That’s all you want, isn’t it: everyone to get on and be happy?’It was not the most encouraging of introductions to Castle Snax. “Not talking to you, you tell lies,” said a bearded man sat on one of the two high stools squeezed into the tiny cafe. The aproned women, busy behind a glass counter laden with fillings spooned into plastic containers, giggled.View image in fullscreenNicole Moy (left) and Shazza McCormack at Castle Snax.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“A lady come today with a Scottish flag and a donation, it’s not just the English,” said Moy. “People are just loving it. There is a little note, with a clip and some money in there. We had an old lady come in with £2 worth of 5ps.”“She raided her money box,” said McCormack.“People are making it a racism thing …” said Moy.“They are not doing it for racism” interjected McCormack.“No, but I think we are making a bit of a stand,” said Moy.A stand over what? The suffocating cost of living (“You go to Asda, it’s an extra 40, 50 quid”), the scale of immigration in recent years and the people on the small boats arriving on the south coast and “getting everything for free”. Then there is the right of the people here to speak their mind.“I think people saying that we can’t fly our flag, I think it’s made us a little bit more determined,” said Moy.It started four months ago. Flags were put up on nearby Bristol Road in response to the proliferation of Palestine flags in other parts of Birmingham in support of those suffering in Gaza, they said. People liked what they saw, and asked for more. Now the warriors were buying pallets of 2,000 flags at £4,500 a time, said Moy.“They say it is racist … You’ve got other people putting up their flags, and we’ve got to accept it,” said one of the cafe’s younger customers popping in for her lunch.View image in fullscreenFlags outside homes in Birmingham.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianSome had torn down the flags outside their homes, said Moy. But they are soon put up again. Among those donating were people of Islamic faith, it was claimed.As to Robinson? “I do like certain things he says, but then other things … he is making out all Muslims are bad. They are not, they are not,” Moy said.At the back of the cafe, McCormack pulled a face. The former leader of the English Defence League was not for her. The flags were a celebration of a British way of life, she suggested. They provided a much-needed morale boost.The women understood that Doolan planned to spend what was left of the donations after “it was all done” on a party on the square’s green.“The communities are getting together,” McCormack said. “That’s never happened. That’s all you want, isn’t it, everyone to get on and be happy?”Westminster:‘Its meaning is very determined by its context’“This does periodically happen,” said Prof Nick Groom, author of The Union Jack: the Story of the British Flag, when asked of precedents to the recent flag-hugging.The St George’s cross was selected by Oliver Cromwell as his standard in the civil war. The union flag could be said to have been a symbol of the sexual revolution in Britain too. “Every hip cat had a union jack bed spread, a union jack on the wall, bands draped them over their amplifiers and made jackets out of them – part of the reason for that was there were so many flags after the war,” said Groom.It was then associated with skinheads in the 1970s, and rescued by Cool Britannia in the 1990s when Tony Blair conceived his revolutionary reimagining of Britain as a young country.Then there was Boris Johnson, who appeared to want to put a union flag stamp on the Brexit revolution with an announcement that all civic buildings would hoist it in an expression of national pride.The key to understanding the pliability of the meaning of the British flags, said Groom, was that unlike in France, where there are rules over the use of the tricolour, or in the US, where there is veneration of the stars and stripes, “there have never been any laws about how the union jack should be used or flown”.View image in fullscreen‘There have never been any laws about how the union jack should be used or flown.’Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“Its meaning is very determined by its context,” he said. “There is a responsibility not to let the extremists set the agenda as to what it means.”Part of that responsibility could be said to lie with those waging political campaigns around the flags.Gordon Brown, in his first speech as prime minister in 2007, also recognised the government needed to acknowledge pride in place and flesh out what these national symbols meant to avoid them being “hijacked by those who seek to work against values of tolerance and respect”.Yvette Cooper, who moved this week from home secretaryto foreign secretary, was unattractively accused of “flag shagging” by some on the left of British politics when she disclosed that she had union jack bunting in her home.Was it not, though, a nod to Brown’s prescience about the fragility of the union, her allies countered? A recognition that showing respect to the flag was to show respect for the norms and values of the people who live in this country and not just foreigners in peril?Such arguments are nothing new. “In leftwing circles it is always felt that there is something slightly disgraceful in being an Englishman,” George Orwell wrote more than eight decades ago. “If you were an intellectual you sniggered at the union jack … It is obvious that this preposterous convention cannot continue. The Bloomsbury highbrow, with his mechanical snigger, is as out-of-date as the cavalry colonel. A modern nation cannot afford either of them. Patriotism and intelligence will have to come together again.”The north of England:‘Identity is hardwired in people, especially when confronted’The flags spread to York a month ago, causing much controversy, and leading to a most peculiar scene in the car park outside Tang Hall working men’s club on Thursday evening.View image in fullscreenFlags flying at Tang Hall in York.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianIn response to the activities of a group who call themselves Flag Force UK, who have successfully plastered the St George’s cross and union jack across the city, a so-called International Flagging Committee had started going out in the dead of night to put the flags of other countries and movements up alongside the British flags on the lamp-posts of York.It was not a criticism of the act of flying the home flags, said the group’s spokesperson, a young PhD student at York University, but an attempt to make it more friendly, amid evidence of a surge in racist attacks.This had not gone down well. Someone connected to Flag Force UK had pulled the flags of the other countries down and taken them hostage. The International Flagging Committee wanted them back. The police had been called. An amnesty had been arranged at the working men’s club.The arrival of David, a polite man in his late 20s carrying a black bin bag full of the looted international flags, marked a moment of high tension. In the end it was settled in the most British of ways.There was an apology from David, a university graduate, to the irate landlady of the working men’s club, who was unhappy to have her establishment embroiled in the row.This was followed by a meandering and lengthy debate between the campaigns about the meaning of the international flags, which concluded with a handshake. Everyone was getting cold in the Yorkshire rain and the International Flagging Committee spokesperson said she was starving.Earlier in the day, the City of York council leader, Claire Douglas, had announced that all the flags would be taken down, at an estimated cost of £250,000 to taxpayers.It was “right to have a deep pride in our home, our city and our country”, Douglas said, but the hoisting of the flags had coincided with a rise in the number of racist attacks.She said: “Many in our communities are feeling threatened and uncomfortable. Children have been racially abused by adults on their way to school and council staff are being abused simply for doing their jobs of removing graffiti from our roads. This cannot go on.”View image in fullscreenA flag flies near the university east campus in York.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianWhy is it going on? “It’s a protest,” said Joseph Moulton, 22, who, independently of the initiative in Birmingham, came up with the campaign for York with a group of friends. “It’s a protest against Westminster. It’s a protest against the government who haven’t acted in the interests of the British people and that’s the last 20-plus years of my entire lifetime.”He and his friends had spent time abroad and they concluded in a York pub that “we just don’t really see our national flag outside sporting events or coronations, when actually it should be used in a civic way”.They started putting flags on a local estate. It was well received on social media. More people asked them to visit or provide them with flags.They combined their flagging with picking up litter. “And as we were doing that, we had loads of people beeping, people shouting out of windows and they liked it,” Moulton said.They helped out others around the UK who wanted to follow their lead and set up a website with a live map showing where flags had been put up around the country. It has long since become outdated. They can’t cope with the number of notifications.Moulton said that people were sick of being called racist for being concerned about the pace of change brought about by net immigration figures that peaked at 906,000 in the year ending June 2023, but have since declined.“Look at the last 10 years,” he said. “Real wages have gone [down] dramatically. The quality of life is decreasing. The cost of living is increasing. The privatised national infrastructure services like the water and the electric and the trains don’t work. The prices go up. They’re poorly managed.“And then on top of that, you’ve got the migration debate. Brexit was a protest vote against immigration and people voted for Boris on the platform of reducing migration. After both of those votes, migration only increased. The democratic apparatus is not working for people”.David, drinking a pint after handing over the international flags, said he would not personally protest outside a hotel housing asylum seekers, but that such places were lightning rods for anger at the lack of a plan regarding migration into the UK or care about the impact of new people on the home culture.He quoted the philosopherSlavoj Žižek, who said that Yugoslavian people always made a joke of each other but then “the jokes stopped and eight years later war began”.“Identity is hardwired in people, especially when confronted,” David said. “Things are very tense. I think the riots of last summer were a precursor of something”.The south coast:‘It raises the heat’Just before Liphook services on the A3, about 30 miles north of Portsmouth, a truck with a crane has been parked on the motorway bridge. A grubby union jack hangs lifelessly from the metal arm that hoists it. It has an unfortunate unintentional ugliness.View image in fullscreenFlags in front of the Royal Beach hotel in Southsea, Portsmouth.Photograph: Andy Hall/The GuardianThe Royal Beach hotel, a Victorian whitewashed hotel in Southsea, Portsmouth, was once the pride of the area.

A perimeter of St George’s cross flags directly surround the hotel.“It’s like they are saying: ‘Don’t come out,’” said Theresa, 52, who used to work in social housing, as she looked out from a cafe on the south parade pier opposite the scene.Wendy Regan, 59, a cleaner for the Co-op, said she despaired about the failure to stop the boats in the Channel, as she stopped for a cigarette. “But, no, that’s rude,” she added as she looked up at the flags standing sentinel.Mosen Kahali, 35, who came to the UK three months ago from Iran, is living in the Royal Beach. He knew the St George’s cross only from the protests. “Not good,” he said in broken English. “There are a lot of protests in Iran.”All across the south coast ofEngland, there have been flags and controversy. Nick Ireland, the leader of Dorset council, faced a torrent of abuse when he called out those daubing the cross on mini-roundabouts.“All I said is that you shouldn’t be defacing public property and that for some people, they find it intimidating,” he said. “It’s true, because I’ve had people contacting me saying: ‘You’re spot on.’ One of my councillors finds the flying of the flag intimidating because their parents found that intimidating from the time of the BNP. Amusingly, I have been told to go back to my own country, and I’m a scouser.”In Exeter, Dr Faith Stafford, a counsellor and psychotherapist, said it was the context that concerned her.View image in fullscreenFaith Stafford.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The Guardian“It is combined with the protests outside the hotels, that’s where the problem is,” she said. “Waving St George’s flag when England is playing football doesn’t threaten anybody.”Her own therapists at her clinic had told her that they were “keeping out of the public eye” at the moment. “It raises the heat,” she said.Leigh Frost, the leader of Cornwall council, had just returned from the Great North Run in the north-east of England. He was “shocked” by the number of flags that had been put up in the rest of the country.“We had someone defile a war memorial, and I think pretty much that just stopped it dead here,” he said. “But people are fed up and I think they’ve got every right to be fed up, if I’m honest. They’re showing their frustrations, I think – from my point of view as a Liberal Democrat, I think they’re probably targeting their frustration at the wrong people. Unfortunately, we’ve had a lot of stoking up of that, of that hatred.”Explore more on these topicsProtestMigrationEnglandImmigration and asylumRacenewsShareReuse this content"

Its workers are bright, industrious and completely anonymous. Their job is writing essays to order for students – in the UK and elsewhere – to help them get good degrees.These are “shadow scholars”, highly educated Kenyans who earn a living by working for essay mills. They are contracted to ghostwrite essays, PhD dissertations and other academic papers for students across the world, who pay a fee then pass off the work as their own.The role is not unique to Kenya. There are similar writers in India, Pakistan and any other number of countries, including the UK, but Kenya has been identified as a hotspot, with an estimated 40,000 ghostwriters working in Nairobi alone.They are the subject of a new film that talks for the first time to the young Kenyans who may be writing an essay or dissertation on any topic from mechanical engineering, nursing or quantum physics to Jane Austen, linguistics or Ho Chi Minh.Smart, ambitious, well-educated and tech-savvy, they worked hard to get to university, graduated with good degrees, but there are no jobs. Instead they spend their days – and nights – logging on to essay-writing platforms, scrolling down the list of assignments and making their bids to win the work.The cameras follow the sociologist and Oxford professor Patricia Kingori as she travels to Nairobi to interview the writers and explore the power dynamics that enable students in countries such as the UK to secure degrees and begin lucrative careers without doing their own work.View image in fullscreenPatricia Kingori said it was important to overturn the idea that ‘Africa isn’t the place that is propping up educational institutions.’Photograph: Channel 4She is bowled over by the young people she meets. “They’re incredible,” she told the Guardian. “I felt like I was entering a kind of elite athletes’ camp. It’s like being a recreational jogger and then suddenly entering an Olympic village.“You’re able to write an essay, on a subject you’ve learned nothing about, in six hours? How are you able to do this? They have to meet these deadlines, otherwise they get badly reviewed and they get kicked off the platform. They don’t get extensions. They don’t get sicknotes. They just have to do it.”Kingori, who is Kenyan-born, meets Mercy, a graduate and mother of Angel, who works through the night, sometimes having to master two different subjects for two different assignments in the space of 12 hours. She has had only three hours’ sleep, but she needs the money.With the money he has made, Chege, who describes himself as one of Kenya’s academic writing pioneers, paid for his own education, supported his sister through her degree, built his parents a house and bought himself a car.The writers create fake IDs, using white profiles and names, because they say it helps convince clients they are up to the task. “If you go online now and try to find help with an essay, invariably they sell you the service as if it’s coming from somebody that’s in the UK or the US,” said Kingori.“Nothing that I’ve seen will tell you that this is somebody in Nairobi. There’s this idea that this could not be coming from an African country. This level of intellect and skills could not be coming from people in Kenya.View image in fullscreenThe best-paid shadow scholars can earn as much as a doctor in Nairobi. Pricing ranges from less than £1 a page to thousands of pounds for a whole dissertation.Photograph: Channel 4“Africa isn’t the place that educates us, right? This is the place where we do all the cake sales for, it’s not the place that is actually propping up all of our educational institutions. So I think turning that on its head is really important.”One of the writers in the film says: “They want our ideas.

Asked about the ethics of what he does, he said: “For me, I’m gaining knowledge. I would pass that question to the client.”On the other side of the world is Kate, a US student who was falling behind with her studies and sold nudes so she could pay $300 for someone else to write her essays. Her parents invested their life savings in her education, which is costing tens of thousands of dollars a year, and she cannot bear to let them down.View image in fullscreenEssay mills were banned in England in 2022, but one expert said students were still using them, though generative AI is changing the landscape.Photograph: Channel 4Essay mills were banned in England in 2022, but according to Thomas Lancaster, a computer scientist and expert on contract cheating at Imperial College London, students are still using them, though the advent of generative AI is changing the landscape.“Contract cheating and the use of essay mills remains a major problem in UK higher education, as students are getting awards that they do not deserve. This is unfair to the vast majority of students, who are working and studying hard,” he said.“Some students have moved tousing genAI systems like ChatGPTin place of contracting to an essay mill. I’ve also heard that there is a market now for students who use genAI to create a first draft, but then hire a writer to check the content and to rewrite it so that it is not detected as AI-generated.”Kingori is angry at what the film uncovers. “Power makes itself invisible so we don’t question whether things should be the way they are. It enrages me. This should not be why Kenya is on the map, and if the world was fair, these scholars would be able to operate on the world stage as themselves.”All names have been changed.

No problem: how to make friends at university without boozeStudents may have had a reputation for boozy behaviour, but there are ways to make friends for those who prefer to keep things straight edgeRaphael BoydSun 14 Sep 2025 08.00 EDTShareFor as long as anyone can remember, drinking has been a key part of the student experience – but this is changing. An increasing number of young people are turning away from drinking, with a2024 pollby Student Beans finding that half of first-year students did not plan to drink during their freshers’ week.If you’re considering a teetotal uni experience, or want to limit your drinking, here are four places to look for sober fun.SocietiesOne of the easiest ways to find like-minded people and make friends without alcohol is to join any society that you’re interested in. There are more than 10,000 societies across all universities in the UK, with at least 50 to choose from at most universities, many of which do not involve alcohol.Georgia Burdis, a vice-president of activities at Northumbria University, says that for “students who don’t drink, university can still be a very rewarding social experience when you find the right spaces” and advises teetotal students to “seek out communities that align with your intentions rather than the social norms of alcohol consumption. This way you will naturally build meaningful friendships”.PartiesIt is absolutely possible to go to parties where people are drinking and still have fun while sober. Although it might be outside your comfort zone, try at least one to find out if you enjoy it.If you want to go to a party with other people like yourself, there is a surprising amount of choice. Sober parties have fast become normalised, with events spreading across the country. In Glasgow, for example,Good Clean Funputs on monthly ticketed events that combine a variety of musical genres with activities such as meditation.Enjoy the outdoorsAstudyby the Mental Health Foundation found that 39% of students did not do regular exercise, often citing tiredness and a preference for socialising. So how about combining looking after your health with making friends in the process?Most universities will have great sportsfacilities and a plethora of teams you can join, with something to suit all ability levels. Ask at your fresher’s fair to find the perfect fit.For something more intrepid, outdoor societies such as Dundee University’s Rucksack club, the University of Plymouth’s Adventure & expo group and the University of London Mountaineering club take advantage of the local countryside and are open to people of all backgrounds and experience levels.GamesYou might think only mature students would enjoy playing board games – but you’d be wrong. Onestudy by Edge Hill University(pdf) found that 26.9% of board game players are between the ages of 18 and 25.There are a surprising number of games clubs and campus societies dedicated to them. Edge Hill has several, including the Poker and card games society, which says new members should “feel free to bring along any card game you wanna play and I’m sure we’ll enjoy playing too!”.Explore more on these topicsUniversitiesUniversity Guide 2026Student experienceStudent healthHigher educationStudentsFreshersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But it can be difficult to know where to look, especially if you’re moving to an unfamiliar city.The most important thing is to find a job that’s flexible enough to fit alongside your studies. With the third term increasingly quiet or even empty you might consider filling it with temporary work – but remember your main goal is to get a degree that opens the door to the career you want. Many universities, includingEdinburgh,BirminghamandBrunel, recommend working no more than an average of 15 hours a week during term time so that your studies aren’t compromised.Aside from the usual job search platforms such as LinkedIn, Indeed and Reed, there are other sites worth a look if you want flexible work either during term time or the holidays.Jobtoday,Caterer,E4s,StudentJobandJobsBearall list jobs around the UK, including casual work.As well as searching on job sites, you could contact local catering companies – they often let you pick up waitering shifts as and when they suit you. From October, Christmas temp roles are worth looking out for as many retail and hospitality companies will be offering flexible working contracts during this time.Working for a chain that has branches around the country is great because it can give you the flexibility of transferring to another outlet when moving between home and university and vice-versa.When you get to university, your campus will have an employability or careers team. They should be able to give you guidance on finding jobs in the area, as well as helping you with your CV and cover letter.Even if the role does not match what you hope to do for a living post-university, having a job while studying will equip you with essential life skills. All jobs involve being organised and punctual, many will help you build resilience and your communication skills as you deal with different people and situations.Roles such as restaurant work can have great transferable skills such as conflict resolution (dealing with awkward customers), building rapport (with colleagues and not-awkward customers) and being able to work well under pressure. These will all serve you well on your CV.“Increasingly, major graduate employers are prioritising skills over academic qualifications when selecting candidates,” says Claire Tyler, head of insights at theInstitute of Student Employers, the biggest UK student recruitment community.“We recommend students research the skill requirements of the graduate employers they may wish to apply to after university and then seek part-time work which will help demonstrate these skills.“Developing skills during part-time employment work is an accessible way students can ensure they stand out in a competitive graduate job market.”Explore more on these topicsUniversity guideUniversity Guide 2026Student workStudent financeStudentsStudent experienceHigher educationUniversitiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If you’re choosing a university place, don’t forget to check how you will be testedAI is making universities rethink how they assess students, with some turning to presentations, vivas and quizzesTess ReidySun 14 Sep 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 14 Sep 2025 03.01 EDTShareFor 18-year-old Rose Kade from London, deciding between studying geography or maths at university is not just about the subject, it’s about how she will be assessed.“I don’t like exams,” she says. “I feel like anything can happen on the day, and I find it hard being judged entirely on that one performance.” She prefers coursework: “I like building things up over time. It’s less stressful and if I have a bad day it doesn’t affect my grade.”Kade is not alone. For some time now, universities have been trying to ensure that students are exposed to a variety of assessment styles, with many moving away from traditional written exams towards longer-term projects, presentations and online assignments. There is particular emphasis on dissertations because of the useful research and data analysis skills that they help develop, as well as a move towards integrating assessments into the learning experience.Universities UK’s director of policy, Steph Harris, says students can expect a range of assessment types depending on the course. “Some qualifications rely more on coursework or observation-based assessment, while others may require more traditional exams. Many will include types of assessment needed to meet professional standards, including medical courses,” she adds.One factor accelerating this shift is AI. According to Sue Attewell from Jisc, an organisation that provides digital resources in the higher education sector, institutions are trying to AI-proof assessments by trying out a variety of styles. The emphasis, she says, is on verbal discussions where students have no time to prepare and can’t easily predict the questions that will come up.“The historic methods [of assessment] are not really fit for purpose in the modern world and we have seen a lot of promotion of authentic assessments. We’re seeing a wider mix of methods now. That might include presentations, vivas, verbal quizzes, and question-led discussions after presentations, not just written exams,” she says.Manuel Souto Otero from the school of education at the University of Bristol thinks students mulling their course options should look at the content as well as how it is going to be examined. “Think about the variety of assessment types, but also the frequency and whether you prefer working alone or in a group. In some cases students can have a range of assignments they can choose from.”Of course, not every assessment will be in your comfort zone and that is not necessarily a bad thing. “There’s value in being exposed to different styles,” he adds. “But if you know that you are going to clearly struggle with certain types of assessment, you may want to know what you are likely to face.”Rachel Gillam, deputy director of student recruitment at the University of Nottingham, says it can be a personal thing. “If this is something that is significant to you, we’d recommend that you review the more detailed course information on the prospectuses of the courses that you are considering. All universities should provide this information in more detail, once you secure an offer.”Still, assessment is not everything, and it should not be the be-all and end-all. It is important, especially for students with additional needs, but so is the course content, the learning environment, and what comes after. In the end, how you are assessed may not define your degree, but it could shape how you experience it.One thing to consider is that the third term might be a little quieter than expected. With many assessments taking place early in summer term, students are increasingly finding themselves with time on their hands. That is not necessarily wasted, especially if you plan it well.Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, says the third term is “increasingly empty” and there is frustration, particularly among parents, that the academic year is ending early.The change, he says, is partly because many universities are shifting from a three-term academic year to a two-semester system. “You can have your exams quite early in the summer term and you’re paying £9,250 and not going back until late September or early October. I’m surprised it is not a mini-scandal,” he says.However, this is not necessarily wasted, especially if you plan it well. “If they are doing a final-year dissertation, this can be highly consuming, but if they have free time there’s an opportunity to gain additional skills through non-formal learning, volunteering, sports, networking, work experience, or something creative,” says Souto Otero. “All of that can be highly valuable.”Explore more on these topicsUniversity guideUniversity Guide 2026Higher educationStudentsUniversitiesShareReuse this content"

The discomfort felt by others may have been sharper this year as Promenaders heading to South Kensington shared the streets with the flag-draped hordes who had come to town in support of far-right activist Tommy Robinson.Inside the Royal Albert Hall, however, all was good-natured inclusivity, with pennants from around the globe dotting a sea of bunting from the UK and EU. Perhaps that was the diversity organisers were hoping to capture in a hodgepodge programme where 20-or-so disparate composers battled for attention.Inevitably there was good and bad. A definite plus was Hong Kong-born conductor Elim Chan making an auspicious Last Night debut. A firecracker on the podium, she piloted her forces through a series of orchestral and choral showcases. There was Mussorgsky’s first attempt at A Night on the Bare Mountain, a riot of imaginative ticks and quirks for those familiar with Rimsky-Korsakov’s interventionist rearrangement. Dukas’ Sorcerer’s Apprentice worked his magic, and there was a rip-roaring account of Shostakovich’s Festive Overture whose Soviet Technicolor brilliance felt like John Williams on steroids.View image in fullscreen‘This is in A, right?’ … Bill Bailey plays the typewriter.Photograph: Chris Christodoulou/BBCAnother asset was British soprano Louise Alder who, with limber tone, exquisite top notes and a relaxed, communicative manner, delivered a sparkling Jewel Aria from Faust and a deeply felt Vilja from The Merry Widow. In Rule, Britannia!, the vocal line was more richly decorated than her stylishly restrained Union Jack dress. She even turned in a creditable Eliza Doolittle in a medley from My Fair Lady.‘The cultural landscape is decimated’: Louise Alder on stage fright, arts funding and the Last Night of the PromsRead moreThere was a poignant farewell from trumpeter Alison Balsom who, at just 46, has put her retirement down in part to lack of repertoire. Hummel’s amiable concerto showed her at her best in the galloping finale. There were finds too, including Arthur Benjamin’s Elgarian Storm Clouds’ Cantata, composed for Hitchcock’s The Man Who Knew Too Much with a climactic cymbal crash designed to mask the sound of an assassin’s bullet.On the minus side, new music felt somewhat marginalised. At six minutes, Camille Pépin’s Fireworks did what it said on the tin, but while Rachel Portman’s The Gathering Tree boasted a catchy faux folk tune, it was dogged by some clumsy word setting. A souped-up classical arrangement of Queen’s 50-year-old Bohemian Rhapsody raised more laughs than goosebumps despite featuringBrian Mayon guitar and Roger Taylor banging Britain’s largest gong.For celebrity turns, it was left to comedian and Strictly winnerBill Baileyto save the day, playing a mean typewriter in Leroy Anderson’s eponymous bonbon. “This is in A, right?” he joked, before popping up later for Auld Lang Syne on the Albert Hall organ.

Gough Whitlam had abolished university fees, which meant a lot of older women who previously wouldn’t have been able to afford to study were arriving at uni for the first time.I was 17 and nursing an otherness of my own. One day in class, our lecturer asked everyone who had attended a private high school to raise their hand. The sea of arms that shot up revealed that, in a class of 30 people, I was the only one who’d come from a state school. The lecturer didn’t do this cruelly – he was making a point about lawyers being privileged people, and how that affects the legal system. But I nonetheless felt very confronted by the different world my peers came from.At one point in that class we had to do a moot court and were instructed to wear a suit. My family wasn’t poor but we certainly didn’t have the money lying around to head to the shops and buy me one for the occasion. My mother had the idea that we could look for a suit in an op shop, where we successfully picked one up.It was a nice suit but I knew where it had come from, and that it hadn’t exactly been tailored to fit me properly. I was feeling self-conscious and shy when I arrived wearing it that day at university.The kindness of strangers: a nurse saw me crying and asked if I wanted a hugRead moreThere was a woman in my class who must have only been in her mid-20s but to me was incredibly cool and mature. We walked past each other on the way in and she said: “Oh Brian, you look really smart.” It meant so much to me coming from her, because I saw her as this worldly, wise woman. Those few words from her flipped the way I was feeling about myself. Thanks to her, I walked into class with confidence and did well in the moot court.I went on to have a successful career in law but I never forgot that woman – her words became part of me. I have tried through my career and life to honour her gesture in my dealings with others. She showed me the power our words have.I don’t remember ever seeing her after that first year, so I’m not sure if she continued on with her degree. I wish I’d got to thank her and tell her how much that kindness stuck with me. I hope she had the best possible life.What is the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?Share your experienceFrom making your day to changing your life, we want to hear about  chance encounters that have stuck with you.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

But Saturday’s rally, facing up to Tommy Robinson’s 110,000-strong“unite the kingdom” marchin London, was the only one where I actually felt threatened.I was on the anti-racist counter march and we were outnumbered 20 to one. This was startling: on anti-racist marches, we usually easily outnumber the racists. The march organised by Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, was billed as “a free speech rally”, but free speech in this caseseemed to mean people saying anything they wanted about only one subject: immigration.Some commentators like to say that mobilisations such as this are only expressions of discontent bypeople who feel a little ignored. If they had been in central London on Saturday and seen the sea of men (and they were nearly all men) defiantly waving their St George’s flags, some of themattacking the policeand spitting at people like me, they might want to reconsider that view. The kind of people who were marching usually take exception to being called racists. But it is hard to know what else to call those of them who gathered in the capital to demand mass deportation and insist that black and brown men are a unique threat to white women.Apart from its size, the other thing that was remarkable about Robinson’s march was that it was addressed, via video link,by a billionaire, Elon Musk. He may be a hugely successful businessman, but his grasp of the British political system seemed less than sure. He said, “violence is coming to you, you either fight back or you die” and “I really think that there has to be a change of government in Britain … Something’s got to be done. There’s got to be a dissolution of parliament and a new vote held.” That’s not how we do democracy in the UK.Robinson and Farage’s ‘civil war’ narrative is warping voters’ minds. How is any government supposed to counter it? | John HarrisRead moreThe huge turnout for Robinson’s march was partly a consequence of theonline world we now live in. Social media have made this scale of mobilisation so much easier. But discussing the march afterwards with others from the anti-racist rally, we had the sense that there is something dark bubbling up in British society. Organisations that support the victims of race hate crime say that the number of cases is shooting up. Ugly incidents are increasing – only this weekend, in the West Midlands, a Sikh woman wasreportedly raped in broad daylightby white men shouting racist abuse including “you don’t belong in this country, get out”.One of the problems with our response to race hate incidents, in my experience, is that the parts of society who would normally be expected to take up a progressive cause are reluctant to call them out for what they are. Trade unions are content to let their branches carry their banners on anti-racist marches but are too oftensilent on anti-racism itself. Is it because they suspect that many of their members might be racists and do not want to antagonise them?The Labour party seems to be tying itself in knots to avoid talking about racism at all. It took Keir Starmer until Sunday afternoon to address what happened on Saturday,telling the Guardianthat “we will not stand for … people feeling intimidated on our streets because of their background or the colour of their skin”. But first, the business and trade secretary, Peter Kyle, was sent out to tellthe press that the rally“doesn’t disturb me, because it’s actually proof that we live in a country where free speech, free association, is alive and well”.Perhaps this is Labour’sstrategy for out-Reforming Reform. But in reality,this anti-immigrant politics is not helping the party. Using survey data from more than 30,000 respondents from the British Election Study, which happened to take place in the same month as Starmer’s “island of strangers” speech, political scientists found two things. First, that the public registered the speech and assumed that Labour had moved to the right on immigration; and second, that this did not have a favourable impact.One of the political scientists involved said: “The real story is the negative effect [of the speech] on Labour. They lost votes without gaining any from the people they are aiming to attract or nullifying their perceived threat from Reform.”Britain has seen anti-immigrant politics for generations. Post-war migrants from the Caribbean were harassed and beaten up by the equivalent of Robinson’s followers today. The only differences now are a toxic social media ecosystem and US billionaires prepared to publicly support the successors of the teddy boys.But if the violence and hatred are to be stopped, politicians first need to be prepared to call racism out for what it is. Silence about the racism inherent in events such as Robinson’s march can be seen as tacit approval of its message. It further emboldens the men wrapped in St George’s flags attacking thepolice. Refusing to acknowledge racist attacks for what they are can leave victims feeling alone and unprotected, and tiptoeing around the racist nature of this violence does not seem to alleviate it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But we must not rewrite his lifeMoira DoneganIn the wake of horror, honest accountings of his life have not only become rare – they have also become dangerousSun 14 Sep 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 14 Sep 2025 09.02 EDTShareMaybe it is the gruesome suddenness of his death that has made so many people forget the realities of Charlie Kirk’s life. After the 31-year-old rightwing influencer was shot dead at a college campus appearance in Utah on Wednesday, many commentators rushed to condemn political violence, on the one hand, and to issue warm tributes to Kirk’s life, on the other. The former of these is legitimate: that political policy should not be determined by force, or political disagreements settled through homicidal violence, is a baseline precondition of not just a democratic form of government, but of any functional society. The latter, perhaps, can be explained by the admirable human impulse towards gentleness and reconciliation. The horror and shock of Kirk’s assassination prompted some to offer their generosity, and their sympathy, to the dead man.Perhaps it was these noble gestures toward generosity and sympathy that led some commentators to be more laudatory to Kirk’s memory than an honest recounting of his life would allow. In the days following Kirk’s death, several bewilderingly inaccurate postmortem hagiographies have appeared, including from prominent voices on the left and center, that seem to wish that the tragedy of Kirk’s death could retroactively have given him a more honorable life.The most egregious of these came fromEzra Klein, a center-left columnist at the New York Times known for his ability to channel and influence elite opinion. In a piece published the morning after Kirk’s death, titled Charlie Kirk Was Practicing Politics the Right Way, Klein made a series of strained, bizarre and outright untrue assertions about Kirk’s career and character. Kirk, Klein argued, was, if anything, an example of civic virtue. “Kirk was practicing politics in exactly the right way,” Klein said. “He was showing up to campuses and talking with anyone who would talk to him. He was one of the era’s most effective practitioners of persuasion.” Klein’s point was that political persuasion – the rational debate of ideas between equals in which violence is unthinkable and good faith is presumed – is a cornerstone of liberal democracy, the kind of thing we should all be striving for, the kind of thing we need more of. “American politics has sides,” Klein continued. “There is no use pretending it doesn’t. But both sides are meant to be on the same side of a larger project – we are all, or most of us, anyway, trying to maintain the viability of the American experiment.”Fair enough, I suppose, on its merits, but such a description of reasoned, honest, good-faith debate is so inaccurate a description of what Charlie Kirk engaged in on college campuses – in his series of large, staged events where he “debated” untrained liberal undergraduates with cameras rolling – that it reads as willfully naive, if not outright dishonest. Charlie Kirk’s “debates” were aggressive, unequal, trolling affairs, in which he sought to provoke his interlocutors to distress, shouted them down and belittled them, spewed hateful rhetoric about queer and trans people, women, Black people, immigrants and Muslims, and selectively edited the ensuing footage to create maximally viral content in which his fans could witness him humiliating the liberals and leftists they perceived to be their enemies. This was not “debate”; it was not reasoned, good-faith discourse; it was not the kind of fair deliberation that democracy relies on. It was a mockery of those things.If reasoned debate is a precondition of a liberal democracy, there are other preconditions as well. A state cannot be called democratic if it does not offer equal protection of the law – if not all of its citizens are awarded the same dignity by their government and the same vote, same rights of expression and same prerogatives before courts and elected officials in their attempts to influence its policies and navigate its laws. Civic equality – not just civil engagement – is central to the American experiment, too. It is not to excuse his murder to be honest that Kirk opposed that equality. Some historians and political scientists have argued that the United States did not become a democracy until the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act, the laws that intended to end de jure segregation and racist voter suppression. But Kirkopposedthe Civil Rights Act, calling it a “huge mistake”. Heendorsedthe racist so-called “great replacement theory”, in which nefarious actors (usually cast as Jewish people) are seeking to “replace” America’s white population with immigrants, saying it was “well under way every day at our southern border”. On his podcast, he hosted a “slavery apologist” and a man whosaid that after women“got, you know, the right to vote – after that, it all went downhill”. Kirk himself once said that Black women – he named Joy Reid, Michelle Obama, Sheila Jackson Lee and Ketanji Brown Jackson – “do not have thebrain powerto be taken seriously”. He condemned Democrats for supposedly wanting tomake the US “less white”, and claimed: “There is no separation of church and state. It’s a fabrication, it’s a fiction, it’s not in the constitution.” (It is.) And yet Ezra Klein praised Kirk’s “moxie”. One wonders what such a euphemism is meant to obscure.In the rush to canonize Kirk and revise his history, honest accountings of his life have not only become rare – they have also become dangerous. In the days since his death, journalists, media personalities and others who have not been sufficiently laudatory to Kirk in public have lost their jobs for telling the truth about his life. Matthew Dowd, a Republican political consultant, was fired from MSNBC after saying that Kirk had spoken “hateful words”. In Phoenix, asports writerwas fired for criticizing euphemistic accounts of Kirk’s beliefs. “‘Political differences’ are not the same thing as spewing hateful rhetoric on a daily basis,” he wrote in a social media post. Many of those eulogizing Kirk want to paint him as a champion of free speech, as a man who peddled in honest inquiry, uninhibited expression and the open exchange of ideas. This is a laughably inaccurate picture of the man’s work; it is in these punishments of those who oppose him that we can see a truer reflection of Kirk’s values.I do not find it hard to condemn political violence. To me, to say that Kirk should not have been murdered is the easiest thing in the world. No one should be shot, be they rightwing influencers, or schoolchildren, or grocery shoppers, or churchgoers. It is easy for me, even, to show sympathy for the humanity of Charlie Kirk, who, for everything else he was, was a human being who has now been robbed of the opportunity to learn, grow, and repent. But such commitments – to human life, to nonviolence, to a faith in the possibility of redemption and reconciliation – need not lead us to lie to ourselves about Charlie Kirk. The same values that make us horrified at his violent death are the ones that should embolden our commitment to defeating the politics he worked for in life.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsCharlie Kirk shootingOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

Can the latest tweaks work?Sun 14 Sep 2025 06.31 EDTLast modified on Sun 14 Sep 2025 14.03 EDTShareEnsuring England’s workforce has the right skills for a rapidly changing economy is key to Labour’s hopes of boosting social mobility and kickstarting economic growth.So it seems unfortunate that more than a week afterKeir Starmer’s drastic reshuffle, ministers are still wrangling over exactly which bits of the skills agenda will now move to Pat McFadden’s beefed-up Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).Broadly speaking, the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, is expecting to hang on to responsibility for further education, while McFadden will probably take on apprenticeships and adult skills. Jacqui Smith, the skills minister, will work across both departments.Labour market experts say there is some logic to the shift: ensuring the right training is available in the right places is one crucial part of tackling the issue of economic inactivity in a rapidly changing employment market, which falls within the DWP’s bailiwick.But “machinery of government” changes, as official parlance has it, can often bring more disruption than clarity.Over the past two decades alone, responsibility for skills has bounced around Whitehall, from education into the short-lived Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (2007-09) then on to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (2009-16), back into education again, and now across to the DWP.Perhaps this nomadic status helps account for successive administrations’ chronic neglect. Government spending on adult education halved between 2011-12 and 2019-20. It then recovered somewhat as the worst years of austerity came to an end, but by last year it was still £1bn down in real terms.The Guardian view on construction workers: the country needs more of them, fast | EditorialRead moreMeanwhile, despite endless speeches by politicians of all stripes about how vocational skills should have the same status as university (I have sat through quite a few: it is compulsory to mention Germany), the numbers of people completing apprenticeships have collapsed.Official figures show 178,220 people earned an apprenticeship in England in 2023-24, down by more than a third on 2017-18, when the apprenticeship levy was introduced.Recently rebranded as the skills and growth levy, this is charged at 0.5% of the payroll of larger firms. It was meant to encourage a flowering of workplace training, although employers have long complained that it is too rigid.Since Labour came to power, Phillipson hasmade some changes, cutting the minimum duration of an apprenticeship to eight months.Enrolment in apprenticeships has risen this year, by just over 2%, but business groups are still hoping for a more substantial shake-up.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It must surely be a piece of the UK’s productivity puzzle that,according to the Learning and Work Institute, employers’ annual spending on training for each member of staff has fallen by 28% in real terms since 2005, to £1,530, a level less than half the EU average.The longtime education expert Sir Philip Augur put it well in a recentInstitute for Fiscal Studies podcastabout post-16 education. Welcoming the changes to the apprenticeship levy, Augur said: “Employers have to step up to the plate here. For employers, ‘I can’t get the staff’ is quite often an excuse for bad management. Now, on this occasion, they can’t get the staff because the skills aren’t there. But there needs to be honesty and self-appraisal on the part of employers.”Augur called for the levy to rise “very slightly” to free up more resources for expanding apprenticeships.McFadden’s team say he is keen to ensure young people get the skills they need to benefit from the jobs scheduled to be created by new government investment in defence and green energy. That will mean working with firms and unions to get the training landscape right.There is plenty of innovative thinking going on at local level. The West Yorkshire mayor, Tracy Brabin, announced plans last week for what she called “skills-led growth” in Wakefield, the UK’s largest city without a university.She hopes toestablish a new Wakefield Futures Centre, led by employers, where local people can do courses directly linked to finding work in the fastest-growing sectors in the surrounding economy. The idea is to make the courses flexible so that adults with caring responsibilities, for example, can take up the offer.This kind of relatively fluid, employer-connected approach could allow mums to pick up new skills, or older workers to switch sector or dip their toe in the market after a period off sick, for example.It could also be used to tempt young people to think about a wider set of options: in Manchester, Andy Burnham is pushing to set up an Mbacc – an Ebacc equivalent, intended to be an alternative to GCSEs, which is tailored to local jobs.Jobcentres, which are getting a rejig under Labour to present a more encouraging face, can then signpost to local opportunities such as these.Getting the skills offer right will have to form one crucial part of any genuine effort to bring down the UK’s unusually high economic inactivity rates, and therefore, ultimately, the welfare bill.Last year’s crass attempt at cuts failed because Labour could not justify to its own MPs the crude way in which it planned to cut eligibility for the personal independence payment (Pip).If the government wants to have another go – as McFadden certainly does – then a fresh skills and training offer could be part of the package for the hard-to-reach claimants Labour said it had a “moral case” to help last time – but for whom across-the-board Pip cuts would have done nothing.It’s not a quick fiscal fix by any means, but get it right and the upside, for individuals, employers and the economy, would be significant and long-lasting. The sooner ministers can clear up who takes on which bits of the task, and crack on with it, the better.Explore more on these topicsApprenticeshipsEconomics viewpointVocational educationWork & careersUnemploymentEconomic policyProductivityEnglandcommentShareReuse this content"

Do they know something we don’t?Emma BeddingtonThese plutocrats spending months in the equivalent of Center Parcs when they could be jetting off to a White Lotus-style resort just proves my view that wealth is wasted on the wealthySun 14 Sep 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 14 Sep 2025 13.31 EDTShareIdon’t particularly enjoy analysing the habits of the ultra-rich. I would be happier if I didn’t have to think about them at all – and I apologise for making you do so – but in my defence, this is fascinating: a feature in theFinancial Timesreveals some have started selling up and living in motorhomes.Obviously, they’re ultra-luxurious motorhomes. The owner of a private equity firm interviewed has a 30-tonne behemoth with air conditioning and high-speed internet, a kitchen, dining room, two bathrooms, a “spacious master bedroom” and “a range of modern hi-tech appliances”. Which, yes, sounds plusher than my in-laws’ caravan, but it’s still a massive shed on wheels. And you’ll never guess how much they cost: “around $2.7m” (£2m), apparently. Imagine the bricks-and-mortar house you could get for that – that private equity chap sold both of his – and you wouldn’t have to empty a toilet tank. (Maybe they outsource that somehow, but still.)Weirder still, for long periods these wheeled vehicles and their occupants don’t move, despite that being, you’d think, the whole point. Instead, they park up – and imagine parking something 13 metres long, the horror – in places called things like Motorcoach Country Club but which sound like gussied-up trailer parks. Owners buy permanent plots with, the FT explains, “pools, covered patios, barbecue areas, fire pits, and small homes with living rooms and bedrooms”. So, hang on – you buy a giant, more-than-million-pound motorhome, then you don’t live in it, instead hanging out in a sort of small chalet structure with a view of your massive truck? I nearly lost my mind after I spent three days in Center Parcs; these plutocrats are spending months in the equivalent voluntarily, when they could be jetting off to some White Lotus-style resort to have their every whim indulged, or being heli-dropped at the top of a mountain to protect their peace.It’s like a perverse reversal of Nomadland, the book and subsequentfilmthat explored the lives of struggling Americans living peripatetically in vans from necessity after the 2008 recession. Are rich people so tired of luxury they’re doing this just to feel something? Is it a Common People socioeconomic tourism thing: if you called your real-estate broker, he could stop it all?Initially I was, at most, mildly entertained by this – it’s just a microtrend, albeit a baffling one that seems to confirm my conviction that wealth is wasted on the wealthy. But then I read something else about ultra-high-net-worthers: they’ve started renting rather than buying property, with the number doing so tripling between 2019 and 2023 in the US, according to theNew York Times. Something similar is happening in the UK, with high-end properties being rented and tenants potentially buying later once they’ve tested the water. The founder of the private car hire company Addison Lee, Sir John Griffin, has apparentlyput his place on the rental market for £75,000 a month.At those kinds of prices, I’m sure none of them are dealing with black mould or unfairly retained deposits, but it’s still unexpected. I can’t imagine preferring transience and uncertainty over permanence. So why? As a real-estate broker told the New York Times, they’re “choosing flexibility and liquidity over ownership. They don’t want to be bothered with the inconveniences of home ownership, which includes paying real-estate taxes and insurance, especially in markets like Florida and California, where we’re seeing a lot of natural catastrophes.” “Flexibility is the name of the game in today’s market,”the Times confirms.And, huh – perhaps that’s the explanation? In a world that feels dangerous and unpredictable, increasingly prey to “natural catastrophes” (and unnatural ones), the ultra-rich are learning from their hedge-funder friends and they’re hedging. They’re prepping for any eventuality, but with a luxe 30-tonne RV rather than a government-recommended grab bag. Maybe that’s the most important thing money can buy these days: the ability to get the hell out of Dodge at a moment’s notice.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsThe super-richOpinionHousing marketcommentShareReuse this content"

Perhaps a return to a childhood passion could helpSun 14 Sep 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 14 Sep 2025 05.40 EDTShare‘Please sit down,” I begged my neighbour, who was leaning across the car gearstick, arm stretched around my headrest. My pleas for him to fasten his seatbelt were futile. Now he was jigging about, gesticulating wildly as he revealed his latest plans.He had told me before about the script he was writing for Gary Oldman. I hadn’t thought too much of it, then – all writers have to be a bit grandiose, I had reasoned, otherwise they wouldn’t achieve anything. But now he was telling me he was inventing a flying machine, from which he would fall – and I quote – “like a sycamore seed”. “You very much won’t,” my partner muttered. “What goes up, must come down.”That morning, he had arrived at our door with an extensive shopping list that he demanded we procure for him from Tesco, saying that only the very best red wine would do. Caught off-guard by this bristling confidence, we’d compromised and offered a taxi service instead. At the supermarket, it transpired he had no money – we didn’t have much either – so we got what we could afford and went home, trying to make our new friend promise he would not attempt the flying stunt anytime soon. I wish I could write that we did more to support him. We were young and barely supporting ourselves. The neighbour became very quiet after that, and eventually moved.Some years later, I thought of him. It was a fleeting recollection, like all my thinking at that point. I looked in the mirror, and instead of hating my reflection, as I had for the months previously, I was suddenly glowing with positivity. How lovely, I reasoned; after several years of severe depression, I must have turned a corner. Except it was more of a sharp bend. I hadn’t exercised for months, but that morning I practically sprang out of bed and announced that I was going for a run. When it ended, I set off again.It can take many years to understand that a high can be just as dangerous as a low. Self-care seldom says to watch out for impressive productivity and witty repartee. My neighbour had been experiencing an acute manic episode as part of bipolar disorder. Eventually, I would receive a similar diagnosis: hypomania. These highs are less intense, often associated with creativity and, in my case at least, are less frequent visitors than the lows.Unable to fully escape depression, I rolled out a red carpet for these rare experiences. Allow me to deep clean your house and rewrite your CV, for nothing will tire me! I saw this as a well-earned treat after months of listless sadness. I took risks; I flirted recklessly. I made choices I cannot yet write about. The depression, when it returned, was worse than ever. Back on the therapist’s couch, we unpicked my 20s. “What goes up, must come down,” she warned. And so now, when I start to feel my heart pounding in my head, I lie down. I do not look at my phone; I do not attend a work event. I wait, just like I do when depressed, and focus on getting better.In my quest for wellness, I reconnected with a childhood passion: butterflies. I spent my 30s trudging around woodlands and meadows in an effort to see every British species. I like collecting, and this hobby is all about collections; seeing males, females, mating pairs, aberrations. Some butterflies are easier to find than others – a peacock lives up to its name, rainbow wings with unblinking, heavily made-up eyes. Others live in the canopy, only venturing to terra firma in particular circumstances. It’s a wholesome hobby, or so you might think.InThe Butterfly Isles, the Guardian writer Patrick Barkham wrote about the curse of the purple emperor, a spectacular, elusive insect that – for two weeks of the year – will occasionally descend to the ground to take salts (often on dung) from woodland floors. Lepidopterists lose all sense of perspective in their company, setting up baits to lure the butterfly. (I encountered one man who actually defecated under an oak tree where the emperor had been spotted.)One summer, I spent every spare hour in the woods “emperoring”, as the pastime is dubbed. Then it was hours that weren’t so spare. I missed a deadline. And another. I couldn’t sleep for thinking about a “grounding”, the term for when a butterfly descends. My heart pounded; my dreams turned purple.I stopped going to the woods. It took every drop of willpower I possessed. I cooked; I took some moderate exercise. I tried to avoid the butterfly sightings posted online. The graph took a gentle decline, and stabilised. Previously, I might have rewarded myself with a splurge or a binge. Nature had something better in mind.Later that week, my best friend messaged to say a purple emperor had landed in her open-top car. The chances of this happening were extraordinarily remote, and that it would still be there by the time I arrived, even slimmer still. But I raced to find her anyway. A pristine male purple emperor, lethargic in the blistering heat, waited in the footwell. He sat on my hand, drinking my sweat. We paused together, quiet and content.Claire Jackson is a journalist who writes about classical music, art and animalsDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But there are still ways to foil themSun 14 Sep 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 14 Sep 2025 13.06 EDTShareIt is too easy to blame Donald Trump for everything that goes wrong in the world. The ability of any US president to fundamentally change or control the behaviour of other major powers is frequently overestimated. Yet by posing as a sort of uncrowned global monarch and grand arbiter of war and peace, Trump perpetuates fantasies of US hegemony, omnipotence and divine right. Intoxicated by such ego-inflating delusions, he pledged before taking office toswiftly end the Ukraine and Gaza conflicts. Perhaps, in his vanity and hubris, he truly believed he could.Eight months on, the exact opposite is happening. Both crises are expanding and escalating. The bubble has burst, his bluff has been called, the emperor has no clothes – and there is no denying that Trump, by alternately appeasing, excusing and encouraging the two foremost villains of these twin tragedies, is greatly to blame. Last week’s multiple Russiandrone incursionsinto Nato member Poland – which Polish officials are right to call deliberate –risk transforming the Ukraine war into a Europe-wide conflagration. Likewise, the reckless, illegalIsraeli airstrike in Qatar, which blew up the Gaza peace process, physically and metaphorically, has supercharged regional tensions.A common factor in both developments is US weakness, which is to say, Trump weakness. Has any other US president devoted so much effort to making himself look like a strong leader while failing miserably to act like one when it matters? Much of what he does, whether it’s promulgating illegal executive orders, firing senior officials, bullying neighbours and defenceless migrants,ordering troops on to the streetsof US cities, backing afellow coup leaderin Brazil, or picking fights with judges and independent media, is about bolstering the strongman Trump image.The reality is very different. When Trump is faced by tough, unyielding opponents, rather than soft targets, he folds. He chickens out. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, and Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, worked this out long ago.Both men play him for a sucker. They flatter him. They spin lies about wanting peace. They offer easy wins. Then they go home, as was the case with Putin after last month’sembarrassing Alaska summit, and carry on doing whatever they want, which usually involves even greater violence. When an angry Trump calls to complain, as after Netanyahu’s Qatar raid, and whinges, pathetically, that he’s “not happy”, he merely confirms his weakness – and is ignored.Far from facilitating an end to these wars, Trump has become a prime obstacle to peace. His ill-considered interventions, grandstanding and partiality make matters worse, prolonging both conflicts. His dearth of leadership skills, coupled with a lack of integrity and common sense, is shocking for Europeans, accustomed to dealing with mostly rational, relatively competent presidents. Trump’s hostility to the EU and Nato, his tariff wars and his anti-democratic machinations have further undermined western cohesion and confidence – andboosted authoritarian regimes.1:04Poland shoots down Russian drones over its airspace   – videoWatching from his Kremlin lair, Putin acts accordingly. Thedrone incursion into Poland– not the first, but by far the biggest – was a calculated test of Nato reactions and unity. He will have been gratified by the defensive vulnerabilities it exposed and the uneven political response. Trump has said little so far – and done nothing. His silence is telling. He will not admit that his fawning subservience towards Putin has backfired horribly. Nor, despite the many military, diplomatic and economic weapons at his disposal, will he now summon the strength and courage to take a stand. SoPutin gets a free pass, again. Next time it could be worse. What if, say, Russia directly threatens Finland? Or Germany? What will Trump do then?On the evidence to date, the suspicion is: not much. Former president Joe Biden was rightly criticised for playing it cautious on Ukraine. Trump is barely in the game. The UK and European Nato states must stop deferring to Washington, take off the gloves andfinally draw a linewith Moscow. Creating a protected no-fly zone over unoccupied areas of Ukraine, expanding military aid, halting all Russian energy imports,confiscating frozen Kremlin funds, isolating sanctions-busting Russian and Chinese banks, and downgrading or cutting diplomatic ties with Putin’s regime are courses of action repeatedly urged here. And if need be, Europe’s armies must be prepared to shoot back. Waiting for Trump is as futile as waiting for Godot, without the jokes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What price now his grandiose plan to remake the Middle East? US policy is held hostage to Netanyahu’s extremist nihilism. Cut off US weapons supplies to Israel. Freeze bilateral financial aid. Impose sanctions. Support war crimes prosecutions of Israeli leaders. Recognise an independent state of Palestine. Any normal American president might do some or all of this. But Trump isn’t normal. He’s an aberration. He’s out of his depth.Historic failures of international leadership are becoming all too common in this fractured 21st-century world. One was the 2003 US-British decision to invade Iraq. Another is the failure to effectively address the climate emergency. Now two more comparably epic disasters simultaneously loom. If the UN, holding its annual get-together this month, ifEurope, if the west allow Russia and Israel to pursue their murderous, illegal, immoral and ever-expanding aggression, there may be no stopping an accelerating descent into global anarchy.Unless democratic countries unite to secure a rapid halt to these wars, employing all necessary means including military force, then greater calamities will surely follow. But don’t count on the US to take the lead. Don’t count on weakling Trump. He’s part of the problem.

It was probably finished after the gallery’s cut-off date of 1900, a cut-off the gallery has just announcedit will be jettisoning.To say that I am pleased is an understatement. It always struck me as bizarre that the end date occurs just at the exact point in history when painting is about to become very interesting. Just look atthe Baigneusesand what they represent: the leap towards abstraction in the representation of the human form; the composition and its unidentifiable, but unified landscape; the use of colour, and the lack of discernible religious or mythological subject matter. The painting and its two sisters cast a significant influence on the onward march of 20th-century painting, particularly cubism, as they made a strong impression on both Matisse and Picasso. Yet one leaves the building without much of a sense of how these revolutionary developments ever played out. To stop at 1900 never made much sense.Weird altarpieceshave their place, but there are only so many in the world to acquire, and the public’s appetite for them is likely to be limited.Reports that the National, in dropping the cut-offdate and buildinga large new wingdevoted to 20th-century painting, risks “bad blood” with the Tate are depressing. Before an agreement about the date was reached, the galleries had historically been at each other’s throats. How unedifying it would be to see these two institutions at war again over the acquisition of, say, a Rothko.However, these reports seem overstated. The galleries have formed a joint working group and are planning to collaborate in the interests of the national collection as a whole, and part of that collaboration will no doubt involve considering each gallery’s remit.The National is a gallery of painting, and it traces the history of that artform only, while the Tate encompasses sculpture, photography, installation, works on paper, and more. The 1900 cut-off is so frustrating in part because for a gallery of painting to not tell the story of the seismic shifts in painting during the 20th century is such an obvious omission (it has for some years been trying to circumnavigate this through various shows and collaborations with contemporary artists). Besides, from a tighter focus can come greater clarity in an institution’s storytelling.View image in fullscreenRokeby Venus by Diego Velázquez was slashed by suffragette Mary Richardson in 1914Photograph: IanDagnall Computing/AlamyOne of those shifts, and one which I would love to see embraced by the National Gallery, is the story of the female nude. At the moment, to walk around it is to see the naked female figure as perceived and depicted by men, from Titian’s Diana and Actaeon to Renoir’s Nymph by a Stream and, of course, Diego Velázquez’s Rokeby Venus. The building is essentially a temple to the male gaze. The suffragette Mary Richardson’s infamousslashingof the Venus is testament to that. While I could never slash such a painting, I do understand the impulse, as will many other women who have been subjected to society’s ruthlessly objectifying beauty standards.It goes without saying that the nude is highly political. As Cézanne left us to contemplate his bathers, that same year – 1906 – saw the first nude self-portrait by a female painter in western art history (officially, at least). Paula Modersohn-Becker would tragically not live long enough to see modernism play out, but her approach to the nude changed everything. To halt a survey of the history of painting just at the point where women artists were, for the first time, beginning to depict themselves as subjects after centuries of being objects simply makes no sense. Visitors are left with only part of the story.How wonderful would it be to see the nude as approached by Gwen John, Suzanne Valadon, Frida Kahlo, Amrita Sher-Gil, Louise Bourgeois, Jenny Saville, Tracey Emin, Lisa Brice, Mequitta Ahuja, Kudzanai Violet Hwami … the list goes on. And to see not just women artists’ depictions of the female body, of course, but also, through their gaze, the male. The gallery’s expansion is a wonderful opportunity to redress the balance and introduce the British public to underrepresented artists. Because much as I would love, budget allowing, to see a Rothko or a Magritte or a Hockney at theNational Gallery, I would also like to see a Lee Krasner, a Frank Bowling, or a Dorothea Tanning. As it stands, there are only 27 works by women in the entire collection, and very few works by artists of colour.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I have no doubt that the Tate and the National galleries will come to a workable agreement. As experts they will understand better than anyone that to tell the story of art a certain way always involves a series of choices about whose work, and whose subjectivity, matters. There will be new, and no doubt fraught, decisions to be made, but how exciting. I can’t wait to see where they lead.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist.

Far more ambition is required if they are to be metSun 14 Sep 2025 12.25 EDTLast modified on Sun 14 Sep 2025 14.09 EDTShareDelivering her state of the unionaddressin Brussels last week, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, painted a grim but accurate picture of the challenges faced by Europe as the first quarter of the 21st century draws to a close. “A world of imperial ambitions and imperial wars,” she noted, is “a world in which dependencies are ruthlessly weaponised. And it is for all of these reasons that a new Europe must emerge.”Few would quibble with that analysis. As Ms von der Leyen spoke, the news that Nato aircraft hadshot downRussian drones over Poland graphically underscored her point. In an era of great power rivalry in which the United States has become an unreliable ally, there is an emerging consensus that the European Union must be more robust in defending its own interests and championing its own values.Whether Ms von der Leyen is the right leader to help deliver that is another matter. Her second term has thus far been defined by diplomatic passivity beyond the EU’s borders and a painful lack of ambition within them. On Ukraine and Gaza, as the former president of the European Central Bank Mario Draghi recentlypointed out, Brussels has mostly been “a spectator” as Donald Trump’scontentiouspeacemaking efforts have been brazenlyignoredby Vladimir Putin and Benjamin Netanyahu.In her speech, Ms von der Leyen responded to a growing chorus of criticism by calling for a partial suspension of the EU’s trade and cooperation agreement with Israel. Welcome, but too little too late.Disagreementamong member states – and the paralysing requirement for unanimity before sanctions can be imposed – has hobbled the EU’s response to a genocidal war that hashorrifiedEuropean populations. But Brussels has signally failed to show the kind of leadership that could shift the dial.An embarrassinglyone-sidedtrade deal struck with the US, which imposed 15% tariffs on EU exporters while removing existing tariffs on US goods, was another display of weakness. Renewed White Housethreatsover the treatment of US tech giants indicate that Mr Trump has simply banked that win before launching the next bullying onslaught. And although Ms von der Leyen last week reaffirmed her commitment to climate goals, the growing influence of far-right MEPs has provoked a series of damagingU-turnson green policy.A paradigm shift is needed if the “new Europe” to which Ms von der Leyen alludes is truly to emerge, and if its voice is to be heard in a darkening multipolar world. In a landmarkreportpublished last year, Mr Draghi called for vastly greater investment in Europe’s security, infrastructure and technology, enabled by common debt, a greater pooling of sovereignty and more cohesive and integrated markets. Ms von der Leyenpledgedto place this bold strategy at the heart of the commission’s plans, but so far barely a tenth of its recommendations have led to action.Unless that rapidly changes, the bloc’s ongoing economicmalaise– and its related vulnerability to growing Chinese competition and Mr Trump’s blustering demands – is likely to deepen. A strong, unified Europe is needed to stand up for liberal values in an era of “imperial ambitions and imperial wars”. Ms von der Leyen, and fellow European leaders, may be running out of time to build one.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionOpinionUrsula von der LeyenEuropeEuropean CommissioneditorialsShareReuse this content"

The government must step up as others stir division and disillusionment growsSun 14 Sep 2025 12.30 EDTLast modified on Sun 14 Sep 2025 14.09 EDTSharePeter Mandelson’s exit from public office in disgrace over his links to the millionaire sex offenderJeffrey Epsteinshould have been a low point for the government. Instead, it exposed a leadership in trouble, with further to fall. Sir Keir Starmer defended his ambassador after No 10 had seen the emails that sank him. Whether or not the prime minister read them, the damage is becoming institutionalised. Labour looks adrift – consumed byinfightingas darker forces gather beyond Westminster.At the weekend, more than 110,000 marched through London in Britain’slargest far-right rallyin decades. Organised by Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson, and billed as a “festival of free speech”, it quickly descended into conspiracy theories, Islamophobia and anti-migrant bigotry. There wasviolence: 26 police officers were injured. Stirring the pot was the far-right billionaireElon Musk, dialling in via video link, who called for the dissolution of parliament and incited violence; the French rightwinger Éric Zemmour pushed the “great replacement” lie – a white nationalist myth of engineered demographic change. Maga hats, US flags and “Send them home” signs made it feel more Mar-a-Lago than Millbank.The story here is not just scale, though that is striking. It is that the far right is increasingly organised,transnationaland opportunistic. While Labour was self-injuring, Mr Robinson and his allies staged a large-scale political mobilisation, laced withshocking aggression. British grievance, alarmingly, is now louder, American-branded and better funded.The killing of the American far-right influencer Charlie Kirk threw fuel on to the fire. The US right has swiftly turned the death of Kirk – shot dead at a university campus event – into a rallying cry. His widowpromisedthat his mission would grow stronger. Donald Trump refused to call for calm – instead blaming the radical left and striking a vengeful tone. It was a moment to de-escalate. He,unsurprisingly, chose not to. Mr Trump has a track record of inflaming hatred and using violence for political gain. It is appalling that Britain will roll out thered carpetfor him this week.This is the climate in which British politics now finds itself. One in which liberal democracies are not being overturned, but eroded – hollowed out from within by voter disillusionment. AndLabour, the party supposedly committed to democratic renewal, is floundering. Sir Keir’s response to the Mandelson debacle was too slow. His leadership is under pressure from MPs, ministers and unions – and he shows little sense of the growing threat from the far right.The lesson is clear: populist movements succeed not just because of what they offer, but because of what their opponents fail to provide. The US seems nowtrappedin a media and political ecosystem that profits from division and hate. Nothing good awaits Britain following on a path of rage and despair – fertile ground for political exploitation by unscrupulous politicians. Elected representatives here must bridge divisions, not widen them.With Reform UK topping the polls,wages growing slowlyand the NHS notimproving quickly enoughamid political dissatisfaction, Labour cannot retreat into technocratic management. Voters want clear direction and meaningful change – not stumbles and poor judgment. Democracy does not fail in a single moment. It corrodes. But democratic collapse happens like bankruptcy: gradually, then suddenly. The stakes could not be higher. This crisis may not stop at Downing Street – it could engulf the entire political system.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Read this and see what lies ahead, unless we act now, 9 September), my town has a small hostel that houses people who are seeking asylum. Recently, around 70 people draped themselves in the flag of St George, festooned the streets in the night, and came from across the country for a march towards the hostel. The local people tried to defend these vulnerable few. We gathered with our own flags to signify solidarity and compassion. We held banners saying that our town did not want racists terrorising refugees. We tried not to engage with them directly.In the seemingly interminable time before the police arrived, we were screamed at, pushed, called filthy child molesters and scum. Women were threatened with rape, and aerosols sprayed towards women with children to “wipe out their stink”. Posters were ripped from our hands, and young children wearing flags were encouraged to scream obscenities. They were spitting out that asylum seekers were scum, vermin, child molesters and that we were going to be knocked down and smashed.These people have seen the change in the political narrative. They are drowning in disinformation and intended to terrify and hurt people. This is the free speech that they claim is being denied to them.Every politician who engages in dog-whistle statements, scapegoating and myth-making is responsible for building their numbers. Has history really taught us absolutely nothing?Name and address suppliedFaversham is a lovely town on the north coast ofKent. With a creek running through it, frequent markets and festivals, and Britain’s oldest brewery, it is a delightful place to visit. Yet we recently experienced a hate-filled protest against immigration and the use of a hostel to fulfil the county’s responsibility toward migrants.This seeming contradiction can be explained in that whereas most of the people living in and around Faversham are middle class, it is also home to disadvantaged people left behind by the Conservatives and now by Labour. These people are understandably angry and have been swayed by the media to believe immigration is the problem rather than the inequality in our society.It has not helped that individuals in the government have echoed Reform’s rhetoric instead of countering it with the truth about the value of immigration. It has also not helped that housing policy has badly affected our area. We now have a Reform council that combines inexperience with an inclination to sympathise with the protest. The result is that our streets are no longer safe.So it is important that the needs of the “left behind” are looked after and the immigration myths are cleared out of people’s heads once and for all. Otherwise we can foresee Reform taking control throughout Britain, and, as we know in Faversham, this is not a prospect that bears thinking about.Name and address suppliedIn our village, many people are intimidated by the racists who have put flags on pretty much every lamp-post and there are vigilantes confronting anyone who tries to take them down. Many villagers are extremely angry with this overt racism and the threat of reprisals. Many are frightened and fearful.Some have been openly abused and videos posted on social media – this appears to be in the far-right playbook. It’s clear evidence of criminality, but that doesn’t seem to matter. Sadly we don’t have the numbers prepared to stand up to what, here at least, appears to be a small minority. Individuals who have taken a stand have been assaulted, and accused of being traitors and unpatriotic. This is nothing to do with patriotism or freedom of speech. It’s all about intolerance, power and racists’ bully-boy tactics.The police and councils are fully aware, but have only shrugged. If those who are supposed to represent and protect us will not speak out, somehow we have to do it for ourselves.Name and address suppliedHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Plus a letter fromMary FoySun 14 Sep 2025 12.05 EDTLast modified on Sun 14 Sep 2025 12.12 EDTShareThe “timid” approach by the government when it comes to regulating businesses is a shift from the promises of just a year ago to face down the nanny-state jibes to secure the long-term future of the NHS (Editorial, 9 September). This approach is also at odds with public sentiment.Recent polling showed74% of people want the government to prioritise people’s health over business growth.With millions of people affected by preventable diseases caused by tobacco, alcohol and unhealthy food, we need stronger action from the government to match the rhetoric – including minimum unit pricing to prevent strong alcohol being sold cheaply, a levy on the profits of the tobacco industry and the implementation of mandatory policies to improve food and drink.This will not just benefit the NHS but support the government’s growth ambition, given the heavy toll of poor health on productivity and the wider economy.Hazel CheesemanChief executive, Action on Smoking and Health;Prof Sir Ian GilmoreChair, Alcohol Health Alliance;Katharine JennerDirector,ObesityHealth AllianceThe government’s ambition to shift to prevention is something many have tried but not achieved. There is cross-party consensus, backed by public support, that we should rid our country of the tobacco epidemic and end smoking, aleading cause of preventable death. Thetobacco and vapes billis the chance to do this, but isn’t being prioritised in parliament.As long as tobacco firms can profit, they will attempt to delay and weaken regulations that save lives. A levy on them would weaken this incentive while raising£700mper year, which could fund efforts to improve public health. Companies built on profits from addiction and disease should be nowhere near policymaking. It is only right that they pay for the damage they cause.Mary FoyCo-chair, all-party parliamentary group on smoking and healthHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

This ignores a range of clinical and societal factors that contribute. Maternal factors play a part, but so does the rise in defensive clinical practice, the loss of midwives’ and obstetricians’ skills and confidence in supporting physiological birth, and the proliferation of misinformation and scare stories on social media that increase parental anxiety.All these factors have led us to the current crisis, where more than 50% of babies are born with surgical intervention, with no concomitant improvement in maternal or perinatal mortality and with unknown consequences for the health and wellbeing of future generations.Dr Debbie GarrodMidwife and antenatal educator, Abingdon, OxfordshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The scoreboard answer from a soaking wet Bristol was predictable enough. When bookmakers start quoting prices of 1000-1 on for a team to win a two‑horse race, the chances of England failing to reach the semi‑finals were roughly on a par with anyone in the stands getting sunstroke.With it came yet another record statistic for John Mitchell’s bunch of serial winners. No leading international rugby side in history has previously won 31 Tests in a row as England’s women have now done: 61 victories in their past 62 Tests leaves precious little room for people to question their pedigree or killer instinct.England blow away Scotland to set up World Cup semi-final against FranceRead moreYet would you absolutely put your mortgage on England hoisting the World Cup in just under a fortnight? This may, of course, depend on the precise sum of money involved and the potential availability of other emergency income streams. But would you? Without hesitation? Based on the evidence of this particular game, despite the comfortable victory margin and difficult conditions, you may just be inclined to hold fire.Sure, the return of Zoe Aldcroft makes a big difference. What a totemic figure the England captain has become. And, as ever, when England get within five metres of the opposition line with ball in hand, their supporters lick their lips. Scotland were wonderfully spirited and endlessly committed but the laws of physics are not easily defied when big forwards with subterranean centres of gravity are queueing up to score.The occasionally underrated Morwenna Talling deserved her award for player of the match while Kelsey Clifford, in for the injured Hannah Botterman, also took her starting chance with both hands. Her two no-nonsense first-half tries will have particularly delighted everyone at her first club, Finchley RFC, where her father introduced her to rugby at the age of six. Then there is that fleet-footed marvel Abby Dow, who scored her 50th Test try and played with her usual dash and energy.A single-figure penalty count on a filthy afternoon was another relative plus. But into the final equation must also be factored the handful of tries they didn’t nail through nagging little misjudgments, one or two curious tactical options and occasionally staccato rhythm. On other days, against opponents with a sturdier set piece, the contest could have been appreciably tighter.View image in fullscreenAbby Dow’s usual energetic performance was topped off with her 50th Test try.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianMitchell felt his side had been unfairly handicapped by Scottish cynicism up front but the danger of complacency lurks around every corner. Is it really a great innovation, for example, for non-playing England players to be bashing away at drums in the stands during a game? Shouldn’t they be concentrating more intently on the action and saving all that for afterwards? Or, better still, quietly take a few more lessons before “entertaining” the public further?Of more immediate urgency, perhaps, is whether England are hitting all the right on-field notes. This, for example, was Holly Aitchison’s big chance, after a lengthy wait, to start at No 10 and show her suitability to retain the jersey for the biggest games. She is a lovely footballer and slotted the vast majority of her goals, but England’s backline seldom clicked as the management might have hoped.One of those moments, ironically, came after Aitchison had been shifted slightly wider out and came gliding down the 12 channel to score a smooth second-half try. But England, for entirely logical reasons, prefer to start the more direct Tatyana Heard at inside-centre alongside the ever-impressive Meg Jones. Even after all the endless winning it sometimes feels as if England are still not totally sure of their optimal starting XV.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Maybe their mighty pack and extraordinary strength in depth will wear down all-comers and the holy grail will be secured for the first time since 2014. Maybe the winners of the other semi-final between Canada and New Zealand on Friday night will be crushed beneath the host nation’s caterpillar tracks like so many before them. As Scotland’s impressive captain, Rachel Malcolm, rightly said afterwards: “England are the No 1 team in the world for a reason.”But just maybe England’s future opponents still have a tiny sniff. As the lively Francesca McGhie carved through England’s defence late on to help set up the position from which Rhona Lloyd scored Scotland’s consolation try, the eyes of one or two Black Ferns would certainly have lit up. The Scots also had some joy chipping over the top into space and forcing England’s midfield to turn.We shall find out soon enough. What is not in any doubt is the Red Rose love in the stands. Ashton Gate was sold out for this contest and will be again for the semi-final next Saturday. The final will be a monumental occasion, rain or shine.

I believe in my way’Jamie Jacksonat the Etihad StadiumSun 14 Sep 2025 15.34 EDTLast modified on Sun 14 Sep 2025 20.59 EDTShareA defensive Ruben Amorim insisted after Manchester United’s 3-0 derby defeat at Manchester City that his system will remain, so “you have to change the man” if his 3-4-3 formation is to be discarded. The head coach also suggested recent events behind closed doors have hampered the team.City defeated United 3‑0 with Phil Foden’s 18th-minute header and Erling Haaland’s strikes on 53 and 68 minutes. It leaves Amorim’s side on four points after four games and his overall record as 31 from 31 games.Amorim denied the team’s shape may be adjusted to try to improve results and he pointed to unknown occurrences as a factor in the form.“It is not a record you should have at Manchester United,” he said. “You have no idea what happened [privately] during these [past] months but I accept that. I am not going to change. When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man.“We talk about this every game that we lose. I believe in my way and I am going to play my way until I want to change.“I see that we are doing better but the results don’t show that.I remember last year I played with my former club [Sporting Lisbon] against City [in the Champions League] – we won 4-1. It was not near the same amount of opportunities – the way we controlled that game compared to today. In certain moments we were not better than City – I understand that. It is hard and the record says everything. I understand.”Amorim was asked what the message is to any fans losing faith in him. “That I am going to give everything,” the 40-year-old said. “I will do everything – always thinking about what is best for the club. That was always the same message. It is not my decision, the rest. I really want to win games. I am suffering more than them.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The striker is not ready for the demands of playing regularly after missing pre-season and Slot is looking to build up his stamina slowly.Mohamed Salah settled the match in the 95th minute from the penalty spot after Hannibal Mejbri handballed inside the box on a day that Liverpool’s talismanic forward misfired.Mohamed Salah on the spot as Liverpool break Burnley hearts in stoppage timeRead more“We got him from Newcastle in a state where you could say his pre-season is going to start now,” Slot said he of Isak. “He needs proper minutes of training before he has a certain base, let alone for him to play twice in three days.“So that’s what we do, we try to prepare players for the beginning of the season once a week, and then we try to do more and more and more before we go into the rhythm of two games a week, so that they are ready for that schedule.”The Liverpool defender Milos Kerkez was replaced before half-time after being booked for a dive inside theBurnleybox. “The only way we could lose this game, if we go down to 10, because with 11 v 11, we could have drawn it, but we couldn’t have lost it because they’ve never been over the halfway line, let alone in our own 18-yard box,” Slot said.“I didn’t want to take that risk, which was hard for Milos because normally you don’t have to take a player off if he has a yellow before.”View image in fullscreenMilos Kerkez was booked for diving in the first half and then substituted after only 38 minutes.Photograph: Lee Parker/CameraSport/Getty ImagesBurnley endured the same fate last time out when an injury-time Jaidon Anthony foul allowedManchester United to win 3-2 at Old Trafford. The latest defeat leaves Burnley with three points from four games after throwing away two potential draws.“It’s really heartbreaking the way the game finishes for us,” their manager, Scott Parker, said. “Two weeks in a row that it’s in the dying minutes, two penalties that decide the games. And we don’t manage to get the result.“It’s pretty disappointing. I thought the players really produced a performance. It was everything we’ve worked on.

The problem for the home side was that it was scored by a Tottenham player.When Cathinka Tandberg spotted Courtney Brosnan off her line, as she received the ball 35 yards out, she did not hesitate to attempt the lob, and she would spoil the party for Everton in their first competitive match since making Goodison Park their permanent home. Her first-time strike dropped perfectly and capped an impressive away performance for Spurs, who made it two wins out of two so far under their new head coach, Martin Ho.Sam Kerr scores after 634-day absence while Manchester United maul LionessesRead moreThat ambitious effort, four minutes into the second half, came after Olga Ahtinen slotted Spurs in front 27 minutes into a first half they controlled, with Everton unable to click into gear. Ahtinen’s opener came after she won the ball on the edge of the area, played a one-two with Tandberg and slotted low past Brosnan.Both goals came from Tottenham pressing with intensity, as Bethany England tackled Rion Ishikawa before laying the ball off for Tandberg’s long-range lob, on the Norway striker’s first start since her deadline-day move from the Swedish side Hammarby.“She did it in training this week,” Ho said of Tandberg. “The courage to do that and the risk-taking to do that is big and that’s what she’s built on. Overall, her performance was brilliant.”View image in fullscreenNew signage outside Goodison Park.Photograph: John Clifton/Action Images/ReutersThe former England striker Ellen White labelled the strike “absolutely ridiculous” on the BBC’s live television coverage and Tandberg told the broadcaster: “I did it in my last club. You just have to go for it, and when you score that, it’s unbelievable. When I get those moments I have to do what I like and that’s scoring goals, so ‘go for it’.”It was also a second consecutive clean sheet for Tottenham, whereas for Everton the result brought them back down to earth somewhat, after their positive victory away at Anfield. This game was still historic for them, though. They were backed by 6,473 at Goodison, an attendance which is nearly three times the maximum capacity of their former home at Walton Hall Park.In the stands there were some signs of “the grand old lady” having been vacated recently by the Everton men’s team, not least the many hundreds of seats that have been removed, but in general the venue looked smart. The rebrand around the exterior has been impressive; a timeline of the history of the women’s team is now found proudly along Goodison Road, while along Walton Road, a series of new banners display the “Everton Women” name and say: “A history we own; a future we are making.” Another reads: “Goodison Park, the home ofEverton Women.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Of course, we want to do better. I don’t know if it was the occasion. But it’s on me to make sure they’re 100% ready, and they weren’t.”Ho, formerly a player at Everton’s boys’ academy before working as assistant coach of Everton Women between 2015 and 2018, labelled the stadium “beautiful”. “Coming back here was an unbelievable feeling. As soon as you come in here, you do feel intimidated because the stadium is quite enclosed. And that’s one thing I said to the players before the game, was ‘we have to expect it to be a bit hostile’, and I thought the fans were brilliant.”Everton’s best moments featured Ruby Mace having a deflected shot saved and Rosa van Gool curling over, but Spurs had the better chances, with Tandberg sliding wide in the first half, England heading wide in the second and Drew Spence forcing Brosnan into a smart late save. Tottenham are one of four teams with a 100% winning start.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueEverton WomenTottenham Hotspur WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

That came to pass when he joined the famous Racers Track Club in Jamaica. Now, on a night of exhilarating speed and twisting drama, he achieved a far bigger dream and emulated his hero by becoming the 100m world champion.To make it even sweeter, he deli­vered the greatest performance of his career in front of Bolt himself, who was cheering and ­punching the air like a superfan as Seville ran down his ­fellow Jamaican Kishane ­Thompson in the final metres to secure gold in 9.77sec.“It was a pleasure to have Usain watching me,” Seville said. “His coach is my coach and I know that both of them are very proud of me right now. They were telling me I was going to be the world champion. And I have proved, in front of him, that I am. I am very proud of that. Now, more gold medals.”This was a night when the National Stadium in Tokyo felt like the world’s biggest steam room, with the heat and impossible humidity making palms and minds sweaty. Not that you would know it looking at Noah Lyles on the blocks.As his name was announced he raised his hands in the air like a champion boxer before roaring into the night sky.Beside him was another contender, Thompson, whom he had beaten to gold by 0.005sec in a thrilling Olympic 100m final last year. The Jamaican, too, was bouncing around excitedly, eager for what lay ahead. Seville, though, played it ice cool as he waited to pounce.It took a while, though. Thompson, who moves with the power of a No 8 forward with a try-line in sight, made his usual lightning start. And he was still leading until the last five metres or so until his form got increasingly raggedy. “I enjoyed myself,” he said.View image in fullscreenMoment of magic: Oblique Seville crosses the finish line to win the final ahead of Kishane Thompson and third-place Noah Lyles.Photograph: Paweł Kopczyński/Reuters“I wanted to win. But when it came to the last five metres, I saw Oblique was moving. And then I was like ‘Oh’.”Oh indeed. Still, he looked happy to take silver in 9.82sec with Lyles, the reigning Olympic and world champion, claiming bronze in 9.89.As usual Lyles was great value afterwards, as he admitted that an injury had ruined his chances of 100m gold – before predicting boldly that he would definitely defend his 200m title this week.“The difference between last year and this one was my injury,” Lyles said.“Getting injured in the middle of the season was not part of my plan. Unfortunately it made me rush a lot of things. I came to the world championships with only four races over 100m under my belt.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Budapest in 2023 was particularly tough, given he clocked 9.88sec, the same time as the silver and bronze medallists.To make matters worse, at the Olympics last year Seville had run quicker than anyone in the semi‑finals, before finishing last in the final after injuring his hamstring.“For Paris I got injured in the final and I fell short, but I learnt from my mistake,” he said afterwards. “I have proved that I am a true competitor, that I have the determination of a champion. But still, I was panicking. Finishing strong in the last 30 to 40 metres was something I was struggling with the whole season.“But now I have perfected it. And I was confident that if I could do it in the final, I would win. Track and field is both mental and physical. But to be honest, I think I have mastered the mental part of it.”Last year people were starting to wonder whether the 24-year-old had the right stuff. This, emphatically, proved he did. In doing so, he also brought the title of the fastest man on the planet back to the country he loves. “The last time Jamaica won a men’s 100m global gold medal was in 2016 when Usain Bolt got it,” Seville said. “The gold is coming home.”Explore more on these topicsWorld Athletics ChampionshipsAthleticsnewsShareReuse this content"

In an official statement, the Vuelta organisers said: “For security reasons, stage 21 of La Vuelta has been ended early. There will be no podium ceremony.”Pidcock ready for podium as Vingegaard all but guarantees Vuelta triumph with stage winRead moreSpanish media reported that about 3,000 protesters were at the finish line and it was also claimed that there had been violent exchanges between police and protesters. Security sources told Spanish media they had “to charge at the protesters who were throwing barriers and bottles”. The Spanish government later said more than 100,000 people were at the rally in Madrid.Afterdays of vociferous protestsdirected towards the Israel Premier Tech team, extra police had been brought into Madrid in a bid to secure the final stage, in what was the largest security operation since the city hosted a Nato summit in 2022.A huge crowd of protesters pushed over race barriers, close to the Plaza de Colón and Gran Vía, as security forces lost control of the situation. Police charged some of the protesters and fired teargas, but the race route was overwhelmed.As the peloton arrived in Madrid, with 56km to race, riders at the rear were delayed and also pushed by protesters holding anti‑Israel banners. The race organisers then stopped the front of the race and lengthy discussions with the Guardia Civil led to the decision to cancel the stage.Soon afterwards, a glum-looking Vingegaard was seen sharing a muted celebratory handshake with his teammates, as he made his way directly to his team hotel.View image in fullscreenBarriers are smashed by pro-Palestine protesters at the finish line of the final stage in Madrid.Photograph: Ana Beltran/ReutersBefore the stage the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, had expressed his “admiration” for the demonstrators. Speaking in Málaga, he said: “We would like to express our gratitude and absolute respect for the athletes but also our admiration for the Spanish people who mobilise for just causes, such as Palestine.”The Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Saar, said: “He encouraged protesters to take to the streets. The pro-Palestinian mob listened to the inciting messages and attacked La Vuelta. The sporting event that has always been a source of pride forSpainhas been cancelled. Sánchez and his government: shame on Spain!”The collapse of the third biggest Grand Tour of the year has plunged World Tour racing into crisis, with the continued presence of the Israel Premier Tech team, recently endorsed by Benjamin Netanyahu, the object of the increasingly enraged protest groups at the roadside.A week ago, as pressure increased on the team, owned by the billionaire entrepreneur Sylvan Adams, to withdraw from the Vuelta, Netanyahu posted: “Great job to Sylvan and Israel’s cycling team for not giving in to hatred and intimidation. You make Israel proud!”View image in fullscreenThere were some clashes between protesters and police, who had mounted Madrid’s biggest security operation since Spain hosted the Nato summit in 2022.Photograph: Rodrigo Jimenez/EPAThedisruptions throughout the three-week raceaffected multiple stages and led to the cancellation of planned stage finishes and the shortening of the race distance.Vingegaard, speaking last Monday to Danish media, said of the protests: “People do it for a reason. It’s horrible what’s happening currently and I think those protesting do so here, because they need a forum to be heard.”The Tour de France Grand Depart takes place in Barcelona in July next year and Spanish protest groups are targeting the French race. The Palestinian campaign for the academic and cultural boycott of Israel told Swiss media “protests will continue at cycling races as long as hypocritical western institutions absolve Israel”, adding: “The immediate finish line is the end of the genocide.”Last week the civil disobedience group Futuro Vegetal said it was “very likely” that there would be further protests in Barcelona and added that “protesting at the Tour de France is the least we can do”.Despite the cancellation of the stage, Vingegaard still won the race overall, from the Portuguese João Almeida in second place. It was the Dane’s third Grand Tour victory, after his wins in the Tour de France in 2022 and 2023. Tom Pidcock, double Olympic gold medallist in mountain biking, took his first Grand Tour podium, finishing third overall. The planned podium ceremony and final presentation ceremony were cancelled.Explore more on these topicsVuelta a EspañaCyclingSpainEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But whatever happens, a great team understands that just because you haven’t got a [leadership] title, doesn’t stop you from being a leader.”A switch would be a blow to Pope, who has been vice-captain since late 2022 and led the team five times during this time. McCullum confirming Pope will also be the reserve wicketkeeper on tour – the role he performed in New Zealand last year,handing Jacob Bethell his chance– is unlikely to soften it.As for the squad overall, McCullum said he wants at least seven seamers, even if he is searching for a new person to mentor for them. Tim Southee, who replaced Jimmy Anderson in the role this summer, is committed to playing franchise cricket, with Andrew Flintoff tipped as one option for the role.With McCullum confident that Mark Wood will be “cherry ripe” after knee surgery in March blew out his summer, the main question mark is the spare spinner. Shoaib Bashir is still the No 1, McCullum insisted, despite missing the back end of the 2-2 series draw against India with a broken hand.View image in fullscreenEngland’s final T20 against South Africa was called off at a soggy Trent Bridge without a ball being bowled.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersLiam Dawson replaced Bashir for the Old Trafford Test but a wicketless final day, plus his usual winter commitments in franchise cricket, may lead to Rehan Ahmed getting the nod. As for Stokes, who is recovering from a shoulder injury, McCullum has no concerns and expects him to have a “booming series”.The head coach said: “I know how much [Stokes] wants these Ashes. My job will be to finesse that. Sometimes, we can want something too much and our haste to want to succeed can be the thing that stops us succeeding. But it’s going to be a ripper.”McCullum offering his thoughts on the Ashes – and defending England’s solitary warmup, pointing out they have won the first Test of every away tour under his leadership – offered some interest on an otherwise soggy day at Trent Bridge. Brian Clough might have walked on water in this part of the world but they are still to work out how to stop it falling from the sky.Not that England’s summer is over entirely. A squad flies to Ireland on Monday for three further T20s, albeit further diluted by Brook and Jofra Archer being granted a breather before the winter. No Brook meansBethell will get his first taste of captaincyat the tender age of 21.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

England’s warmup match against their own Lions side may yet decide who gets the nod for the No 3 position.Before the rain fell in Nottingham, England also announced that Saqib Mahmood will miss Ireland to undergo “minor knee surgery”. In comes Hampshire’s Scott Currie, a former England Under-19 seamer who won three one-day international caps for Scotland last year, for his first senior call-up.Among the greatest pities about the damp scenes was that Phil Salt, Jos Buttler, Luke Wood, Tom Banton and Dawson all missed T20 Finals Day at Edgbaston 24 hours earlier to then mill around watching puddles form on the covers.Still, in spite of the absentees and the time of year,Somerset’s victory capped a memorable occasionthat clearly meant so much to so many. The T20 Blast may no longer be the premier men’s short-form tournament in England but, to pinch a line from Clough, it is definitely in the top one.Explore more on these topicsEngland cricket teamHarry BrookBrendon McCullumBen StokesThe AshesSouth Africa cricket teamCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

Hurts and Barkley each had touchdown runs, while Andrew Mukuba’s fourth-quarter interception of Patrick Mahomes helped to deliver the win. The Eagles’ defense was strong, holding the Chiefs to 294 yards and forcing the only turnover of the game. Philadelphia have won seven straight games and improved to 17-1 over the past 18 games. The Chiefs have fallen to 0-2 for the first time since 2014, which also was the previous time they failed to make the playoffs.New York Giants 37–40 Dallas Cowboys (OT)Brandon Aubrey kicked a 46-yard field goal on the final play of overtime after a tying 64-yarder to end regulation, and the Dallas Cowboys beat theNew York Giantsin a thrilling duel between Dak Prescott and Russell Wilson. The Cowboys extended their winning streak against the NFC East rivals to nine games. It’s the longest active streak in the NFL among division opponents. Prescott beat the Giants for the 14th consecutive time since losing both starts against them as a rookie in 2016. Overtime was on the verge of going scoreless after the teams combined for five go-ahead TDs in the final 12 minutes of the fourth quarter. Wilson, who threw for 450 yards and three touchdowns, connected with Malik Nabors on a 48-yard TD for a 37-34 New York lead with 25 seconds remaining after Prescott threw a six-yarder to George Pickens with 52 seconds to go. The Giants just needed a field goal to win when Wilson threw an ill-advised deep ball with pressure, and Donovan Wilson intercepted at the Dallas 30 with two minutes left in OT. Prescott put Aubrey in chip-shot range with a 14-yard scramble.Jacksonville Jaguars 27-31 Cincinnati BengalsJake Browning passed for 241 yards in relief of the injured Joe Burrow and scored the go-ahead touchdown on a one-yard sneak with 18 seconds remaining as the Cincinnati Bengals rallied for victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars. Burrow suffered a toe injury in the first half and did not return, an ominous sign for the Bengals and their franchise quarterback. The Bengals moved to 2-0 for the first time since 2018, while the Jaguars fell to 1-1. Browning led a 15-play, 92-yard drive for the decisive score on which he completed 9 of 12 passes for 65 yards. Burrow, who was not available for interview after the game, left the Bengals’ locker room on crutches with a boot on his left foot. “We had such a tight game, I don’t have all of the information right now,” Bengals coach Zac Taylor said.Later reportsindicated Burrow has strained toe ligaments and will miss several weeks, although ESPN’s Adam Schefter said that could rise to three months if the quarterback needs surgery.Seattle Seahawks 31-17 Pittsburgh SteelersGeorge Holani doing what every coach tells ya to do: run to the ball. Touchdown, Seahawkspic.twitter.com/tTVn2rwFPc— Dugar, Michael-Shawn (@MikeDugar)September 14, 2025George Holani pounced on a live ball in the end zone for an improbable touchdown, and the Seattle Seahawks took advantage of sloppy play by the Pittsburgh Steelers to pull off victory. The Seahawks had taken a three-point lead early in the fourth quarter on Jason Myers’ 54-yard field goal when the ensuing kickoff bounced over the hands of Steelers rookie Kaleb Johnson and into the end zone. While Johnson turned his back and walked toward the bench, Holani raced to the end zone and fell on the ball. That was enough for Seattle on a day that Aaron Rodgers struggled, completing 18 of 33 passes for 203 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions a week after a four-touchdown debut in a win over the New York Jets. Sam Darnold threw two TD passes for the Seahawks.Denver Broncos 28-29 Indianapolis ColtsSpencer Shrader made a 45-yard field goal with no time left after the Broncos were penalized for leverage on his missed 60-yard try, and the Indianapolis Colts beat Denver for their first 2-0 start since 2009. Trailing by two with 3:15 left, the Colts played conservatively on their final drive, with Jonathan Taylor running the ball seven times and Daniel Jones throwing only one pass. Those plays netted 26 yards and set up Shrader’s attempt from midfield that missed short and right. But Dondrea Tillman was flagged for leverage – using a teammate to vault himself into the air to try to block the kick. The 15-yard personal-foul penalty put Indy well within Shrader’s range.Chicago Bears 21–52 Detroit LionsJared Goff threw for 334 yards and matched a career high with five touchdown passes, including a career-high three scores to Amon-Ra St Brown, to help Detroit bounce back with a win over Chicago. The Lions dropped the opener at Green Bay and have not lost consecutive games in the regular season over the last two-and-a-half years. The Bears turned the ball over twice in the first half, leading to a 28-14 deficit that was too large to overcome in coach Ben Johnson’s return to the city where he became an offensive coordinator.Buffalo Bills 30-10 New York JetsJosh Allen shook off a bloody nose as the Buffalo Bills cruised to victory over the New York Jets. James Cook ran for 132 yards and two touchdowns, helping the Bills improve to 2-0. Allen left for two plays in the first quarter after being hit in the face but returned to lead the team. The Bills’ defense shut down Justin Fields and the Jets’ offense from the start. Fields struggled before leaving in the fourth quarter with a concussion. Tyrod Taylor replaced him and threw a late touchdown for the Jets, who fall to 0-2.New England Patriots 33–27 Miami DolphinsDrake Maye threw for two touchdowns and rushed for another, Antonio Gibson returned a kickoff 90 yards for a score, and the Patriots beat the Miami Dolphins 33-27 for Mike Vrabel’s first win as New England’s coach. Maye completed 19 of 23 passes for 230 yards, including TD tosses to Mack Hollins and Kayshon Boutte. The Dolphins took a 27-23 lead midway through the fourth when Malik Washington returned a punt 74 yards for a touchdown. Before Miami fans were even done celebrating the play, Gibson took the ensuing kickoff to the house to give the Patriots a three-point lead.San Francisco 49ers 26–21 New Orleans SaintsMac Jones threw three touchdown passes as Brock Purdy’s replacement and the visiting San Francisco 49ers held off the New Orleans Saints.Jones made his debut for the 49ers in place of Purdy, who is sidelined by a toe injury, and completed 26 of 39 for 279 yards. Spencer Rattler matched Jones’ three touchdown passes while completing 25 of 34 for 206 yards and Alvin Kamara rushed for 100 yards on 21 carries for the Saints.Cleveland Browns 17–41 Baltimore RavensLamar Jackson threw four touchdown passes and Baltimore’s defense harassed Joe Flacco throughout his return to Charm City as the Ravens dispatched the Cleveland Browns. After holding Cincinnati to 141 yards in a one-point loss to the Bengals last week, the Cleveland defense limited Derrick Henry to just 24 yards on 11 rushing attempts. But the Browns were mostly inept on offense. Flacco, the former Super Bowl-winning quarterback for the Ravens playing his first game in Baltimore as an opposing player, went 25 for 45 for 199 yards and a touchdown, with an interception and a lost fumble.Los Angeles Rams 33–19 Tennessee TitansMatthew Stafford threw for 298 yards and two touchdowns as the Los Angeles Rams spoiled rookie Cam Ward’sNFLhome opener scoring 20 straight points to beat the Tennessee Titans. Wide receiver Puka Nacua also ran 45 yards for a touchdown. Davante Adams had 106 yards receiving and a touchdown catch. Joshua Karty also kicked two field goals. The Rams improved to 2-0. They sacked the No 1 overall draft pick five times. Linebacker Byron Young had two. He stripped Ward of the ball at the Titans’ 21 on his second sack.Carolina Panthers 22–27 Arizona CardinalsThe Arizona Cardinals beat the Carolina Panthers, thanks to a strong defensive effort. Josh Sweat’s strip-sack led to an early touchdown, and Calais Campbell’s sack with 26 seconds left stopped a late Carolina rally. The Cardinals led 27-3 in the third quarter, but Panthers quarterback Bryce Young threw three touchdown passes in the second half. His final touchdown cut the lead to 27-22 with 1:58 left. The Panthers recovered an onside kick but couldn’t score on their last drive. Young finished with a career-high 328 yards passing, but missed all seven throws on the final drive.Explore more on these topicsNFLCincinnati BengalsNew York GiantsDallas CowboysUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

He retired in 2012 and went on to speak openly about his struggles with depression and alcohol.Greater Manchester police said they were not treating his death at home in Hyde as suspicious.Unforgettable Ricky Hatton turned boxing into a spectacle for his vast army of fansRead moreTributes from inside and outside the boxing world were paid to the Stockport-born fighter, who was training for his first contest in 13 years in an exhibition fight in Dubai in December.Amir Khan, another British former world champion, said Hatton was “one of Britain’s greatest boxers” and also a friend, mentor and “a warrior”.“As fighters, we tell ourselves we’re strong – we train, we sweat, we take hits, we get up,” Khan said. “But sometimes the hardest fight happens in silence, in the mind.“Mental health isn’t weakness. It’s part of being human. And we must talk about it. We must reach out. We must lean on each other.”The former world heavyweight champion Tyson Fury also paid tribute. Alongside two pictures of him with Hatton, Fury wrote on Instagram: “Rip to the legend @rickyhatton may he rip. There will only ever be 1 Ricky hatton. can’t believe this so young.”The BBC boxing pundit Steve Bunce described the news as “unbelievably shocking” because Hatton “was in a really good place”.View image in fullscreenRicky Hatton with the IBF and WBA light-welterweight belts after defeating Carlos Maussa in November 2005.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAOnly days ago, Hatton had posted videos of himself working out in the gym in apparent preparation for his comeback fight.Bunce said training for a contest had been Hatton’s salvation but that he had not gone to the gym as planned on Friday and then failed to appear at a boxing match he was due to attend.“He didn’t show up and someone went to his house this morning … It is shocking news,” he said.Fans of Manchester City and Manchester United held a minute’s appreciation for Hatton during the derby at the Etihad on Sunday afternoon. City, the club Hatton supported, paid tribute to “an icon of British boxing”.In a statement, City said they were “devastated” and that Hatton was “viewed by many as one of the most compelling personalities the sport has ever produced”.It added: “Hatton wore sky blue shorts and used Blue Moon as his walkout song throughout his career. Ricky was one of City’s most loved and revered supporters, who will always be remembered for a glittering boxing career that saw him win world titles at welterweight and light-welterweight. Everyone at the club would like to send our heartfelt condolences to his family and friends at this difficult time.”View image in fullscreenA minute’s applause in tribute to Ricky Hatton before the Manchester derby.Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images/ReutersManchester United responded to City’s post with the words: “Sending our heartfelt condolences to Ricky’s loved ones on the loss of a legend of our city.”The City midfielder Phil Foden spoke of his shock and the players’ determination to do Hatton proud.Speaking to Sky Sports News before the match, he said: “My heart obviously goes out to his family, at this hard time. Obviously to hear the news just before a big game is devastating. I’m sure he would have been here today as well, supporting us. Today is for him and we’re going to try to get the win and do the best we can for him.”The Ring magazine said it was “deeply saddened” to learn of the former super-lightweight champion’s death, while IFL TV, another boxing outlet, described Hatton as “a legend of a man inside and outside the ring, he was truly one of a kind”.The British boxer, who won 45 of his 48 professional bouts, made his debut in 1997. He earned notable world title wins over Kostya Tszyu in 2005 and Jose Luis Castillo in 2007 before high-profile defeats by Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao.Tributes were left at the gates of Hatton’s property, called The Heartbreak, shortly after the news broke. One card read: “We can’t gather our thoughts at present so we’re not sure what to write. Devastated is the only thing that comes to mind. Thank you for being the beautiful soul you are.”Stephen Billing, 46, said he was “shaking, in shock” as he draped a blue-and-white Manchester City scarf marked “RIP Ricky” alongside bouquets of flowers.Billing said he had known Hatton for years as they had both had struggles with alcoholism and were City fans. He said he last spoke to the former boxer three months ago when Hatton was about to go on holiday after the end of his relationship with the former Coronation Street star Claire Sweeney.“He was hard as nails, we all know that, but not in a bad way,” Billing said. “He was a proper local lad, down to earth. You wouldn’t think he was a professional boxer with millions and millions of pounds.”Explore more on these topicsRicky HattonBoxingnewsShareReuse this content"

In reality, according to what the nonpartisan Gun Violence Archivesaidto NBC News, only about a tenth of 1% of such cases over the previous decade have allegedly been carried out by trans people.Nonetheless, Cox stopped short of saying that officials had determined the suspect’s partner’s alleged status was a factor in Kirk’s killing.In comments toNBC’s Meet the Press, Cox said that Kirk’s accused killer, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, was not cooperating with authorities. Yet authorities are gathering information from family members and people around him, Cox said.Cox said that what investigators had gathered showed Robinson “does come from a conservative family – but his ideology was very different than his family”.Questions linger about alleged shooter’s motivation for killing Charlie KirkRead moreCiting the content of investigators’ interviews with people close to Robinson, Cox said “we do know that the [suspect’s] roommate … is a [partner] who is transitioning from male to female.“I will say that that person has been very cooperative with authorities” and was “shocked” by what had happened, Cox remarked to Meet the Press host Kristen Welker, referring to the roommate. “And … the why behind this … we’re all drawing lots of conclusions on how someone like this could be radicalized. And I think that those are important questions for us to ask and important questions for us to answer.”The governor did not elaborate on the evidence that investigators were relying on to establish Robinson’s relationship to his roommate with whom he shared an apartment in Washington county,Utah, about 260 miles from where Kirk was killed.Robinson’s arrest was announced on Friday after he surrendered to authorities to end a two-day manhunt in the wake of the 31-year-old Kirk’s killing.At the time of his arrest, Robinson was a third-year student in an electrical apprenticeship program at Dixie Technical College.Utah records show both of his parents are registered Republicans who voted in the 2024 election that gave Donald Trump, their party’s leader, a second presidency. But publicly available information offers little if any insight into Robinson’s personal beliefs.Cox made it a point to tell NBC that “friends that have confirmed that there was kind of that deep, dark internet … culture and these other dark places of the internet” where Robinson “was going deep”. The governor did not elaborate – though on Saturday, citing the work of law enforcement, he told the Wall Street Journal that “it’s very clear to us and to investigators that this was a person who was deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology.”NBC News reported that Cox’s information tracked with what the network had been told by a federal official close to the investigation into Robinson. The official also said that there was still “not a solid understanding” of whetherRobinson’s personal relationship with his roommate isrelevant to the case, NBC reported.Cox also warned Meet the Press’s audience of the damage that the internet and social media sites, which he said are run by “conflict entrepreneurs is doing to all of us”.“These companies … have figured out how to hack our brains, get us addicted to outrage … and get us to hate each other,” Cox said.In a separate interview on Sunday, CNN’s Dana BashaskedCox to elaborate on his comments to the Journal.“That information comes from the people around him, from his family members and his friends – that’s how we got that information,” Cox told CNN. “There’s so much more that we’re learning, and so much more that we will learn.”Bash alsoaskedCox whether the roommate’s status was relevant to the investigation and a potential motive. The governor replied: “That is what we are trying to figure out right now.”“I know everybody wants to know exactly why, and point the finger,” Cox said. “And I totally get that. I do, too.”Yet Cox said he had not read all interview transcripts compiled by investigators, “so I just want to be careful … and so we’ll have to wait and see what comes out.”Cox said he expected the public would learn more when formal charges were filed against Robinson. The governor said he expected that to happen on Tuesday.After Robinson’s arrest, Utah officialssaidthat inscriptions were found on bullet casings within a rifle found near the scene where Kirk was killed.One reportedly read: “Hey fascist! Catch!” Another purportedly read, “Oh, Bella ciao” – a reference to an Italian anti-fascist resistance song. A third reportedly said: “If you read this, you are gay, LMAO.”During his CNN appearance, Cox also said that investigators were looking into a potential note left by Robinson.Officials at the group chat app Discord recently said that they had identified an account on the platform associated with Robinson – but found no evidence that the suspect planned the incident on the platform.The spokesperson for Discord did say that there were “communications between the suspect’s roommate and a friend after the shooting, where the roommate was recounting the contents of a note the suspect had left elsewhere”.When asked about the note, Cox said that “those are things that are still being processed for accuracy and verification”. He suggested additional details about the note could be “included in charging documents”.Charlie Kirk’s death raises fears of ‘beginning of a darker chapter’ for US violenceRead moreOn Saturday, the New York Times reported that Robinson joked in Discord messages after the FBI released suspect photos during the manhunt that his “doppelganger” was the one who had fatally shot Kirk. A group chat member joked about turning him over the custody of the FBI to collect a $100,000 reward being offered for information leading to an arrest in the case, to which Robinson allegedly replied: “Only if I get a cut.”The FBI director, Kash Patel, posted a link Sunday onsocial mediato an article that the conservative Fox News network published a day earlier that first relayed details of Robinson’s alleged partner, citing senior-level agency officials. The FBI on Saturday declined to comment to the Guardian on that report and other similar ones.In an unrelated matter from three years earlier, Kirk had attacked Cox on social media over the topic of trans women in sports and called for him to be expelled from the Republican party.Members of both of the US’s major political parties on Sunday reiterated condemnations of Kirk’s killing and political violence in general.“Every American is harmed by this – it’s an attack on an individual and an attack on a country whose entire purpose, entire way of being is that we can resolve what we need to resolve through a political process,” Pete Buttigieg, a Democrat who served as the US transportation secretary during Joe Biden’s presidency, said to Welker.Republican US senator Lindsey Graham, meanwhile, told Welker: “What I’m asking everybody to do is not to resort to violence to settle your political differences.”Explore more on these topicsCharlie Kirk shootingUtahUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

But when we get things wrong, I have the guts to say we need to change course.“We need to listen to the country, and our movement. When we don’t, we make mistakes that overshadow our achievements. That’s how we succeed and that’s where our strength lies.”Phillipson launched her campaign with supporters in Sunderland on Sunday, promising to take on Reform UK with her experience fighting a “red wall” seat for Labour.“You can use this contest to look backward, to pass judgment on what has happened in the last year or you can use it to shape positively what happens in the run-up to the next election,” she said in an address to party members, who will vote next month.Phillipson said she would run a campaign of “hope, not grievance” and warned the party against descending into division.

The court could also delay the ruling.Speaking at Sunday’s rally, the CHP leader, Özgür Özel, said the government was trying to cling to power by undermining democratic norms and suppressing dissent after opposition victories in local elections over the past year.Özel also called for a snap general election. “This case is political. The accusations are slander. Our comrades are innocent. What’s being done is a coup – a coup against the future president, against the future government. We will resist, we will resist, we will resist,” he said in his address to the crowd.View image in fullscreenThe CHP leader, Özgür Özel, told the rally the government was trying to cling to power by undermining democratic norms.Photograph: Necati Savaş/EPAThe government says the judiciary is independent and denies any political motives.Turkey has detained more than 500 people, including 17 mayors, over the last year in Istanbul and other CHP-run municipalities around the country as part of corruption investigations, according to a Reuters review.Hundreds of members of the CHP have been jailed pending trial in a sprawling investigation into alleged corruption and terrorism links, among them Erdoğan’s main political rival, Istanbul’s mayor, Ekrem İmamoğlu.The arrest of İmamoğlu in Marchsparked the country’s largest protests in a decade where hundreds of thousands took to the streets, prompting a brief but sharp sell-off in the lira and other Turkish assets.In a letter sent from prison and read aloud at the rally in Ankara, İmamoğlu wrote that the government was attempting to predetermine the outcome of the next election by sidelining legitimate rivals. He also accused the government of undermining democracy through politically motivated judicial actions and other efforts to suppress dissent.“The era of ‘I’ in this country will end, and the era of ‘we’ will begin. One person will lose, and everyone else will win,” İmamoğlu wrote. The crowd applauded and chanted “President İmamoğlu” after the letter was read aloud.Explore more on these topicsTurkeyRecep Tayyip ErdoğanEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The vote determines 20,000 seats in the councils of more than 320 towns, cities and municipalities as well as the positions of mayors and lord mayors across the state. Voter turnover was 59%, up from 2020.Merz’s conservative CDU fulfilled predictions that it would retain its dominant position in the state. The Social Democrats, its junior coalition partner in the federal government, came in second with 22.5%, a small drop from its result in 2020 that defied pollsters’ predictions that it was facing heavy losses.The SPD has struggled to retain support in some areas, in particular former coalmining regions where it was once sure of victory.The AfD’s strong showing lived up to pollsters’ predictions, more than tripling its standing from five years ago when it secured 5.1%, and giving its candidates who are running for mayoral positions a considerable chance of reaching second-round votes in two weeks’ time.The AfD’s gains appear to have been made on the back of heavy losses for the Greens and the pro-business Free Democratic party. The far-left Die Linke secured 5.5%, putting it above its 2020 result of 3.8%.View image in fullscreenThe elections in Germany’s most populous state were seen as the first significant test at the ballot box for Friedrich Merz as chancellor.Photograph: Christopher Neundorf/EPAPolitical observers say the vote indicates the AfD is on track to repeat the big gains it has made in the states of the former communist east, where it has been most successful at drawing on voters’ disgruntlement with the status quo. It has set as its goal to enter the federal government by 2027. Currently it is the largest opposition party in parliament.The vote took place against the backdrop of a weakened German economy, rising unemployment and growing unease over immigration – the AfD’s key issue. Merz has pledged to get the economy back on track, reduce immigration and cut the far right down to size.Since February’s federal election, the AfD has come top in several national opinion polls. The more success the AfD achieves in securing a foothold in local political positions, by securing mayoralties and councillor posts, the harder it will be for the mainstream parties to uphold their pledge to maintain a “firewall” preventing political collaboration with the AfD at the federal level, experts say.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But on immigration, where he has pledged to dramatically change Germany’s policy, voters have said they are not so convinced, despite the fact that numbers have dropped in recent months.The AfD has presented itself as a confident alternative, scoring points with voters on issues such as energy provision, education and above all immigration, even though these policy areas are not decided at the local level.Explore more on these topicsGermanyAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)The far rightFriedrich MerzEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

In the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – and mounting threats by Donald Trump to abandon historic allies – Nato announced plans to increase military spending to 3.5% of gross domestic product (GDP), as part of a broader security spending target of 5% GDP for each member country.Meeting the 3.5% target will add 132m tCO2e into the atmosphere, which is about the same amount of carbon pollution generated annually by 345 gas-fired power plants – or the entire oil producing country of Oman,according to the report.The planned rise comes on top of the $200bn funding boost between 2019 and 2024, which already increased Nato’s military carbon footprint by an estimated 64m tCO2.“It is extremely difficult to see how the current and planned military spending increases can be reconciled with the transformative action necessary to prevent dangerous climate change,” according to SGR, a UK-based membership organisation which promotes responsible science and technology.Military emissions are vast but difficult to track, in large part due to a lack of transparency and mandatory accounting, and predicting how budget increases will be spent is fraught with uncertainty.Still, the total military carbon footprintwas estimated at about 5.5% of global emissions in 2019 – excluding greenhouse gases from war fighting and post-conflict reconstruction. This is more than the combined contribution of civilian aviation (2%) and shipping (3%).Since then, global military expenditure has surged, hitting $2.72tn in 2024 - the highest since the end of the cold war, according to theStockholm International Peace ResearchInstitute.Israel’s military budgetjumped to $46.5bn in 2024 – the largest increase in the world as it continued to bomb Gaza, Syria, Iran, Yemen and Lebanon, while thePentagon’s 2026 budget is setto surge to $1tn thanks to Trump’s tax and spend bill, a 17% rise on last year.The SGR report is the most comprehensive assessment so far of the impact of increasing military spending on greenhouse gas emissions, as the planet hurtles towards climate catastrophe and governments fail to take meaningful action.The findings, which draw on the methodologies used by the 11 studies analyzed, suggest that military expansion will play a significant role in breaching the Paris climate target of curtailing planetary warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.“There is an urgent need for rapid decarbonisation to prevent the most dangerous effects of climate change. But recent and planned rearmament programmes and wars are pushing the world in the opposite direction,” said Dr Stuart Parkinson, author of the report and a leading researcher in the field.The report recommends that nations with military spending above 0.5% GDP should be mandated to report robust data to the UN, assist with estimates of conflict-related emissions and put in place plans to transition off fossil fuels through both technological and non-technological measures including peace building agreements, arms control, and disarmament initiatives.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisNatoShareReuse this content"

Analysing 20 years of data on 27 diseases – including malaria, Chagas disease and hantavirus – researchers found that municipalities in the Amazon biome near healthy forests on Indigenous lands across eight countries faced a lower risk of disease.The study reveals a reduction in respiratory and cardiovascular problems linked to wildfire smoke, as well as diseases spread when deforestation brings humans into closer contact with animals and insects.“Indigenous forests in the Amazon bring health benefits to millions,” says Paula Prist, senior programme coordinator of the forests and grasslands team at theInternational Union for Conservation of Nature(IUCN), and an author of the study.Ana Filipa Palmeirim, at the Federal University of Pará inBraziland co-author of the study, says: “Even when fires take place in remote forest areas, winds spread the pollution far and wide, creating deadly public health emergencies.”View image in fullscreenBoys from the Indigenous Tsimane people climb papaya trees to pick fruit in the Bolivian Amazon.Photograph: Matthieu PaleyThe findings come duringfire seasonin the Amazon region, when seasonal blazes are driven by drought, the climate crisis and agricultural expansion, withlarge ranches and farmsusing fire to clear land.

The new study, published in Communications Earth and Environment, stresses that legal recognition of Indigenous lands is key.“Indigenous-held lands with secure land tenure lose less tree cover, which helps keep forests intact and allows them to store more carbon and support higher biodiversity,” says James MacCarthy, research associate at World Resources Institute’s (WRI) Global Forest Watch, which was not involved in the study. “Securing Indigenous land rights is one of the mosteffective strategiesfor protecting forests in the Amazon.”View image in fullscreenThe Bolivian Amazon suffered record tropical primary forest loss driven by wildfires in 2024.Photograph: Matthieu PaleyAnother recentreport by WRI and World Wildlife Fund, authored by MacCarthy, underscores the critical role Indigenous lands play in conserving forests. “Both studies highlight the importance of ending deforestation and supporting Indigenous leadership, which is critical for reducing fire risk,” says MacCarthy.Boliviahadrecord tropical primary forestloss driven by wildfires in 2024, ranking second only toBrazil– a country eight times its size.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Several hours away in the town of Santa Ana de Velasco, nurse Wilmar Cristian Gonzales Ortiz says many young patients are now struggling with pneumonia and other respiratory problems after heavy smoke exposure last year.For Uzquiano, the impacts of fires go beyond physical health. “Emotionally, we feel an emptiness after each forest fire, with only silence remaining after you see your forest turned to ash,” he says.View image in fullscreenIsabel and Verónica Surubí Pesoa resettled in San Javier in Bolivia after wildfires forced them to leave their home in Monte Verde Indigenous territory.Photograph: Benjamin Swift/The GuardianScientists say the Amazonis also importantfor human life far beyond the tropics. Evapotranspiration from the Amazon is a critical water source for the central Andes of Bolivia and Peru, says Marcos Andrade Flores, an atmospheric physicist at the Universidad Mayor de San Andrés in La Paz, Bolivia.“If you cut down the forest on a large scale, the transportation of moisture could destabilise and change to a dry system,” he says. “It would be catastrophic.”View image in fullscreenVicente Canare credits historic Indigenous marches for legal recognition of their territory.Photograph: Benjamin Swift/The GuardianThe new study emphasises that legal recognition of Indigenous territories is key to enabling effective forest stewardship. “Ourparents and grandparents marchedto demand that our territories be respected, demanding security and land titles,” says Vicente Canare, the secretary of land and territory atCPILAP, an Indigenous organisation in Bolivia’s north-western Amazon, referring to a series of 640km marches for Indigenous rights in the 1990s and early 2000s. “It is thanks to those marches that we can now decide how to best conserve our territory.”But Bolivia is in the middle ofelections, with a conservative and centre-right candidate set to head to arunoff in October. Withcampaign promisesto eliminate communal property in favour of individual land titles, Indigenous communities worry they could lose territorial autonomy.“They are essentially offering up our territory for sale,” says Verónica. “Everything could be lost.”With theCop30UN climate summit slated to take place in Brazil this November, researchers hope the study will be an impetus for international collaboration. “Particulate matter emissions due to forest fires, and their related health impacts, transcend national borders,” says Florencia Sangermano, a co-author of the study at Clark University in the US. “International collaborative frameworks that align forest protection, Indigenous stewardship and fire mitigation strategies across the Amazon biome are essential.”Katie Reytar, a senior research associate at WRI’s Land and Carbon Lab, says the benefits to ecosystems of titled Indigenous forests are significant. A 2016 report estimated that securing Indigenous land rights in Bolivia, Brazil and Colombiawould generate at least $679bn(£502bn) in carbon storage and other ecosystem services over two decades.View image in fullscreenChiquitano forest in Bolivia has been cleared for cattle grazing.Photograph: Benjamin Swift/The Guardian“Adding in the human health and disease prevention dimension would increase these values even further,” she says.For communities in the Amazon, the link between preserving forests and protecting health is clear, says Uzquiano. “You don’t need studies to know that people here are joyful – we live from nature’s benefits,” he says, warning that research alone won’t protect that future. “If we want to strengthen the resilience of Indigenous peoples, they must be matched with real programmes and projects.”Explore more on these topicsAmazon rainforestSouthern frontlines: Latin America and the CaribbeanWildfiresBoliviaBrazilAmericasGlobal healthDeforestationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That’s the stakes that I’m dealing in, and don’t be under any illusions. I think you know perhaps better than I do because you work in it. The NHS is hanging by a thread. So I urge the BMA not to pull on it.”Streeting’s direct plea to the union comes after a tumultuous summer in which resident doctors in England stagedfive consecutive days of strike actionamid a dispute with the government over pay.“The government has changed. The attitude to the NHS and its staff has changed. I need the approach of the BMA to change too,” Streeting said. “Rescuing the NHS from the biggest crisis in its history is a team effort and it will only happen if we are on the same side, working together. I can’t do this alone. I need partners, not adversaries.“I am in this job to fight for patients every day, just like you, and just like you I am in this job to save the NHS every day. If we join forces, it’s a fight we can win. If we are pitted against each other, the whole country loses.”He added: “When I said the NHS was broken, I did not just mean for patients. I am clear that the future depends on building a health service that values you, invests in you and supports you. We can only do that as friends, not foes.”Doctors were still “fighting the last enemy”, Streeting said. “The Conservatives curbed your pay – we’re raising it. The Conservatives created training bottlenecks – we’re tackling them. The Conservatives took the NHS to the worst crisis in its history – we’re putting it back on the road to recovery.“If we fail and Nigel Farage gets his hands on it, then it is Reform and die. I don’t know about you but I do not want that on my conscience.”However, Streeting was told that a BMA survey of 2,874 doctors showed many had “deep concerns” over his 10-year plan to mend the NHS.Dr Tom Dolphin, the chair of the BMA council, said morale remained low among NHS staff and there were still high levels of vacancies. The government “will need to explain how fewer staff will be able to deliver more care,” he said.Explore more on these topicsHealth policyNHSDoctorsHealthPublic services policyWes StreetingLabournewsShareReuse this content"

He has also just taken on the role of designated safeguarding lead.“This year things have got as bad as I’ve seen in my nearly 20 years of headship,” he said. “Across schools in Lambeth I’m seeing exhausted staff, morale is low and we are seeing more and more dilapidated school buildings across the borough.“In my school we have had to cut pretty much all areas of support staff and services, from additional language to mental health.

The result is overstretched school staff, crumbling buildings and harm to our children’s education, with some of the largest class sizes in Europe. We are urging the government to decisively deal with the school funding crisis once and for all and properly fund our children’s schooling.”The general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, Paul Whiteman, said members were being asked to do more with less, including growing demand for special educational needs support. “School leaders share the government’s ambition for inclusion, but are warning that system reform must be accompanied with sufficient funding,” he said.A spokesperson said the Department for Education did not recognise the figures quoted in the research. “Despite our tough fiscal inheritance, this government has protected key education priorities through our plan for change.“We are putting a further £3.7bn into schools’ budgets and increasing pupil premium to over £3bn for 2025-26 to provide additional support for those children that need it most.”Explore more on these topicsSchool fundingSchoolsAusterityTeachingEducation policyEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The overall rankings score trusts based on a range of measures including finances and patient safety, as well as how they are bringing down waiting times for operations and in A&E, and improving ambulance response times.Guardian analysis of the underlying data has found that about three-quarters of trusts are failing to hit either of the two cancer targets in the tables.Ninety of the 118 trusts (76%) are missing the first target of ruling cancer in or out within 28 days of urgent referrals in at least 80% of cases.The analysis also reveals that 86 of the 118 trusts (73%) are failing to hit the second cancer target measured in the tables, of starting treatment within 62 days in 75% of patients.Delaying cancer diagnosis or treatment can lead to worse outcomes for patients, fewer options for tackling the disease, and earlier death.Canceris the UK’s biggest killer, causing about one in four deaths.Cancer experts said they were alarmed by the Guardian’s findings. Paula Chadwick, the chief executive of the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation, said: “Three-quarters of NHS hospitals failing to meet cancer targets is nothing short of a national emergency.“Behind every missed target is a person left waiting, a family left in limbo, and lives put at greater risk because the system simply isn’t moving fast enough. Cancer does not wait. Delays in diagnosis and treatment cost lives – it’s as stark as that.”Chadwick said the government and the NHS must act to tackle the crisis. “Without immediate action, people will die who could and should have been saved,” she said.Helen Dickens, the chief support officer at Breast Cancer Now, said the figures were “devastating” and she was “deeply concerned” that many patients were facing very long waits for treatment. “More must be done to reverse these alarming trends,” she said.Susanna Daniels, the chief executive of Melanoma Focus, said: “It is deeply concerning that three in four NHS hospitals are missing cancer treatment targets. For patients with melanoma skin cancer, delays could significantly affect their outcomes.”Alfie Bailey-Bearfield, the chair of the Less Survivable Cancers Taskforce, said treatment delays were unacceptable. “For people diagnosed with less survivable cancers – of the brain, liver, lung, oesophagus, pancreas and stomach – time is absolutely critical,” he said. “Each year, 90,000 people in the UK are diagnosed with these cancers, and they have an average five-year survival rate of just 16%. We urgently need the NHS and government to prioritise faster diagnosis and treatment.”Mid and South Essex NHS foundation trust ranked worst inEnglandon 62 days to start treatment, with only four in 10 of its patients (42.2%) beginning treatment within two months. It was also the second worst performer on the 28 days diagnosis target, with just 59.2% of patients told they do or do not have cancer within a month of an urgent referral.Graph of NHS trusts’ performance in cancer treatmentThe chief executive of Mid and South Essex, Matthew Hopkins, said: “Our patients deserve better and so we are absolutely focused on improving our position as a trust. We are increasing the provision of diagnostic tests, outpatient clinics and cancer surgery to reduce the time to diagnosis and treatment.”Hull University teaching hospitals NHS trust was the worst in the country on 28 days diagnosis, ruling cancer in or out in 57.5% of patients within a month of an urgent cancer referral. It was the third worst performer in England on the 62 days treatment target (49.3%).A spokesperson for NHS Humber health partnership said: “We are disappointed with our position in the latest NHS league tables. They highlight areas where we must do better for the communities we serve.”Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS foundation trust was ranked the best in England on starting treatment within 62 days (87.3%). Bolton NHS foundation trust was the top performer on cancer diagnosis, ruling it in or out within 28 days in 88.6% of patients.The health secretary, Wes Streeting, said the league tables would pinpoint where urgent support was needed and help end the “postcode lottery” of care for patients.“We must be honest about the state of the NHS to fix it. Patients and taxpayers have to know how their local NHS services are doing compared to the rest of the country,” he said. “Patients know when local services aren’t up to scratch and they want to see an end to the postcode lottery – that’s what this government is doing.”A separate report published on Monday suggests breast cancer could cost the UK economy £4.2bn by 2050.Claire Rowney, the chief executive of Breast Cancer Now, said the report produced with Demos exposed “the growing scale of the problem and the human and economic prices being paid”.Additional reporting by Michael GoodierExplore more on these topicsNHSCancerHospitalsHealthEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

If we as a country prioritised education and training in prisons, there would be far less reoffending.”Changes to prison education budgets are authorised by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ). The Guardian has submitted freedom of information requests to find out more about how prisons will be affected but has been told that the MoJ does not hold data about the budgets of individual prisons.James Timpson, the prisons minister, has repeatedly emphasised the importance of prison education and training.In July, Lord Timpson wrote: “We know that purposeful activity can help to enable safe and decent prisons and have a transformative effect on reoffending rates … This is why the government committed to working with prisons to improve access to purposeful activity in its manifesto and is actively exploring the best approaches to do so.”An MoJ spokesperson said the government had secured investment in new roles, career advice and improvements in digital systems for prisoners.“This government inherited a prison system in crisis and is working at pace to fix it. This includes changing how prison education works so that it is more effective and so that we also focus resources on building prisoners’ vocational skills like construction, retail and hospitality, where there is demand for labour.“The national budget for education services has not been reduced.”Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationUK criminal justiceEnglandWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

He died of his injuries. It is still unclear how he selected his apparent victims. The county was also the scene of the 1999Columbinehigh school massacre that killed 14 people.Holly’s TikTok accounts contained white supremacist symbols, the Anti-Defamation League said, and the name of his most recent account included a reference to a popular white supremacist slogan. The account was unavailable on Friday. TikTok said accounts associated with Holly had been banned.Holly’s family could not be reached. The Associated Press left a message at a telephone number associated with the house that police searched after the shooting.A spokesperson for the Jefferson county sheriff’s office, Mark Techmeyer, declined to comment on the ADL’s findings or discuss its investigation into the shooting. The office previously said Holly was radicalized by an unspecified “extremist network” but released no details.Two recent suspects in school shootings were active on the so-called “gore forum” that Holly used called Watch People Die, according to the ADL. Holly appears to have opened his account in the month in between shootings inMadison, Wisconsin, andNashville, Tennessee, the ADL said.A few days before Wednesday’s shooting, Holly posted a TikTok video posing in a similar way to how the Wisconsin shooter posed before killing two people during in December. He included a photo of the Wisconsin shooter in a post in which Holly wore black T-shirt with “WRATH” written on the front.He also posted videos showing how he made the shirt that was like the one worn by a gunman in theColumbineshooting, the ADL said.Assassination in Utah, school shooting in Colorado: one day in US gun violenceRead more“There is a through-line between those attacks,” said Oren Segal, the ADL’s senior vice-president of counter-extremism and intelligence. “They’re telling us there is a through-line because they are referencing each other.”Watch People Die administrators said in an email that Holly lied about his age in order to access the site and was a not a very active user of it, with only seven comments. The email said the site is “adamantly pro-Israel” but does not silence opposing viewpoints. It referred to Holly and the shooters in Wisconsin and Tennessee as “unhinged losers”.Holly was also active on TikTok’s “True Crime Community”, where it says users have a fascination with mass murderers and serial killers, the ADL said.Some TikTok posts shared by the ADL show one user encouraging Holly to be a “hero”, a term it says white supremacists use to refer to successfully ideologically motivated attackers.The person also told Holly to get a patch with a Nazi-era symbol that was worn by the men who carried out the2019 attackon a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, and the2022 attackon a supermarket in Buffalo, New York.Holly posted a photo of two patches that he had but said the Velcro on the back had fallen off.“I’m gonna use stronger glue when I fix it,” he said.The Colorado school shooting happened on the same day that the far-right political activist,Charlie Kirk, wasshot deadduring an event in Utah.Kirk’s alleged killer, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, was similarly an avid internet user.Robinson – whose motives are still unclear – grew up in a gun-loving Republican home. He is reportedly not yet cooperating with law enforcement. Utah’s governor, Spencer Cox,said on Sundaythat “friends that have confirmed that there was kind of that deep, dark internet … culture and these other dark places of the internet” where Robinson “was going deep”.Ammunition left at the scene of Kirk’s death had engravings related to internet memes, including lyrics from an anti-fascist Italian song, the words “hey fascist! CATCH!” and an obscure sexual meme.José Olivares contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS school shootingsColoradoUS politicsColumbineFar right (US)US crimenewsShareReuse this content"

Inside the club, which is at the centre of the former fishing community aroundNewcastleupon Tyne, something else is brewing.When the Guardian visits, members are playing lunchtime games of pool in the downstairs bar as usual. But upstairs there are still signs of the latest party as huge sound system speakers butt up against the bingo caller’s equipment.This working men’s club has become an unlikely clubbing mecca. Local promoter and artist Man Power (real name Geoff Kirkwood) has brought some of the world’s best DJs and dance music acts to King Street:Caribou, Daniel Avery, Luke Una, Roman Flügel, Prosumer, Optimo and Gerd Janson have all played on the club’s stage and sung its praises.View image in fullscreenGeoff Kirkwood, better known as Man Power, has been putting on events at King Street, in which he owns a stake, since 2022.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“For the first two years, we lost money,” admits Kirkwood, who grew up in Wallsend. “But we could feel that there was something special happening.”He wasn’t the only person to see potential: Sam Fender had an album launch here and has a studio just down the street. But, after the Man Power parties, others started to get in touch. Apparently,Fred Againasked for a slot and was turned down.Kirkwood, who spent time in Berlin and Mexico before moving home, has been putting on events here since 2022. The DJ doesn’t just rent the space; he owns a stake in King Street. His company,Are You Affiliated(AFA), has essentially sublet the concert hall space for the next decade. The club, which has about 1,000 members, functions as usual (bingo nights, psychic acts, club turns) but on the occasional evening the upstairs space is transformed into a night club. Bar takings are up and events are selling out.It’s not just the King Street Social Club that Kirkwood has transformed either. Over the August bank holiday, AFA turned the Beacon Centre car park – a standard multi-storey in the town centre – into an ad hoc rave venue.The King Street model doesn’t just stand out because of the colourful tiles or the intriguing mix of new and old-school clubbing; it’sa success storyin an era when clubbing is often depicted asneeding life support.Covid was a terrible time for British clubs, with abouta third closing for good, which is part of a wider pattern. In 2013, the UK had 1,700 nightclubs; 11 years later there were just 787. In August, the Night Time Industries Association said the UK faced a future of “night-time deserts”, which followed dire headlines such as “UK clubs will be extinct by 2030” because of the closure rate.The reason for club closures is often put down to the changing habits of young people, soaring rents and pressure from property developers. But Kirkwood has also seen a shift in dance music towards a model where thedominance of major promoters and clubsmakes it harder for others to operate.View image in fullscreenThe working men’s club functions as usual, with its pool tables and bingo nights, but on the occasional evening is transformed into a night club.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“We’ve got into a situation where the model is ‘let’s create these few stars who can command a big audience; create these places that can take the big audience and we swallow it up and take market share’,” he says. “Fuck market share.”Kirkwood has taken that outspoken approach into meetings with local politicians who he is trying to convince to include clubbing when thinking about culture, and ensure some of themoney streaming into the areacomes the way of promoters.The impact of the cultural economy is already obvious in North Shields.Kirkwood takes me on a tour of the local area. We snake past theMeadow Well estate, site of a notorious riot in the 90s, before heading to Fish Quay, which Kirkwood describes as a “mini Hackney Wick”.On one street in the area there are two breweries and half a dozen artist studios (one of which is Kirkwood’s). Sam Fender’s studio is close by and there’s a vinyl pressing plant called the Jungle, which is finishing up a batch of records for drum’n’bass artist Nia Archives. “I was their first customer,” says Kirkwood. All the enterprises are connected in some way, with most roads leading back to King Street.Last weekend at the club, Kirkwood helmed a performance of a symphony he wrote while he was artist in residence at the nearby Glasshouse (formerly the Sage Gateshead). But he’s not getting carried away.“You’ve got journalists coming down to talk about it, which is fantastic,” he says. “But it doesn’t change the fact that, like, at 11.30 on Sunday night I was mopping piss up from the flooded toilets. It’s good to have that kind of levelling factor.”Explore more on these topicsClubbingDance musicNewcastleDjango DjangoSam FenderCaribouTyne and WearnewsShareReuse this content"

He opens up about his years of hard graft, his mum’s big acting break, and why things are getting weird with his therapistSun 14 Sep 2025 05.00 EDTShareIdon’t know if I’ve even really celebrated it to be honest, man.”Sitting in a north London bar on a boiling hot evening, resplendent in a matching silk shirt and shorts combo, Mawaan Rizwan is contemplating his life post-Bafta. In May last year, he won best male comedy performance for Juice, his gloriously surrealist BBC series in which he stars as Jamma, a clownish manchild with a bowl cut navigating a chaotic life alongside his dysfunctional family and buttoned-up older boyfriend.In the end, after a few sips of his negroni, Rizwan – whose CV also includes appearances on Taskmaster, Live at the Apollo andDoctor Who, plus a slew of comedy songs about racism, toxic masculinity and skiing’s lack of socioeconomic diversity – pinpoints one way his life has changed; his therapist upped his fee. Rizwan speculates that it might have happened after his viral acceptance speech, in which the surprised and elated actor recounted a prior session’s focus on the dangers of relying on external forms of validation.“I’ve spent a lot of my adult life trying to prove myself so that I can be clapped by people, like: ‘Hey, you know what? Maybe you’re not a loser,’” the 34-year-old says with a grin. “I thought winning an award shouldn’t feel good according to everything I’m talking about in therapy … But it feels fantastic.” Shortly after his win, awkward conversations were had in his therapist’s office. “It was the elephant in the room because I reckon he saw the fucking speech,” Rizwan laughs.Like his onscreen creation, Rizwan has the ability to flit between silliness, sincerity and sadness in the blink of an eye. When I ask why his dad doesn’t star in Juice, like his mum and brother do, he falls silent. Then just when it feels as if he’s on the brink of opening up about their relationship, he switches to joke mode: “I didn’t want to be like Trump, just giving out jobs to my family. Plus, being completely honest, my dad’s CV wasn’t good enough.”Today Rizwan’s energy is also spiked by tiredness; he arrived 10 minutes late for the interview, having just finished the edit on Juice series two, and seems ready to collapse. “This show is a lot, man,” he sighs. “I care about it so deeply. But the downside to that is I don’t have a life.”View image in fullscreenClown show … Rizwan in Juice series two.Photograph: BBC/Various Artists LimitedThankfully, the hard work has paid off. While series one had myriad visual flights of fancy – Jamma tucking into his boyfriend Guy’s arm after it transformed into a cake; an orgasm in a pub toilet punctuated by a jet of glitter – it was still anchored in the real world. Influenced by the playful aesthetics of directors such as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind’s Michel Gondry andSorry to Bother You’s Boots Riley, the more supernatural series two takes place in a miniature Juice Town. It’s a world of tactile sponge-like fantasias, intricate house interiors made entirely of cardboard, and sperm-soaked sofas mistaken for modern art. Its gothic, mist-strewn streets are haunted by a mysterious mystic-slash-vape salesman (played by Kevin Eldon) who trades souls, while an emotional scene involving Jamma’s dad’s journey to the UK is retold using shadow puppets and an egg.First performed at Edinburgh festival fringe as a frenetic one-man show more than a decade ago, it took a while to convince people that Juice could work on television. “There’s a certain way of making British comedy, and if you’re trying to make a show that’s not [like something else] on TV already, that’s a huge risk,” Rizwan says. That risk was heightened by a TV industry contending with financial and political pressures. “I think people are scared,” he says. “Politically, we’re in a very tumultuous time. And that’s the time when art needs to be the most daring, the most honest, the most bold. But on a systemic level and on a commercial level, it’s also a time of austerity, where money tightens, so we often get this paradox: people need to make art that’s more honest, but commissioners want to make stuff that’s a surefire hit. It’s just a hard time for people who want to challenge expectations because everything is a fight.”Politically, we’re in a time when art needs to be daring. But it’s also the time of austerity – commissioners want a sure-fire hitUltimately, he’s aware that not everyone will like Juice and its glorious phantasmagoria and oddball in-jokes (Jamma and his best friend, Winnie, can often be found “smoking” Chipsticks, for example). “If this is not your show, cool, don’t watch it,” Rizwan says. “But if this is your show, the idea is that you become obsessed with it, because it’s a squidgy, almost edible world that feels tangible and sensory.”Despite the familial cast list – Jamma’s flighty artist brother Isaac is played by Rizwan’s real-life younger brother Nabhaan, who has also starred in Netflix’s Kaos and the crime drama Informer; his mother, Shahnaz, stars as frustrated matriarch Farida – Rizwan is at pains to point out that Juice’s narrative arc of self-acceptance isn’t completely autobiographical. “I know monetising our trauma is the ‘in’ thing in our culture, but sometimes it’s not always helpful,” he laughs. “I wanted Juice to feel truthful and personal, but I wanted it to just fly into avenues that are beyond my limited life experience.”View image in fullscreenAll bark … Mawaan Rizwan.Photograph: Tami AftabThere are definite connections, however, not least the fact that series two finds Jamma becoming a professional clown. When Rizwan was 23, he enrolled at a clown school just outside Paris for a month (it was all he could afford). It changed his life. “We would learn about how everyone in the circus has a skill – there’s a fire-breather, there’s a contortionist – but the clown has no skill whatsoever but his stupidity,” he says. “They’re so lovable but so tragic, and that’s an interesting character trait. Jamma has so many of those qualities.” Rizwan is reckoning with his frequent impulse to “use comedy as a way to get love, make people laugh” by making himself “the butt of the joke. There comes a point in your life when maybe that doesn’t serve you, but you still do it because it’s a habit.”I did every kind of dingy fringe venue you can think of: corridors, buses, toilets, on a dancefloor shouting over the VengaboysBorn in Pakistan, Rizwan, like Jamma, moved to the UK as a child with his mum (“a powerhouse who never takes no for an answer”). While the family initially struggled – “Mumhad a really tricky decade of migration battles and economic struggles,” is how Rizwan puts it – their home was a hub of imagination and creativity. They were often in their own bubble, a world that had its own sayings, including one that would influence the title of Rizwan’s show. “My mum used this phrase: ‘When life gives you mangoes, make mango juice,’” he smiles. “She genuinely thought that was the phrase. So I thought that, too. When the Lemonade album came out, I assumed Beyoncé had got it wrong.”As a teenager, Rizwan made comedy home videos, which he’d upload to YouTube. He soon noticed that the videos that co-starred his mum, a former child actor in Pakistan, would get the most views. Eventually, Rizwan received a call from a Bollywood producer asking to speak to her. “So, weirdly, she came full circle and she got to act again.”While his mum was continuing with her acting dream, Rizwan eschewed university in favour of working and going to an arts college. It was during a trip to the Edinburgh fringe that he realised alternative comedy was his calling. “It opens your eyes,” he says of the festival. “I did Edinburgh fringe eight years in a row, in every kind of dingy venue you can think of: corridors, buses, toilets, on a dancefloor shouting over the Vengaboys. It taught me how to play to any kind of audience.” He mentions one punter who threw a Subway sandwich at him: “It was 10pm – what were they even doing having dinner that late?” The early standup version of Juice would often find Rizwan reflecting on his long and winding journey to success (one of his first acting roles involved him dressed as SpongeBob, handing out flyers at a shopping centre), while comparing it to his family’s, particularly his mum’s, almost accidental career ascension.View image in fullscreen‘I took the scenic route’ … Rizwan in Juice.Photograph: BBC/Various Artists LimitedAs he climbed the standup ranks, when he was 24, Rizwan presented a documentary for the BBC called How Gay Is Pakistan? in which he explored queer life in his birth country. “I was trying to process a lot at that point,” he says. “But also a part of me was just trying to get it out of the way. The two most obvious things in terms of identity the industry kept telling me about were my queerness and my Pakistaniness. So it was a way of doing something that was super brash and bold and saying: ‘Well, there you go’. Also it was me trying to understand a part of the world and a part of my history that I felt I wasn’t given access to.” He pauses. “And I thought: Well, let’s do that on taxpayers’ money!” He recognises it was helpful to a lot of people, but says he won’t go back to documentaries: “I definitely enjoy the nuances and subtleties I’m able to have in scripts, over a documentary that sometimes feels heavy-handed.”‘It’s cheap therapy, innit!’: comedian Mawaan Rizwan on family, adulthood  and his brilliant new TV seriesRead moreJuice is full of big themes such as identity, class and social mobility, but its presentation keeps things light, smuggling in topics such as abandonment via a plotline involving a parent rental site called DaddyDays4LonelyGays.com (sadly not real). Every moment of pathos is spiked by a visual gag or a surreal tangent, which makes the whole thing more moving. “Juice was the first show where I combined the clowning and the physicality and the dance and the songs and the singing and the vulnerable stories and the confessional stuff,” Rizwan says. “It somehow all just worked.”The use of the past tense, plus series two’s neatly wrapped final episode, leads to an obvious final question: will there be a Juice series three? Rizwan sighs. He says he’s keen to focus on music next, and not just comedy songs but something more serious. Besides, he’s too tired to think about the future and would rather sit in the moment for a bit. “It was a fucking long journey, man,” he says of his career, cocktail now drained. “I took the scenic route and it’s made me a better artist for it.”Season two of Juice startson18Septemberon BBC iPlayer and BBC Three.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTaskmasterDoctor WhoTV comedyComedyinterviewsShareReuse this content"

She is wearing a gold‑trimmed, blusher-pink, kaftan-style caped dress and has a wide smudge of neon-blue eyeshadow streaked across her eyelids. She could have freshly twirled off the dancefloor at Studio 54. It is a strong look for a late afternoon chat in a quiet hotel, but then I remember that she has been at a photoshoot all day, and assume she must still be wearing one of the outfits. “These are my own clothes,” she says, as if that should have been perfectly obvious.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.To be fair, Ellis-Bextor is throwing a party later, so she has made an effort. She’s hosting a playback of her new album Perimenopop, which is also very disco, so much so that Chic’s Nile Rodgers is on one of the tracks. During the Covid lockdowns in 2020, the pop star hosted a weekly Kitchen Disco, broadcast live on Instagram from her family home, with her husband, the musician Richard Jones, and with occasional cameos from her five sons. People must think she’s pretty good at throwing a party. “Well, I am capable,” she says, drily. There will be a photo booth. Aptly, the bar already has a giant glitter ball hanging from the ceiling.As a title, Perimenopop is both silly and defiant. It came from a joke in the studio between Ellis-Bextor and her friend Hannah Robinson, who co-writes some of her songs. “We’re a similar age,” she says, “and so we were jokingly saying: oh, it’s perimenopop. And we thought it was hilarious. It just didn’t leave my head.” It’s a showy, attention-grabbing name. “I think I’m in my sod-it era, really. What’s the point of tiptoeing around?”I stretched myself out like a cat, letting the music lift me and letting it make me feel betterView image in fullscreenShirt and skirt: bothRejina Pyo. Shoes:Christian LouboutinShe is 46 now. As she gets older, she is growing much more comfortable in her own skin. “Just shaking off a lot of the peripheral worries of stuff,” she says. She started planning her return to dance music in 2021, having been reminded by the lockdown Kitchen Discos just how much music and dancing can lift the spirits. “Music is often a cape that I will shroud myself in, to boost me up a bit,” she says. She wrote Perimenopop – wall-to-wall bangers, mostly about enjoying life – at home, in comfort, working in the daytime, eating dinner with her family at night. “I stretched myself out like a cat, letting the music lift me and letting it make me feel better.”Perimenopop arrives at a time when perimenopause is slowly becoming part of the cultural landscape, fromBridget Christie’sunderrated Channel 4 comedyThe Change, toMiranda July’sliterary juggernautAll Fours. “I do feel so grateful to all of the women who have made it more of a conversation,” she says. “I was working with someone the other day, just met her, and she was like, ‘Oh, I’m having a hot flush – perimenopause.’” Once, that was a conversation Ellis-Bextor thinks she might have had with her mum, but not with her friends. “Now, there’s much more transparency. Thank goodness. There’s just so much less mystery, and more help for people who need it.”And what about her own experience of it? “It’s funny, because when I said to my mum about the album, she said: ‘You do realise in interviews that they’re going to ask you about it?’” She laughs. “I feel like I’m just on the cusp [of it], really. Maybe in the first room. I don’t know how many rooms there are! But it’s chats that my girlfriends and I have been having.”Many of her friends are women she has known since they were at school together, and they are coming to the party tonight. In a lot of ways,Ellis-Bextor is overdue a celebration. She has been a household name since the turn of the century, when an early career as an indie singer collapsed and led her, inadvertently, to the housey pop of the song Groovejet (If This Ain’t Love), which became an international hit. For years, alongside music, she has done the celebrity circuit, appearing on the likes of Strictly Come Dancing and The Masked Singer. She has a podcast, Spinning Plates, in which she interviews mothers who also work. When the BBC needed a New Year’s Eve host, as 2024 rolled into 2025, they got her to throw everyone a party. She has become the nation’s smart, fun big sister. But her music career has undergone a resurgence on a massive scale, too. It’s not that she ever stopped making records – Perimenopop is her eighth studio album – but in 2024 her other megahit, Murder on the Dancefloor, first released at the end of 2001, became one of the biggest pop songs in the world.View image in fullscreen‘It’s exciting when you have the twists in the road and new experiences.’ Jumpsuit:Meandem. Shoes:Christian LouboutinIt had made a splashy appearance in the Emerald Fennell filmSaltburn, soundtracking the now infamous scene in which Barry Keoghan’s character dances through a country house, nude as the day he was born. Ellis-Bextor saw Saltburn – andthatscene – for the first time at a private screening in London, at 10am, with a lot of her family in tow: “My oldest boy, my mum, my brother, his then very new girlfriend, my husband.” A friend had warned her that it was “quite extreme. I’m like, come on,” she laughs. “But, yeah, it was!”Ellis-Bextor and Jones were flown to LA to DJ at the premiere, and afterwards a couple of her friends told her that she was on the verge of becoming a thing. “One of those things where the song goes everywhere. And I was like: I really don’t think so. Let’s not lose our heads.” But by the end of 2024 ithadbeen everywhere, becoming the biggest song of the year by a British female artist, 20 years after it first came out.It’s hardly like you’re at retirement age, I say, but, still, was the song’s belated success surprising, given that pop is so often characterised as a young person’s game? She politely rebuffs me. “Part of what I loved about disco was that a lot of the vocalists were telling stories and singing songs from a point of experience. OK, they could be cautionary tales, they could be stories that were the other side of heartache, but they weren’t all anchored in youth culture.” Then there’s social media. Her oldest son is 21 and tells her that on TikTok nobody cares about the age of the person singing the song, or how old the song is, “if it means something true”.In the heat of the Murder on the Dancefloor revival, last year was “quite a giddy time of my life”, but Ellis‑Bextor has been a professional musician since she was 16. “This year will be 30 years since my first gig,” she points out. “So the years are there, and I’m really into that. I like experience.” A few years ago, when she wrote her autobiography, also called Spinning Plates, she said that she was happier at 42 than she had ever been before. How is it now, at 46? “Same, same. That’s nice!” she laughs. “I’m very content with what I have in my life. It’s exciting when you have the twists in the road and new experiences. But I am also very aware of how good I have it.”I’m happy to acknowledge and explore things that upset me or that hurtThe main impression I got from the book, and one not dimmed by meeting her in person, is that Ellis-Bextor is one of life’s great optimists. “I am very optimistic,” she nods. “I am my mother’s daughter.” Her mother, Janet Ellis, was a Blue Peter presenter who turned to writing novels in her 60s. Ellis-Bextor had a short-lived sideline in selling Blue Peter badges to her classmates when she was at primary school. “Shh! Not so loud!” she jokes. “I haven’t got any with me, I’m afraid.”She reconsiders the optimism question. “[I’m] apragmaticoptimist,” she says. “I’m happy to acknowledge and explore things that upset me or that hurt, but I’m quite good at framing things in a way that can make me feel good about stuff, ultimately.” Her music career, now spanning four decades, involves quite a lot of pragmatic optimism. I don’t want to say that she has been lucky – “There’s definitely been a lot of luck,” she interrupts, cheerfully – but there is a sense that a lot of things happened to her as if by chance. “Oh, 100%. Serendipity. But I suppose the trick is to be able to get the most out of these opportunities when they come your way.”As a teenager growing up in west London, Ellis‑Bextor thought she wanted to act, but music was her real love. She bought the NME and Melody Maker every week, and was obsessed with Britpop. At 16, she started going to an indie night in London called Popscene, “living for the weekend”, as she puts it, in her Rimmel Black Cherries lipstick, a 1995 staple. One night, she met a journalist from Melody Maker who passed her a note with a phone number on it and told her that his mate was looking for a singer. She recorded a tape of herself singing Oasis covers and handed it over the next night.That band was called Theaudience. For a brief moment, they were music press darlings. It must have given her whiplash to go from reading Melody Maker to being on the cover of it. “It was terrifying,” Ellis‑Bextor says now. “It was a baptism of fire, and I was a closet square, really. I felt like: oh my God, I’m not cool. I can’t keep up. I don’t fit in. And, of course, it turned out everybody was feeling a bit like that.” Theaudience had a moment, did OK, but they were signed to a major label, and OK wasn’t enough. They were dropped after their debut album, and the music press turned on them.  “It is hard to avoid the suspicion that she is part of some sly television exposé on how to get ahead in the music industry,” read one of the more vicious gig reviews from that time.“It’s hard, because you’re reading all the stuff about you that you’re worried is how people think about you, so …” She laughs. “As a teenage girl, it’s not ideal.” But, of course, she has found the positives. “The good news is: it definitely built up a kind of resilience!”When Theaudience got dropped, she thought it was all over. “I was like, oh my God, I’ve already had the highest high already, and I’m not even 20. Now, for the rest of my life, I’m going to be this tragic person who’ll say: ‘I had a record deal once when I was 18.’” Why did she feel she could plough on, when others might have walked away? “I just didn’t have anything else I felt I could do,” she shrugs. Then serendipity intervened once again. She recorded a speculative vocal for a dance track that turned into Spiller’s Groovejet (If This Ain’t Love), even though she kept saying that she didn’t like dance music. “I was just a proper indie kid!” she protests. Obviously, she loves it now. “I remember thinking: Melody Maker and NME won’t even know I’ve done this, and then they won’t be bruising me, because it’s a whole different world.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But I think also, because I’d had the failure with the band, I was probably just a little bit less of a brat than I might have been.”She met her husband when they were both 22. Jones was auditioning for her band (he would go on to form the Feeling), and when he joined her on the road they became firm friends. Both were in other relationships at the time, but after a while their mutual attraction was obvious. They celebrated their 20th wedding anniversary in June. They had only been seeing each other for a few weeks when Ellis-Bextor discovered she was pregnant. Her first solo album had just come out and she had become a target for the tabloids. That whole time was “freaky”, she says, because when she was in Theaudience nobody ever really knew who she was. Then all of a sudden, after Groovejet, she would be recognised in the street. “And that was simultaneous with phone hacking, so I just thought that being known, in that era, meant that you didn’t have any ownership over information. It just was so normal to me.”Before she had told her friends that she was pregnant, her press officer called her to ask if it was true, and to let her know that the papers were running the story the next day. At the time, she brushed off the tabloid intrusion. “I just thought that was what happened. But now I’m like, God, that is outrageous.” For a moment, she looks almost appalled. Their relationship was so new that they hadn’t yet said I love you. They didn’t move in with each other until two weeks before Sonny was born. But still, she finds a silver lining. “It’s OK. I was just starting out with Richard. I was falling in love with him. So there’s lots of reasons to be cheerful, but I do look back and think it’s pretty outrageous, really.”She only learned that she had been a victim of phone hacking many years later, when the police got in touch to let her know. For a long time, she let it lie. “I thought, I don’t want to dredge up any negativity. I’m happy. I’ve got my young family. I don’t need to dwell on something.” But eventually she pursued, andreceived, a settlementfrom the Mirror Group. “I did actually want to be a tiny little thorn in their side, even if only for a split second. I was happy being a little, tiny, teeny pest, even if that’s all I’ve got.” She doesn’t remember the details, she adds, because she was having a baby at the time. “Who’s now 13, so it’s quite a while ago.”She pauses. “Ithinkit was that baby?” I laugh. “Sorry. I was definitely having a baby, and I’m pretty sure it was him.” After all, she has had five of them. She starts to giggle. “Sometimes I’ve got baby pictures and I don’t know which one it is! I don’t remember whose first word was what.” Her youngest is six; her eldest 21. I ask if that means she’s really good at it now, a well-oiled machine. “I don’t know about that, because they’re all individuals. They’ve all got a slightly different relationship with me. I don’t think it’s like, ‘Now I present you with Mother 5.0.’”People are often fascinated by the fact that she has five boys. During her fourth and fifth pregnancies, strangers would tell her that she must be wishing for a girl. “Sometimes you’d get some bore sat next to you at one of those dinners, where you don’t know them, and they’d be like, ‘Oh, how terrible, you have sons.’ I just think people have got quite narrow ideas sometimes.” She is careful to point out that she doesn’t actually consider this to be a big issue. “This is small fry, really. It’s more an occasional lack of imagination than an everyday problem.” Somehow, in her lightness, she manages to sound even more scathing.View image in fullscreen‘In some ways, I think I’m better at being in my 40s than in my 20s.’ Cardigan:Stella McCartneyBut, in the current climate, there has been an increasing interest in what it’s like to raise boys. “It’s definitely become more of a topic recently,” she says, but she shuts it down before it can get going. “It’s a bit clickbaity, isn’t it? It only makes me feel sad, because my children are five really interesting, lovely people, and I don’t really like the idea of their imagined characters being skewed into something for that.”One of the things she has learned from doing her podcast, in which she has long conversations with other mothers, is how to talk about her job with her children. “I don’t diminish it any more. I used to be very apologetic about work. I’d make it tiny.” She puts on a quiet, squeaky voice: “I’ve got to go and do this thing, I wish I didn’t have to, I’ll be as quick as I can, I’d rather be here.” That just isn’t the truth. She loves what she does, and after the lockdowns, especially, she realised how much she needs to perform to feel like herself. Now, when she goes somewhere, she talks about it differently. “I say to the kids, ‘This matters to me. I like what I do. Don’t worry, I’ll be back soon. But I’ve worked really hard to get these opportunities’ – that kind of thing. So I think I frame it better.”In 2013, Ellis-Bextor appeared on Strictly Come Dancing, getting through to the final week. In her book, she was candid about the strain that it put on her relationship with Jones. He gave her permission to write about the fact that he sought counselling when she was on the show, to help him cope with anxiety it triggered about their relationship. “I thought that was really brave of him,” she says. “But, look, it wasn’t like he thought I was going to run off.” It was more than 10 years ago, she points out, a little wearily. “But he felt like it wasn’t involving him. And then, because he was seeing us experiencing things separately, it shook something. He was worried about it.” Every time they went out, she said, people would joke about the so-called curse of Strictly, in which the celebrities and their dance partners supposedly fall for each other. “And I think it just started to wear him down a little bit.”Jones worked through it and was supportive of her time on the show, but Ellis-Bextor was an early critic of some aspects of Strictly, writing about how she felt the contestants were not always well supported psychologically. Is it fair to say that she wasn’t surprised when allegations of unacceptable behaviour emerged in 2024? “I only know what I witnessed on my year,” she says. “I made some really good friends out of it, and I loved doing the dancing, but I think they should have been checking in, because I was seeing real relationships changing and people breaking up.” The programme should have taken that more seriously, she thinks.David Byrne, Little Simz, Jasmine.4.t and more: the best music of autumn 2025Read moreShe calls it “an extraordinary, heady chapter. I think maybe some of the things I spoke about in the book aren’t seen as exotic any more, because more people have contributed to [talking about] the things I experienced.” She wrote that, at times, doing the show was “too intimate, too intense”, and that contestants were, back then at least, separated from family and friends. She practically pinpointed what the show needed to change, long before they agreed to change it, I suggest. “And they’ve done it. All good: chapter closed!” she says, sunnily.Ellis-Bextor has work to do. She is about to swoop off again, to get ready for her Perimenopop party, and before the guests arrive she has to record some clips for Instagram, twirling around in the pink dress, lip‑syncing to her new single. She mentions a conversation that she had recently, with a man who is 20 years older than her, who suggested she take all of August off, as she’s had such a busy year. She asked him how he had felt in his 40s, and he told her that he had felt driven. “And I said: that’s where I’m at. I think that’s not always expected. In some ways, I think I’m better at being in my 40s than in my 20s.” I wonder what the difference is. “I think you’ve curated your life a little bit more. You’re not trying things out for the first time, but doing the things that you know work for you.”What’s next, then, I say: Menopop? She laughs. “Oh my God. Imagine! I’m already getting so many people contacting me, saying: I run this menopause help thing …” But she gets serious for a minute. “What’s next? I don’t know. But I don’t think you should do what I do, if you like knowing what happens next.” This, from the woman whose 20-year-old song has just been a huge global hit again. “Yeah,” she says, smiling. “That doesn’t work.”Perimenopop is out nowExplore more on these topicsSophie Ellis-BextorPop and rockSaltburnfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Either way, the venue’s vast arena and cavernous dome tend to loom large. Then there are those rare, astonishing performances that seem untouched by basic matters of physics: performances that take flight instantly and apparently without effort from the monumental Victorian architecture, conjuring a space entirely their own – ephemeral and miraculous – for as long as they last.TheSinfonia of London’s concert on the penultimate night of the 2025 Proms season was one such performance. A frenetic ascending scale, an immediate gathering of forces into a single, razor-sharp motif, a precipitous tumble to bounce on the timpani – and we were off, violins airborne with one ofRichard Strauss’s most joyfully propulsive melodies. This wasn’t just a vivid, high-definition reading of a familiar score: Strauss’s tone poem Don Juan sounded as if it had been made to measure. Woodwind solos were lithe and spacious, the strings glossy, the lower brass fixed in the crosshairs.Such performances are far from effortless, of course. Sinfonia of London is a handpicked crack team of other orchestras’ finest players, but it is conductor John Wilson’s weapons-grade energy levels and his ear for tiny, transformative details that are essential to its success. As if more evidence were needed that, just four years since itslive debut, Wilson has made this orchestra one of the UK’s best,Leonard Bernstein’s Serenade featuringviolinist James Ehnesboasted a vast colour palette, from ambivalent nattiness via melancholy, diaphanous textures to vibrant surges of strings. Ehnes was an ideal musical interlocutor: entirely poised, his tone lucid, even as the ringleader of the final movement’s urbanely folksy dance.But there’s no orchestral showcase like Ravel’s Daphnis and Chloe, the ballet score performed here in its entirety. From the barely audible hum of its opening to the blistering release of its frenzied final bars, via iridescent flute solos and interjections from the finely blended Sinfonia of London Chorus, the score seemed entirely malleable in Wilson’s constantly moving hands, his dynamism utterly contagious.Listen again on BBC Soundsuntil 12 OctoberExplore more on these topicsProms 2025Classical musicPromslive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

The line suggests a gulf between the Swedish dark tragedian and English light comedian but the dramatists have a curious affinity.August Strindberg’s Creditors (1889) and Coward’s Private Lives (1930) both start in hotels where a troubled couple is haunted by a former marriage. It’s unclear if the influence was conscious but, if so, would have been apposite. Strindberg identified his drama as a “tragicomedy”, the genre in which, as Blakemore recognised, Coward is increasingly seen to belong.This revival by Tom Littler (an accomplished Coward and Strindberg director) finds both the gasps and guffaws in Creditors, through a darkly sardonic version (from a literal translation by Agnes Broomé) by Howard Brenton, himself a tragicomic playwright, whose superb Churchill in Moscow was recently directed by Littler at this cramped but dynamicOrange Tree theatre.Adolf, a twitchy artist exhibiting signs of physical and mental illness, is working on a clay model of a naked woman in the hotel parlour when interrupted by Gustaf, a fellow guest who has become a rather coercive mentor, having, through a fierce critique, turned Adolf from painting to sculpture. Gustaf also encourages the other man to talk about his wife, Tekla, a novelist who wrote a book fictionalising her “idiot” ex-husband and has taken a holiday from the holiday after a row over her alleged flirtations. She will soon return and Gustaf coaches Adolf in what to do and say. We sense that, as smoothly and ruthlessly as the Marquise in Les Liaisons Dangereuses, Gustaf is setting traps and, by the time Tekla comes in, suspect Gustaf’s identity and mission.A sense of event comes from the reunion of Charles Dance, Geraldine James and Nicholas Farrell four decades after their performances in ITV’s indelible The Jewel in the Crown. Back on stage after an absence of 17 years, Dance remains a magnetic presence, eyes flashing with amusement and menace between barked half laughs. In the difficult part of Adolf, a stooge and fool, Farrell makes the man pathetic in the classical sense of eliciting sympathy rather than the modern inference of contemptuous.Modern audiences can understandably have a problem with the misogyny that may have been present in Strindberg and is certainly there in Gustaf, who claims that a naked woman looks like an incomplete man. But the warm, engaging Tekla of James mitigates this issue by suggesting that the woman has been slandered by both men. In the final reckoning with Gustaf, she becomes clearly the moral centre of the piece.Exploring how people use each other up in love and art, this Creditors – the title encapsulating Strindberg’s grim metaphor of relationships as a series of loans to be noted and eventually collected – leaves us in debt to Littler, Brenton and the remarkable cast.This chilling portrait of private lives deserves a long public one.At Orange Tree theatre, London, until 11 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTheatreOrange Tree theatreAugust StrindbergreviewsShareReuse this content"

It begins with a flight to Guyana, in comic mode, and travels towards themes of trauma, motherhood and healing that bring broad-brush dialogue, therapy-speak and earnestness.The women are on their way to the Caribbean island to scatter the ashes of Elaine – Joyce’s mother and Erica’s grandmother. Together they comprise three generations of British Guyanese women who have had to go it alone, from work to child-rearing to financial and emotional support. It examines the cost of that but also how daughters misunderstand, and misjudge, their mothers.Both actors are at ease on stage. Wright is most magnetic while Rosheuvel is heartwarming and playful, albeit emotionally impenetrable to her daughter, even at her character’s most vulnerable.It is energetically directed by Lynette Linton, who is co-creator along with Dennis-Edwards, while Alex Berry’s set pulses with light, sound and projection as the story zooms across memories and time-frames.Mother and daughter are chalk-and-cheese with an amusingly antsy repartee at first: Joyce seems to be living her Shirley Valentine dreams as she kicks back, eyes up the waiter and hits the booze while Erica glowers at her judgingly and reassesses her own relationship to alcohol.The gulf between them has a history of secret anguish which emerges from beneath the humour, but without enough emotional intricacy or depth. Flashbacks to private sadness, depression and loss are well-enacted, in quick temporal switches, but they are too brief, with a repetition of ideas and lines through the play.Both actors switch between playing Elaine and versions of their own character at different ages, but the story brings plot-points that do not amount to much – the discovery of a long lost father that goes nowhere and an early memory for Joyce that haunts her but remains opaque until the end.This venue has had a spate of charismatic two-handers under Linton’s leadership such as The P Word and Shifters. This does not have the same alchemy, despite its central, dynamic duo, whose performances outshine the play.At Bush theatre, London, until 1 NovemberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

But sometimes it’s also wonderful to see lovely dancing set to beautiful music. And London City Ballet, the company revived last year after an almost 30 year hiatus, delivers it.Take Liam Scarlett’s Consolations and Liebestraum from 2009. It helps that it opens with Alina Cojocaru, one of the world’s superlative ballerinas, who is always able to make your heart quietly leap, your breath still for a moment. The Liszt score, played live by Reina Okada, is longingly romantic but sets in train dancing with no schmaltz, unspooling threads of steps that are swift but unhurried: turn and lift, turn and lift in fluid swirl.Scarlett’s later career became mired in controversyand he took his own life in 2021; this is a reminder of the superiority of his craftsmanship.A new commission, Soft Shore by Paris Opera Ballet’s Florent Melac, is easy on the eye and ear too, but suffers from being too close in mood to Scarlett’s piece. The second highlight of the programme is Alexei Ratmansky’s Pictures at an Exhibition. The famous Mussorgsky score was inspired by Viktor Hartmann’s paintings, but the backdrop here has projections of Kandinsky’s colourful circles. Again for solo piano, the music is illustrative, almost comical at points with a heavy, lurching melody, but Ratmansky’s response is not always the obvious – there is brightness and zing – and we are absorbed into the dance’s world. Joseph Taylor (formerly of Northern Ballet) gets a fantastic angry solo against a vivid red canvas; Constance Devernay-Laurence, another former principal with a large company (Scottish Ballet) emits the assurance only experience can bring.Part of London City Ballet’s remit is to revive forgotten works by great choreographers. Here it’s George Balanchine’s Haieff Divertimento from 1947, never before seen in the UK. It has Balanchine signatures a-plenty: the practice-wear costumes; the clarity of individual steps, as if watching a ballet class; the idiosyncratic style of jutting hips and off-centre weight. Dancers train for years to absorb Balanchine’s technique and this is not a Balanchine company – although Cuban dancer Alejandro Virelles does a lovely combination of lightness and authority that’s very in keeping – but it’s a pleasure to see the work unearthed nonetheless.Until 14 September; New Theatre Oxford, 11 November; York Theatre Royal, 14-15 NovemberExplore more on these topicsBalletDanceSadler's WellsAlina CojocarureviewsShareReuse this content"

He was 86.Hart died at his home inLos Angeles, according to his friend and co-author Glenn Ballantyne. He had been in poor health since breaking his hip last year.Boyce and Hart were a prolific and successful team in the mid-1960s, especially for the Monkees, themade-for-televisiongroup promoted by Don Kirshner. They wrote the Monkees’ theme song, with its opening shot, “Here we come, walkin’ down the street,” and enduring chant, “Hey, hey, we’re the Monkees,” and their first No 1 hit, Last Train to Clarksville. The Monkees’ eponymous, million-selling debut album included six songs from Boyce and Hart, who also served as producers and used their own backing musicians, the Candy Store Prophets, as session players.“I always credit them not only with writing many of our biggest hits, but, as producers, being instrumental in creating the unique Monkee sound we all know and love,” the Monkees’Micky Dolenzwrote in a foreword to Hart’s memoir, Psychedelic Bubble Gum, published in 2015.‘It was not a boyband!’ Micky Dolenz on the madness of being in the MonkeesRead moreAs Boyce and Hart grew in fame and the Monkees took more control of their work, they pursued their own careers, releasing the albums Test Patterns and I Wonder What She’s Doing Tonite? and appearing on such sitcoms as I Dream of Jeannie” and Bewitched. They also were politically active. They campaigned for Robert F Kennedy when he ran for president in 1968 and wrote the brassy “LUV (Let Us Vote)“ in support of the 26th amendment, which in 1971 lowered the voting age from 21 to 18. Their other songs included the Monkees’ melancholy I Wanna Be Free and the theme to the daytime soap opera Days of Our Lives.They were covered by everyone from Dean Martin (Little Lovely One) to the Sex Pistols ((I’m Not Your) Steppin’ Stone).In the 1970s and 80s, Hart managed several hits with other collaborators and even contributed material to another TV act, the Partridge Family. He worked with Austin Roberts on Over You, an Oscar-nominated ballad performed by Betty Buckley in Tender Mercies, and with Dick Eastman on My Secret (Didja Gitit Yet?) for New Edition. He and Bryce toured with Dolenz and fellow MonkeeDavy Jonesin the 70s, put out the album Dolenz, Jones, Boyce & Hart and received renewed attention when the Monkees enjoyed a comeback in the 1980s.Boyce, who died in 1994, and Hart were the subjects of a 2014 documentary The Guys Who Wrote ’Em. Hart was married twice, most recently to singer MaryAnn Hart, and had two children from his first marriage.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

In his memoir, he remembered himself as a shy kid with a “strong desire to distinguish” himself, as he wrote in Psychedelic Bubble Gum. Music was the answer. By high school, he had learned piano, guitar and the Hammond B-3 organ. He also started his own amateur radio station, eventually adding a console, turntables and microphones. After graduating from high school and serving in the army reserves, he settled in Los Angeles in the late 1950s, hoping first to become a disc jockey, but soon working as a songwriter and session musician. His name shortened to Bobby Hart, he toured as a member of Teddy Randazzo & the Dazzlers, and with Randazzo and Bobby Weinstein wrote Hurt So Bad, a hit for Little Anthony and the Imperials later covered by Linda Ronstadt.He also befriended Boyce, a singer and songwriter from Charlottesville, Virginia, with a “very unusual personality, spontaneous and extroverted, yet very cool at the same time”. Boyce and Hart helped write the top 10 hit Come A Little Bit Closer for Jay & the Americans and were a strong enough combination that Kirshner recruited them for his Screen Gems songwriting factory: they were assigned to the Monkees. Asked to come up with songs for a quartet openly modeled on the Beatles, they devised a twangy guitar line similar to the one for Paperback Writer and wrote Last Train to Clarksville, a chart topper in 1966. When Kirshner suggested a song with a girl’s name in the title, they turned out Valleri and reached the top five.For the show’s theme song, a stroll outside was enough.“Boyce began strumming his guitar and I joined in by snapping my fingers & making noises with my mouth that simulated an open & closed hi-hat cymbal,” Hart wrote in his memoir. “We had created the perfect recipe for inspiration and started singing about just what we were doing: ‘Walkin’ down the street.’”Explore more on these topicsLos AngelesThe MonkeesCaliforniaWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

He came to my Blue Note club night in London a few times when it was very underground and he could be left alone. Then he’d come to the studio, where he’d sing through a haze of cigarette smoke like a gorilla in the mist, or I’d take him to see Dillinja in Brixton to hear drum’n’bass, or we’d spend time in his trailer on the Isle of Man set for the film Everybody Loves Sunshine and he’d sit there doing crochet. His thinking was that of an alchemist – he wanted to saturate himself in everything because he knew that inspiration could come from anywhere. He once said to me: “Golds, did you know Michelangelo said that when you blow the dust off a piece of marble, the sculpture’s there inside”? That thought stayed with me.I hope the archive has some of his interviews, especially this one where he talks about DJ culture, the internet and what it’s going to mean: everyone having access to music and the general saturation. Nobody else understood the change that was coming like he did. He said things about it like: “Treat this thing like a velvet claw. It’s very soft and passionate on your skin, but it can cut you like a knife.”Natalie Merchant –Freddie Burretti’s costumes(1972-74)View image in fullscreenOne of Bowie’s  Ziggy Stardust costumes, designed by Freddie Burretti.Photograph: Richard Davis/V&A, LondonVisits to museum-library collections rank high on my list of peak experiences. I’d always imagined the poet Emily Dickinson as deep in thought or mourning or enraptured. Then at the Emily Dickinson museum I saw her favourite white cotton house dress: something meant for cleaning house or baking bread, and for all her forceful words issued on paper, the dress revealed that she was a thin-boned tiny bird of a woman, even smaller than me. I have a feeling the Freddie Burretti costumes would give me a similar insight about Bowie.When I was a 14-year-old kid growing up in rural New York State, someone gave me a copy of The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars and it delivered me entirely to another place. On the back cover, Bowie wore a quilted suit with a geometric pattern, a tight fitted jacket unzipped to the waist and matching trousers. He was otherworldly, cocky, dangerously hip, androgynous, provocative. Burretti’s fabulous costumes during the Ziggy Stardust to Diamond Dogs cycle refined Bowie’s androgynous glitter god persona. If I couldn’t have access to them all, I’d settle for some time alone with thaticonic album cover suitthat played such an important part in my adolescent awakening.Anthony Szmieriek – Freddie Burretti’s Ziggy Stardust costume (1972)As a teenager I found The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust in the bottom of a wardrobe. It’s one of the only things I have of my dad’s – a man I never knew but at least we share a taste in music. For me, this Ziggy costume is about collaboration, trust and bravery. A conversation in a London club [El Sombrero] with designer Freddie Buretti created an androgynous science fiction figure, the first of Bowie’s iconic characters inside a kind of time lord. Bowie’s marriage of music, fashion and art felt so beguiling and eternal that his passing almost felt like another transformation. I’d love to spend time with this costume to understand how that was possible, how it started and what it would lead to.Moby –Hamburg gig poster(1978)When David and I lived opposite each other in New York he would sometimes call up and say: “Hey, do you wanna come over and play guitar or piano on this song?” One night as I was leaving the apartment he shared with Iman, going down this very fancy hallway filled with art, he shouted: “Hold on – I want you to have this” and gave me his black fedora hat. When I rewatched him in the film The Hunger recently I thought: “Hey, there’s my hat!” For years it went missing, I presumed stolen by the crack addicts I’d invite back to my apartment at the end of the night when I was still going hard with liquor and drugs.Two house moves later I was in LA unpacking some boxes and there was theDavid Bowiemagic hat. I’m so glad to have it back, but otherwise the Bowie artefact I’d most like to spend time with is this poster for a gig in Hamburg in 1978. There’s a drawn self-portrait and underneath are some of his records: Low, “Heroes”, ChangesOneBowie and Space Oddity. In terms of a moment in time, you can’t do any better. I’d love to be able to go back to 1978 and see him performing songs from those records and Station to Station, my favourite Bowie album.Peter Murphy, Bauhaus –Ola Hudson, Giorgio Armani and Browns’ Thin White Duke costume(1976)View image in fullscreenReturning … David Bowie’s Thin White Duke costume.Photograph: Richard Davis/V&A, LondonThe first time I saw David in this outfit was in a news article announcing that he had “arrived on UK soil”, which was a thing then. Then the concert at Wembley was an unforgettable experience. This period was a move away from his decadent years and he was trying to clean up, which was reflected in the outfit: clean cut, white shirt and trousers, black waistcoat, slick hairdo. I’d also choose [to see] one of Bowie’s notebooks containing his handwritten lyrics, sketches or fragments of thought. Those pages are where his worlds first took shape, so to spend time with those would feel like being allowed into his head, to witness the beginnings of what would affect the lives of so many.Hamish Hawk –photograph by Paul McAlpine, Serious Moonlight tour(1983)It’s near impossible to pick just one item from such an inspiring collection but I was surprisingly drawn to this one. There’s a pristine, tailored aspect to it where he’s wearing this lovely suit with the perfectly untied necktie, but the live recordings from that tour are wild and unpredictable. It’s so immaculately presented yet he uses what was by then an incredible suite of songs as the basis for experimentation. This is all the different eras of Bowie in one photo. He’d just become a megastar but the photo captures a human look, as if he’s wondering: “Is everyone enjoying it?” But on the other hand he is absolutely in command, looking cooler than he ever has.Roddy Woomble, Idlewild –Labyrinth crystal ball(1985)View image in fullscreenCasting a spell …Bowie’s crystal ball from the movie Labyrinth.Photograph: David Parry/V&A, LondonI remember watching Labyrinth when I was eight years old and my mother telling me: “That’s a musician called David Bowie.” To me he was always Jareth, the king of the goblins, a sort of child-catcher figure who gazes into this crystal ball. It wasn’t until much later that I saw a video of Live Aid and realised who he was. Then in my teens I started listening to his records and loved them all. I still find it hard to compute that the same person could do Under Pressure with Queen and shapeshift into the king of the goblins in the same period, but that’s how transformative he was – and nobody did it better.The Anchoress –EMS Synthi AKS synthesiser used on Low, ‘Heroes’ and Lodger(1977)View image in fullscreenUnpacking the future of pop … EMS Synthi AKS synthesiser used by Brian Eno and David Bowie for ‘Heroes’, Low and Lodger.Photograph: Olivia Singleton/V&A, LondonUntil I first heard this synth on Low, I’d only known Bowie as the writer of hit songs such as Life on Mars and Changes, which my parents would play over Sunday lunch. The more esoteric, experimental, Berlin-era Bowie was a version I could claim for my own. My fascination with analogue synths started there and Brian Eno’s synths on those albums fundamentally shaped me as a producer and artist. I’ve been lucky enough to recently get to work with Pete Townshend’s incredible collection of vintage synths as I’m making a new album. But getting to see the one that started it all for me would be priceless.Joe Elliott, Def Leppard – Life on Mars handwritten lyrics (1971)View image in fullscreenApproaching star … David Bowie’s draft lyrics for Life on Mars.Photograph: Geoff Pugh/ShutterstockI’ve got enough Bowie posters to keep me happy for the rest of my life and his clothing wouldn’t fit me, so I’d love to have or get close to the lyrics to Life on Mars. Taken out of the context of his entire body of work, it stands out as a beacon of brilliance. The lyrics would look great above my jukebox next to my original lyrics of Marc Bolan’s One Inch Rock.The David Bowie archiveopens at the David Bowie Centre at the V&A East Storehouse, Londonon 13 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsDavid BowieV&AfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Share the story of your sex life, anonymouslyAs told toOlivia LadanyiSun 14 Sep 2025 06.00 EDTShareGrace, 33“We’ve been getting to know each other and building intimacy in bursts of a few weeks at a timeTheo and I have friends in common, and we slept together casually in our early 20s. After I moved abroad, we lost touch. Nine years later, in 2023, we fell for each other. I was on holiday by myself in Spain, and he replied to a thirst trap I’d posted, saying he was going to be in the same region. We went back to my hotel after dinner and had Negroni-fuelled, animalistic sex. In my 20s, I was self-conscious about my body and inexperienced, but by my 30s I was much more confident in myself, my skills and my body.We’ve been in a long-distance relationship for the past year and a half, getting to know each other and building intimacy in bursts of a few weeks at a time, either on holiday or when he comes to visit me.If I’m feeling bloated, anxious or low in confidence, I find it harder to get in the moodThis summer, we lived together for three months and, apart from when I had thrush, had sex two or three times a week. I thought I had a high sex drive, but Theo’s is higher. He gets hard very quickly, whereas I need a build-up. If I’m feeling bloated, anxious or low in confidence, I find it harder to get in the mood. I lost my job recently, which affected my self-esteem, which then affected intimacy. We also had an abortion last year, which was difficult, but it brought us closer and forced us to have conversations – about kids and the future – that we hadn’t yet had.Theo is my first boyfriend, my best friend and the love of my life. I love how complimentary he is; he encourages me to look at my body in the mirror, telling me I’m beautiful. He makes me feel very safe, and I can be completely myself with him. Having that level of intimacy with someone for the first time feels very different to the sex I had in my 20s. I send him silly, ugly photos that I wouldn’t send to anybody else, and that playfulness translates into our sex life.This is the first serious relationship for both of us, so we’re learning together. As very independent people, we’re understanding how to commit to someone and to know ourselves better while being in a relationship, rather than losing the people we’ve spent decades becoming.Theo, 32“Because we don’t live in the same country, if it’s not really intense after we haven’t seen each other for a month, I worryGrace and I had an instant connection when we met at a festival in our 20s; it was as though we already knew each other. We had bizarre things in common, like her studying in the small town in Italy where my dad is from. I was attracted to her aura, her eyes, her warmth, and invited her to stay at my parents’ up north, where we slept together for the first time. I’d been single since I was 18, put off by commitment after what felt like an intense relationship for that age.Intimacy scared me; I prioritised my freedom and autonomy. Although sex with Grace was more intimate than other sex I was having, and she was someone I wanted to spend time with, not just have sex with, I wasn’t looking for anything serious at that time.Our relationship has existed in a space that isn’t reality – on holiday and at festivalsWhen we reconnected a couple of years ago, I’d spent a long time being avoidant. When I didn’t address where our relationship was going, or my flights to visit her were delayed or cancelled, I worried Grace would still see me as the flaky, unreliable boy that I was when we first met, but she didn’t put pressure on me.Our relationship has existed in a space that isn’t reality – on holiday and at festivals – but tough moments have taught us more about each other. When we decided to have an abortion, we had to learn how to be vulnerable. Our intimacy has evolved, with long phone calls and intimate photos, which show she’s thinking about me.I’m very attracted to Grace and want to have sex with her four or five times a day. Because we don’t live in the same country, if it’s not really intense after we haven’t seen each other for a month, I worry about what it’s going to be like in 10 years when we have kids. But I need to be respectful of Grace’s libido too, its ebbs and flows. So I’m learning to ask myself, what makes her want to be in the mood?

It nearly wrecked our marriageAfter Jessica and I received expert counselling from the hit show Couples Therapy, I became public enemy number one. Here’s what didn’t make it to the screenBoris FishmanSun 14 Sep 2025 06.00 EDTShare“You are the reason women hate men,” a woman commented on one of my Instagram posts. “You don’t deserve Jessica, you schmuck,” another said in a direct message on Facebook. “I hope you’ve gotten the help you need and set your poor wife free,” wrote a third.I am a novelist who relishes connecting with his audience. That disposition has suffered. The reason: three months ago, the US network Showtime aired the latest season of the documentary seriesCouples Therapy, on which my wife Jessica and I appeared as one of the pairs.The series depicts four couples in 18 or so sessions of free therapy with Dr Orna Guralnik, a renowned New York psychoanalyst. The show is unscripted, and tries to avoid sensationalism. Participants are not paid, except for a modest stipend to cover childcare and transportation. The therapy takes place in a spacious office designed in the muted tones of the High Analyst style. The impression is that one is on New York’s Upper West Side rather than a recording studio in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. (The cameras are so invisible that it was always startling when, in the middle of one tear-filled testimonial or another, one heard discreet coughing on the other side of what suddenly sounded like very thin walls.) Though filming was always preceded by green-room small talk with the producers, we never crossed paths with the other couples.At a time of deep global division, many viewers seem to have found a way to agree that I may be the worst man in AmericaReportedly, millions of people watch the show, which airs on the BBC in the UK. At a time of deep global division, many of these viewers have found a way to agree that I may be the worst man in America – beyond redemption or, worse, understanding. “We ride at dawn for you, Jessica,” went a recent comment ona TikTok Jessica madein response to the show. It’s astonishing that tens of thousands of people debate the relationships on the programme with the intensity and detail that they do – so much so that some of them have been compelled to eviscerate me in direct messages. It’s surreal to have reams of strangers discussing your marriage with a certainty that has eluded you despite a decade of effort in the relationship itself.At the time we applied to be on Couples Therapy, Jessica and I had been arguing almost since we began dating in 2015. We met at a restaurant where I was moonlighting as a line cook and she as a singer, though I was a novelist and she owned a bookstore. Two weeks later, she called me from a Lakota Sioux kids’ camp, where she volunteered as a counsellor every summer, to say that the cook hadn’t shown up. The next day, I caught a flight to Denver.Our attraction and the magnificent conversations we had – hours at a time, at the restaurant, on the phone, by a campfire – made us wish to defy our radically dissimilar origins: a Jewish-Soviet immigrant from a family of boundary-crossers who couldn’t get his brain to slow down, and the easygoing daughter of a typically decorous Wasp family from Seattle. She wanted ferment, and I wanted serenity. We thought we could give that to each other. Instead, my bluntness made Jessica feel criticised, and Jessica’s reticence made it difficult for me to understand what she wanted. And yet, even on the hardest days, there remained a connection that felt too special to give up without trying everything. It was strained further by multiple relocations, but reinforced by the appearance of two children, now six and three.We applied because we had seen the opening season, which featured a couple who found their way to a better place thanks to Dr Guralnik. Also, couples counselling can cost $300-400 an hour, and $700 or more with someone like Dr Guralnik. That wasn’t money we had – I was a fiction writer, and Jessica was in the early stages of a career as a psychotherapist herself. Admittedly, it’s naive to give a TV show your most vulnerable self and expect nuance in return. But that’s what I counted on from a series that stakes its reputation on the idea of sincere inquiry, especially when the subject is as sensitive and complicated as marriage. Honestly, I wasn’t even thinking about this. I wanted to save my marriage. I was desperate for help.Instead, we became part of a shallow, confusing story of reductive characterisations and disappointing omissions. The therapy itself was so unhelpful, only increasing our conflict, that we quit after four sessions. But the lack of nuance became fully apparent only on the screen, after editing. (Jessica and I watched the episodes separately. I wasn’t planning on watching them, but the intensity of the online vitriol made it feel necessary.) Certainly, we failed to convey ourselves as articulately as we might have. But we told a clearer and more complicated story than the one that appeared onscreen.By including no fill-in to-camera interviews – presumably to distance Couples Therapy from the feel of a typical reality show – the film-makers set themselves a difficult task: to scrape together a coherent story without jumping around between sessions, and despite the fact that patients hardly tell a coherent story themselves. The cost of this, and not just in our segment, is a mess of unclarity.For instance, in the first episode, I begin to try to explain why one of our recent relocations, from Montana to New Jersey, has left me feeling as if our lives are much harder than they were. But I don’t get to continue, let alone finish. Then Jessica tries to explain why Montana was wrong for her. I say, “I disagree with that narrative.” Dr Guralnik doesn’t prompt me to say why. At the end of the first episode, it feels as if only a mind-reader can understand our issues. Watching the episodes, even I couldn’t say why I disagreed with Jessica’s narrative of our lives in Montana.The episodes continue in a similar style. Boris is hot-tempered, voluble and vocal. Jessica is hurt, weary and withdrawnIn the second episode, Jessica says that I end up taking care of so many family tasks because I don’t trust her to do them well. As an example, she talks about my having taken her to task for buying expensive tomatoes. Dr Guralnik doesn’t have us say more, or dig deeper.The episodes continue in a similar style. Boris is frustrated with something or other about Jessica and their lives, and Jessica is tired of feeling inadequate. Boris is hot-tempered, voluble and vocal. Jessica is hurt, weary and withdrawn. At Dr Guralnik’s prompting, the conversation flits frantically between stories that rarely make sense, let alone culminate. The only thing that feels obvious, in a mushroom-cloud way, is that a loud man has all sorts of problems with an exhausted woman. Certainly, that’s what the internet decided.Of course, there are painfully clear moments, too. I speak callously to Jessica, blind to the ways my behaviour also makes her suffer. In a particularly shameful moment, she acknowledges my distress and I cruelly dismiss her gesture. For the most part, though, you hear me ranting about water filters and vague pleas for “understanding” and “solutions” – a crazy person if you ever saw one. And I was. But not only.After the fourth session, I wrote to one of the producers to say we wouldn’t be returning. It felt like relief rather than failure. I was certain that we would not be featured on the show because our involvement was so truncated. (Once the network decided to include us anyway, I did not object, as I felt I had made a commitment.)Several months later, we returned for a final session because the film-makers invited us to give a coda to our aborted treatment. In the interim, we had experienced a reprieve in our conflict. In a quixotic bid for reconnection, I had staged an extravaganza in New York City for Jessica’s 40th birthday, and the time alone had helped us to remember, even if temporarily, what had once made it so nice to be together. Critically, however, the film-makers don’t make clear thattheyinvited us back. The lacunae prompted viewers to again project their darkest imaginings:they asked to come back to put lipstick on the pig of their earlier sessions. Or:Boris forced Jessica to return and tell a false story of improvement so he wouldn’t look as bad.And so on.View image in fullscreenThe couple with their two children, photographed at home.Photograph: Chris Buck/The GuardianThe show is full of such omissions. Viewers never learn that the episodes were filmed two years ago, a much longer lead time than usual for the programme. (Airing seems to have been delayed by Showtime’s merger with Paramount+.) The film-makers also obscure how quickly we quit. They stretch out our sessions to appear in seven of the season’s nine episodes, which is part of the reason so many viewers experienced the reprieve of our coda episode as a manipulation. It feels as if it were filmed only a week or two after we quit in extreme distress.Viewers have responded accordingly. “I hope [Jessica] left you since the show,” the Facebook message mentioned above went on. “She can do so so so much better. She’s a sweet wife and you don’t care about her or appreciate her and you speak like a pretentious asshole too.”And these are just the direct messages. I’ve done my best to keep news of the show away from my parents. The friends who get in touch, either in puzzlement or frustration on my behalf, are easier to address than all those people I know who, I imagine, have watched the show and decided I must be a monster without giving me the chance to offer nuance.I’ve mostly avoided the public comments on Reddit and TikTok, so many of which feel like projections of every relationship misdeed the commenter has endured. And yet, it’s hard to withstand so many instances of insult and cruelty – especially when you know the real story is much more complex.I was born Jewish – that is, second class – in the Soviet Union. When I was nine, my parents and grandparents became political refugees to the United States so I, the only descendant, could have a chance at equality. Because I learned English before they did, I was put in charge of their wellbeing. I spent my adolescence making decisions that no young person should make. I lived in constant dread of coming up short for these people who had sacrificed so much for me.I became an optimiser. More was always more; I could always do better. I dreamed of fleeing my family – the only way I could imagine getting away from the taskload. But first, my grandmother, a Holocaust survivor, was dying. Then my grandfather. How could I abandon them? My family defined love as proximity. A properly individualistic American would have wished them good day as the exhaust of his tailpipe obscured their stricken faces in the rearview mirror. But I couldn’t find the fortitude, or cowardice, to break their hearts in that way.But neither could I give them everything they wanted. Against their hopes, I became a writer, the worst thing I could do for the financial anxiety that so many persecuted immigrants feel, which I inherited from them. But nothing else made me feel so alive. In my first year, I made $22,000, by all accounts a resounding success.Meanwhile, Jessica was a paragon of the moderation that eluded me: an excellent student who was not interested in the Ivy League; a talented singer who was not interested in a music career; someone who didn’t need to turn over every rock to see if she had found the best treasure. She had a very reasonable definition of treasure.Jessica loved New York, where we met. However, she indulged my desire to flee, which now felt more explainable on account of her appearance in my life. It wasn’t only to separate from family that I wanted to leave. Despite its vibrancy, New York has always been a difficult place for me, partly because of its expense. We tried Miami, thinking the sun and sea would soothe us, but we missed New York’s edge and irreverence. For me, New York is like that girl you wish you’d never met – you can’t be together, but everyone else pales in comparison. It’s Jessica as a city.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It was then that I received a tenure-track university teaching position in Montana. About 20 such jobs become available in fiction every year in the US as a whole. Finally, after more than a decade of cobbling together my income, I had an offer of something resembling security as a writer. Again, Jessica, who was able to work remotely because of the pandemic, generously agreed to move.But Jessica was as dejected in Montana as I had been in New York. What does one do when there is so much connection, but practical circumstances literally point in different directions? Removed from my homeland at a formative age, relocated to a place where I felt ill at ease, my eternal pursuit of a home was easy to ridicule as perfectionism. Meanwhile, Jessica had long ago found her Eden. She had accommodated me twice. It felt like her turn. And it was time to give the kids a steady home. Two years away from tenure, I resigned my position and we returned to the only part of the New York area where we could afford a home: rural New Jersey.It was our eighth home in four years. (There were other short-term moves related to the pandemic. We once calculated that our daughter had slept in 10 different beds by the time she was three.) We had spent these years endlessly packing and unpacking, learning new cities and jobs, creating and losing community, and trying to take care of little children, all without family near – circumstances that made it very difficult to be our best selves with each other. Now we were homeowners, too. I had no income; a home far away from essentials in an area I had been trying to flee most of my life; and a lot of house to constantly mend. You haven’t lived until you’ve had an infant and a toddler and your water is out for a week.As had been our pattern for years, I went after most of these tasks first. Jessica’s habit was to go slow, in case things resolved themselves; sometimes they did, and sometimes they got worse. Mine was to anticipate problems before they occurred; sometimes that was wise, and sometimes I ended up fixing problems that didn’t need fixing. This meant that I rented and bought our homes; dealt with our landlords; organised our moves; figured out our health insurance; filed our taxes; fixed the small things and found professionals for the big ones; did the shopping and cooking; planned the trips; and dreamed up diversions for the kids – all while trying to figure out new ways to make money. Even in our darkest moments, I made Jessica coffee in the morning and a sandwich for her train ride into New York City for work.It was too much to manage, and I had been managing so much for so long. I pleaded with Jessica to help. But she was struggling with her own difficulties: recovering from pregnancies, trying to advance in the first years of a career that had yet to pay well, often taking the lead on the kids. She was also very tired from our endless fighting. All the same, she said she would help. But then she forgot. I’d ask again. She’d apologise – and then she wouldn’t do it again, or do the job partway.Very little context – heartbreaking, nuanced, full of love and mistakes by both sides – makes it into the showI would offer that this problem existed in part because ofme– I wanted to price-check more plumbers than she did. I was ready to build a bridge of compromise if she had ideas on how. She didn’t. So I offered some of my own. But this back-and-forth required more energy and creativity than she had, or wanted to put forward, and so she just promised she’d help more. But she rarely did. On it went this way, until I became apoplectic with resentment. And then she did, too. But only I shouted. She retreated into herself. On a screen, unlike in life, only one of these behaviours feels toxic.By the time filming began, nearly a year after we’d applied, things between us were even worse. I was in despair at the mistake I’d made in moving back. But when I tried to discuss this with Jessica, I encountered a wall. As she confessed later, she couldn’t sympathise with me because she was afraid that if she did, I would receive it as acquiescence to my pressure to move us away from New York again. She was angry at being asked to give up a home that was finally hers, and was past the point of caring for me. (These are her words – she has read this essay.) I was desperate for my life partner to at least acknowledge what I’d given up and what I’d come back to. But I couldn’t get her to do that.That’s the couple viewers meet on Couples Therapy. Except it isn’t. Very little of the above context – heartbreaking, nuanced, full of love and mistakes by both sides – makes it into the show, even though we tried to share these complexities in our sessions.View image in fullscreenGetting advice from Dr Orna Guralnik on the show Couples Therapy.Photograph: Paramount+Not only the storytelling is reductive. Whether it’s the therapy or the editing, the treatment itself is so one-sided, so focused on my problems and behaviour, that many online commenters can’t recall Jessica’s name. (The misrepresentationsshehas experienced, which include assumptions that she is autistic or mentally unwell, are the reason she has recorded TikTok videos in reply. These videos also discuss how she handles with her own patients the treatment issues we faced with Dr Guralnik.) In that final coda session, after I describe the 40th-birthday weekend I conceived for Jessica, at Dr Guralnik’s prompting Jessica tells a very attentive, sensitive story about how she sees me. And that is where the exchange ends. Dr Guralnik fails to ask the same thing of me. (As I fail to insist on providing it.)This happened a lot. Dr Guralnik was scrupulous about turning the mic over to Jessica, but on the show, I speak most of the time. Certainly not a good reflection on me, but if we could fix this ourselves, we wouldn’t have needed therapy. The show alternates Dr Guralnik’s consultations with the couples with her own supervision and advisory sessions, first with a clinical adviser named Virginia Goldner, then with a broader circle of fellow therapists. At one point, Dr Guralnik wisely tells Dr Goldner that I need “containment”, which I understand as a combination of being reined in but also persuaded that I don’t have to say so much to be understood. But she never contains me. Even after I interrupt Jessica at one point to say that “we’ll get to you” – an outrageous statement from someone who has been talking nonstop – Dr Guralnik says nothing.As for my search for acknowledgment from Jessica, Dr Guralnik felt that it was my job to take care of myself. She tells Dr Goldner she said to me: “‘This is not something you can ask of a partner. This is your existential plight. It’s not a shared plight. It’s yours.’ [Boris] can’t stand that.” As I watched, my mind went back to a terrible patch that Jessica went through with an abusive remote New York employer when we were living in Montana. What if, as Jessica trembled and wept at the dinner table, I had smiled in a hollow way and changed the subject? Instead I held her hand, asked questions and cried with her. Indeed, I gave up my professional security so she could have hers.As for Dr Guralnik’s sessions with her circle of therapeutic advisers, one of them scoffs at my naivety in believing that home could be anywhere but the mind – as if Arizona and Florida have to mean the same thing to a person with a respiratory ailment; as if totalitarian Belarus and free Latvia will feel the same if only a person gets his brain right; as if the United States and a western European social democracy must be synonyms to a person raised under socialism.As I watched, I felt deeply insulted – as I was by Dr Guralnik’s assessment, so poisonously familiar from other therapies, of disagreement on my part as a refusal to see the light, to get treated. “He identifies with me only when I am 100% empathetic,” she says – painful to hear considering I repeatedly admit error throughout the sessions. “The moment I establish any kind of difference between his experience and my interpretation, I [am] just, like, useless to him.”Sometimes, therapists are healers. Dr Guralnik has helped to heal many; she was incredibly warm to me and Jessica. She sensed the therapy wasn’t working, and sought solutions from peers, literature and her own reflections. But sometimes, therapists are as limited as we civilians. The problem is that their limitations too often get another name: authority.Eventually, on my own and through conversations with Jessica, I came to understand what I needed to do to become more of the partner Jessica wanted, regardless of the form our relationship took. This process obeyed no formula or self-help shorthand. I  can only describe it as an experience of great searching, humbling and circuitousness. You wouldn’t know it from the show, but Jessica has had things to learn, too. It’s only because both of us have done this work that we now interact with tenderness and respect.The airing of the show, and the crude misrepresentations it has invited, have been a wrecking ball to our very fragile site of reconstruction. That the therapy didn’t help us feels like our responsibility as much as Dr Guralnik’s: we hardly gave it a chance, and at our level of distress we were very hard to help. But now it’s back to make our lives harder a second time. Couples Therapy has certainly helped others. But I deeply regret having applied to be on it.The one bit of good news here is that Jessica and I have managed this incredible stress test with gentleness and care. I have continued to speak with deference, never raising my voice, and taking care to frame frustrations as an expression of who I am rather than who she is. In turn, Jessica has worked hard to articulate more of what she’s feeling and to be more mindful of the things I have explained make me feel seen. Our future remains uncertain. But every time we see each other, we embrace. Sometimes, the children pile in. I don’t know what awaits us. But this, no one can take away. It is ours. It is the only part that is real.Couples Therapy is on BBC iPlayer in the UK, Paramount+ with Showtime in the US and SBS On Demand in Australia.

Whether squeezing some more joy out of the garden before it dies back for another winter or doing jobs your future spring self will thank you for, these are the things that define the season.I’m a self-taught gardener and an autumn superfan, so some of these tasks are my favourites of the year. I also asked wise friends from across the gardening landscape to share what they’ll be doing, buying and thinking about – and, crucially, what they won’t be – as autumn dawns.Getting your garden autumn readyView image in fullscreenPhotograph: SolStock/Getty ImagesSow hardy annualsThere are few things more pleasing in the grim depths of late winter than a clutch of sturdy seedlings promising flowers to come in the spring and summer. Sowing hardy annuals such asnigella,poppies,nasturtiums,sweet peas,cornflowersandAmmi majuswill give you a crop of summer flowers to cut after putting on good growth in the spring – and a second chance to sow again in the spring if they fail.Herb hacks“A lot of nurseries will be discounting their more tender-leaved perennials at the moment, as they’re not hardy enough to last the winter,” says herbologist and writer Maya Jayaweera Thomas. “The joy of that is you can make the most of them, prune them back to get that last flourish of foliage and use them in your food.”She adds that sage is a great place to start. “Give it a haircut at the end of summer and dry bunches for the house – it’s great for making simple syrups to ease coughs and colds.”Catch waterIf you’re letting rainwater go to waste, now’s the time to fix that, says landscape designer Tom Massey. “After the hot, dry spring and summer we’ve had this year, disconnect your downpipes and invest in water butts or rainwater harvesting tanks to capture and store precious rain as the wet season arrives.” (Just make sure you’ve got an overflow system in place should your water butt fill up.) Some councils will even give them away for free, or look on Facebook Marketplace and similar sites for secondhand options.View image in fullscreenStrata water butt kit£35 at Argos£43 at Water Butts DirectPlot next year’s design“Now is a great time to sit back and have a look at what you’ve got, think about what you might want to change or add for next year and maybe make a few notes,” says Susanna Grant of planting design consultancy Linda. Look back at photos to help you remember the highs and lows of your spring and summer space – it’s a good time to make changes before growth begins again in the spring.Jazz up your spaceThe evenings might be shorter, but autumn’s sunsets are stunning – and well worth enjoying outside if you can cosy up right. It can be a good time to think about garden lighting – I particularly like Pooky’s exterior range – before the cooler seasons, when you may see more of your garden in the dark than in the light. Braziers offer warmth and something to gather around (and have some good discounts on at the moment). It’s also a fine time to snag a bargain on outdoor cushions; these stripy ones come in autumnal hues.View image in fullscreenExterior wall light£210 at PookyView image in fullscreenCorten steel fire bowl£84.92 at Primrose£92.92 at B&QView image in fullscreenPink stripe outdoor cushion£8 at ArgosBuy bargain bulbsThere’s something to be said for being organised and buying yourbulbsat the end of summer (you get the best pick, your future self will thank you), but hold your nerve until October and they will be massively reduced onbulb websites. The most popular varieties may have sold out, but stick to a tight colour palette and you won’t notice. Conversely, keep an eye on the floristry section of the supermarkets from now on, as bargain bulbs will start appearing there in boxes. I plant all of mine in December.Support wildlife in styleIn our era of biodiversity crisis, doing all we can to support wildlife in the garden is important – and fosters good garden ecology, too. Floral artist and broadcaster Hazel Gardiner is a fan of the decorative bird feeder, and they’re increasingly available on the high street. “They can look beautiful rather than purely utilitarian, while also ensuring your outdoor space supports biodiversity through winter,” she says.View image in fullscreenWildlife Vierno diner seed feeder£10.99 at CJ Wildlife£11 at National TrustThink about a treeAutumn, along with spring, is the ideal time to plant trees. This is a good time, then, to find one. In a small garden, it’s sensible to choose one that offers interest for most of the year, between blossom in spring and colour in autumn (this is whyAmelanchier lamarckiiis so popular), and multi-stem varieties provide shade and interest without taking over a space.View image in fullscreenAmelanchier lamarckiitreeFrom £25.79 at CrocusFrom £45 at Ornamental TreesGet your edges straightIf you’re itching to create order in the garden but not at the expense of woodier perennials as habitat for wildlife, attend to your edges, says gardening coach Andrew O’Brien. “After a season of growth and weeks of ripening and flopping, re-establishing some clear lines and routes makes a world of difference in making everything feel more manageable,” he says. “Look to your paths and edges – of lawns, beds and hedging – and you can let the bits in between collapse over winter while managing the overwhelm.”View image in fullscreenDraper heritage stainless steel lawn edger£25.87 at Rapid£26.95 at My Tool ShedSort your shedIf your shed has become a depository of garden furniture, toys, tools and non-gardening detritus this summer, now is a fine time to get it in order. Donate anything you haven’t used or don’t want, clean out the spiderwebs and make any repairs to make it easier to store things over the colder months. On the other hand, now is a great time to search secondhand sites for garden furniture as so many others take part in this clearout.Clean your toolsSpeaking of tools, it’s much nicer to do autumnal garden tasks with clean, sharp ones. Setting yourself up with a sharpening stone, a YouTube tutorial and some camellia oil will make your secateurs look new. I like to havea coarse-haired brushby the shed door to dust tools down after use.View image in fullscreenSharpening stoneFrom £15 at Niwaki£16.50 at AmazonView image in fullscreenCamellia oilFrom £7.50 at Niwaki£12.90 at AmazonFill a few gapsIf you really want to plant things, it’s a fine time to do so. Gardiner suggestsJapanese anemones,sedumsandchrysanthemums. “These varieties keep borders popping with colour deep into autumn. They also provide nectar for pollinators when food sources are scarce – and they’re having a cut-flower resurgence.”Take cuttingsSave on your plant budget by taking semi-ripe cuttings, especially of half-hardy perennials that won’t survive the winter, such asPelargoniumsor lavender. The semi-ripe refers to the growth habit: these cuttings are woody at the bottom – which prevents rotting – and have soft new growth at the top. Take a 15cm cutting with clean secateurs, dip intohormone powderif you like, then place in pots of good compost in a propagator or inside a plastic bag to keep them warm and moist.View image in fullscreenBurgon & Ball bypass secateurs£23 at B&Q£23.99 at John LewisView image in fullscreenHigurashi secateurs£59 at NiwakiFor more, check out our guide tothe best secateursDon’t cut back too soonThe long-held tradition of “putting the garden to bed” lingers on, but there’s really no need. “Resist cutting back too soon,” says Massey. “Let seed heads and ornamental grasses glint in autumn light and sparkle with winter frost, while supporting wildlife outdoors.” Gardiner agrees, with this simple advice: “Don’t over-tidy.”Consider shrubs for your potsBefore you place that bulb order, says Grant, why not consider bare-root hedging for your containers instead? “Buying a handful ofRosa glauca,spindle,wild privetorhawthorncan add height and texture, while providing food for wildlife. They will only cost you a few pounds but give so much back.” You can also plant them for borders and front gardens. “Adding a few each year has totally transformed my side return planters,” she says. “And they can be coppiced if they get too big.”Sow green manureWorking on your soil is a crucial – and arguably first – step in any garden. If yours is a little worse for wear, why not sow green manure instead of planting another doomed garden centre annual?Vetch,phacelia(which produces gorgeous purple flowers for bees) andforage rye– especially good for clay soils – will grow over winter, and can then be dug into the soil in the spring to nourish the soil.Cut bunches to dry and decorateWhat might look crispy in the garden can be structural inside. Sedum heads, poppy seedheads, hydrangeas, amaranth and grasses can “bring sculptural beauty indoors”, says Massey, while dried bunches of flowers provide longstanding interest throughout the cooler months.Alice Vincent is a writer, author and gardenerExplore more on these topicsGardensThe FilterGardening advicefeaturesShareReuse this content"

As it happens, I often eat the creamy, wobbly silken variety straight from the packet, but I wouldn’t disagree: you don’t have to be vegetarian to enjoy a hot, crisp nugget of deep-fried beancurd.Prep15 minCook15 minServes2About 280g firm or extra-firm tofu– if using silken, skip step 3Saltand black pepper4 tbsp cornflour, or other starch (optional)Neutral oil, for deep-fryingFor the chilli crisp (if making)1½ tbsp Sichuan peppercorns3-4 tbsp gochuharu, or other chilli flakes to taste30g roasted salted peanuts, or soybeans, roughly chopped1 tbsp fermented black beans, finely chopped (optional)250ml neutral oil1 long shallot, or 2 round ones, peeled and thinly sliced6 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced1 tsp sugar(optional)¼ tsp MSG powder(optional)1 A note on the tofuFirm or extra-firm tofu is the best choice for frying – silken will be creamy inside, and pressed tofu chewier and more meaty. For the neatest results, cut into bite-sized nuggets about 3cm x 2cm. If you value crunch over appearance, break it into bite-sized pieces instead; the rougher edges will crisp up better than perfectly flat surfaces.2 Soak the tofuView image in fullscreenFor maximum crispness, remove as much excess moisture from the tofu as possible before cooking it. Fill a bowl or pan with boiling water and season very generously with salt, so it tastes like the sea. Drop in the tofu, leave to soak for 15 minutes (the hot water will draw out liquid from the centre of the tofu; the salt’s just for seasoning).3 Dry the tofuView image in fullscreenMeanwhile, line a baking tray with kitchen paper or a clean tea towel. Drain the tofu, put it on the tray and top with more paper or another towel. Put another baking tray or chopping board on top, weigh that down with a couple of tins, or something else heavy, and leave to sit for 15 minutes.4 To coat, or not to coat?Coating the tofu is optional, but it will help with crunchiness. Put the cornflour or other starch (eg, plain or rice flour, potato starch, etc) in a shallow bowl and season generously with salt and pepper, or other spices of your choice. Add the pieces of tofu, toss to coat lightly, then shake off any excess.5 Fry the tofuView image in fullscreenMeanwhile, fill a deep pan by about a third with a neutral oil and heat to 180C (or until bubbles form around the end of a wooden chopstick). Add the tofu, in batches, if need be, stir once, then fry until crisp and golden. Drain on kitchen paper, season and serve with a dipping sauce, or toss through a stir-fry.6 And now for some homemade chilli crispYou may wish to serve your fried tofu (and just about everything else you eat, for that matter, from eggs to rice to steamed veg) with chilli crisp. Though there are many delicious ready-made versions out there, making your own allows you to tweak the basic formula (oil, chilli, crunchy beans or nuts) to suit your own taste.7 Toast and grind the spicesView image in fullscreenToast the peppercorns and/or any other whole spices (eg, black peppercorns, cumin and/or coriander seeds, star anise, cinnamon) in a dry pan, then roughly crush. Chilli-wise, I prefer medium-hot flakes such as Korean gochugaru, but experiment with different varieties. Toast briefly, then grind, if necessary. Put the peanuts, black beans and all the spices in a large heatproof bowl.8 Flavour the oilSet a heatproof sieve over a heatproof bowl. Pour the oil into a wide frying pan, add the sliced shallot and put the pan on a medium heat. Fry, stirring, until the shallot is crisp and golden, then drain into the sieve and return the oil to the pan. Add the garlic, cook until pale golden, then drain again.9 Mix and jarView image in fullscreenPour the hot oil on to the spice and nut mixture, then stir in the sugar and MSG, if using; you may also wish to add salt, depending on how salty your peanuts and black beans are. Leave to cool completely, then stir in the fried shallots and garlic. Decant into a clean jar, seal and store in the fridge.Explore more on these topicsTofuFelicity Cloake's masterclassFoodMain courseSide dishesChinese food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

To the chagrin of some, BrewDog continued soliciting investment from the crowdfunders who had fuelled its initial growth, even after taking the private equity money.“That was a tipping point,” says the beer and food writer Melissa Cole. “After a private equity company has invested, can you still go back to the well of your fans?”Watt’s personal and professional antics since stepping down as chief executive last year, broadcast relentlessly on social media, seem to have completed themigration into the establishment.“I compare the history of post-punk music with craft beer,” says Pete Brown, a beer writer and author of Tasting Notes: The Art and Science of PairingBeerand Music.“I’ve got a slide with [former Sex Pistols frontman] John Lydon doing the Country Life butter commercial next to a picture of James Watt attending Nigel Farage’s birthday party.“It’s like the French Revolution … inevitably the revolutionaries become the reactionaries.”Peak BrewDogViews may differ about when the brewer lost its countercultural credentials, but there is little dissent among beer connoisseurs about one thing: we have reached – and probably passed – peakBrewDog.Outside what Brown calls the “beer bubble”, though, the hangover from theraucous growth storythat defined the company for so long is only just setting in.Since it was founded, sales have grown every year by at least 9% – and often at a much more rapid clip – even during the Covid-19 pandemic. But financial results for 2024 released earlier this month brought that remarkable winning streak to a close. Takings all but flatlined in 2024, rising by less than 1% to £357m.Net revenues, which take into account the duty sliced off the top of a pint and sent to the Treasury, actually fell slightly. The company is taking on more debt, at sky-high interest rates, from TSG..James Taylor, the second chief executive since Watt announced his departure 18 months ago – and the third James in a row to run the business – pointed investors towards his preferred “adjusted” operating profit measure.At that level, BrewDog returned to the black, but only to the tune of £7.5m. Pre-tax losses over the past two years amount to nearly £100m.So far, 2025 has offered little solace. BrewDog’s products, including its flagship Punk IPA, have been axed from 2,000 pubs as customers opted for rival beers. Last month, the brewersaid it would close 10 of its own UK bars, including on its home turf in Aberdeen.Some of this is down to environmental factors. The sluggish economy has constrained consumer spending across hospitality, while gen Z, a cohort who might have been expected to drink BrewDog 10 years ago,are now swerving alcoholic indulgence.BrewDog says reports of its decline are exaggerated. Jettisoning loss-making bars will reduce costs, it argues, trimming a division that had over-expanded.The company also plays down the impact of being elbowed off the beer pumps at so many pubs. They point to new distribution deals with big venues, including West Ham United’s London Stadium, the Isle of Wight festival and that lodestar of punk culture, Lord’s cricket ground.These, say a spokesperson, have delivered more than three times the volume of sales lost from pubs.But the notion of peak BrewDog is about much more than the financials. It is, say observers, the inevitable culmination of years of behaviour that have gradually chipped away at BrewDog’s rebel image until there was almost nobody left who believed in it.From brash to cringeEverything seems right with the world when you’rethrowing stuffed toy cats out of a helicopter.The 2015 stunt – intended to mock “fat cat” beer companies – was just one of many thought up by Watt and his fellow co-founder Martin Dickie, who followed his partner out of the exit door earlier this year.View image in fullscreenPink IPA is BrewDog’s signature beer.Photograph: Alan Richardson/The GuardianTheir brash marketing strategy elicited the odd eye-roll, but on occasion, the duo badly misread the room.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Thousands signed a petition calling the caricatures offensive.Their Pink IPA – a mock “beer for girls” released on International Women’s Day 2018 and supposedly intended to challenge stereotypes – didn’t get many laughs from women in beer.By and large though, drinkers loved this brand of devilment, while those in the industry recognised that a rising tide lifted all boats and that in the early days at least, BrewDog was making good beers.“I was gushing about what they were doing,” says Curtis. “They were bringing the impetus from that US beer scene into the UK, which is what it needed.”He credits BrewDog with fostering talented people who went on to run breweries themselves, echoing the old line that everyone who bought the first Velvet Underground record went on to start a band.Brown points out that BrewDog has been a victim of revisionism too, from people who like to pretend they were always too cool for it. “They’ll say the beers were always shit. No they weren’t. They are now but they weren’t back then.”But the publicity missteps – not to mention the dissonance caused by the company’s corporatisation – became less trivial.View image in fullscreenMartin Dickie and James Watt (right) photographed in 2016.Photograph: Alan Richardson/The GuardianIn 2017, BrewDog attracted criticism for threatening two small bars with legal action,one for using the name Lone Wolf– the same as a spirit brand that BrewDog was trying to launch, and another – against a Leeds pub –for calling itself Draft Punk.The irony of trying to copyright punk was not lost on beer fans.Then came the 2017 private equity investment and, in 2021 the bombshell Punks with Purpose open letter.In response to mounting criticism, Wattacknowledged some of his failings and apologised. But he reacted with fury to aBBC documentarythat raised further questions about his behaviour. The Guardian revealed that he hadhired private investigators to gather information on peoplewho had spoken to the BBC.One seemingly minor but telling detail that emerged was that Watt, such a vocal critic of Big Beer, even owned shares in the Dutch brewing giant Heineken.Dog days are over?Last year, the company faced a new staff backlash afterdropping its commitment to the real living wageand then over itshandling of a decision by the EDL, a far-right group, to use its Waterloo bar as a meeting point for a rally.More recently, Watt has courted ridicule for social media posts, including videos filmed alongside his former reality TV star partner Georgia Toffolo, in which he has railed against taxation on business andmooted delaying the duo’s wedding to avoid a potential tax hit.“People have looked at how he behaves, looked at the brand and thought they’d rather drink something else,” says Cole. “BrewDog has just totally lost its identity. Whether it was all just smoke and mirrors is kind of irrelevant.”One cohort that BrewDog has always been able fall back on was its army of shareholders, the “equity punks” who have a financial, as well as an emotional stake in the company, after taking part in its early crowdfunding rounds.Even their loyalty may be tested.BrewDog has previously indicated that it is seeking to float on the stock market, with valuations of up to £2bn bandied about. Faltering progress since then appears to have made a valuation even half that size fanciful.Detailedanalysis by the Financial Times, published earlier this year, concluded that weak profitability, with the terms of the investment by TSG may have rendered the equity punks’ stakes worthless.If that turns out to be true, then some may look from BrewDog to the faceless brewing giants that they once mocked and find it impossible to tell which is which.Explore more on these topicsBrewDogBeerFood & drink industryCorporate governanceScotlandPrivate equityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If only their main trouble was making bottles of chardonnay and pinot blanc, or selling pretty Tillingham tea towels at £36 a pop. But no, Tillingham has (quite literally) many other plates to juggle: it has a fancy restaurant and a vast barn from which they serve pizza, too.There’s also the option to stay over in bell tents, no less, if posh hen weekends or corporate bonding sessions are required. Or in bricks-and-mortar rooms with actual plumbing, if the tent’s compost toilet is not for you. If all this isn’t distracting enough, much of Tillingham’s workforce must be drained dealing with its frequent wine tours; wine experts plod groups of natural wine buffs around the sheds, talking lovingly of clay vessel spontaneous fermentation and how nettle tea aids vine health. All that while handing out samples of natural wine, which naysayers might find quite challenging, if not verging on abrasive.View image in fullscreenThe ‘prettily arrranged’ citrus-cured halibut, at Tillingham’s restaurant.Natural wine is, of course, wildly polarising. What everyone loves, however, is dinner, which is why Tillingham’s huge, formal restaurant overlooking breathtakingly pretty countryside should be its biggest draw. TheSunday feast, for example, has three courses for £45. The short menu, on first inspection, sounds lovely and locally sourced: braised Morebread Farm lamb, Beal’s Farm salami, house-made focaccia and baked cheesecake with poached rhubarb. The vast room was empty when we arrived, although several chefs seemed to be hard at work in the open kitchen, while serving staff hovered around the floor. So far, so good.However, as the meal began, it transpired that not a terrible amount of cooking was going on and, more pressingly, no one on the floor seemed to be in charge or trained to work in a semi-formal restaurant. The amateur-hour shtick of Tillingham’s service could be seen as endearing – our drink order, for example, was taken with no mention of the wine that was being made all of 100m away.View image in fullscreenTillingham’s lobster linguine with a ‘good, rich, slightly piquant, glossy tomato sauce’.It was midday on Sunday and the fresh focaccia from the sharing section of the menu had definitely seen brighter, crisper days. Let’s call that day Saturday. The other “sharing items” were cashews and olives, which would hardly have made chef break a sweat. A starter of citrus-cured halibut with fennel, orange salad and wood sorrel was prettily arranged – in a fancy, wedding-breakfast, mass-catering way – but lacked any discernible zing. Another starter was courgette velouté with more of that stale focaccia.At this juncture, a visit to the ladies’ room led me to discover a small chalkboard, at skirting-board level, alerting diners to the veg from nearby fields that had been picked and was being served today. Tillingham’s restaurant seems determined to hide its light under a bushel. The main courses were the stars of the show: lobster linguine came topped with half a native lobster, with a good, rich, slightly piquant, glossy tomato sauce. The lobster meat was well judged, drenched in garlic butter and impossible not to love. Lamb chop was accompanied by crispy lamb and garlic puree and a complex rosemary jus. Another main of nicely cooked skate wing with brown shrimp sported a delightful beurre noisette. We saw some great cooking here, and sumptuous sides of heritage tomatoes and broccoli chargrilled with honey glaze were further clues that we were eating farm to fork.View image in fullscreenTillingham’s rhubarb cheesecake comes ‘titivated with petals’.Still, this is a restaurant that seems to be currently working to a fraction of its potential; the desserts were a choice of a spin on Eton mess, some cheese and crackers, plus that baked rhubarb cheesecake, which we chose, hoping for something Basque-ish, burnished and wobbling. Instead, it was something clearly pre-made, with a digestive biscuit base, piped with rhubarb gel and titivated with petals. So many cooks, not a great deal of cooking.Wine, wine everywhere and not a drop of it mentioned to drink. We left, and skipped the gift shop for keepsakes, because there was very little here to remember.TillinghamDew Farm, Dew Lane, Peasmarsh, East Sussex, 01797 208226.

Should I say something?Your concern may be an expression of care for your daughter – but you need to dig down into why you feel like thisAnnalisa BarbieriSun 14 Sep 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 14 Sep 2025 13.32 EDTShareMy daughter, aged nearly 50, lives in a pleasant cul-de-sacof privately owned houses. Her front garden is the only one in itthat, frankly, looks a mess.The grass is never cut because she says it’s eco-friendly and has wild flowers.(Mainly dandelions and three prized wild orchids.)It’s a very smallgarden and is crammed with untended bushes, fruit treesand a central treethat takes all the light from her sitting room. Recently, she’s been given five large fruit bushes in pots, which straggle over the path.I would be very disappointed if I had such an eyesore next door to me.She’s a single mum with two sons whohave recently left school, but she won’t let them tidy up her garden. We live three hours away, but always feel ashamed when we visit and push our way up the overgrown path. Does it matter or are we just pernickety old folk with outdated views?I’d appreciate another opinion.I think you’ll get a lot of other opinions below this column. Whenever someone says or does something that on the face of it seems unhelpful, I always think: “What is the motivation here?” And I do believe your motivation is one of caring for your daughter. Maybe it’s easier to say you’re worried about her by focusing those worries horticulturally, but there are a fair number of loaded words in your letter: “privately owned”,“the only one”, “prized”, “disappointed”, “single mum”, “ashamed”. I wonder if your daughter feels this judgment too. What are you really worried about?What’s her house like? How does she run her life? Are her sons, your grandsons, well cared for? I ask not to heap more judgment on to her – or you – but to see if she is depressed or needs help. Or whether this really is just about a messy garden.Your daughter is right that gardens can be a wildlife haven and, of course, if it works for her then … it works.Try turning your concern into openness and curiosity. Curiosity is always a better key into places than criticismUK registered psychotherapist Katherine Cavallo wondered if “there were different generational meanings attached to the garden? To you a well-kept garden may be a sign of being a respectful neighbour, or even an indicator of success and social standing in the local community. However, it sounds as though your daughter sees things differently. Her garden may be a means of expressing her values, identity or political views; she may feel she is consciously doing her part to protect the planet by creating a place for biodiversity. As a lone parent, her garden may not be a top priority, and she may have limited resources to devote to it.” I think the word priority is key here – what matters to you? It may not matter so much to her, and vice versa.If your grandsons have left school, they may soon be leaving home, and Cavallo wonders if “your concern – which may be felt as criticism, and could result in your daughter withdrawing further from you – could instead be turned into openness and curiosity to generate a different pattern of communication, one where your daughter may feel more able to voice her feelings. As she approaches a transition in her life with her children on the point of leaving home (or, at least, a next stage), what are her hopes and dreams for the independence this will bring her? And how will her garden fit into this? If she were able to enjoy the space more, what might that look like?”Curiosity is always a better key into places than criticism.I’m going to suggest a little exercise that helps me and may help you to work out what this is really about: I call it corkscrewing. You think of what’s causing you angst then you “corkscrew” down to try to work out what it’s really about, at each stage asking yourself about the feelings it brings up and what it makes you think about. You then go further down into that emotion/feeling and explore what else it brings up. This takes time, thought and reflection, but you know when you’ve got to the “hot emotion” – what’s really upsetting you – because you either go “that’s it” or it makes you upset.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

They had bare ground, grass mats and animal skins, if they were lucky. So when my wife suggested I spend $90 on a natural rubber yoga mat like the one she had, I balked. Is that really necessary?It turns out the answer was yes. Ten years later, I’m still using the JadeYoga Harmony mat I sprang for, and I’m no longer a skeptic, I’m an evangelist. Natural rubber provides enough cushion for comfort, enough grip to safely push my limits, and the durability of a truck tire.From sedentary to centeredThis versatile Japanese chef’s knife has lasted longer than some of my relationshipsRead moreYogawasn’t always a part of my life. A decade ago, I was desk-bound with occasional bursts of activity, and the creaky joints and stiff muscles to show for it. My wife Tracey and I tried various exercise routines, including fitness videos, going on walks, and even gamifying exercise with Nintendo’s Wii Fit. Nothing ever stuck.Then Traceydiscovered yogathrough online classes, starting with the same cheap $20 foam yoga mat you can find in the fitness aisle of any local big box store. Only a couple of months in, I noticed yoga was different for her. It became a daily ritual for her that provided movement and also set anice moodfor the entire day. After getting serious, Tracey upgraded to a natural rubber mat, like the ones yoga instructors use.JadeYoga Harmony$79.65 at Amazon$91.95 at JadeYogaView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Alan TrulyI started to feel like I was missing out, so I grabbed her hand-me-down foam mat to join her, and experienced a surprise: I didn’t expect yoga to be simple, but I was shocked at how unsteady I felt and how challenging it was to hold what looked like an easy pose. While the squishy foam was soft on my knees, it made me feel awkward and wobbly. Balance is a big part of a physical yoga practice, and I became frustrated with my lack of progress.After struggling for a couple of months, Tracey recommended getting the same mat she used. Even though my foam mat was already wrinkling and tearing, I hesitated. But I knew I needed more movement, andyoga was an easy, at-homeoption that didn’t take much space, so I reluctantly agreed to invest in a proper mat.What a difference. Instead of a shaky stance, I could hold poses long enough to feel like I was accomplishing something. Though the fiber-reinforced rubber was less than half as thick as the foam and not nearly as plush, it provided a comfortably soft but resilient and remarkably grippy surface that I could rely on.These $45 sandals with a 5,000-mile warranty outlasted my BirkenstocksRead moreWhy it worksNatural rubber yoga mats have an unbeatable grip. Anindependent testby the German non-profit Stiftung Warentest found that natural rubber yoga mats outperformed all synthetic mats, offering superior grip even when wet.That’s especially important for poses like a wide-stance warrior pose, or a deep twist, when slipping could cause an injury.It’s also a renewable natural resource, made from the sap of the rubber tree. Dean Jerrehian, the president at Jade Industries Inc, told me that the company “chose natural rubber for its yoga mats since it’s a durable and sustainable material that doesn’t require cutting down trees”. While sap extraction is energy-intensive, a2017 studyfound rubber to be more eco-friendly than synthetic alternatives. Natural rubber doesn’t off-gas volatile organic compounds, either. (Though it’s not a good choice if you have latex sensitivity.)View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Alan TrulyDespite advances in materials science, rubber is still the top pick for durability, too. From heavy-duty tires toeco-friendly footwear, natural rubber handles wear and tear. Jerrehian says the mat’s fiber reinforcement, an embedded polycotton scrim, prevents stretching. After 10 years of daily practice on the same mat, I can attest to that: I would have worn through a dozen foam mats in that time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Filter USFree weekly newsletterA guide to buying fewer, better products.Enter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I took 150,000 steps to find outRead moreA decade of wearI’ve spent more than 1,000 hours on my JadeYoga mat, but I know it’s past time for a new one. It isn’t as grippy as it once was. I have a hole the size of a pencil eraser at one end, and a palm-sized thin spot at the other end, where I can see the embedded fibers. To compensate for the inevitable wear caused by stretching, twisting, and sliding, I now shift my hand and foot placement forward a couple of inches.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Alan TrulyI haven’t abused my mat, but I also haven’t babied it. I use it outdoors sometimes, for general-purpose exercise, and sometimes even for extra grip under foot when I wear virtual-reality headsets. An occasional scrub with soapy water keeps it smelling fresh, and I roll it up when I’m finished using it.What do I do with my old mat?My wife ordered her second JadeYoga mat four years ago, and now it’s my turn. But my wonderful mat won’t go in the landfill. I’ll roll it to use as a pad, or cut it up to use as smaller mats, as I did with my wife’s retired mat. A mini-mat can add a second layer of knee padding, cushion weights, or extend a new mat.

Later photograph: Simon Webb/The Guardian. Styling: Andie Redman. Grooming: Aimee Adams. Archive photograph: courtesy of Vernon KayBorn in 1974 in Bolton,Vernon Kay, son of Norman and Gladys, was scouted as a model in 1997 and, after being crowned Model of the Week on Channel 4’s The Big Breakfast, moved into TV presenting. He became a household name as one of Channel 4’s T4 hosts in the 2000s and went on to front All Star Family Fortunes and Splash!, while also carving out a radio career that led to him succeeding Ken Bruce on BBC Radio 2’s show in 2023. He lives in Buckinghamshire with his wife, the TV presenter Tess Daly, and their two daughters. He hosts M&S: Dress the Nation on ITV from 14 September, available to stream on ITVX.VernonThis is me and Dad in a photo booth at Bolton bus station. I needed to sort out my passport as I was going on a trip to Seattle – I was obsessed with American football and had saved up to go and watch it in real life. Dad must have jumped in for a bit of fun.I look like a baby, but I was 16 at the time – a real late developer. In fact, I didn’t really blossom until shortly after this picture was taken. When I got back from Seattle, nobody recognised me. I shot up from 5ft 4in to 6ft 4in in the few weeks I was away. I’ve still got stretch marks down my legs from the growth spurt.Dad was a lorry driver and he wasn’t home much during my childhood, but it never felt as if he was absent. Sometimes, during our summer holidays, he would take me and my brother along to work – we would sit with him in the passenger seat of his lorry driving up and down the country. He would never stop for a break unless it was already on his schedule. I’ve definitely inherited that determination.As a kid, I had everything I could ever wish for. Dad made sure our Christmases were off the charts – it was like walking into Hamleys on Christmas Day. But it wasn’t just about the presents. Our house was in this beautiful area on the back of the West Pennine Moors – open fields for miles. In the winter it was knee-deep in snow, so we could go sledging, and in the summer I spent all day playing football and swinging on ropes. Because I was so spoilt with where we lived and how generous my parents were, I never really rebelled.I always find a way to bring up my parents on the radio. They made me who I am, and it makes me feel connected to themDad taught me a lot about having a work ethic. I was 14 when I got my first job, which was putting stickers on imported bananas in a factory. It was probably highly illegal to hire someone so young, but from that moment on I was addicted to working. I loved getting paid. I was the richest 14-year-old at school.Dad’s always been good at advice. One piece that stuck with me was: “No one’s going to give you anything ever, so you’ve got to go and get it yourself.” Another was on my first day at uni. Dad looked at me very seriously, which never happens, and said: “Listen, have a lot of fun, look after yourself, but be careful.” Meanwhile, Mum was like: “Have you got your toothbrush and sorted your TV licence?”Sarah Parish and James Murray look back: ‘Losing a child is such a hard thing to digest, but when we harnessed the grief, it got easier’Read moreI was at the BBC Clothes Show Live when I got scouted as a model. My dad’s reaction? He laughed down the phone and said: “Whoa, whoa, whoa! Say that again. Why would they pick you? You look like a girl. You’re too skinny to do modelling. Gladys, come here!” That brought me back down to earth straight away.That’s the moment that everything started for me. I’d left home by the following Friday. I immediately loved living in London. My agency put me on a wage of £175 a week – I got it on Thursday and spent it by Thursday afternoon, mainly in the Punch and Judy pub in Covent Garden with my mates. But Dad’s work ethic was still embedded within me. I would never miss a casting, I always tried my best, and when a TV opportunity came up I grabbed it by the throat.As soon as I started presenting, I knew it was my true path. I instantly felt comfortable and had such a good time. I think it helped that I didn’t work my way up from being a runner or researcher. Making TV was a mystery to me, so everything I did was instinctive. I was just a young lad from Bolton having a laugh.Over the years, Mum would join me at the odd film premiere, but Dad was mostly working. He did come to see one show being filmed – a series called Boys and Girls, where Chris Evans was the exec producer. It was nuts – a semi-dating show featuring 100 boys and 100 girls who had to rank each other using the metric “Babe or minger?” It quickly descended into people getting their boobs out. Dad thought it was disgusting.Whenever I am on the radio, I always find a way to bring up my parents. They made me who I am, and it makes me feel connected to them. I know they’re always listening. I also know that if I say something slightly derogatory about dad, Mum will be nudging him and going: “Yeah, Norman – Vernon’s right!”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

We always had good laughs.As a little boy, Vernon was mega shy and introverted, but as he grew older he became the complete opposite. For example, when he started going to the Haçienda in his teens: I’ll never forget his outfits – particularly the black satin trousers, and the green tartan ones, too. He would walk into the garden so he could admire himself using the patio windows as a mirror. I’d probably say something like: “You’re not going out like that, are you?” But of course he always did.One of the first on-screen things Vernon did was an advert for PlayStation. It was on at the cinema, not the television, so me and Gladys went along and asked the person at the counter: “Is there an advertisement for PlayStation in this film, and if so please could we get two tickets?” Seeing him on the big screen was great.Ever after all his success, he’s still grounded. If all this fails, he’d find something else to do. Like lorry drivingI got my first paper round when I was 10. By 12, I had two jobs. Since then, I haven’t stopped working. As well as driving lorries, I was in a house band at a pub, so I would come home from work on a Friday and on Saturday night I would go out and play my guitar for another wage. I loved it. That being said, my biggest regret is not watching the kids being brought up. I should have recognised it back then, but I was concentrating on making money. Every penny of it was spent on Vernon and his brother.Vernon always talks about me on the radio, so now I feel like the most famous lorry driver in Britain, even though I’ve not driven a lorry in 10 years. I still watch all of his TV shows, too. My feedback? “You want your hair cut.” Or: “You look tired. Have you been out?”Even after all his success, he’s still our Vernon. He is just as grounded as he was back then. I know that if all this fails, he’d find something else to do. Like lorry driving. Although Gladys has said: “If I see either of you two with your bum on the seat of a lorry ever again, I’ll give you a bloody good hiding.”Explore more on these topicsVernon KayFlashbackFamilyPhotographyRadioTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You’ve been careful with your details so you can’t work out what has gone wrong, but you have made one mistake – recycling part of your password.Reusing the same word in a password – even if it is altered to include numbers or symbols – gives criminals a way in to your accounts.Brandyn Murtagh, an ethical “white hat” hacker, says information obtained through data breaches on sites such as DropBox and Tumblr and through cyber-attacks has been circulating on the internet for some time.Hackers obtain passwords and test them out on other websites – a practice known as credential stuffing – to see whether they can break into accounts.But in some cases they do not just try the exact passwords from the hacked data: as well as credential stuffing, the fraudsters also attempt to access accounts with derivations of the hacked password.Research from Virgin Media O2 suggests four out of every five people use the same or nearly identical passwords on online accounts.Using a slightly altered passwords – such as Guardian1 instead of Guardian – is almost an open door for hackers to compromise online accounts, Murtagh says.Working with Virgin Media O2, he has shown volunteers how easy it is to trace their password when they supply their email address, often getting a result within minutes.A spokesperson for Virgin Media O2 says: “Human behaviour is quite easy to model. [Criminals] know, for example, you might use one password and then add a full stop or an exclamation mark to the end.”What the scam looks likeThe criminals use scripts – automated sets of instructions for the computer – to go through variations of the passwords in an attempt to access other accounts. This can happen on an industrial scale, says Murtagh.“It’s very rare that you are targeted as an individual – you are [usually] in a group of thousands of people that are getting targeted. These processes scale just like they would in business,” he says.You might be alerted by messages saying that you have been trying to change your email address or other details connected to an account.What to doChange any passwords that are variations on the same word – Murtagh advises starting with the most important four sets of accounts: banks, email, work accounts and mobile.Use password managers – these are often integrated into web browsers. Apple has iCloud Keychain while Androids have Google Password Manager, both of which can suggest and save complicated passwords.Put in place two-factor authentication or multi-factor authentication (2FA or MFA), which mean means you have two steps to log into a site.Explore more on these topicsMoneyScam watchCybercrimeScamsHackingInternetfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He had the kind of schedule that would be familiar to any occupant of Downing Street. From 8.44am, he talked with his aides, then chaired cabinet, ate lunch, prepped for prime minister’s questions, took a briefing on security threats, and got ready for an interview with one of Rupert Murdoch’s reporters.The entry for 5.48pm in the official log for Tuesday 26 April 2022 contains one of several privileged interactions that he would later seek to exploit for financial gain. Johnson was in his office, the log notes, “alone texting MBS”.Within two years, Johnson, by then out of office, would be trying to use the relationship he nurtured with Saudi Arabia’s Mohammed bin Salman, widely known by his initials, as part of an intercontinental campaign of self-enrichment.Those widespread commercial activities, which raise questions about misuse of public funds and breaches of “revolving door” prohibitions on lobbying, have been exposed this week by the Guardian after a leak from Johnson’s private office.The crown prince, heir to a fossil-fuel fortune that makes his family among the richest that has ever lived, had established himself as the all-powerful ruler of Saudi Arabia, and a player on the global stage.Johnson had also spoken to Prince Mohammed on the phone for seven minutes shortly after 8pm the previous night, according to the logs seen by the Guardian.View image in fullscreenBoris Johnson and Mohammed bin Salman before a meeting in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in March 2022.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/APThey discussed international developments, the war in Ukraine and “cooperation between their countries and ways to develop it”. Six advisers had been with Johnson on that call. Now it was just him and the crown prince, texting.The moment captures the intimacy that can be shared by fellow holders of high office, two individuals with the power of nations at their disposal. Once their exchange was over, Johnson set off for an outing in the West End to catch Six the musical with his wife, Carrie.We do not know what the prime minister and the autocrat were messaging about, although Johnson has spoken fondly of a man he calls a “changemaker”.What we do now know is the contents of a letter addressed to Prince Mohammed that Johnson wrote two years later, in March 2024, after the collapse of his prime ministership. “I remain a fervent admirer of the vision you have for the kingdom of Saudi Arabia,” a draft of the letter reads.The text appears beneath the letterhead of the Office of Boris Johnson, the private office that is part-subsidised by the taxpayer.Johnson explains that he has taken up a business venture. “I would very much like to explore whether that company could be useful to you and the kingdom of Saudi Arabia in achieving your ambitions – because I believe it certainly could.”The letter is in a cache of leaked documents obtained by Distributed Denial of Secrets, a US non-profit that archives data leaks.The files shed new light on Johnson’s time in Downing Street, from secret meetings with tech and media executives to yet more details of possible Covid lockdown breaches.But the revelations about his commercial activity, and numerous apparent breaches of ethics rules, could prove most difficult for Johnson. They tally with an apparent disdain for the ethical norms of public life observed by some of those who have worked with him at close quarters.Max Hastings, his editor at the Daily Telegraph in the 1980s, hasallegedJohnson “cares for no interest save his own fame and gratification”.His supporters might point out he is not the first former prime minister to be criticised for the way he has sought to cash in after his time in office. It is perhaps telling that the others have also gone to the Gulf.‘An unforgivable crime’In his memoir, Unleashed, Johnson writes: “Tony Blair once told me that Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince, was ‘the hope of the region’, and I can see why.”The Saudi royal’s admirers call him a reformer. He is relaxing some of the most draconian restrictions on what women are permitted to do and opening the Islamic kingdom to outsiders. He has also proved a generous friend to veterans of Downing Street. The Tony Blair Institute receives Saudi funding and was awarded acontract, reportedly worth about £8m, to support Prince Mohammed’s agenda. During David Cameron’s time as a hired lobbyist for the soon-to-be-disgraced Australian financier Lex Greensill, the pair wentcampingwith Prince Mohammed in the Saudi desert.Both former PMs maintained their Saudi relationships after an incident in 2018 that, critics said, revealed the true face of the regime. Jamal Khashoggi, a dissident writer living in the US was lured to the Saudi embassy in Istanbul, murdered and dismembered. In 2021, US intelligence agenciesconcludedthat Prince Mohammed “approved” the operation.Johnson, in private at least, appeared to have been fully aware of the gravity of the Khashoggi episode. In April 2023, a year on from the evening he sat texting the crown prince, Johnson was asked about Khashoggi’s assassination during a private event in North Carolina, according to a transcript in the leaked data.Johnson was by then out of Downing Street, but still an MP. He had already embarked on a global speaking tour that, the leaked files show, earned him more than £5m from 34 speeches, from Lagos to Singapore. He even provided the entertainment at a German businessman’s 50th birthday party.At the North Carolina event his view of the Khashoggi was unvarnished. “I think that, first of all, nobody should minimise what happened to Jamal Khashoggi. I hope you heard me say that loud and clear. I’ve raised it with MBS, as you’d expect.” The killing of the journalist, Johnson said, was “clearly an unforgivable crime”.Yet Johnson would soon be telling the crown prince of his “fervent” admiration. By the time Johnson resigned as an MP, he had already set up his private office. Like those of all former prime ministers, Johnson’s office can claim an allowancefrom the taxpayerof up to £115,000 a year. That money is strictly for use on public duties.The leaked files raise questions about whether funds, which are used to pay the salaries of staff in the offices of former PMs, were misused in pursuit of profit. Johnson’s office employs three staff. All three, the leaked data suggests, have been involved in commercial activity.It is perhaps unsurprising that Johnson would launch an intensive money-making operation. After the scandal over the Downing Street refurbishment (complete with “gold” wallpaper), one of Johnson’s No 10 aides was quoted as saying: “The bottom line is that he can’t afford to be prime minister.” For one thing, he has nine children to support, and remunerative projects, such as a long overduebook on Shakespeare, sometimes fail to materialise.The leaked documents indicate that his part-time role at a company called Better Earth would be worth £120,000 a year as well as an initial 12.5% stake in the business. Founded by a Canadian mining investor, Better Earth’s shareholders include seven close associates and advisers to Johnson, including two former Conservative ministers and an aide he made a peer.It was for Better Earth that Johnson penned the overtures to the Saudi crown prince in March 2024. The pitch: to assist with the greening of the foremost petrostate. “Although I now live a life of blameless rustic obscurity in Oxfordshire,” Johnson wrote, “I remain deeply committed to carbon reduction.”It is not clear how the Saudis responded or how much money Johnson brought in. But this was not the only time he sought to trade on relationships nurtured in No 10.“As you know,” he wrote in a draft letter to seek business from another senior figure in the Gulf he knew from his Downing Street years, “a key part of my legacy as prime minister of the United Kingdom was coalescing world leaders around a series of concrete commitments at the Cop26 climate summit in 2021.”View image in fullscreenBoris Johnson (back right) and Khaldoon al-Mubarak (front left) at the signing of agreements between the UAE and the UK in 2021.Photograph: Ministry of Presidential AffairsThe files suggest Johnson and an aide had been offered stakes potentially worth millions in a “climate finance solutions” venture. Part of his job was to lobby the Abu Dhabi official who controls one of the emirate’s vast pots of oil wealth. Johnson’s partners in the firm, Bia Advisory, wanted more than $1bn of Abu Dhabi’s money to invest, the leaked files suggest. They did not respond to the Guardian’s questions about whether they got it.But the documents appear to confirm that Johnson lobbied the official, Khaldoon al-Mubarak, best known in the UK as chair of Manchester City.For the first two years after they leave office, former UK ministers are banned from using contacts gained in government for private benefit. However, Johnson had hosted Mubarak at least three times in Downing Street.Johnson also appears to have broken the same rule during his Saudi venture. The Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba) is the “revolving door” watchdog responsible for monitoring the post-government careers of ex-ministers. He sought Acoba clearance for his role at Better Earth, seemingly without disclosing the Saudi angle. Acoba granted it, but with conditions. Until he had been out of office for two years, Johnson “should not become personally involved in lobbying contacts you developed during your time in office in other governments” to seek business. According to the leaked files, he already had.No such restrictions on turning power into money constrain the sheikhs. “The Gulf is the one part of the world where kleptocracy is not just legal, but positively encouraged,” said Oliver Bullough, the author of Butler to the World, a book about how the UK serves the rich, powerful and corrupt. “It’s no wonder politicians flock there, though it would be nice if they didn’t.”A meeting with MaduroAt first, when the Guardian contacted him to ask about the apparent misconduct revealed in the leaked files, Johnson was silent. After the first articles were published, senior politicians said the government shouldsuspendJohnson’s access to the public duty costs allowance (PDCA), the funding intended to support an ex-PM’s public duties.At that point, Johnson got in touch. “This story is rubbish,” he emailed. “The PDCA has been used entirely in accordance with the rules.” He added: “The Guardian should change its name to Pravda.”But it is Johnson’s truthfulness that is, not for the first time, under scrutiny.On 18 March 2024, the leaked files show, Johnson was sent a letter from Acoba officials. Newspapers had revealed that a hedge fund manager took Johnson with him to Caracas to meet Nicolás Maduro, the head of a Venezuelan regime notorious for corruption and brutalising opponents. The Acoba officials wanted to know whether this might have breached their rules.Almost £10m of public money spent on subsidies for former PMsRead more“The meeting was unpaid,” Johnson told them in his reply. That seems to be contradicted by documents in the leaked files. One is a contract with Merlyn, the hedge fund on whose behalf Johnson met with Maduro – a leader he had once likened to a “dictator of an evil regime”. Another records Johnson’s office sending Merlyn an invoice, weeks before his letter to Acoba, for £240,000.Rules such as Acoba’s have evolved as part of a system designed to preserve public faith that their elected representatives are acting in the common interest rather than their own. Sue Hawley of Spotlight on Corruption, a non-profit, says: “If you have people at the top of government displaying the sense that they don’t have to live by the rules ordinary people have to live by, that percolates down.”A recentstudyby the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development asked: “If a politician was offered a well-paid job in the private sector in exchange for a political favour, how likely do you think it is that they would refuse it?” Unlikely, said two-thirds of Britons, the highest rate of any of the 30 rich countries surveyed.

This year has recorded the highest concerns over immigration – outside of one other period during the 2015 Europe migrant crisis – since polling company Ipsos started asking the question in 1974.But what do the figures really show – and do all of the claims made about immigrants add up?Immigration is falling – from a record highDespite public concern about immigration rising in recent months, official figures show that the number of people coming into the country is falling – albeit from a record high peak.Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that net migration has mainly hovered between 200,000 and 300,000 peoplea year since 2011. However, since Brexit came into effect on New Year’s Eve 2020, there has been a large increase in the number of immigrants. Commentators and critics have called this the “Boriswave”, as it occurred following the new post-Brexit immigration system introduced by Boris Johnson.Recent figures show that the wave is subsiding. Net migration fell by half in 2024, and recent rule changes mean it is expected to fall further. This is largely because of a decrease in health and care visas. Fewer people are now escaping the Ukraine war or fleeing the Taliban through the now closed Afghan humanitarian scheme.Net migration graphicStudent visas have also declined. Applications were down 1.5%in August(when student visa applications spiked ahead of the academic year) compared with 2024, and down 18% on the same month in 2023.Who are the migrants, and how many can work?In comments to the BBC following his conference speech, Reform leader Nigel Farage blamed Johnson for “millions of people being allowed into Britain, most of whom by the way don’t even work and are costing us a fortune”. However, the available evidence complicates his version of events.Most people seeking asylum are not allowed to work until their application has been accepted. But despite the large media focus on small boats and asylum seekers, these only make up a tiny proportion of the overall number of people coming to the UK –less than 5%of Home Office visas granted and arrivals detected in 2025.Migration by type in year to June 2025.The largest proportion of people coming into the UK is made up of students (about 47%, including dependants). Students aren’t expected to work, but do contribute by paying fees towards their degrees, and can’t get indefinite leave to remain so either leave the UK or contribute by moving into paid work afterwards.The second largest group are people on working visas, who make up 20%, with their dependants making up 11%.How many people on other visas work?Currently, the published data on immigrant earnings is patchy – and isn’t helped by ongoing issues with the ONSlabour force survey.Madeleine Sumption, director of theMigrationObservatory at the University of Oxford said that while the data on employment was imperfect and rates “vary widely by immigration category”, the figures suggested employment rates among recent migrants were “not far off existing residents or long-standing migrants”.A Home Officereportmanaged to link some visa types that were granted between 2019 and 2023, to pay as you earn (PAYE) earnings in the 2023-24 financial year – with most of them recording earnings. As for those without records, it’s probable most will have already left the country.It’s not just people on working visas who work. The report also found that almost half of people entering on family visas (48%) had some PAYE earnings (and again that’s not including those who are self employed or left the country).Much of the talk around immigration recently has focused on dependants – family members who are allowed to immigrate alongside the main visa holder. New health and care workers were prevented from bringing their children and other dependants by the Sunak government, as were most students.Graphic showing occupations of those on dependant visas.The PAYE data suggests many dependants do in fact work – 67% of health and care worker dependants, 45% of skilled worker dependants, and 25% of senior or specialist visa dependants received earnings (once again – these don’t take into account the self-employed, or the fact that many will have left the country. Adjusting the figures to account for the primary visa holders that have left raises the estimates further).Among all the different types of people coming to the UK, newly arrived refugees (around 28% according to some estimates) and those on humanitarian visas are the least likely to be in work.In terms of overall earnings, the Migration Observatory found that the immigrant earnings grow quickly – the median non-EU immigrant worker in 2024 earned similar or slightly more than the median UK worker.So will recent migrants – as Farage stated – cost the UK a fortune in the long run? Based on the available data we still can’t tell – but given the fact that most people moving to the UK won’t be going through the school system, and also have to pay towards their NHS treatment, it’s unlikely they would cost more than others.Ipsos graphicExplore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumMigrationHome OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

Now the mystery has been solved, with forensic scientists formally identifying Tenório Júnior’s body – and confirming he was a victim of Argentina’s bloody dictatorship.“He left his hotel in the centre of the city and the earth ate him,” said Carlos “Maco” Somigliana of the Argentinian Forensic Anthropology Team (EAAF). “Nothing more was ever known – until now.”Tenório Júnior, known to most as Tenorinho, was regarded as one of the leading figures of the bossa nova movement –Brazil’s celebrated fusion of samba and jazz. Onecriticpraised him as a pianist with “hands of gold” and an “enormous future”.On 17 March 1976, during a South American tour, he performed alongside the Brazilian legends Vinícius de Moraes and Toquinho at the Gran Rex in Buenos Aires. Around 3am the following morning, the 34-year-old left his downtown hotel in search of cigarettes and aspirin, and was never seen again.In the days that followed, his fellow musicians searched frantically, combing through the hospitals and morgues. Moraes, the lyricist of The Girl from Ipanema, filed a habeas corpus writ and appealed directly to the Brazilian ambassador. By then, Tenorinho, a husband and father of four, was already dead: he had been seized by the Argentinian military and executed, his body dumped in wasteland 30km away.His killing came less than a week before a military coup d’état, which plunged the country into a dark chapter of fear, torture and forced disappearances.Over seven years, tens of thousands of political opponents, student activists, journalists, intellectuals – and countless bystanders – would be abducted, held in clandestine detention centres, tortured and killed.Some were thrown alive from planes, others disposed of in mass graves. Human rights groups estimate that as many as 30,000 people were disappeared.Decades after Tenorinho’s disappearance, at the2014 National Truth Commission, his widow, Carmen Magalhães Tenório Cerqueira, demanded answers for what happened to her husband. “Where is Tenorinho?” she pressed. “Tenório was a person who never had any involvement with politics. He was a person who lived for music … And what happened to him is really something that … is absurd,” she said.View image in fullscreenCarlos Somigliana of the Argentinian Forensic Anthropology Team.Photograph: Harriet BarberToquinho channelled his pain into a song called Lembranças, or Memories: “Tenório went out alone into the night / He disappeared / No one could explain.”‘You couldn’t trust anyone’: documenting Argentina’s military dictatorship – photo essayRead moreOver the years, various witnesses came forward; a man working at a newsstand near the hotel said he saw Tenorinho taken away in a green Ford Falcon –the infamous car of choice used by Argentina’s death squads.Official confirmation of what happened would finally come thanks, primarily, to an Argentinian forensic team which to this day excavates and identifies those disappeared by the military regime.The group was originally set up by the Texas forensic anthropologist Dr Clyde Snow – renowned for identifying the skeleton of the Nazi doctor Josef Mengele – after Argentina’s return to democracy. They made an unusual team at first; unable to find willing colleagues, with many Argentinians still fearful of a return to the dictatorship, Snow had instead recruited a collection of anthropology students.“None of us were jumping with joy to do this, because if we started to work on this and a new military coup occurred, we would end up on the list of people who could disappear,” said Mercedes “Mimi” Doretti, one of the founders,last year. “But at the same time, we couldn’t say no.”Decades on, the group continues to search for the victims of the dictatorship, scouring archives, interviewing witnesses, corroborating timelines and conducting digs at suspected mass graves. Today, technological advances also have made it possible to conduct mass fingerprint comparisons – the technique that ultimately led to Tenorinho’s discovery. More than 1,500 bodies have been recovered, and more than 840 people identified.“At the same time that the state had been torturing, killing and throwing people from planes, they kept their bureaucratic ways of working, recording deaths, taking fingerprints of the corpses,” said Somigliana, who has worked with the EAAF since 1986. “In many cases, the state tried to avoid this, by burning the bodies, cutting hands off, but in others they left a chain of documents.”While the team had been seeking Tenorinho’s fingerprints for some years, his case gained momentum in 2024, when the office of the prosecutor for crimes against humanity found an old file containing the details of a murder victim who had “appeared in a small unoccupied piece of land” in the Tigre district on 20 March 1976.“The death certificate said ‘man with many gunshots, around 30 years old, with a beard’,” said Somigliana.View image in fullscreenDr Clyde Snow and the EAAF.Photograph: No credit“We compared the fingerprints with all of those people kidnapped in Argentina, and there was no match. Why? Because he was not from Argentina. Then we asked for the fingerprints from Brazil, and when they came, we were able to confirm that this body was him.”Tenorinho’s unnamed body was buried at the Benavídez municipal cemetery on 22 March 1976, but later excavated and put into a common grave. At present, there are no plans to begin exhumations of the common grave.While the identification does not in itself prove the military killed Tenorinho, the manner of his murder and the way his body was discarded mirror the fate of countless others disappeared by the military.His remains were discovered in the same area where other victims of clandestine detention centres had been dumped, cases later proven to be linked directly to the regime. He was also shot more than once, the typical way the military killed victims. While the typical registration of the death – taking the fingerprints and photos of the body – was conducted, his identification was not completed, a further hallmark of state crimes. The EAAF said they had no reason to doubt Tenorinho was a victim of state terrorism in the days before the military coup.Tenorinho, who was born in Laranjeiras in Rio de Janeiro, was one of11 Brazilianskidnapped in Argentina during the dictatorship. He had no political affiliations, and it has long been surmised that he was picked up for how he looked: he wore glasses and had a long beard, features the dictatorship associated with leftists.View image in fullscreenTenorinho on his wedding day.Photograph: c/o FamilyHe left behind his wife, Carmen, who was eight months pregnant at the time of his disappearance, and four other children. His parents, who for years sought answers to their son’s whereabouts, died around the 10th anniversary of his murder. His surviving family was informed of theidentification this week.Carmen has passed away, along with two of the children. In a statement, the three remaining children said: “We received the news of the identification of our father’s body with surprise, of course, and with a mixture of relief and sadness. Relief because, finally, we can know with more certainty what happened to him in that sad March of 1976. Somehow, we will be closer – saddened by the confirmation that Tenório was a victim of violence and buried as an unknown, far from family, friends, music colleagues.”They said his death deprived them of his company and forced their mother to raise five children alone, one who was born a month after their father’s disappearance. “Tenório never met his youngest son, nor his eight grandchildren,” the children wrote. “We still want and need answers. Who killed Tenório? Why? Why kill a man with no political involvement, who only lived for music?”Tenorinho’s identification comes against an emerging climate of denialism in Argentina.In late 2023, Argentina elected Javier Milei as its president – a hard-right leader who has been accused byrights organisationsof attempting to “rewrite the history” of the dictatorship’s crimes. He has previously declared “there were no 30,000” people disappeared, and called into question the extent of the military’s crimes. His party has also begun dismantling the Human Rights Secretariat, downgrading the body and recently laying off hundreds ofworkers.Last year six lawmakers from Milei’s La Libertad Avanza party visited a jail to meet prisoners convicted of crimes against humanity committed during the 1976-83 dictatorship, including Alfredo Astiz, the so-called “Angel of Death”. The politicians later claimed they were reviewing the living conditions of the detainees.‘Justification of dictatorship’: outcry as Milei rewrites Argentina’s historyRead moreThe office of the prosecutor for crimes against humanity, nonetheless, is continuing its dictatorship-era work and is reviewing cases involving the discovery of unidentified corpses in public streets in the province of Buenos Aires between 1975 and 1983.“We have already identified approximately 600 files, 475 of which are under analysis,” said María Ángeles Ramos, one of the country’s lead federal prosecutors of dictatorship-era crimes.The EAAF, which operates as a non-profit, is also committed to continuing its work. The team has become world-renowned, finding and identifying remains all over the world including genocide victims in Darfur, and the bodies of the Chilean president Salvador Allende and the guerrilla Che Guevara.Explore more on these topicsArgentinaBrazilAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

New entrants such as Chery, which started to sell its own-brand petrol SUVs this month, have sold about 20,000 new cars in the UK since launching the Omoda and Jaecoo brands here earlier this year.New models for import are assessed for risk on behalf of insurers, with tests including a two-minute “attack test”, whose results led to a range of Chinese prototypes being beefed up against car thieves.Ben Townsend, the head of automotive at Thatcham Research, a vehicle risk intelligence company, said: “We’ve worked closely with Chinese vehicle manufacturers advising on vehicle security enhancements for the UK market.“In China, vehicle crime is not the same challenge we experience in the UK and Europe, so certain anti-theft features – like immobilisers, door shielding to prevent access to internal locking mechanisms, and software-based intrusion detection – haven’t historically been prioritised.”He added: “These features often don’t require major structural interventions, which means they can be applied to completed new models, and we’ve found Chinese brands to be highly responsive and agile in implementing improvements.”Chery executives said modifications had been swiftly delivered in the Chinese production process. Factory and other staff typically work a six-day week, on lower wages that have contributed to Chinese cars underpricing western comparators.Oli Lowe, the UK head of product for Chery UK, said the Chinese manufacturer had dedicated regional research and development centres to get its cars ready for sale here. He said: “Simple but crucial adaptations, such as the addition of locking wheel bolts, ensure that vehicles not only meet local requirements but also deliver enhanced security and customer confidence for our buyers in the UK.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Parents at the centre were not notified that it had been placed in the high risk cohort or of the notifications to the regulator being examined as part of the increased scrutiny on the centre.All but two of these notifications were closed without disciplinary action being taken. The regulator found that apart from the two instances, there had been no breaches of regulation on the part of the centre. The sexual abuse allegation was reported to the Department of Education’s investigations team, but the investigation was closed “with noting [sic] being able to be substantiated”, the report said.Education ministers agreed to legislative changes in August that would require the publication of any breaches or compliance actions against childcare services.It’s unconscionable for the regulator to be wilfully withholding highly relevant safety informationAbigail BoydBut these only apply to instances where the incident has been substantiated and action had been taken – not cases that were investigated and closed with no regulatory breaches found. In the case of this NSW childcare centre, two out of 22 reports were followed by compliance actions.The childcare centre has since been removed from the high risk cohort, with the Department of Education officer writing: “The service has made progress throughout 2025. The number of notifications has dropped and reporting obligations continue to be met.” It was commended in the report for “turning things around”.“The service has been reflective and has made changes to improve its internal processes and prevent similar issues in the future.”The secret risk rating systemAbout 18% of services in NSW were rated high or very high risk in the secret risk rating system, with fewer than 5% in the highest risk category, as of 1 August, the NSW Department of Education told Guardian Australia.The existence of a secret risk rating system, the RA (risk assessment) risk rating of services (RRS), was highlighted by theWheeler review into the childcare sectorin NSW, conducted earlier this year.Chris Wheeler’s review found that there were often “differences between the quality rating (that may be some years old) and the RA risk rating of services [RRS]”.Wheeler found the public rating was a measure of general safety and quality issues, whereas the RRS considered these issues “alongside compliance information which is more dynamic and up to date”.He found that the secret risk rating likely gave a better sense of “the actual and current risk to the wellbeing of children enrolled in a service” despite the fact that it was not available to parents.The NSW Department of Education said the public rating was a national rating, whereas the RRS was a NSW-based assessment tool.A spokesperson said that the risk rating system was “used to inform the timing of the next assessment and rating, the frequency of visits and the intensity of the regulatory oversight”.“Risk levels will continue to be an internal tool used by the regulatory authority to ensure resources are focused on the safety of children and lifting and maintaining the quality of education and care services.”As part of his report, Wheeler compared the quality and risk ratings of 34 services. He found that 66.6% of services that were publicly rated as “exceeding” national standards – the highest rating – were rated either “high” or “very high” risk in the secret rating system.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What we need to be doing, and what we are demanding, is creating a sector where standards of the highest quality are the norm so families, carers and children can have the confidence that no matter which service they use there will be safety, dignity and respect for children and workers.”The reports made against the NSW childcare centreAfter placing the childcare service – the report into which has been seen by Guardian Australia – in the “very high risk” cohort, officers monitored all complaints and notifications of incidents at the centre between April 2024 and April 2025.Among those 22 notifications included a disclosure by a child of sexual abuse by an educator, which was referred to the regulator’s investigations team and later marked as closed “with noting [sic] being able to be substantiated”.Another incident involved a child who was taken to the bathroom by their parent at the service and the parent observed blood when wiping her child. The child was taken for medical assessment and hospital discharge papers confirmed the child’s diagnosis. The officers recommended closing the case “as no regulatory breaches or child protection concerns were identified”.Other incidents included a parent complaining their child was “consistently” “wet” during collection time; another that involved a parent complaining her child was not provided with water while in care; and a complaint by a staff member that she was bullied by staff and management. These were all closed.There were also several injuries reported, including one that involved an educator allegedly grabbing a child by the arm and causing them to fall off a pole they were climbing on. The educator was terminated after an investigation.Another incident involved a child injuring another child. When investigators examined the case, they found the service was out of ratio at the time of the incident, with only two-thirds of the required number of educators working directly with the children at the time.The centre was found to have responded appropriately in response to these cases.Can Australia’s new childcare safety policies keep our children safe? The devil is in the detailsRead more“Since joining the RRS cohort, they’ve submitted 22 notifications – most of which were closed without any regulatory breaches,” said the report. “Only two compliance actions were issued, both of which were responded to within adequate time frames and addressed all concerns adequately. The service has been reflective and made changes to improve its internal processes and prevent similar issues in the future.”In April 2025, the Department of Education recommended that the service be removed from the high risk cohort, noting that “the service has made progress throughout 2025. The number of notifications has dropped and reporting obligations continue to be met.”In Australia, children, young adults, parents and teachers can contact theKids Helplineon 1800 55 1800; adult survivors can seek help atBlue Knot Foundationon 1300 657 380.

The capital share is the portion going to the owners of capital and land, including company profits.Unions decried asurge in the profit shareof national income in 2022, before Labor’s jobs and skills summit in September of that year, which the government used as a platform to push through reforms to workplace laws.A graph showing the shift in wages share of national income over timeAs surging inflation undermined workers’ real wages and mining companies’ revenues surged amid a spike in commodity prices into 2023, there were also accusations of companies’ profiteering from the cost of living crisis.Bustamente said companies were now finding it harder to pass on higher wage costs to their customers, which was leaving more in the pockets of workers and also easing pressures on inflation.Meaningful increases to the minimum wage over recent years had also played a role.After a decade of stagnant wages through the 2010s, Bustamante said there was evidence in the national accounts figures released last week that a high labour share could prove to be a new “equilibrium”, mimicking earlier periods of low unemployment.It was also a positive starting point as workplaces prepare for the potentially disruptive impact of artificial intelligence.“IfAI generates productivity improvements– which the IMF has estimated at an extra 1.5 percentage points of productivity a year – then if you can keep the labour market tight, there’s no reason the wages share needs to go down,” Bustamante said.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailGianni La Cava, research director at e61 Institute, said the profits versus labour share was often used as a proxy for whether “the capitalists are winners or the workers are winners”.While these arguments were “mostly politics”, La Cava said, movements in the wages share of national income was still a “pretty good indicator of worker bargaining power”.“If it is a sustained increase since Covid, say over a few years, that would be a meaningful thing and it would suggest sustained cost pressures for firms.”La Cava agreed that “the post-Covid strength in the labour share is related to the hot and inclusive labour market”.“But I think the slightly longer-run trend is probably linked to the slowdown in productivity growth in the market sector.”When real wages are growing faster than productivity growth, then employers are internalising the extra cost and so take a smaller share of the total income.Saul Eslake, an independent economist, said “the distribution of national income is a political, social and economic issue”.“The wages share of national income has been declining for quite some time,” Eslake said.“One of the points the ACTU made at the [economic reform] roundtable is that in order to get agreement on what needed to be done to reverse the slide in productivity growth, it’s reasonable to do that on the basis that the fruits of any improvement would be fairly shared.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian economyWages growthnewsShareReuse this content"

In an official statement, the Vuelta organisers said: “For security reasons, stage 21 of La Vuelta has been ended early. There will be no podium ceremony.”Pidcock ready for podium as Vingegaard all but guarantees Vuelta triumph with stage winRead moreSpanish media reported that about 3,000 protesters were at the finish line and it was also claimed that there had been violent exchanges between police and protesters. Security sources told Spanish media they had “to charge at the protesters who were throwing barriers and bottles”. The Spanish government later said more than 100,000 people were at the rally in Madrid.Afterdays of vociferous protestsdirected towards the Israel Premier Tech team, extra police had been brought into Madrid in a bid to secure the final stage, in what was the largest security operation since the city hosted a Nato summit in 2022.A huge crowd of protesters pushed over race barriers, close to the Plaza de Colón and Gran Vía, as security forces lost control of the situation. Police charged some of the protesters and fired teargas, but the race route was overwhelmed.As the peloton arrived in Madrid, with 56km to race, riders at the rear were delayed and also pushed by protesters holding anti‑Israel banners. The race organisers then stopped the front of the race and lengthy discussions with the Guardia Civil led to the decision to cancel the stage.Soon afterwards, a glum-looking Vingegaard was seen sharing a muted celebratory handshake with his teammates, as he made his way directly to his team hotel.View image in fullscreenBarriers are smashed by pro-Palestine protesters at the finish line of the final stage in Madrid.Photograph: Ana Beltran/ReutersBefore the stage the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, had expressed his “admiration” for the demonstrators. Speaking in Málaga, he said: “We would like to express our gratitude and absolute respect for the athletes but also our admiration for the Spanish people who mobilise for just causes, such as Palestine.”The Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Saar, said: “He encouraged protesters to take to the streets. The pro-Palestinian mob listened to the inciting messages and attacked La Vuelta. The sporting event that has always been a source of pride forSpainhas been cancelled. Sánchez and his government: shame on Spain!”The collapse of the third biggest Grand Tour of the year has plunged World Tour racing into crisis, with the continued presence of the Israel Premier Tech team, recently endorsed by Benjamin Netanyahu, the object of the increasingly enraged protest groups at the roadside.A week ago, as pressure increased on the team, owned by the billionaire entrepreneur Sylvan Adams, to withdraw from the Vuelta, Netanyahu posted: “Great job to Sylvan and Israel’s cycling team for not giving in to hatred and intimidation. You make Israel proud!”View image in fullscreenThere were some clashes between protesters and police, who had mounted Madrid’s biggest security operation since Spain hosted the Nato summit in 2022.Photograph: Rodrigo Jimenez/EPAThedisruptions throughout the three-week raceaffected multiple stages and led to the cancellation of planned stage finishes and the shortening of the race distance.Vingegaard, speaking last Monday to Danish media, said of the protests: “People do it for a reason. It’s horrible what’s happening currently and I think those protesting do so here, because they need a forum to be heard.”The Tour de France Grand Depart takes place in Barcelona in July next year and Spanish protest groups are targeting the French race. The Palestinian campaign for the academic and cultural boycott of Israel told Swiss media “protests will continue at cycling races as long as hypocritical western institutions absolve Israel”, adding: “The immediate finish line is the end of the genocide.”Last week the civil disobedience group Futuro Vegetal said it was “very likely” that there would be further protests in Barcelona and added that “protesting at the Tour de France is the least we can do”.Despite the cancellation of the stage, Vingegaard still won the race overall, from the Portuguese João Almeida in second place. It was the Dane’s third Grand Tour victory, after his wins in the Tour de France in 2022 and 2023. Tom Pidcock, double Olympic gold medallist in mountain biking, took his first Grand Tour podium, finishing third overall. The planned podium ceremony and final presentation ceremony were cancelled.Explore more on these topicsVuelta a EspañaCyclingSpainEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The vote determines 20,000 seats in the councils of more than 320 towns, cities and municipalities as well as the positions of mayors and lord mayors across the state. Voter turnover was 59%, up from 2020.Merz’s conservative CDU fulfilled predictions that it would retain its dominant position in the state. The Social Democrats, its junior coalition partner in the federal government, came in second with 22.5%, a small drop from its result in 2020 that defied pollsters’ predictions that it was facing heavy losses.The SPD has struggled to retain support in some areas, in particular former coalmining regions where it was once sure of victory.The AfD’s strong showing lived up to pollsters’ predictions, more than tripling its standing from five years ago when it secured 5.1%, and giving its candidates who are running for mayoral positions a considerable chance of reaching second-round votes in two weeks’ time.The AfD’s gains appear to have been made on the back of heavy losses for the Greens and the pro-business Free Democratic party. The far-left Die Linke secured 5.5%, putting it above its 2020 result of 3.8%.View image in fullscreenThe elections in Germany’s most populous state were seen as the first significant test at the ballot box for Friedrich Merz as chancellor.Photograph: Christopher Neundorf/EPAPolitical observers say the vote indicates the AfD is on track to repeat the big gains it has made in the states of the former communist east, where it has been most successful at drawing on voters’ disgruntlement with the status quo. It has set as its goal to enter the federal government by 2027. Currently it is the largest opposition party in parliament.The vote took place against the backdrop of a weakened German economy, rising unemployment and growing unease over immigration – the AfD’s key issue. Merz has pledged to get the economy back on track, reduce immigration and cut the far right down to size.Since February’s federal election, the AfD has come top in several national opinion polls. The more success the AfD achieves in securing a foothold in local political positions, by securing mayoralties and councillor posts, the harder it will be for the mainstream parties to uphold their pledge to maintain a “firewall” preventing political collaboration with the AfD at the federal level, experts say.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But on immigration, where he has pledged to dramatically change Germany’s policy, voters have said they are not so convinced, despite the fact that numbers have dropped in recent months.The AfD has presented itself as a confident alternative, scoring points with voters on issues such as energy provision, education and above all immigration, even though these policy areas are not decided at the local level.Explore more on these topicsGermanyAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)The far rightFriedrich MerzEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The court could also delay the ruling.Speaking at Sunday’s rally, the CHP leader, Özgür Özel, said the government was trying to cling to power by undermining democratic norms and suppressing dissent after opposition victories in local elections over the past year.Özel also called for a snap general election. “This case is political. The accusations are slander. Our comrades are innocent. What’s being done is a coup – a coup against the future president, against the future government. We will resist, we will resist, we will resist,” he said in his address to the crowd.View image in fullscreenThe CHP leader, Özgür Özel, told the rally the government was trying to cling to power by undermining democratic norms.Photograph: Necati Savaş/EPAThe government says the judiciary is independent and denies any political motives.Turkey has detained more than 500 people, including 17 mayors, over the last year in Istanbul and other CHP-run municipalities around the country as part of corruption investigations, according to a Reuters review.Hundreds of members of the CHP have been jailed pending trial in a sprawling investigation into alleged corruption and terrorism links, among them Erdoğan’s main political rival, Istanbul’s mayor, Ekrem İmamoğlu.The arrest of İmamoğlu in Marchsparked the country’s largest protests in a decade where hundreds of thousands took to the streets, prompting a brief but sharp sell-off in the lira and other Turkish assets.In a letter sent from prison and read aloud at the rally in Ankara, İmamoğlu wrote that the government was attempting to predetermine the outcome of the next election by sidelining legitimate rivals. He also accused the government of undermining democracy through politically motivated judicial actions and other efforts to suppress dissent.“The era of ‘I’ in this country will end, and the era of ‘we’ will begin. One person will lose, and everyone else will win,” İmamoğlu wrote. The crowd applauded and chanted “President İmamoğlu” after the letter was read aloud.Explore more on these topicsTurkeyRecep Tayyip ErdoğanEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

If it happened inUkraine, by Ukrainian definitions, that would be regarded as a 100% success,” he said.Natoannounced on Fridaythat it would deploy more jets to the alliance’s eastern flank to protect against future drone attacks. On Saturday, Polish and allied aircraft were again deployed due to a renewed threat of drone strikes in western Ukraine. The airport in the eastern Polish city of Lublin was closed and people in border areas received SMS alerts to exercise caution. However, there was no reported incursion this time.On Saturday, Romaniabecame the latest Nato member state to report a Russian drone incursionin its airspace, scrambling two F-16 fighter jets to monitor the situation. The country’s defence ministry said it strongly condemned Russia’s actions, which were described by the EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, as unacceptable.Sikorski said the Polish response would have been “much tougher” if last week’s attack had caused injuries or deaths in its territory, but declined to elaborate on how such a response could look in a future scenario. “With an aggressor and a liar like Putin, only the toughest counter-pressures work,” he said.Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, last week said the incursion had brought his country closer to military conflict “than at any time since the second world war”. Sikorski rejected the suggestion byDonald Trumpthat “it could have been a mistake”, saying too many drones were involved. “You can believe that one or two veer off target, but 19 mistakes in one night, over seven hours, sorry, I don’t believe it,” he said.View image in fullscreenThe Polish president, Karol Nawrocki, visits the country’s largest airbase in Krzesiny, after the Russian drone incursion.Photograph: Łukasz Cynalewski/Agencja Wyborcza.pl/ReutersPolish anti-drone teams will receive training from Ukrainian operators to help defend against future attacks, said Sikorski. “The Ukrainians have better equipment for dealing with Russian drones, and they have much deeper and more up-to-date experience of resisting the Russian army,” he said.“This is something that the public and the governments in the west need urgently to integrate in their thinking … that it is the Ukrainians who will be training us how to stand up to Russia, not the other way around,” he added. Training for Polish teams on Ukrainian anti-drone best practice would take place at a Nato training centre inPoland, a “safer environment” than doing it in Ukraine.Sikorski was speaking on the sidelines of an annual conference in Kyiv that gathered the Ukrainian elite and international politicians to discuss prospects for the country after more than three years of full-scale war.Ukraine war briefing: Zelenskyy tells allies ‘stop looking for excuses’ on sanctions as Russian drone flies over RomaniaRead moreTrump addressed the Yalta European Strategy conference with a short video message, making his oft-repeated claim that the war would not have started if he were president, and claiming that “we’ve made more progress toward peace in the past three months than Joe Biden made in the whole three years”.Trump’s Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, was also in Kyiv, and told the conference the US president was becoming “exasperated” with Putin. But he cautioned European leaders who were frustrated with Trump’s apparent softness on the Russian leader not to push him too hard.“One thing I would advise anyone who is working with President Trump – do not put him in a position where he thinks he’s being used, that is probably the worst place you can be with him,” said Kellogg.Sikorski said he hoped Trump would receive the Nobel peace prize if he could achieve “a fair peace” in the conflict, which he described as “Ukraine within defensible borders and a Ukraine that is integrating with the west”. When it was suggested that Trump had so far showed not much sign of pressuring Putin to accept such an outcome, he said: “He has his personal style, we respect it, but we will judge it by results.”At a meeting in Paris earlier this month, 26 countriespromised to contribute to a postwar security missionfor Ukraine, some with boots on the ground. Some European countries have floated the idea that Ukraine, while unlikely to be admitted to Nato any time soon, could be given “article 5-like” guarantees after a future peace settlement, to prevent Russia attacking again.“Somecountries are talking about boots on the ground. We really want it because this is real deterrence which will be needed for Ukraine,” said Ihor Zhovkva, a senior aide to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Poland has said it would not contribute troops to such a mission and Sikorski, speaking to the conference, cautioned against grand rhetoric when it came to future guarantees.“Security guarantees are meant to deter a potential adversary … So what we are saying is that if there is some kind of peace, the next time Russia tries anything against Ukraine, we might go to war with Russia. Now I find that not very credible. Because if you want to go war with Russia, you can do it today and I see no volunteers. And there is nothing more dangerous in international relations than giving a guarantee that is not credible,” he said.Explore more on these topicsPolandUkraineRussiaDrones (military)Donald TuskDonald TrumpKarol NawrockinewsShareReuse this content"

Polish fighter jets scrambled on Saturday in response to fresh Russian drone strikes just over the border in Ukraine.Romania, a Nato member, has had several drone fragments crash on its territory since Moscow invaded Ukraine, especially as Russia has stepped up attacks on Ukrainian ports.In a statement after the drone entry on Saturday, Romania’s defence ministry said it “strongly condemns the irresponsible actions of the Russian Federation and emphasises that they represent a new challenge to regional security and stability in the Black Sea area”.It added that “such incidents demonstrate the Russian Federation’s lack of respect for international law”.The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said the incident was unacceptable and accused Moscow of a “reckless escalation”.Romania reported late on Saturday that its airspace had been breached by a drone during a Russian attack in neighbouring Ukraine. The country scrambled two F-16 fighter jets, which “detected a drone in national airspace” and tracked it until it dropped off the radar, the defence ministry said.In its statement, the ministry said a Geran drone used by Russia had entered Romanian airspace. It added that the drone “orbited for about 50 minutes, from north-east of [the village of] Chilia Veche to south-west of Izmail, and left national airspace near the town of Pardina, heading towards Ukraine”.Romania’s fighter jets were “supported by German allies … with two Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft”, which monitored the situation. The drone did not fly over populated areas and did not pose an imminent threat to the safety of the population, said the statement.Romania’s foreign minister, Oana Toiu, said on X that she would “raise Russia’s actions at [the] UN general assembly, urging a strict international adherence to sanctions”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This continued reckless escalation threatens regional security. We stand in solidarity with Romania. I am in close contact with the Romanian government.”Poland and its fellow Nato countries have been on their guard since Warsaw saidnearly 20 Russian drones entered its airspaceovernight Tuesday to Wednesday.While Russia denies targeting Poland, several European countries including France, Germany and Sweden have stepped up their support for defending Polish airspace in response.The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, warned that Russia was deliberately expanding its drone operations and that the west needed to respond with tougher sanctions and closer defence cooperation. The latest drone incursions were “an obvious expansion of the war by Russia”,he said. “The Russian military knows exactly where their drones are headed and how long they can operate in the air.”What was required in response were fresh sanctions against Russia and a collective defence system, Zelenskyy argued. “Do not wait for dozens of Shaheds and ballistic missiles before finally making decisions,” he said, referring to the Iranian-designed Shahed drones Russia is using.In February, the Romanian parliament adopted a law that made it possible for the country to shoot down drones breaching its airspace.Explore more on these topicsRomaniaPolandUkraineRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Titled Don’t Mention the Children, the poem was written in 2014 in response toa Guardian articleabout the Israeli government banning a radio advert naming children killed in Gaza. It begins:Don’t mention the children.Don’t name the dead children.The people must not know the namesof the dead children.“The first time I read Michael Rosen’s poem, not only was I profoundly moved, I was also in shock,” Pearce told the Guardian.“Rosen’s brutal commands stare directly into our soul and force us to confront the cruelty of erasing a child, erasing their name, their memory and their life.”Others featured include the actors Ambika Mod, Joely Richardson, Juliet Stevenson, Denise Gough, Khalid Abdalla, Zawe Ashton and Indira Varma; as well as the presenters Laura Whitmore and Nadia Sawalha, the model Poppy Delevingne, the emergency doctor Dr Mo Mustafa, the activist Stephen Kapos, and the poem’s creator, Michael Rosen.The project is paired with renewed calls by Save the Children and Choose Love for the UK government to “end its complicity in the horrors unfolding in Gaza and the West Bank”.They are urging the public to sign apetitiondemanding “the immediate suspension of all arms transfers to Israel; all perpetrators to be held to account and an end to Israel’s impunity; and decisive action to be taken to bring Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory to an end”.“We have all seen the devastating images of children inGaza, but with time comes a dangerous desensitisation – people look away, or the suffering is ignored, let alone justified by the perpetrators or those complicit,” Pearce said. “The simplicity of this poem doesn’t allow that escape.”He added: “Taking part in this recital was, for me, a matter of conscience. Every day in Gaza, children are being killed, maimed or starved – trapped in a nightmare they did nothing to create. We cannot allow this horror to be normalised. I urge everyone to speak out and to act. Silence is complicity.”At least 20,000 children have been killed in Gaza since October 2023, according to the health authorities in Gaza, though independent surveys suggest the figure is far higher. The photographer and Oscar-nominated director Misan Harriman, who spearheaded the film project, said children in Gaza had “endured a relentless stream of atrocities” for nearly two years.“Their homes, schools and hospitals destroyed, the deliberate use of starvation as a weapon. And still, the world does nothing to stop it,” he said.Save theChildrenhas been working in Gaza for decades, running primary healthcare centres and providing essential services including screening and treatment for malnutrition. But the aid organisation said it had been unable to get any of its own aid into Gaza since 2 March.Rosen said: “I wrote Don’t Mention the Children 11 years ago in response to an attempt to silence the names of children killed in Gaza. It is heartbreaking that the poem is still so relevant today – in fact, the situation for children has only grown worse.“Behind every number, every statistic, is a child with a name and a future that has been stolen. We cannot allow them to be erased. To deny their names is to deny their humanity, and we must resist that erasure at every turn.”Explore more on these topicsGazaChildrenPalestinian territoriesWest BankIsraelGuy PearceAnnie LennoxnewsShareReuse this content"

Part of his mission on this two-day visit is to convey Donald Trump’s irritation at the Tuesday’s Israeli missile strike on Doha that was aimed atHamasleadership but killed their aides and a Qatari security officer.The attack hasshaken faith among Washington’s alliesin the Arab world that the US can protect them, and particularly infuriated Qatar, a close ally who the US has encouraged to host Hamas officials and broker negotiations.On the eve of an emergency summit of Arab and Islamic leaders called byQatar, its prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani urged the international community to “stop using double standards” and punish Israel for what he described as its “crimes”.However, Rubio has signalled that he intends to balance criticism of Israel with a message of broad support for the country, at a time it is facing accusations of genocide, an arrest warrant for Netanyahu from the international criminal court, and a looming UN general assembly summit next week, at which some leading US allies including the UK, France, Canada, Australia and Belgium are expected to recognise the statehood of Palestine.Rubio, before his departure on Sunday, discussed the Qatar strike with reporters. “Obviously, we’re not happy about it. The president was not happy about it. Now we need to move forward and figure out what comes next,” Rubio said. He added, however, that the incident was “not going to change the nature of our relationship with the Israelis”.The Netanyahu government is seeking to play down any rift with theTrump administrationover the Doha strike, while remaining defiant over the attack.“We have a very close dialogue with the administration. We’re coordinated with them and, relatively speaking, the American reaction was reasonable,” the Israeli ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, said on Israeli army radio. “At the UN security council they expressed reservations, but the reservations were minor. We took into account that this would have a price.Israel’s strike on Hamas leaders in Qatar shatters Gulf’s faith in US protectionRead more“The Qataris are trying to ride on this. From their perspective, they are leveraging this incident. From our perspective, we delivered the clear message that we will pursue the terrorists everywhere.”Rubio’s public itinerary has been designed to emphasise biblical archeology favourable to Jewish claims to Jerusalem, which are at the heart of American evangelical support for Israel. At the Western Wall on Sunday, Israeli security officers separated female reporters from the press pack and confined them to a separate, adjacent compound, where they could not see Netanyahu or Rubio. Asked why, the officers said the two men were going to pray and the separation was for religious reasons.On Monday, Rubio is due to visit the City of David archaeological park, which has been established by a settler group in the Palestinian neighbourhood of Silwan. It includes a tunnel excavated under Palestinian homes which is supposed to mark the path taken by pilgrims to the Jewish temple in the Roman era. Critics say the park is an example of archeology being used in the service of politics.Rubio is being accompanied on his tour by the US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister who has been a fervent supporter of settler and Israeli territorial expansionism.View image in fullscreenPalestinians run for cover during an Israeli airstrike on a high-rise building in Gaza City this month.Photograph: Yousef al-Zanoun/APHuckabee has led the US defence of Israel’s war inGaza, where the official death toll is approaching 65,000, with thousands more feared buried in the ruins. Israel has ordered the estimated million people sheltering in Gaza City to move south as it mounts a new offensive against Hamas there, which has involved destroying one apartment block after another.UN general assembly votes to back Hamas-free government for PalestineRead moreThe Israel Defense Forces said they had destroyed three more blocks on Sunday, claiming Hamas had put surveillance equipment on their rooftops. At least 13 Palestinians were killed and dozens wounded on Sunday in Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip, according to local hospitals.The Israeli military’s top lawyer is reported to have called for a delay to the evacuation of Gaza City until more humanitarian facilities were available in the south, but her advice was ignored, accordingto Haaretz.Rubio is due to fly to the UK for Trump’s state visit, during which policy towards Israel and the recognition of Palestine will be a major irritant. On Friday the UN general assemblyvoted 142-10 to endorse a two-state solutionto the conflict, involving a Palestinian state in which Hamas would be blocked from any role in government.Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyMarco RubioQatarBenjamin NetanyahuHamasIsrael-Gaza warIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

The attack targeted the leadership of Hamas, who were meeting in the Gulf state to consider new terms for a deal set out by Donald Trump.Israel’s military has ordered 1 million people living and sheltering in Gaza City to leave before a new offensive. On Saturday the Israel Defense Forces said more than 250,000 people had already fled, though Gaza’s civil defence agency said the figure was closer to 68,000.Footage and photographs published over the weekend showed exhausted families moving along the coastal road near Nuseirat, south of Gaza City, with their belongings stacked high in vehicles.View image in fullscreenDisplaced Palestinians flee northern Gaza after Israeli forces ordered residents of Gaza City to evacuate to the south.Photograph: Mahmoud Issa/ReutersHealth authorities in Gaza announced last week they would not evacuate Gaza City’s two main operational hospitals, al-Shifa and al-Ahli, and that doctors would not leave patients unattended. The UN’s World Health Organization has also pledged its workers would remain in Gaza City.But doctors at al-Ahli, which has been under evacuation orders for weeks, described a “situation beyond any human mind can imagine or can conceive” and said they could be forced to comply with the Israeli evacuation orders.“You see towers 20 storeys high collapse in less than two seconds [when hit by an Israeli airstrike], you see thousands of families running for their lives in the streets with their kids, you see the kids being slaughtered, you see limbs being mutilated,” said Dr Khamis Elessi, a consultant pain specialist at the hospital.View image in fullscreenPalestinians wait for treatment in Nasser hospital.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThere are now three times more patients than beds at al-Ahli, which has received as many as 400 cases on some days in the past month. The facility has only three ICU beds. Many casualties with serious injuries, including broken limbs, have been sent home to wait for surgery.“I hope, I hope we will survive,” Elessi said.At al-Shifa hospital, once the biggest health facility in Gaza City but now barely functioning, doctors also said they would stay. “I will go to the south with my family and make sure they are safe and then I will return to Gaza to continue working at al-Shifa hospital, God willing,” said one.Medics at Nasser described a daily routine of dealing with death and severe injuries inflicted by bomb blasts and bullets.View image in fullscreenIsraeli airstrikes hit Nasser medical complex in Khan Younis in August.Photograph: APDr Tipu Khan, from Ventura, California, who arrived at the hospital 10 days ago as a volunteer with MedGlobal, said: “We are dealing with a lot of blast injuries, shrapnel and bullet wounds … If this was in the US it would be a huge mass casualty incident every day. For me it is absolutely overwhelming but I’m told these are good days compared with last month.”Many casualties are young men and children, often teenagers, injured close to food distribution hubs that are run by the US-and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation and protected by Israeli troops, Khan said.“Every morning like clockwork we get seven, eight, 10 young adolescent males with blast or gunshot wounds. Some come in with a retained bullet in the brain or chest. These are devastating injuries and three or four are either actively dying or not saveable,” Khan said.The Israeli military has denied firing deliberately on civilians seeking food from the GHF sites and says it takes all feasible precautions to prevent civilian casualties in Gaza.View image in fullscreenPeople with the bodies of their relatives at a funeral service at al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesKhan said some basic supplies were running short at Nasser, such as equipment for blood pressure readings and anaesthetics.The hospital, where an Israeli strikekilled 20 peopleincluding journalists and health workers last month, is turning off electricity on certain days in some departments and corridors to conserve limited stocks of fuel for generators, officials there said.Saqr said he feared that the sprawling facility, which providesmore than halfthe total hospital beds in Gaza, could be forced to shut down if the Israeli military operations expand further.“Evacuating Nasser complex means that thousands of patients will inevitably die because there are no other places to go,” he said.View image in fullscreenA Palestinian boy mourns by the body of a relative killed in Israeli strikes on Gaza City in September.Photograph: Omar Al-Qattaa/AFP/Getty ImagesTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the WHO, said last week that what Israel had designated as a “humanitarian zone” in the south of the Gaza Strip had “neither the size nor scale of services to support those already there, let alone new arrivals”.Israeli officials’ claims that they are working to increase health service provision in the south of Gaza have been met with deep scepticism by experts and aid workers.The war started after aHamas attack on Israelin October 2023 that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and led to 250 being abducted. Fifty hostages remain in Gaza. The Israeli offensive that followed has killed more than 64,000 people, mostly civilians, and injured more than 160,000.Khan said he had seen the devastation in Haiti after the earthquake there in 2010, but that Gaza was different. “Haiti was a natural disaster but the hardest thing here is that it is 100% preventable,” he said.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

I don’t know if this is an attempt by someone to intimidate me, but I am not going to stop seeking redress for my brother who has been in jail since 2017 without full trial.”A UK court hearing is due in a few weeks’ time in which Jagtar’s lawyers, including from the legal organisation Reprieve, will seek to discover if he was arrested inIndiain 2017 after a tipoff by British intelligence. Much of the UK hearing is likely to be held in closed session.Jagtar has not been found guilty in any Indian court, and a series of delays caused by the Indian prosecutor’s inability to assemble credible witnesses mean he has been detained without full trial.Charges against him at state level in Punjab were dismissed by the court in March 2025 as no evidence or witnesses were produced. The largely identical federal-level charges being brought by India’s National Investigation Agency remain.Gurpreet says he has been stopped four times in the last two years when he has returned to the UK from holiday. Neither the Home Office nor PoliceScotlandhave given him explanations that justify him being taken aside in front of his family. He was stopped at Heathrow in November 2023 and twice at Glasgow airport in April and July 2024 and once in July 2025. Each time he was told at the e-gates to “seek assistance” that then led to a set of inquiries.After years of delay, Gurpreet’s rare legal tort claim against the British intelligence services is due to reach the court on 6 October. The closed proceedings, made necessary by the involvement of the British intelligence services, mean Jagtar’s own lawyers cannot be present, but parts of the first hearing will be open to media and the public.View image in fullscreenJagtar Singh Johal.Photograph: PA MediaJagtar’s legal team is arguing that a member of the British intelligence services appears to be the individual described anonymously in the 2020 annual report by the UK’s Investigatory Powers Commissioner’s Office (IPCO),which sets out how MI5 andMI6passed information to foreign authorities about a British national who was then detained and tortured.The report said the case had been raised by the then UK prime minister with Indian authorities. Theresa May is known to have raised Jagtar’s case in 2018 with the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, and other circumstantial evidence suggests the case referred to is Jagtar’s.Jagtar’s British lawyers are asking the government to admit the individual was Jagtar, grant him redress for the harm he has suffered, to recognise that its actions were unlawful and publicly apologise for its role in his suffering.His lawyers claim he was severely tortured after he was arrested in Jalandhar, Punjab, three weeks after his wedding. At the time local media reported that a British Sikh had been arrested on the basis of a tipoff from British intelligence. The alleged torture led to a false confession, his lawyers say.British rules required ministerial consent for intelligence sharing to occur where there was a risk of torture. The foreign secretary at the time was Boris Johnson, and the court would probably hear if he authorised the sharing of the information with the Indian authorities.A second possible explanation for Gurpreet’s experience is that the British police have generally increased their targeting of British Sikhs, probably in the wake of pressure from the Indian government.Gurpreet said: “Being stopped this number of times, sometimes for long periods without proper explanation is concerning. I am being asked by my children at the airport what I have done wrong and I cannot tell them except I am campaigning to get my brother released from an Indian jail, or that this is straightforward discrimination. It will certainly not lead to me dropping the case against the British intelligence services.”The Home Office has refused an explanation for the stops, citing the Data Protection Act where complying with the right of access to the information on why he is being stopped “would be likely to prejudice the prevention or detection of crime”.In addition, the Home Office claims the border police have a right to stop individuals in the national interest.PoliceScotland referred the issue to the Home Office and said there had been no request from Police Scotland for him to be stopped.A UN working group on arbitrary detention has determined that Jagtar’s detention “lacks [a] legal basis” and is based on “discriminatory grounds” owing to his Sikh faith and his “status as a human rights defender”, and that Jagtar was subjected to torture.Jagtar is accused of being a member of a terrorist group, the Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF), which has carried out attacks in the Punjab region.The charges against Jagtar state that he travelled to Paris in 2013 and delivered £3,000 to other KLF figures, with the money then used to purchase weapons employed in a series of murders and attacks against Hindu nationalist and other religious leaders in 2016 and 2017.Explore more on these topicsPoliceMI5MI6Home OfficeScotlandIndiaSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

Rayner had been the key cabinet minister holding the line.In calls with union leaders, however, Kyle has promised there will be no backsliding on the legislation. The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, also promised it would be delivered in a speech to the TUC conference.In a statement on Sunday night, Starmer welcomed the return of the bill and said the government was determined to deliver the legislation. “This government is delivering the biggest upgrade to workers’ rights in a generation,” he said.“Our employment rights bill is good for workers, good for businesses and good for the economy. It’s a core part of our agenda to make people better off and will make a real difference to people’s lives.”Reshuffle of junior ministers raises fears over future of Labour’s workers’ rights billRead moreUnion leaders are keen to put the spotlight back on the bill when it finishes its passage through parliament to ensure there is no further tampering as it is implemented. Key decisions will be made via secondary legislation on vital issues such as compensation for cancelled shifts.The TUC’s general secretary, Paul Nowak, who will meet MPs on Monday to present the findings of the poll, said it was right that the government was planning to vote down Conservative and Liberal Democrat amendments to the bill on Monday.“These reforms cannot be allowed to stall,” he said. “Banning zero-hours contracts, ending fire-and-rehire, and day-one protection from unfair dismissal aren’t just the right things to do – they’re overwhelmingly popular across the political spectrum.“The government has a powerful story to tell with this bill – one that can resonate across its electoral coalition. Now it must go out and own this agenda.”The 45,000-voter poll for the TUC and Hope Not Hate, funded by theLabourdonor and green energy tycoon Dale Vince, suggests that major reforms such as the end to the vast majority of zero-hours contracts, fire-and-rehire, day-one rights at work and protection against unfair dismissal are near-universally popular.However, only about one in four voters have any knowledge of the sweeping reforms. When told about the changes, more than seven in 10 said they supported workers being protected from unfair dismissal from the first day in the job, instead of the current two years. That support rises to 77% for 2024 Labour voters who have since switched to Reform.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Nearly 80% support employers having to offer zero-hours contract workers a guaranteed-hours contract based on the hours they usually work after 12 weeks – another key part of the bill. That rises to 85% for Labour-to-Reform switchers.‘All the power is with the employer’: why zero-hours workers welcome Labour’s rights billRead moreMore than three-quarters of the public support workers being entitled to sick pay from day one, a number that again rises among Reform switchers.Nick Lowles, the chief executive of Hope Not Hate, said the “real fault line” was economic insecurity rather than immigration, adding: “People are angry for good reason. They’re working harder than ever and getting less and less back.“They want a government that’s willing to stand up to vested interests and fix an economy they feel is rigged against them.“Strengthening workers’ rights can help rebuild trust. But only if it’s front and centre – not an afterthought. The government needs to make the populist case for making work pay.”Nowak said MPs and activists must keep close eye on the bill’s implementation once it had passed. “We need watertight secondary legislation so there are no loopholes for bad bosses. And ministers must hold their nerve against the inevitable scare stories from parts of the business lobby and ensure the bill delivers the secure jobs millions desperately need.”Explore more on these topicsEmployment lawKeir StarmerLabourTrade unionsZero-hours contractsPeter KyleWorkers' rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

Not reducing it would be completely tone deaf to what’s happening in the global bond markets.”Threadneedle Street intervened during the depths of the financial crisis to buy UK government bonds – aiming to crash borrowing costs close to zero – in a programme that was ultimately expanded up to reach £895bn in total.The Bank is now winding down quantitative easing – a process known as “quantitative tightening” (QT) – and has shed about £100bn of bonds in the past year through active sales and allowing maturing debts not to be replaced.It still has a portfolio worth about £560bn, having disposed of most of its holdings at a loss.City investors widely expect the Bank to scale back its QT programme to about £70bn for the year ahead. However, this would involve maintaining active sales at current levels because fewer gilts are due to expire over the next 12 months.Sushil Wadhwani, who was on the MPC between 1999 and 2002, called for a halt to active sales entirely amid worries over the impact of QT on the bond market.“On monetary policy grounds, the Bank should switch to passive QT [only allowing maturing debt to expire],” he said. “Irrespective of whatAndrew Baileysays, the 30-year yield has a significant impact on confidence in the UK economy. I have foreign investors bring it up all the time.”Scaling back the Bank’s QT programme could help the chancellor by easing some of the pressure on long-term gilt yields. Such a step would also save the Treasury money because Threadneedle Street has been selling its bonds at a loss.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, he warned Reeves against banking on any windfall.“The job of the Bank is not to make the chancellor’s life easy. Its job is to control inflation. And a modest winding back on QT would be quite consistent with that.”In a rare piece of upbeat news for the chancellor, a survey by trade body Make UK suggests an upturn in the key manufacturing sector in the third quarter, with output and export orders rising.Make UK’s chief executive, Stephen Phipson, said all the indicators in the survey, carried out by consultancy BDO, had improved.“After a period of considerable uncertainty in global markets, these figures are an encouraging sign that manufacturers’ confidence is improving and, more importantly, being translated into growth and investment.“However, one swallow doesn’t make a summer, and with UK and European markets in particular remaining anaemic it wouldn’t take much to knock prospects for further growth.”The IPPR thinktank has estimated that halting active sales – matching the US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank – could save the Treasury more than £10bn a year.However, holding on to the bonds would not be cost free, because the Bank earns less interest on its gilt portfolio than it pays out on commercial bank reserves.Last month, the IPPR called on Reeves to raise taxes on the country’s biggest banks amid windfall profits on their reserves parked at Threadneedle Street. Some economists have also called for the Bank topay lower rates of intereston some commercial bank reserves.Explore more on these topicsBank of EnglandGiltsBondsQuantitative easingAndrew BaileyEconomicsInterest ratesnewsShareReuse this content"

The overall rankings score trusts based on a range of measures including finances and patient safety, as well as how they are bringing down waiting times for operations and in A&E, and improving ambulance response times.Guardian analysis of the underlying data has found that about three-quarters of trusts are failing to hit either of the two cancer targets in the tables.Ninety of the 118 trusts (76%) are missing the first target of ruling cancer in or out within 28 days of urgent referrals in at least 80% of cases.The analysis also reveals that 86 of the 118 trusts (73%) are failing to hit the second cancer target measured in the tables, of starting treatment within 62 days in 75% of patients.Delaying cancer diagnosis or treatment can lead to worse outcomes for patients, fewer options for tackling the disease, and earlier death.Canceris the UK’s biggest killer, causing about one in four deaths.Cancer experts said they were alarmed by the Guardian’s findings. Paula Chadwick, the chief executive of the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation, said: “Three-quarters of NHS hospitals failing to meet cancer targets is nothing short of a national emergency.“Behind every missed target is a person left waiting, a family left in limbo, and lives put at greater risk because the system simply isn’t moving fast enough. Cancer does not wait. Delays in diagnosis and treatment cost lives – it’s as stark as that.”Chadwick said the government and the NHS must act to tackle the crisis. “Without immediate action, people will die who could and should have been saved,” she said.Helen Dickens, the chief support officer at Breast Cancer Now, said the figures were “devastating” and she was “deeply concerned” that many patients were facing very long waits for treatment. “More must be done to reverse these alarming trends,” she said.Susanna Daniels, the chief executive of Melanoma Focus, said: “It is deeply concerning that three in four NHS hospitals are missing cancer treatment targets. For patients with melanoma skin cancer, delays could significantly affect their outcomes.”Alfie Bailey-Bearfield, the chair of the Less Survivable Cancers Taskforce, said treatment delays were unacceptable. “For people diagnosed with less survivable cancers – of the brain, liver, lung, oesophagus, pancreas and stomach – time is absolutely critical,” he said. “Each year, 90,000 people in the UK are diagnosed with these cancers, and they have an average five-year survival rate of just 16%. We urgently need the NHS and government to prioritise faster diagnosis and treatment.”Mid and South Essex NHS foundation trust ranked worst inEnglandon 62 days to start treatment, with only four in 10 of its patients (42.2%) beginning treatment within two months. It was also the second worst performer on the 28 days diagnosis target, with just 59.2% of patients told they do or do not have cancer within a month of an urgent referral.Graph of NHS trusts’ performance in cancer treatmentThe chief executive of Mid and South Essex, Matthew Hopkins, said: “Our patients deserve better and so we are absolutely focused on improving our position as a trust. We are increasing the provision of diagnostic tests, outpatient clinics and cancer surgery to reduce the time to diagnosis and treatment.”Hull University teaching hospitals NHS trust was the worst in the country on 28 days diagnosis, ruling cancer in or out in 57.5% of patients within a month of an urgent cancer referral. It was the third worst performer in England on the 62 days treatment target (49.3%).A spokesperson for NHS Humber health partnership said: “We are disappointed with our position in the latest NHS league tables. They highlight areas where we must do better for the communities we serve.”Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS foundation trust was ranked the best in England on starting treatment within 62 days (87.3%). Bolton NHS foundation trust was the top performer on cancer diagnosis, ruling it in or out within 28 days in 88.6% of patients.The health secretary, Wes Streeting, said the league tables would pinpoint where urgent support was needed and help end the “postcode lottery” of care for patients.“We must be honest about the state of the NHS to fix it. Patients and taxpayers have to know how their local NHS services are doing compared to the rest of the country,” he said. “Patients know when local services aren’t up to scratch and they want to see an end to the postcode lottery – that’s what this government is doing.”A separate report published on Monday suggests breast cancer could cost the UK economy £4.2bn by 2050.Claire Rowney, the chief executive of Breast Cancer Now, said the report produced with Demos exposed “the growing scale of the problem and the human and economic prices being paid”.Additional reporting by Michael GoodierExplore more on these topicsNHSCancerHospitalsHealthEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

He remains in custody on suspicion of rape. The woman is continuing to receive support as the investigation continues.In a statement released through the Sikh Federation, the victim expressed her gratitude to her community. “I want to sincerely thank everyone for supporting me and my family during this very difficult time,” she said. “We are going through a lot, but the strength and kindness shown by the right people in the community has been incredible, and I can’t thank them enough for being my voice.“I would never wish this on anyone. All I was doing was going about my day on my way to work, and what has happened has deeply affected us. Through it all, my family has been my rock, and my community has stood strong beside me.“The police are doing their best to find those responsible and I truly hope they are caught so that this doesn’t happen to anyone else.”Ch Supt Kim Madill, of West Midlands police, described the arrest as a “significant development in the investigation”. She said: “We want to thank the community for their continuing support. The investigation remains ongoing and we would urge people not to speculate as we work to identify and trace all those who may have been involved.”Police previously said they were looking for two white men in connection with the attack. The first was described as having a shaved head and a heavy build, wearing a dark sweatshirt with gloves. The second was said to be wearing a grey top with a silver zip.Local MPs expressed their shock after initial reports of the attack. Sarah Coombes, Labour’s MP for West Bromwich, which includes Oldbury, said the incident was “absolutely horrible”, adding that such “violence and hatred has no place in our society”.Gurinder Singh Josan, the Labour MP for Smethwick, previously said the “truly horrific attack” was being treated as a hate crime, while Preet Kaur Gill, the Labour MP for Birmingham Edgbaston, said she had been contacted by concerned constituents. She said: “Our Sikh community and every community has the right to feel safe, respected and valued. Racism and misogyny have no place in Oldbury, or anywhere in Britain.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

And yes, a lot was known about Peter Mandelson’s relationship with Epstein. He had apologised for it. And these two things were weighed up.”He said Mandelson had “navigated the most difficult period in the US-UK relationship since the second world war, and we have delivered for people in Britain time after time after time”.Can Keir survive? Inside the plot to bring down the prime ministerRead moreKyle said the Cabinet Office had not provided the prime minister with any further information apart from what was already in the public domain.“The Cabinet Office did an independent inquiry into the appointment, as they do in every public appointment of this nature, and the information was presented to the prime minister,” he told Sky News.“The second process was obviously a political process where there are political conversations done in No 10 about all the other aspects of an appointment of this nature. Now, both of these things turned up information that was already public and a decision was made that, based on Peter’s singular talents in this area, the risk of appointing knowing what was already public was worth the risk.“Now, of course, we have seen the emails which were not published at the time, were not public and not even known about, and that has changed the situation.”The Conservative party has written to Keir Starmer demanding answers over what Downing Street knew about Mandelson’s links to Epstein, and when. They also called for the prime minister to release documents relating to his appointment as ambassador to Washington and correspondence that shows how his No 10 operation reacted when alerted to the emails obtained by Bloomberg “without delay”.Giuffre,who died in April aged 41, was an outspoken accuser of Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. She also sued the Duke of York for allegedly sexually assaulting her when she was 17 after being trafficked by Epstein, which eventually led to Andrew paying millions of pounds to settle the case. She alleged they trafficked her to the prince. Andrew denied the claim and said they never met.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He should not have been given the position in the first place.”Amanda Roberts said: “Why does it take us to have to pull out the skeletons for people to be held accountable? Our governments have allowed these people to hold their status and their title without shame, and so part of me is like, we should have done something sooner. He should have never been given that title.”No 10 is facing considerable scrutiny over the new emails between Epstein and Mandelson – exchanged as Epstein was facing an 18-month sentence – where Mandelson told him to “fight for early release”.Mandelson is believed to have been in touch with the Foreign Office permanent secretary, Oliver Robbins, earlier in the week after receiving a request to comment from Bloomberg, but No 10 said the full extent of the emails’ contents was not known until Wednesday afternoon after the Sun published a story.The former UK ambassador to the US Kim Darroch said the vetting procedure for ambassadors took “weeks and weeks” and included interviews with other sources.“They ask people about you and they look into your background through sources you may not have nominated as people to act as your referees,” he said. “So they do a thorough job … they take weeks and weeks, if not longer, over individuals. The process takes a fair amount of time, so you would expect them to know quite a lot and discover things that maybe weren’t advertised.”He added: “On the other hand, you know, emails from closed or old email addresses that have been closed down – I’m not enough of a technical expert to know how you get to that kind of thing, so whether that would have been available to them, I have no idea.”Explore more on these topicsPeter MandelsonLabourJeffrey EpsteinPeter KylenewsShareReuse this content"

He was 79.Edgar died from complications related to his treatment for pancreatic cancer, his family said in a statement. He had disclosed his cancer diagnosis earlier this year.“We are deeply grateful for the love, support and kindness so many have shown to Jim and our family over these last several months,” the statement said.A former state legislator who wasIllinoissecretary of state for a decade, Edgar was elected governor in 1990. The moderate Republican easily won re-election, including winning heavily Democratic Cook county, where Chicago is located.He remained a party statesman and adviser, and grew uneasy with the Republican party’s shift to the right. Edgar wasamong high-profile Republicanswho did not support Donald Trump’s presidency, joining a campaign to support Kamala Harris’s bid for president last year called Republicans for Harris.Born in small-town Oklahoma, Edgar was much more reserved than his flashy, charming predecessor, James R Thompson, who was the longest-serving governor in state history. At the time Edgar took office, the state was hundreds of millions of dollars in debt and paying its bills months late.Amid a recession, Edgar pushed legislators to cut the state budget, making layoffs and cuts in popular programs. He also managed to fulfill his campaign promise of getting a temporary income tax surcharge made permanent, guaranteeing a stable source of money for public schools.“It wasn’t always pretty how it was done, but we got a lot done,” Edgar told the Associated Press in 1998. “We went after some pretty tough issues. We didn’t get them all, but we got most of them.”He surprised many political observers when he announced in 1997 that he would not seek a third term, considering his popularity.Republicanstried to draft him to run for office again, including bids for the US Senate and again for Illinois governor. But he did not accept.Edgar went on to teach and served as president emeritus of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library Foundation, among other things.“By any standard, he was a Republican whose integrity guided his time in office and who managed one of the most successful periods in Illinois state government,” Bob Kustra, who served as Edgar’s lieutenant governor, said in a statement.JB Pritzker, the Illinois governor, said on Sunday that flags in the state would fly at half-staff in Edgar’s honor.“Now more than ever, we should channel that spirit and resolve to live as Governor Edgar did: with honesty integrity, and an enduring respect for all,” Pritzker, a Democrat, said in a statement. “He will live on in the incalculable number of lives he touched and in the stronger institutions he helped build.”Edgar is survived by his wife and two children.His relatives said details on funeral plans would follow in the coming days.Explore more on these topicsIllinoisRepublicansUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

That number is also a nearly 40% increase over the first six months of 2024, according theStudy of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorismat the University of Maryland.Last week, House speaker Mike Johnson said congressional leaders were reviewing security for members of congress.“We have to protect people who run for public office, or no one will and that is heavy on our hearts and minds,” Johnson said.The Trump administration’s request for an additional $58m in security comes as the deadline for government funding is approaching at the end of the month.

Welcome to America. I feel like I’m tipping for everything, everywhere. And now it’s only going to get worse. And for that I blame President Trump.Of course, our tipping culture was in place long before Trump took office. But now that his “no tax on tips” promise became law, our government is officially enabling it. That’s good news for tipped workers and for small-business owners who may feel less pressure to pay higher wages if their workers are getting enough gratuities. But at the same time, it’s bad news for the rest of us who will likely feel even more obligated than ever to tip.What’s frustrating is that the tax benefits for tipped workers are not only over-hyped, they’re also temporary. Yes, workers can avoid getting taxed on their tips – but not all workers (see below) and not all their tips. If you’re eligible, you can deduct up to $25,000 of tip income each year and there are income limitations. Also, you won’t see that benefit until you file your year-end tax returns. You also still have to pay in to social security and Medicare taxes. And it’s estimated that asmany as one-thirdof those employees eligible for this deduction will never use it because their income is so low they don’t pay any federal taxes anyway. Oh, and by the way, the deduction expires in 2028. So enjoy it while it lasts.Also irritating is who’s eligible. The treasury departmentrecently publisheda list of about 50 types of workers who can claim the tipped-wages deduction. Unfortunately, I wasn’t consulted. But if I were, then I would have been a little more particular.For example, I would never include “digital content creators” as eligible tipped workers. Really? Now we’re tipping influencers? Like MrBeast needs more money? Given all the harm that social media has wrought on this world, it’s probably better not to encourage these people with tax incentives.I was also surprised to see that electricians, plumbers and locksmiths who work in people’s homes are eligible for tips. These are licensed professionals performing a service. Many are independent contractors or freelancers who are quite capable of coming up with their own fees. And those who are employed aren’t cheap either. I’m not sure where the line is drawn. Should I also be tipping the staff of my accounting firm? My life insurance agent?What exactly are “gambling and sports book writers and runners”? Who tips these people? I’m not a prude, but should we be enabling this industry in particular? Can the casinos not afford to pay these people enough?I can’t imagine who would tip a private event planner, either. Event planners work for people who have enough money to pay for event planners. It seems silly to give these people a tax benefit for any tips on top of that.Finally, why in the world would anyone want to encourage “self-enrichment teachers” with a tax-free tip? I would think the best way to enrich oneself is to pocket your extra money and not further enrich the self-enrichment teacher. What’s next, tipping the guy who mansplains how the infield fly rule works?Now that I’ve listed some people who should be dropped from this benefit, it’s only fair to share a few who were unfairly left off. For example:Postal workers. Every year we tip our postal worker. She provides a friendly, cheerful, daily service in rain, snow, sleet … well, you know the rest. Most of my friends do the same.Flight attendants. They load bags. They carry babies. They walk around cabins during turbulence. They deal with jerks. And many don’t even start getting paid until the plane leaves the gate!The panic over tariff details is different than its bigger pictureRead moreSchool teachers. I don’t understand why everyone wrings their hands over how to improve compensation for our teachers and yet there are no tax incentives for parents to tip them.School bus drivers. Them, too.Grocery store cashiers. All during Covid, while the rest of us stayed safely at home, watching Netflix and receiving our Amazon packages, the guy who ran the cash register at our local grocery store came in to work every day and did his job. His name is Emilio. Add him to the list, please.If it were up to me, we’d be like the rest of the world and ban tips altogether. Instead of incentivizing people to tip, I’d tax tip income higher so employers would be forced to step up and just pay a fair wage. But that’s not reality in 21st-century America. So let’s just make this benefit permanent already instead of playing budgetary games and setting an expiration date near (surprise!) the next presidential election, so it can be a populist rallying point. Let’s also re-visit who is and isn’t eligible.My final tip: when in Vegas, make your coffee in your room.Explore more on these topicsUS small businessDonald TrumpShareReuse this content"

To thrive, fruit trees need heat and light and this year “we had lots of both”.“I’ve had boughs breaking on trees under the weight of fruit,” Butterfield continued. “It’s probably going to be the best vintage since 2018.”With more than 20 years in the business, he declared: “It might even be the best in my cider-making lifetime. We’re looking at an incredibly special year.”Core principles: the return of ‘real’ ciderRead moreThe National Association ofCiderMakers (NACM) says the warm spring and summer have produced apples “full of rich flavours and natural sweetness”, despite the fact that the reduced rainfall means the fruit is slightly smaller than average.“I’ve heard from cider makers and growers that the sugar and tannin levels are very high, which means the quality of the fruit will be outstanding,” said the NACM chair, David Sheppy, who is also the managing director of Sheppy’s Cider. “It is going to be a good year for quality.”The record-breaking summer temperatures this year that contributed to the abundance of apples was made about 70 times more likely because of human-induced climate change, the Met Office concluded in an analysis published earlier this month. The mean temperature across June, July and August was 16.1C (70F), significantly above the current record of 15.8C set in 2018, with the country also seeing four heatwaves across a single season.View image in fullscreenA bottle of Sheppy’s Kingston Black Somerset Cider.Photograph: urbanbuzz/AlamySheppy, whose family has 36 hectares (90 acres) of orchards in Somerset, said the trees had “suffered a little bit”. Mature trees “don’t mind a dry spell”, he said, but the stress of the dry weather meant he had observed a small number that had split and lost their branches.Cider-producers have moved to make the most of this year’s bumper crop. Sandford Orchards, which makes Devon Red cider, has installed eight new 50,000-litre (11,000-gallon) tanks and Butterfield is particularly excited to have lots of Tremlett’s Bitter apples, meaning Sandford Orchards can bottle a single variety for the first time in seven years.He describes their “leathery and marmaladey” notes and “rich natural sweetness”.There is also good news forperrydrinkers after last year’s disaster. Albert Johnson, director of Ross-on-Wye Cider & Perry Company bills it as a “bounceback year”.“Last year was so bad for perry pears, probably over half the crop was wiped out by the bad conditions in the growing season,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So it’s a really exciting year for perry.”Industry figures show that while UK cider sales edged up slightly to £3.1bn in 2024, the overall amount drunk declined by about 3% to 676m litres. Sheppy, the sixth generation of his family to work in cider-making, said the industry “had been in decline, but it’s picking up again”.“It’s coming back,” he said of the sector, which supports about 65,000 jobs. “There’s a lot of innovation and new ideas, both around reducing alcohol content but also at the higher end … to appeal to the modern drinker.“Like a lot of industries, cider goes through phases. But there’s a strong passion for the industry in this country. It’s a close connection with the land and farmers.”Sheppy’s harvest started at the end of last week. “We grow 40 different varieties of apples,” he said. “The earliest ones are ripening now but the main cider apple varieties, like Dabinett, Harry Masters and Yarlington Mill, are ready mid- to late October, early November. That’s the key time.”But even if this year is one to remember, Sheppy is keen to point out that the industry doesn’t have “bad years”, only “bad harvests”.“It’s not like when you get a wetter harvest, the quality is not as good, because that’s all in the blending process. We can blend a good year with a bad year and maintain the quality, that is part of the art of being a cider maker.”Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industryCiderFoodUK weathernewsShareReuse this content"

Hurts and Barkley each had touchdown runs, while Andrew Mukuba’s fourth-quarter interception of Patrick Mahomes helped to deliver the win. The Eagles’ defense was strong, holding the Chiefs to 294 yards and forcing the only turnover of the game. Philadelphia have won seven straight games and improved to 17-1 over the past 18 games. The Chiefs have fallen to 0-2 for the first time since 2014, which also was the previous time they failed to make the playoffs.New York Giants 37–40 Dallas Cowboys (OT)Brandon Aubrey kicked a 46-yard field goal on the final play of overtime after a tying 64-yarder to end regulation, and the Dallas Cowboys beat theNew York Giantsin a thrilling duel between Dak Prescott and Russell Wilson. The Cowboys extended their winning streak against the NFC East rivals to nine games. It’s the longest active streak in the NFL among division opponents. Prescott beat the Giants for the 14th consecutive time since losing both starts against them as a rookie in 2016. Overtime was on the verge of going scoreless after the teams combined for five go-ahead TDs in the final 12 minutes of the fourth quarter. Wilson, who threw for 450 yards and three touchdowns, connected with Malik Nabors on a 48-yard TD for a 37-34 New York lead with 25 seconds remaining after Prescott threw a six-yarder to George Pickens with 52 seconds to go. The Giants just needed a field goal to win when Wilson threw an ill-advised deep ball with pressure, and Donovan Wilson intercepted at the Dallas 30 with two minutes left in OT. Prescott put Aubrey in chip-shot range with a 14-yard scramble.Jacksonville Jaguars 27-31 Cincinnati BengalsJake Browning passed for 241 yards in relief of the injured Joe Burrow and scored the go-ahead touchdown on a one-yard sneak with 18 seconds remaining as the Cincinnati Bengals rallied for victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars. Burrow suffered a toe injury in the first half and did not return, an ominous sign for the Bengals and their franchise quarterback. The Bengals moved to 2-0 for the first time since 2018, while the Jaguars fell to 1-1. Browning led a 15-play, 92-yard drive for the decisive score on which he completed 9 of 12 passes for 65 yards. Burrow, who was not available for interview after the game, left the Bengals’ locker room on crutches with a boot on his left foot. “We had such a tight game, I don’t have all of the information right now,” Bengals coach Zac Taylor said.Later reportsindicated Burrow has strained toe ligaments and will miss several weeks, although ESPN’s Adam Schefter said that could rise to three months if the quarterback needs surgery.Seattle Seahawks 31-17 Pittsburgh SteelersGeorge Holani doing what every coach tells ya to do: run to the ball. Touchdown, Seahawkspic.twitter.com/tTVn2rwFPc— Dugar, Michael-Shawn (@MikeDugar)September 14, 2025George Holani pounced on a live ball in the end zone for an improbable touchdown, and the Seattle Seahawks took advantage of sloppy play by the Pittsburgh Steelers to pull off victory. The Seahawks had taken a three-point lead early in the fourth quarter on Jason Myers’ 54-yard field goal when the ensuing kickoff bounced over the hands of Steelers rookie Kaleb Johnson and into the end zone. While Johnson turned his back and walked toward the bench, Holani raced to the end zone and fell on the ball. That was enough for Seattle on a day that Aaron Rodgers struggled, completing 18 of 33 passes for 203 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions a week after a four-touchdown debut in a win over the New York Jets. Sam Darnold threw two TD passes for the Seahawks.Denver Broncos 28-29 Indianapolis ColtsSpencer Shrader made a 45-yard field goal with no time left after the Broncos were penalized for leverage on his missed 60-yard try, and the Indianapolis Colts beat Denver for their first 2-0 start since 2009. Trailing by two with 3:15 left, the Colts played conservatively on their final drive, with Jonathan Taylor running the ball seven times and Daniel Jones throwing only one pass. Those plays netted 26 yards and set up Shrader’s attempt from midfield that missed short and right. But Dondrea Tillman was flagged for leverage – using a teammate to vault himself into the air to try to block the kick. The 15-yard personal-foul penalty put Indy well within Shrader’s range.Chicago Bears 21–52 Detroit LionsJared Goff threw for 334 yards and matched a career high with five touchdown passes, including a career-high three scores to Amon-Ra St Brown, to help Detroit bounce back with a win over Chicago. The Lions dropped the opener at Green Bay and have not lost consecutive games in the regular season over the last two-and-a-half years. The Bears turned the ball over twice in the first half, leading to a 28-14 deficit that was too large to overcome in coach Ben Johnson’s return to the city where he became an offensive coordinator.Buffalo Bills 30-10 New York JetsJosh Allen shook off a bloody nose as the Buffalo Bills cruised to victory over the New York Jets. James Cook ran for 132 yards and two touchdowns, helping the Bills improve to 2-0. Allen left for two plays in the first quarter after being hit in the face but returned to lead the team. The Bills’ defense shut down Justin Fields and the Jets’ offense from the start. Fields struggled before leaving in the fourth quarter with a concussion. Tyrod Taylor replaced him and threw a late touchdown for the Jets, who fall to 0-2.New England Patriots 33–27 Miami DolphinsDrake Maye threw for two touchdowns and rushed for another, Antonio Gibson returned a kickoff 90 yards for a score, and the Patriots beat the Miami Dolphins 33-27 for Mike Vrabel’s first win as New England’s coach. Maye completed 19 of 23 passes for 230 yards, including TD tosses to Mack Hollins and Kayshon Boutte. The Dolphins took a 27-23 lead midway through the fourth when Malik Washington returned a punt 74 yards for a touchdown. Before Miami fans were even done celebrating the play, Gibson took the ensuing kickoff to the house to give the Patriots a three-point lead.San Francisco 49ers 26–21 New Orleans SaintsMac Jones threw three touchdown passes as Brock Purdy’s replacement and the visiting San Francisco 49ers held off the New Orleans Saints.Jones made his debut for the 49ers in place of Purdy, who is sidelined by a toe injury, and completed 26 of 39 for 279 yards. Spencer Rattler matched Jones’ three touchdown passes while completing 25 of 34 for 206 yards and Alvin Kamara rushed for 100 yards on 21 carries for the Saints.Cleveland Browns 17–41 Baltimore RavensLamar Jackson threw four touchdown passes and Baltimore’s defense harassed Joe Flacco throughout his return to Charm City as the Ravens dispatched the Cleveland Browns. After holding Cincinnati to 141 yards in a one-point loss to the Bengals last week, the Cleveland defense limited Derrick Henry to just 24 yards on 11 rushing attempts. But the Browns were mostly inept on offense. Flacco, the former Super Bowl-winning quarterback for the Ravens playing his first game in Baltimore as an opposing player, went 25 for 45 for 199 yards and a touchdown, with an interception and a lost fumble.Los Angeles Rams 33–19 Tennessee TitansMatthew Stafford threw for 298 yards and two touchdowns as the Los Angeles Rams spoiled rookie Cam Ward’sNFLhome opener scoring 20 straight points to beat the Tennessee Titans. Wide receiver Puka Nacua also ran 45 yards for a touchdown. Davante Adams had 106 yards receiving and a touchdown catch. Joshua Karty also kicked two field goals. The Rams improved to 2-0. They sacked the No 1 overall draft pick five times. Linebacker Byron Young had two. He stripped Ward of the ball at the Titans’ 21 on his second sack.Carolina Panthers 22–27 Arizona CardinalsThe Arizona Cardinals beat the Carolina Panthers, thanks to a strong defensive effort. Josh Sweat’s strip-sack led to an early touchdown, and Calais Campbell’s sack with 26 seconds left stopped a late Carolina rally. The Cardinals led 27-3 in the third quarter, but Panthers quarterback Bryce Young threw three touchdown passes in the second half. His final touchdown cut the lead to 27-22 with 1:58 left. The Panthers recovered an onside kick but couldn’t score on their last drive. Young finished with a career-high 328 yards passing, but missed all seven throws on the final drive.Explore more on these topicsNFLCincinnati BengalsNew York GiantsDallas CowboysUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Now the American has put a bow on her historic year by winning her first world title and conjuring one of the most spectacular 100m performances in history.On a balmy night in Tokyo the 24-year-old American was spectacular and smooth in taking gold in 10.61sec, a time that was not only a championship record but made her the fourth fastest woman in history: 0nly Florence Griffith‑Joyner, Elaine Thompson and Shelly-Ann Fraser‑Pryce have gone faster.Given she has already lowered her personal best by 0.19sec this season after an injury-plagued 2024, who knows what else might be around the corner? “This year has been nothing short of a dream,” she said.Oblique Seville rips 100m field apart to deliver worlds glory and gold to JamaicaRead more“I have been working so hard for this very moment to come out here. I just focused on my execution so to put together the perfect race at the right time just means so much to me.”Asked later at her press conference whether it was possible she might one day break the world record of 10.49, Jefferson-Wooden did not entirely rule it out. “As far as world records go, Flo Jo is the greatest to do it. She has put a number out there that’s definitely worth chasing.”Usually at world championships the 100m men’s and women’s finals have top billing on separate nights. Here they were squeezed together just seven minutes apart. It made for great drama.But the downside was that it did not give the 68,000 spectators at the National Stadium in Tokyo time to reflect on a brilliant performance from the American.The race looked close for about the first 30m, with the reigning Olympic champion Julien Alfred getting out fast. But Jefferson‑Wooden had also exploded from the blocks and was quickly taking control.As Alfred faltered the 21-year-old Jamaican Tina Clayton moved up to take the silver medal in a personal best of 10.76, with Alfred having to settle for bronze in 10.84.View image in fullscreenMelissa Jefferson-Wooden wins the women’s 100m final ahead of Tina Clayton and Julien Alfred.Photograph: David J Phillip/APLater Jefferson-Wooden was also asked about comments made by the Olympic 200m champion Gabby Thomas, criticising her and her coach, Dennis Mitchell. Three weeks ago, Thomas posted on social media saying that “doping coaches should be banned for life from coaching in the sport” – a clear reference to Mitchell, who failed a test as an athlete and also admitted to the Balco inquiry in 2008 that he had asked about performance‑enhancing drugs for an athlete, Marion Jones, he was advising.The Harvard-educated Thomas also posted: “If you train under a coach who is known for doping … you are complicit.”Jefferson-Wooden refused to be drawn directly on her 4x100m relay teammate’s remarks. “I respectfully don’t want to answer that question. Gabby isn’t here. She’s entitled to her opinions, but I don’t want to talk about that.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After more than a decade of waiting for the moment that would amplify his greatness beyond the paywalled enclave of modern boxing, the 37-year-old from Omahahad just outpointedthe sport’s biggest star, Canelo Álvarez,before more than 70,000 fans in Las Vegas and millions more on Netflix. It was the career-defining victory he had never stopped believing would eventually come with hard work and dedication to his craft.Patience has always been Crawford’s greatest asset. Inside the ring, he is the consummate problem-solver: slow to reveal his hand, content to let an opponent show their patterns, then surgically dismantling them once he has cracked the code. Outside it, he endured years of frustration, denied the paydays and opponents his gifts merited, waiting for the one night that he could not be ignored any more. On Saturday at Allegiant Stadium, both sides of that signature discipline were vindicated.Terence Crawford stuns Canelo Álvarez to become undisputed super middleweight championRead moreFor most of his career, Crawford operated on the margins of mainstream stardom, the quiet craftsman without the crossover appeal of louder, brasher champions. He unified at 140lb. He did it again at 147,thrashing Errol Spence Jrin 2023 before a pay‑per‑view audience of about 700,000, his most visible commercial success by far. Yet doubts lingered. His résumé, critics said, lacked marquee names. The wins came too often against opponents dismissed as “nobodies”. His long affiliation with Top Rank allowed the most attractive opponents to sidestep him. Even Álvarezneedled him in the buildup: “If you look at his career, mention one elite fighter.”That barb was answered with prejudice on Saturday night. Crawford jumped not one but two divisions to face Álvarez, entrenched at super‑middleweight for nearly seven years, a four‑weight champion who had beaten future Hall of Famers and sold out stadiums on multiple continents. Crawford boxed with restraint early, southpaw jab probing, counters sharp. Then came the shift in the middle rounds. “Around like the sixth round, I felt like I needed to step it up a little more and get more control of the fight, because the fight was going like a seesaw effect,” he said. From then on the pattern was clear: Crawford dictating terms, Álvarez chasing shadows.Crawford’s achievements had already marked him as a first-ballot hall‑of‑famer long before Saturday night. Nothing would have changed that, even if he’d been denied the decision (which, at least relative tomy 118-110 score, came uncomfortably close to happening). The titles across four weight classes, including undisputed reigns in two of them, would have been enough to make him a household name decades ago, before boxing’s protracted retreat to the margins of American life.View image in fullscreenTerence Crawford dictated terms in his victory as Canelo Álvarez chased shadows in Las Vegas.Photograph: David Becker/APBut he did beat Álvarez. And now he’s become only the sixth fighter in history to win world titles in five divisions, joining Thomas Hearns, Sugar Ray Leonard, Oscar De La Hoya, Floyd Mayweather Jr and Manny Pacquiao. Only the third to claim lineal championships in four, alongside Mayweather and Pacquiao. Only the second man to become an undisputed champion in three weight classes since Henry Armstrong in 1938.So why did it take so long? Crawford’s laconic personality, his distaste for theatrics, has long kept him from the superstardom enjoyed by flashier peers. After a decade earning modest sums for his fights, Mayweather’s mid-career reinvention from the white-hat Pretty Boy Floyd into a pantomime villain made him the world’s richest athlete. Crawford has never played that game. He has kept his head down, let the work speak. In today’s culture, which rewards volume as much as substance, that patience often looked like a liability. On Saturday night, it looked like the most important decision of his life.That is why the tears flowed when they did. It was not just about beating Álvarez, though that alone was the kind of victory that vaulted him into all-time company. It was about vindication. That the quiet kid from a fistic backwater better known for producing corn than world-class fighters, who spent years fighting in relative obscurity, who unified divisions without the acclaim they deserved, was right to stay the course. To do it on his terms. That the old-fashioned idea – that if you keep winning, eventually the world will notice – still has some truth left in it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It wasn’t the wild brawl some fans crave, nor the bombastic finish that fuels highlight reels. Instead, it was a masterclass in timing, angles and discipline. Crawford showed that greatness does not always arrive with a bang; sometimes it is built slowly, over years of waiting, refining, refusing to compromise.In a sport that rewards bluster, Crawford’s quiet vindication felt almost radical. He was told for years that he hadn’t fought anybody. Now he has beaten everybody. He was told his chance might never come. Now he has seized the biggest one of all. When he sank to his knee, the tears said as much as any words. The boy from Omaha whoonce survived a bullet to the headhad climbed every mountain, solved every problem and waited long enough for the world to finally see it.Explore more on these topicsBoxingCanelo ÁlvarezTerence CrawfordfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s 10 months since he was appointed but he is yet to win back-to-back league games. Havingbeaten Burnleylast time out, amid scenes of revealing euphoria, they were never going to win at Manchester City.Which must have been a relief for City, who had lost two of their first three games this season for the first time in 21 years. There was, for them, particularly after half-time, a pleasing sense of normality returning. Rodri, shaky early on, began to dominate as he used to before his knee injury, while there were fine performances from Erling Haaland, Jérémy Doku and Phil Foden.Haaland doubles up as City sweep United aside in Manchester derbyRead moreCity may have been the dominant side in Manchester for the past 12 years, but this was the first real battering they had dished out in the derby since the 6-3 in October of 2022-23. And yet, while City were entirely in control by the end, slicing United open on the break again and again, it had not begun like that.United, though, have become one of those sides who will eventually offer up chances; all opponents have to do is wait. United’s attacking is ponderous and still very heavily reliant on individuals – the save Gianluigi Donnarumma made diving to his right was the result of Bryan Mbeumo’s technique in volleying a deep cross rather than any subtle interplay. Again and again, patient buildup ends with the spectacularly one-footed Patrick Dorgu failing to beat his man or deliver a meaningful cross. At the other end, opponents wander through them.United had actually started quite well, their pressing leading both Rodri and Bernardo Silva to give up possession, but they undid any early positivity with some unforgivable diffidence. When Rodri found Doku he was in a square formed by Luke Shaw, Manuel Ugarte, Amad Diallo and Dorgu, watched by all of them but tended by none. He turned and had enough acceleration room to sashay past Shaw.Although Ugarte recovered to block his first attempt at a cross, the second was headed in by an unmarked Phil Foden, United’s defensive structure essentially undone by a pass and a turn, none of it helped by some flatfooted goalkeeping by Altay Bayindir. United had all 11 players in their own defensive third, and yet failed to pick up either crosser or goalscorer.The issue wasn’t quite so stark with the second goal: there is only so much a defence can do against a rampaging Haaland, but as the throw-in was taken there was a meekness, a vagueness, to United’s response.View image in fullscreenPatrick Dorgu had an afternoon to forget in the derby at Etihad Stadium.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAUgarte was not close enough to Nico O’Reilly, which allowed him to be nutmegged, then Leny Yoro was rolled very easily by Doku as seized on Foden’s pass before laying in the Norwegian.Thereafter it was just a question of how many City would score. Haaland hit the post after Matthijs de Ligt had given the ball away, then got his second after Shaw had been dispossessed by Silva. Tijjani Reijnders also missed a one-on-one. This was 3-0 going on 5-0, without City having to do anything exceptional.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Worst of all from a United point of view was how predictable it all felt. There were no howls of outrage, no sense of shock. There wasn’t even a booking. It was all extremely tepid, as though United have accepted their mediocrity.How long can it go on? At what point will more be expected from Amorim, who has won just eight Premier League matches to date? Of the 17 sides who have been in the Premier League since Amorim was appointed, his United have the worst record with 31 points from 31 games. Amorim is not the only problem for United, he is probably not the biggest problem, but it is becoming harder and harder to deny that he is a problem.Perhaps United feel they are so far stepped in blood there is no going back, but how long is it going to take to get to the other side? Will they ever get there under Amorim? How much more can United sink into a sunk-cost fallacy? Does anybody still believe Amorim could be like Alex Ferguson, that there could be a glorious future waiting at the end of the gloom? And if they do believe that, what exactly are the reasons for hope? And if they do not believe it, why is he still in the job? The empty seats in the United end by the final whistle told their own story.This wasn’t a shocking defeat. It won’t be remembered in six months, never mind years or decades. It was run-of-the-mill – and that is the most damning aspect of all.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedRuben AmorimManchester CityanalysisShareReuse this content"

He had a string of misfires with 10 consecutive incompletions in the second quarter, tossed an end zone interception and never looked comfortable as he side-armed some throws and missed open receivers on others.Texas weren’t in danger of losing, but Manning‘s recurring struggles in the offense are enough to concern Texas fans about the upcoming SEC schedule and whether the Longhorns really are title contenders. Through the first three games, Manning is completing just 55% of passes.“I’ve got to play better,” Manning said after the game. “A lot of quarterbacks, a lot of players, want to be great. I know I’m better than this.”Greatness was expected from his first days on campus, and certainly from the first minute on the field this season. After all, he’s the latest big, strong-armed quarterback from America’s most famous football family.He was one of the top recruits in the country coming out of high school. He waited the last two seasons at Texas behind Quinn Ewers, but flashed enough moments of brilliance in two starts when Ewers was hurt to further intensify already intense expectations. Off the field, he has raked in millions in endorsements. Some of his product television ads have aired during Texas games this season.Certainly more was expected of a quarterback in his third season in coach Steve Sarkisian’s offense. And yet Manning often looks rushed or confused or just simply misses open receivers.“All my life I’ve been an accurate passer,” Manning said. “I’ve just got to get back to it.”Sarkisian believes he can bring Manning to the level of play that was expected. Sarkisian at various times has pleaded for patience from fans and pundits.“I feel like we’ve done enough with him to have a pretty good understanding of who he is as a player and what he’s capable of. I know there’s a lot of football in him that’s high-level football,” Sarkisian said. “Our job as coaches is to work him towards that. We’ve righted the ship before, we’ll get there.”Manning’s teammates say they’re still confident in him as their leader.“He’s still a great quarterback,” offensive lineman Trevor Goosby said. “I tell him that every day.”Explore more on these topicsCollege footballCollege sportsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

It was easy then to imagine him in a past life, stealing through Victorian Manchester as a gaunt fingersmith, his nimble hands relieving rich men of their excessive wealth. But the gory marks on his face always brought us back to the jolting present and his bruising reality as a young and aspiring boxer.In 2003, when I interviewed him for the first of many times in the atmospheric setting of that converted factory turned into a boxing gym, Hatton was 24 years old. The troubles of the future lay deep in the unknown because everything Hatton did then burned with an immediacy and urgency. He didn’t care that his gaunt and sickly face was mottled with dark blue bruises and crimson nicks which had yet to scab over and start to heal. “Basic wear and tear,” he said with a little grin, “and my skin’s abnormal”. “When I go out into the sun, no matter how long I spend outside, I stay deathly pale. I change colour in the ring. I mark up and I cut.”Ricky Hatton, former boxing world champion, dies aged 46Read moreHatton also changed his character between the ropes. The friendly young man turned intothe ferocious “Hitman”, as he was nicknamed, while he tore into sparring partners or hammered home withering punches into a body protector which could not stop his trainer, Billy Graham, telling me how it felt like he was being “murdered” by Hatton.“You hold your breath as you get knocked back,” Graham said as he described the full force of being hit by Hatton. “You try to move away. He nails you with another and another. You’re still holding your breath. It’s like having your head held under water.”As he pummelled his trainer, or crumpled tough old bruisers brought in for sparring, Hatton let slip eerie little cries and shrieks. Seeing Hatton hit so hard gave me my most vivid insight into how seriously dangerous yet dramatically thrilling boxing was in stark close up.After all the decades of hanging around gyms, watching fighters at work, only the memories of Mike Tyson at his most destructive in sparring can rival the vivid images I carry of the young Ricky Hatton. He was utterly lost in boxing – and he soon turned it into a spectacle which won him a vast and roaring army of fans.British boxing seemed a little lost then, as it does now, drifting between eras. The great nights of the 1990s had been elevated by the simmering rivalries between Michael Watson, Chris Eubank Sr and Nigel Benn.Boxingin that decade had also been shaped by the crossover appeal of fighters as complicated and contrasting as Frank Bruno and Naseem Hamed.But they were all lost or faded when Hatton stepped out of the shadows in a new century and instilled fresh vigour into the battered old fight business. He brought with him legions of new fans who followed him with rising fervour – partly because hewas so exciting to watchin the ring and partly because it seemed as if he really was just one of them, a seemingly ordinary working class kid who liked to drink, swear, watch football and have a laugh.View image in fullscreenTens of thousands of fans followed Ricky Hatton to Las Vegas for his fight in 2007 against Floyd Mayweather Jr.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersSix years later, when we were together in Las Vegas while he prepared for his penultimate fight, which resulted in him being knocked out chillinglyby Manny Pacquiao in 2009, Hatton spoke earnestly of how much it mattered to him that he was so loved. “They see me as an ordinary bloke,” he said of his fans, “and their mate”.Tens of thousands of his supporters arrived in Vegas that week, undeterred by the fact that Hatton had been knocked out two years earlier in that same gaudy cityby Floyd Mayweather Jr, and they kicked up an almighty racket for the fighter they regarded as one of their own.But, in his fleeting prime, Hatton was extraordinary. In the early summer of June 2005 he came through fire to outfight and ultimatelyoverwhelm the brilliant Kostya Tszyuat a rocking and near hysterical MEN Arena in Manchester. It remains one of the greatest nights in the history of British boxing – and the magnificent peak of Hatton’s tumultuous career. Victory brought him even more adoration, money and the demons of fame.As hard as he tried to stress his normality, by buying drinks for blurring strangers in heaving pubs as he matched them pint for pint, Hatton could feel himself slipping away. Years of hard drinking between fights also diluted his ability to maintain his once voracious work rate. His vulnerability outside the ring soon became evident in that unforgiving space between the ropes. Defeat against Mayweather and Pacquiao crushed him.When Iinterviewed him years later, as he made an ill-advised comeback in 2012, Hatton cut to the heart of his anguish: “It was criminal what I used to do to my body – drinking so much between fights and ballooning up in weight. We all laughed at Ricky Fatton but it was a miracle I got away with it so long. But I didn’t really get away with anything, did I? Life kicked my arse with a vengeance.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

My blood pressure was through the roof and I was 15st 6lb. My doctor said I was on the verge of a heart attack. What he didn’t know was how close, or how often, I’d already come to killing myself. I’ve had so many problems with depression, drugs, drink, the newspapers, fallouts. Every fuck-up you could make in life I did it.“It got to a point where I didn’t care if I lived or I died. I’d been this working-class hero, this down‑to‑earth Manchester lad, who people liked so much that 25,000 of them flew to Las Vegas to watch me fight, singing: ‘There’s only one Ricky Hatton.’ Look what they ended up with? Another fucking Ricky Hatton altogether – a drunk crying in the corner of a pub. They used to say of me: ‘What a fighter! What a cracking lad!’ And then they saw this weeping wreck.”View image in fullscreenRicky Hatton was extraordinary in his prime, overwhelming Kostya Tszyu in 2005.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersIn that interview Hatton also told me: “I was literally thinking: ‘I’m going to drink myself to death here.’ Jennifer [Dooley, his girlfriend and the mother of his daughter Millie] would find me there. Or she would get home and see me with a knife at my wrist. She would take the knife away and calm me down. That was happening on a daily basis at one time – Jennifer taking knives off me or me having panic attacks. I hated the person I’d become.”Hatton was just as hurt bya bitter estrangement from his parents, to whom he had once been so close, and his years in retirement seemed haunted by a yearning to find himself as he had once been – driven by the consuming dream of one day becoming a world champion. He fulfilled that dream, and did much more, but life was never again as pure and simple as it had been in the days with Billy “The Preacher” Graham.It seems telling that Hatton was planning yet another comeback at the age of 46 and, a few days before his death, he posted images of himself preparing for a planned exhibition bout in Dubai.There is often tragedy in boxing and the death of such a great middle‑aged fighter is another grievous loss. But he lived and burned with a furious intensity and, as the truth of his death sinks in, the memories of that ghost‑faced urchin in the broiling old hat factory rise up again. Ricky Hatton was unforgettable then – and he remains so now.Explore more on these topicsRicky HattonBoxingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

No, because genuine rivalry is one of the best parts of sports, and Reese v Clark is particularly captivating.Jakub FrankowiczYes.Both of them have plenty of years ahead to avail themselves of the playoff stage. This year the games can stand on their own, relying less on tabloid-style fodder while highlighting the W’s depth and lifting more players into the spotlight.Bryan Armen GrahamYes.Perhaps the only silver lining to the fact that both athletes have missed chunks of this season due to injury is that the toxic elements of the Reese-Clark storyline are non-existent coming into the postseason. Hopefully, that’s a trend that carries over to next year, when (presumably) both will be back on the floor in top form.Stephanie KaloiNot really.It certainly wouldn’t have been a real storyline given the sorry state of the Chicago Sky, who only made the playoffs last year because Teresa Witherspoon was coaching. But it does smart not have either player in the mix – especially Clark, whom you’d have to think would have lifted Indiana out of the first round.Andrew LawrenceI assume so. It feels like people are holding on to a college-era feud that’s years old at this point. Meanwhile, Angel Reese clearly has bigger fish to fry – namely, a very real and completely valid tension within her own Chicago Sky organization.Tiana RandallTeam that will be missed the mostAnother season sans a playoff appearance for theLos Angeles Sparks, who have gone five years without a trip to the postseason. The shock Kelsey Plum trade brought them closer, but they still came up short. A postseason without Plum’s fiery competitiveness and long-range sharpshooting will be just a bit more dull.JFTheDallas Wings. No Paige, no party.BAGIt feels strange to say because they’re dead last in the standings, but not seeing theDallas Wingsout there will hurt a little bit. The team has largely operated seemingly in chaos most of the season, and many have questioned the leadership of both their GM and head coach, but they have a lot of heart.SKTheLA Sparkslooked primed for a playoff berth after kicking off the season by trading for Plum. But in the end the team couldn’t overcome injuries to Julie Allemand, Rickea Jackson and Cameron Brink – whoreturned to the Sparkshalfway through the season after tearing her ACL last year. At full strength, this team would’ve been a tough out.ALI was genuinely surprised to see theWashington Mysticsmiss out on a playoff spot. While their season was marked by inconsistent performances, their wins weren’t just wins, they were often very big ones against great teams. What stood out most, though, was how cohesive and connected the team looked on the court. Despite the ups and downs, there was a clear sense of chemistry, especially with the addition of impressive rookies like Sonia Citron, who brought a promising energy to the organization.TRView image in fullscreenThe Phoenix Mercury have home-court advantage in the first round but have drawn a very tough New York Liberty team.Photograph: Ethan Miller/Getty ImagesHigh seed at risk of going out earlyTheNew York Libertyhave limped into the playoffs, both figuratively and literally, having lost nearly every piece of their rotation to injury at some point. If they can’t get fully healthy and gel before their first-round matchup, look for the defending champs to head to an early exit.JFThePhoenix Mercury. Their first-round draw is a stacked New York Liberty team who are finally healthy as they launch their title defense.BAGThePhoenix Mercury. As solid as they were in the regular season, the other teams who earned home-court advantage – Minnesota, Atlanta and Las Vegas – are hungrier and have more to prove.SKAm I crazy for pickingLas Vegas? They haven’t lost in over a month and may well be due. Meanwhile, Seattle, where former MVP Nneka Ogwumike and six-time all-star Skylar Diggins lead the league’s fifth-best shooting outfit, only need to wintwiceto advance. The Storm split their four games against the Aces this season already.ALAlthough theAtlanta Dreamare somewhat of an underdog in these rankings, they’ve proven they can deliver consistent wins. However, they can be unpredictable when facing stronger, more established teams. With standout players like Alisha Gray, Rhyne Howard, and Brittney Griner, the talent is undeniable. Still, I’m not convinced they have the experience or composure to hold their own in clutch moments against top-tier competition.TRLong shot to winTheGolden State Valkyrieshad a strong first season in the league, with Veronica Burton looking like a contender for Most Improved Player. But it may not be enough despite a terrific advantage on their home court, where they’ve set a record this season for the highest attendance in WNBA history.JFTheSeattle Storm’s playoff chances were dicey enough after a wildly inconsistent regular season. But that was before they had the misfortune of drawing a scorching-hot Las Vegas team that closed out the regular season with 16 wins on the trot.BAGTheValkyrieswould face an incredibly steep battle, but their season has had a bit of magic to it. If they can get back into Ballhalla and tap into what Natalie Nakase has drilled all season, it’s not entirely wild to believe they could pull off the biggest surprise in league history. After all, they’ve kind of been doing that the entire time.SKNo franchise in any North American league has ever won a championship in its expansion season. TheValkyrieshave the absolute smallest statistical chance to do the impossible only because they beat out an injury ravaged LA squad (see above) for the final playoff spot.ALAlthough theIndiana Feverhave clinched a playoff spot, they’re barely hanging on by a thread. Key players likeCaitlin Clark, Aari McDonald, and Sophie Cunningham are sidelined with injuries, along with important role players like Sydney Colson. They’re lacking serious depth and are being forced to probably out perform their talents. With so many stars out, fan engagement may also dip, and in a league where fan culture plays a big role in pushing teams forward, that could be a major setback for their championship hopes.TRView image in fullscreenThe Golden State Valkyries have reached the playoffs in their first season, but might not be there for long.Photograph: Ezra Shaw/Getty ImagesMost important player this postseasonAlyssa Thomashas always been a jack of all trades, even before her move to Phoenix this season. But she’s taken it to another level in 2025, with a remarkableeighttriple doubles. No team’s hopes ride on a single player more than the Mercury do with Thomas.JFA’ja Wilson.No one else blends defensive dominance, scoring versatility and leadership with her consistency under pressure. She anchors Las Vegas’s defense as an elite rim protector while commanding double-teams offensively, freeing teammates to thrive.BAGA’ja Wilson.She’s led the Aces on one if the most impactful team comebacks we’ve seen this season, is a very likely 2025 MVP and will probably end up taking the team on a deep run. She is (always, inevitably) the player to watch.SKNapheesa Collier.She was the most important player last year, the best end-to-end player in the game this year, and should beat Wilson to the MVP with an assist from voter fatigue. The Lynx haven’t exactly been shy about expressing how salty they still are about the way last season’s championship ended and, as ever, Phee will be key to them exacting revenge.ALNapheesa Collier. The Minnesota Lynx are a strong team with a clear hunger to win, especially after the sting of what many saw as a snub in the last championship. But despite their talent, there seems to be a lot of noise and distraction surrounding the organization this season. That’s where Collier comes in. She has ability to center the team, refocus their energy, and push them to reprioritize, which could be exactly what the Lynx need to make a serious run at the title.TRView image in fullscreenNapheesa Collier and the Minnesota Lynx have unfinished business.Photograph: Ellen Schmidt/Getty ImagesPlayoff semi-finalistsLas Vegas Aces, Minnesota Lynx, New York Liberty,Indiana Fever.JFAtlanta Dream, Las Vegas Aces, New York Liberty, Minnesota LynxBAGAtlanta Dream, Las Vegas Aces, New York Liberty, Minnesota LynxSKIndiana Fever, Las Vegas Aces, Minnesota Lynx, Phoenix MercuryALThe champion will be ...Las Vegas Aces.They’ll meet Minnesota in the finals and Becky Hammon’s red-hot side will take home a third title in four years. A couple weeks ago I would have said the Lynx, who were a questionable call away from winning in 2024 and returned their entire core. But Vegas have won 16 straight to close out the regular season with reigning MVP Wilson leading the charge. Their depth still lacks compared to the Lynx, but any matchup between the two would be electric.JFMinnesota Lynx.Cheryl Reeve claimed her team was robbed after comingthis closeto winning it all last year and the Lynx have been on a revenge tour ever since. So far, so good. With the league’s top defense and elite three-point shooting, they can suffocate opponents on one end and punish them on the other. Collier’s MVP-level brilliance anchors a roster that thrives on depth, ball movement and chemistry. Add in veteran poise and total buy-in to Reeve’s system and the Lynx stand as the team to beat.BAGMinnesota Lynx.I see a Lynx-Dream Finals, a rematch of 2013 but with Atlanta stronger than ever. The Dream know how to trouble Minnesota; they handed the Lynx two of their nine defeats this year, both with and without Collier. But this Lynx team is deeper, steadier and built for the biggest stage. Collier’s leadership and their collective poise should carry Minnesota to another championship.SKMinnesota Lynx.I picked ‘em last year and would have been right if it hadn’t been for Alanna Smith’s controversial foul on the Liberty’s Breanna Stewart with 5.2 seconds left in Game 5. The Lynx have been on a revenge tour all season, starting strong and staying that way to lock up the top seed in the bracket. But as ever, I expect it’ll be the strategy of Reeve that’ll make the difference. I simply cannot see her losing a WNBA finals series in back-to-back years.ALMinnesota Lynxhave an insatiable hunger for redemption. That championship loss in 2024 seems to have left a deep mark, and it’s evident in how they’ve approached their games this season. They’ve been incredibly consistent in team basketball, showing strong court vision, and offensive play. Their overall health has also played a key role; having a solid, mostly injury-free roster makes a big difference. Plus, the addition of standout newly traded players like DiJonai Carrington is already making an impact, especially on the defensive end. I think it will probably come down to the New York Liberty and Lynx again and the Lynx will take it home.TRExplore more on these topicsWNBANew York LibertyIndiana FeverCaitlin ClarkUS sportsBasketballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In an official statement, the Vuelta organisers said: “For security reasons, stage 21 of La Vuelta has been ended early. There will be no podium ceremony.”Pidcock ready for podium as Vingegaard all but guarantees Vuelta triumph with stage winRead moreSpanish media reported that about 3,000 protesters were at the finish line and it was also claimed that there had been violent exchanges between police and protesters. Security sources told Spanish media they had “to charge at the protesters who were throwing barriers and bottles”. The Spanish government later said more than 100,000 people were at the rally in Madrid.Afterdays of vociferous protestsdirected towards the Israel Premier Tech team, extra police had been brought into Madrid in a bid to secure the final stage, in what was the largest security operation since the city hosted a Nato summit in 2022.A huge crowd of protesters pushed over race barriers, close to the Plaza de Colón and Gran Vía, as security forces lost control of the situation. Police charged some of the protesters and fired teargas, but the race route was overwhelmed.As the peloton arrived in Madrid, with 56km to race, riders at the rear were delayed and also pushed by protesters holding anti‑Israel banners. The race organisers then stopped the front of the race and lengthy discussions with the Guardia Civil led to the decision to cancel the stage.Soon afterwards, a glum-looking Vingegaard was seen sharing a muted celebratory handshake with his teammates, as he made his way directly to his team hotel.View image in fullscreenBarriers are smashed by pro-Palestine protesters at the finish line of the final stage in Madrid.Photograph: Ana Beltran/ReutersBefore the stage the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, had expressed his “admiration” for the demonstrators. Speaking in Málaga, he said: “We would like to express our gratitude and absolute respect for the athletes but also our admiration for the Spanish people who mobilise for just causes, such as Palestine.”The Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Saar, said: “He encouraged protesters to take to the streets. The pro-Palestinian mob listened to the inciting messages and attacked La Vuelta. The sporting event that has always been a source of pride forSpainhas been cancelled. Sánchez and his government: shame on Spain!”The collapse of the third biggest Grand Tour of the year has plunged World Tour racing into crisis, with the continued presence of the Israel Premier Tech team, recently endorsed by Benjamin Netanyahu, the object of the increasingly enraged protest groups at the roadside.A week ago, as pressure increased on the team, owned by the billionaire entrepreneur Sylvan Adams, to withdraw from the Vuelta, Netanyahu posted: “Great job to Sylvan and Israel’s cycling team for not giving in to hatred and intimidation. You make Israel proud!”View image in fullscreenThere were some clashes between protesters and police, who had mounted Madrid’s biggest security operation since Spain hosted the Nato summit in 2022.Photograph: Rodrigo Jimenez/EPAThedisruptions throughout the three-week raceaffected multiple stages and led to the cancellation of planned stage finishes and the shortening of the race distance.Vingegaard, speaking last Monday to Danish media, said of the protests: “People do it for a reason. It’s horrible what’s happening currently and I think those protesting do so here, because they need a forum to be heard.”The Tour de France Grand Depart takes place in Barcelona in July next year and Spanish protest groups are targeting the French race. The Palestinian campaign for the academic and cultural boycott of Israel told Swiss media “protests will continue at cycling races as long as hypocritical western institutions absolve Israel”, adding: “The immediate finish line is the end of the genocide.”Last week the civil disobedience group Futuro Vegetal said it was “very likely” that there would be further protests in Barcelona and added that “protesting at the Tour de France is the least we can do”.Despite the cancellation of the stage, Vingegaard still won the race overall, from the Portuguese João Almeida in second place. It was the Dane’s third Grand Tour victory, after his wins in the Tour de France in 2022 and 2023. Tom Pidcock, double Olympic gold medallist in mountain biking, took his first Grand Tour podium, finishing third overall.

With Liverpool lacking conviction in the final third, Isak would have been a welcome addition but, with a fourth straight victory secured, Slot need not worry about that.Isak needs time to get fit says Slot after leaving striker out of Liverpool win at BurnleyRead moreIt is the second time in successive games that a late penalty has cost Burnley a draw, having lostlast time out at Manchester United in similar circumstances. Scott Parker will be proud of his players, who in a season that could be defined by the finest of margins, will be frustrated by the dropped points. Burnley were deservedly holding on, despite Lesley Ugochukwu being dismissed late on for a second bookable offence.Parker, whose final game in charge ofBournemouth was a 9-0 defeat by Liverpoolin August 2022, approached the fixture with a conservative outlook. Burnley switched to a back five including central midfielder Josh Laurent. Everyone in claret was almost permanently behind the ball and rarely offered much in the way of a press, as Liverpool enjoyed 81% possession, but were ready to irritate and win the ball back when required.Liverpool spent plenty of time in theBurnleyhalf, winning numerous corners, putting Martin Dubravka under pressure with crosses, but the hosts were able to hold the champions at bay. They even created their own early chance on the counter, culminating in Jaidon Anthony firing just over from the edge of the box.The Turf Moor crowd were enraged by the amount of time Alexis Mac Allister took to get up after a reckless challenge by Ugochukwu, which rightly earned a booking. The hostility towards Liverpool quickly grew when Milos Kerkez performed a pitiful dive in an attempt to earn a penalty. His reward was a yellow card and being replaced by Andy Robertson in the 38th minute to avoid being dismissed.View image in fullscreenLesley Ugochukwu’s foul on Florian Wirtz earned him a second yellow card.Photograph: Peter Powell/EPABurnley’s deep defending disrupted Liverpool’s rhythm because there was little space to utilise. Where invention was required to get through the claret wall, Liverpool lacked the cunning to find a way. Florian Wirtz struggled to create despite Liverpool often camping on the edge of the Burnley box. Robertson came closest to opening the scoring but he shot straight at Dubravka after a run into the box.At this point, it would have been useful to call on Isak, but he was at home. Slot is eager not to rush him into playing after missing pre-season. Salah, Hugo Ekitiké and Cody Gakpo were not on the same wavelength and struggled to break down Burnley.Instead Conor Bradley was sent on at the break to inject much-needed energy. There was greater vibrancy to Liverpool as Ryan Gravenberch fired over, while Wirtz, whose influence was beginning to grow, shot wide and Dominik Szoboszlai’s rising drive was tipped over by Dubravka. The tide was turning in Liverpool’s favour.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Debutant Florentino Luís stuck to his task on his first experience ofPremier Leaguefootball, while Kyle Walker excelled at full-back, forcing the rest of the defence to match his standards.Burnley’s mission was made more difficult with six minutes to go when Ugochukwu was given a second yellow for fouling Wirtz on the edge of the box. It was all about holding on from this point.Szoboszlai could not replicate his magic that defeated Arsenaland sent the subsequent free-kick over.The clock ticked down and Turf Moor was ready to exhale with relief at the final whistle, but instead Liverpool got to enjoy that emotion. Jeremie Frimpong clipped a cross into the box, Mejbri turned his back, sticking out an elbow to leave referee Michael Oliver with no other option. It was a brief lapse in concentration and it clearly pained Mejbri to watch Salah fire beyond Dubravka. It is another harsh Premier League lesson for Burnley but champions are often the best at teaching them.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBurnleyLiverpoolmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

I believe in my way’Jamie Jacksonat the Etihad StadiumSun 14 Sep 2025 15.34 EDTLast modified on Sun 14 Sep 2025 20.59 EDTShareA defensive Ruben Amorim insisted after Manchester United’s 3-0 derby defeat at Manchester City that his system will remain, so “you have to change the man” if his 3-4-3 formation is to be discarded. The head coach also suggested recent events behind closed doors have hampered the team.City defeated United 3‑0 with Phil Foden’s 18th-minute header and Erling Haaland’s strikes on 53 and 68 minutes. It leaves Amorim’s side on four points after four games and his overall record as 31 from 31 games.Amorim denied the team’s shape may be adjusted to try to improve results and he pointed to unknown occurrences as a factor in the form.“It is not a record you should have at Manchester United,” he said. “You have no idea what happened [privately] during these [past] months but I accept that. I am not going to change. When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man.“We talk about this every game that we lose. I believe in my way and I am going to play my way until I want to change.“I see that we are doing better but the results don’t show that.I remember last year I played with my former club [Sporting Lisbon] against City [in the Champions League] – we won 4-1. It was not near the same amount of opportunities – the way we controlled that game compared to today. In certain moments we were not better than City – I understand that. It is hard and the record says everything. I understand.”Amorim was asked what the message is to any fans losing faith in him. “That I am going to give everything,” the 40-year-old said. “I will do everything – always thinking about what is best for the club. That was always the same message. It is not my decision, the rest. I really want to win games. I am suffering more than them.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The latest defeat leaves Burnley with three points from four games after throwing away two potential draws.“It’s really heartbreaking the way the game finishes for us,” their manager, Scott Parker, said. “Two weeks in a row that it’s in the dying minutes, two penalties that decide the games. And we don’t manage to get the result.“It’s pretty disappointing. I thought the players really produced a performance. It was everything we’ve worked on.

The problem for the home side was that it was scored by a Tottenham player.When Cathinka Tandberg spotted Courtney Brosnan off her line, as she received the ball 35 yards out, she did not hesitate to attempt the lob, and she would spoil the party for Everton in their first competitive match since making Goodison Park their permanent home. Her first-time strike dropped perfectly and capped an impressive away performance for Spurs, who made it two wins out of two so far under their new head coach, Martin Ho.Sam Kerr scores after 634-day absence while Manchester United maul LionessesRead moreThat ambitious effort, four minutes into the second half, came after Olga Ahtinen slotted Spurs in front 27 minutes into a first half they controlled, with Everton unable to click into gear. Ahtinen’s opener came after she won the ball on the edge of the area, played a one-two with Tandberg and slotted low past Brosnan.Both goals came from Tottenham pressing with intensity, as Bethany England tackled Rion Ishikawa before laying the ball off for Tandberg’s long-range lob, on the Norway striker’s first start since her deadline-day move from the Swedish side Hammarby.“She did it in training this week,” Ho said of Tandberg. “The courage to do that and the risk-taking to do that is big and that’s what she’s built on. Overall, her performance was brilliant.”View image in fullscreenNew signage outside Goodison Park.Photograph: John Clifton/Action Images/ReutersThe former England striker Ellen White labelled the strike “absolutely ridiculous” on the BBC’s live television coverage and Tandberg told the broadcaster: “I did it in my last club. You just have to go for it, and when you score that, it’s unbelievable. When I get those moments I have to do what I like and that’s scoring goals, so ‘go for it’.”It was also a second consecutive clean sheet for Tottenham, whereas for Everton the result brought them back down to earth somewhat, after their positive victory away at Anfield. This game was still historic for them, though. They were backed by 6,473 at Goodison, an attendance which is nearly three times the maximum capacity of their former home at Walton Hall Park.In the stands there were some signs of “the grand old lady” having been vacated recently by the Everton men’s team, not least the many hundreds of seats that have been removed, but in general the venue looked smart. The rebrand around the exterior has been impressive; a timeline of the history of the women’s team is now found proudly along Goodison Road, while along Walton Road, a series of new banners display the “Everton Women” name and say: “A history we own; a future we are making.” Another reads: “Goodison Park, the home ofEverton Women.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Of course, we want to do better. I don’t know if it was the occasion. But it’s on me to make sure they’re 100% ready, and they weren’t.”Ho, formerly a player at Everton’s boys’ academy before working as assistant coach of Everton Women between 2015 and 2018, labelled the stadium “beautiful”. “Coming back here was an unbelievable feeling. As soon as you come in here, you do feel intimidated because the stadium is quite enclosed. And that’s one thing I said to the players before the game, was ‘we have to expect it to be a bit hostile’, and I thought the fans were brilliant.”Everton’s best moments featured Ruby Mace having a deflected shot saved and Rosa van Gool curling over, but Spurs had the better chances, with Tandberg sliding wide in the first half, England heading wide in the second and Drew Spence forcing Brosnan into a smart late save.

But on a day when “sack the board” chants and banners were evident from the away end, it looked like the hierarchy were set to come under further pressure when David Watson headed Killie level in the 83rd minute.With virtually the last kick of the match, however, Iheanacho – a free-agent signing after the transfer deadline – smashed home his spot-kick after fellow substitute James Forrest’s shot was adjudged to have been handled by Lewis Mayo.Meanwhile, Russell Martin is understood to retain the backing of the Rangers board despite fans furiously calling for his dismissal during and after the2-0 home defeat against Heartson Saturday.View image in fullscreenRussell Martin watches Rangers’ defeat to Hearts.Photograph: Stuart Wallace/ShutterstockA Lawrence Shankland double gave the visitors their first win at Ibrox in 11 years and left Gers supporters incandescent with rage at the worst start to a league campaign in 47 years.

There was an early decoy run, too, with the team coach entering at stage left, in the corner populated by the away fans, much to the disappointment of the swell of Saints supporters waiting to welcome their rivals outside the main entrance.There was some early needle between Still and Mousinho, too, the former unhappy at some perceived early time-wasting, glaring at his opposite number after haring on to the pitch to hurry the ball to thePortsmouthfull-back Zak Swanson.Portsmouth succeeded in swiftly dousing the natural excitement that accompanied the fixture and came closest to scoring, with the midfielder Andre Dozzell curling a crisp first-time shot against the crossbar nine minutes into the contest.Southampton were subdued, particularly in the first half, and midway through the Portsmouth goalkeeper, Nicolas Schmid, was forced off and went to hospital with a wrist injury after colliding with his defender Connor Ogilvie, who had to be replaced at the interval with a neck issue. Mousinho was unhappy with theSouthamptonwinger Tom Fellows, one of a flurry of recent arrivals, for nudging Ogilvie towards his goalkeeper.“I thought it was really poor,” the Portsmouth manager said. “It is a small push but a small push with massive consequences … there’s no other explanation for that other than he’s trying to injure our players. And he did so successfully, so well done on that. If anyone can give me another explanation, I’ll happily take it.”There were only two shots on target, one apiece. The Portsmouth substitute Terry Devlin registered a bumbling strike from distance, easy for the former Pompey loanee Gavin Bazunu to gather in the Southampton goal, and Cameron Archer flicked an effort at the substitute goalkeeper Ben Killip.View image in fullscreenWill Still was a picture of frustration during the match.Photograph: Robin Jones/Getty ImagesJosh Murphy’s wicked delivery from the left flank caused Southampton problems and this was undoubtedly a superior result for Pompey, who remain two points above Saints in the second tier. “Who needs Mourinho? We’ve got Mousinho,” the away fans rejoiced.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We wasted everyone’s time in the first half and it was just a bit of a dull derby that didn’t reflect who we want to be.”After the referee, Matthew Donohue, blew for full time, that strong handshake prompted Still to screw his face at Mousinho. “I didn’t quite get that … I didn’t understand why he grabbed hold of my hand,” Still said.“Me and him are good mates, don’t worry about it,” Mousinho said, his reply laced with sarcasm. “I don’t want anyone to come off [the pitch] and be the best of friends after the game. I certainly don’t think the managers of these clubs should be best of mates.”Explore more on these topicsChampionshipSouthamptonPortsmouthmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

United acted after Sellés’s sidewere dismantled 5-0 at Ipswichon Friday.Wilder was dismissed after losing the Championship playoff final at Wembley andthe Blades turned to Sellés, who narrowly avoided relegation with Hull City last season.Sellés attended United’s playoff semi-final first-leg win at Bristol City and was hastily appointed after talks with their US owner, the COH sports group consortium.It is thought Wilder will return to Bramall Lane empowered, given the manager previously clashed with the ownership around its shift in transfer strategy. United’s owner’s attempts to implement artificial intelligence-led recruitment have so far backfired.The Spaniard Sellés, who also coached at Southampton and Reading, was an unpopular appointment and endured a disastrous spell in Sheffield. He lost all six matches in charge, five in the league, and his side had not scored a goal in their past four fixtures.“Sheffield United’s board of directors have opted to make a change at managerial level,” confirmed the club on Sunday afternoon. “After a disappointing start to the Championship campaign, Rubén Sellés has been relieved of his duties as manager.“Following a review of recent performances, and taking into account the feelings of supporters, the timing of the change has been made to give the club the best possible opportunity to improve the current league position. The board of directors wish to thank Mr Sellés for his hard work.

That would appear to be the message coming out of Tirana on Thursday whenUefaannounced it had not taken the epochal decision on overseas league fixtures that the world of football had anticipated. Instead, the executive committee decided it would embark on a round of consultation, one that would even take in the considerations of supporters to boot.This is likely a sensible decision. There has been a fair amount of surprise in some quarters that the question of whether and by how much football leagues should be allowed to move from domestic to international is only now being properly debated in the corridors of power. After all, the first writ in this debate was served by the promoter Relevent against the United States Soccer Federation in 2019. Only with the prospect of La Liga staging a fixture between Barcelona and Villarreal in Miami as soon as December has the issue come into focus. But to have discussion at all will be regarded by many as better late than never. It is also a break with the current way of doing things.Uefa delays decision on allowing domestic games abroad and vows to consult fansRead moreFifa’sClub World Cup, the biggest and most disruptive new development in the game for some time, is largely viewed as having come about as the result of one man’s determination to drive change (that man being Gianni Infantino). The process Fifa undertook to establish the tournament has, however, led to legal action and no small amount of rancour over a claimed lack of consultation with competition organisers. (It should be noted there has been less complaint from clubs, some of whom pocketed tens of millions of dollars for taking part.) In this instance, by contrast, Uefa appears to have opted for jaw jaw rather than war war.The president of Uefa, Aleksander Ceferin, flagged this possible direction in an interview conducted before the Champions League draw in Monaco last month. Asked about the plan for overseas fixturesby Politico, Ceferin said: “We’re not happy but, as much as we checked legally, we don’t have much space here, if the federation agrees, and both federations agreed. But I think that for the future we’ll have to discuss this very seriously, because … fans should watch football at home … We will open this discussion also with Fifa, and with all the federations, because I don’t think it’s a good thing.”If Uefa’s presumably well-remunerated lawyers weren’t wildly wrong in their calculations then deferral with a chance of dialogue was perhaps the best option Uefa could plump for in the short term. It may best serve its interests in the longer term too. With the contest to control the future of the world’s most popular sport continuing to heat up, it is possible to argue that Uefa is among the most vulnerable to any shift away from the current model of the men’s game. Its tournaments – the European Championship, the Nations League, even the Champions League – are likely to be the first to feel the squeeze should the international calendar take on even more matches in the medium term via changes such as a biennial Club World Cup. Faced with this position, being an organisation that is seen to be listening, and perhaps even collaborative, may well be a good idea.In the Politico interview Ceferin drew a red line against a biennial Club World Cup, saying:“I wouldn’t agree with that, but I don’t think [Fifa] want to.” That last line goes against much of the reporting on the topic but was of a piece with a more emollient tone as Ceferin rolled back on remarks Uefa had made months beforecondemning Infantino’s “private political interests”after the Fifa’s president arrived late for his own Congress after touring the Gulf with Donald Trump. Ceferin told Politico the language used had been “a bit overemotional” and that relations with Fifa were “absolutely” in a better place.View image in fullscreenGianni Infantino and Donald Trump at the Club World Cup final in New Jersey.Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/ReutersAgain with the conciliation, again another possible sign of where the balance of power lies. But by behaving constructively, by acting less as a rival and more as a facilitator, Uefa will find itself in tune with another player which could yet weigh in on the future of European football (and by extension the game as a whole): Brussels. The European courts are where much of the battles is being played out, with no ruling more consequential than that involving the European Super League, which questioned the ability of sports governing bodies to act as both regulator and competition organiser without the risk of “abusing” their “dominant position”. The European Commission, meanwhile, is taking more and more interest in ensuring the concept of a “European Sports Model” where open competition (ie promotion and relegation) runs alongside financial solidarity from the top to the bottom of the pyramid.The European commissioner for intergenerational fairness, youth, culture and sport, Glenn Micallef, made the unusual decision to intervene in the debate over international fixtures last week, describing the plans as betraying supporters and putting the European Sports Model at risk. On Thursday, he spoke again, commending Uefa’s decision to pause and discuss. “This is the right and responsible way to do things; through inclusive dialogue and consultation,” he wrote on social media.The Commission is the body that initiates Europe’s political direction and if it felt it necessary to intervene to protect the European Sports Model, it could. Such an action would likely throw the existing power structures in football up in the air and being on the right side of any such shift would be to any governing body’s advantage. If Ceferin’s remarks on the issue of international fixtures are correct, it may be we see such matches yet. But while it is unfortunate to lose some battles, sometimes they may help you in fighting a war.Explore more on these topicsUefaFifaClub World CupEuropean Super LeagueFootball politicscommentShareReuse this content"

But whatever happens, a great team understands that just because you haven’t got a [leadership] title, doesn’t stop you from being a leader.”A switch would be a blow to Pope, who has been vice-captain since late 2022 and led the team five times during this time. McCullum confirming Pope will also be the reserve wicketkeeper on tour – the role he performed in New Zealand last year,handing Jacob Bethell his chance– is unlikely to soften it.As for the squad overall, McCullum said he wants at least seven seamers, even if he is searching for a new person to mentor for them. Tim Southee, who replaced Jimmy Anderson in the role this summer, is committed to playing franchise cricket, with Andrew Flintoff tipped as one option for the role.With McCullum confident that Mark Wood will be “cherry ripe” after knee surgery in March blew out his summer, the main question mark is the spare spinner. Shoaib Bashir is still the No 1, McCullum insisted, despite missing the back end of the 2-2 series draw against India with a broken hand.View image in fullscreenEngland’s final T20 against South Africa was called off at a soggy Trent Bridge without a ball being bowled.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersLiam Dawson replaced Bashir for the Old Trafford Test but a wicketless final day, plus his usual winter commitments in franchise cricket, may lead to Rehan Ahmed getting the nod. As for Stokes, who is recovering from a shoulder injury, McCullum has no concerns and expects him to have a “booming series”.The head coach said: “I know how much [Stokes] wants these Ashes. My job will be to finesse that. Sometimes, we can want something too much and our haste to want to succeed can be the thing that stops us succeeding. But it’s going to be a ripper.”McCullum offering his thoughts on the Ashes – and defending England’s solitary warmup, pointing out they have won the first Test of every away tour under his leadership – offered some interest on an otherwise soggy day at Trent Bridge. Brian Clough might have walked on water in this part of the world but they are still to work out how to stop it falling from the sky.Not that England’s summer is over entirely. A squad flies to Ireland on Monday for three further T20s, albeit further diluted by Brook and Jofra Archer being granted a breather before the winter. No Brook meansBethell will get his first taste of captaincyat the tender age of 21.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

England’s warmup match against their own Lions side may yet decide who gets the nod for the No 3 position.Before the rain fell in Nottingham, England also announced that Saqib Mahmood will miss Ireland to undergo “minor knee surgery”. In comes Hampshire’s Scott Currie, a former England Under-19 seamer who won three one-day international caps for Scotland last year, for his first senior call-up.Among the greatest pities about the damp scenes was that Phil Salt, Jos Buttler, Luke Wood, Tom Banton and Dawson all missed T20 Finals Day at Edgbaston 24 hours earlier to then mill around watching puddles form on the covers.Still, in spite of the absentees and the time of year,Somerset’s victory capped a memorable occasionthat clearly meant so much to so many. The T20 Blast may no longer be the premier men’s short-form tournament in England but, to pinch a line from Clough, it is definitely in the top one.Explore more on these topicsEngland cricket teamHarry BrookBrendon McCullumBen StokesThe AshesSouth Africa cricket teamCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

That’s the stuff that we are going to have to deal with.“So it’s better to try to desensitise yourself as much as possible before you get in there. You can get them to say whatever you want them to say. So you can go as close to the bone as you like.”Donald’s attention to detail is well known but this is a striking move. Europe have not won on American soil since 2012. “We are doing every­thing we can to best prepare ourselves for what it is going to feel like on Friday week,” McIlroy said.“But nothing can really prepare you until you’re actually in that. You can wear all the VR headsets you want and do all the different things we’ve been trying to do to get ourselves ready but once the first tee comes on Friday it’s real and we just have to deal with whatever’s given.”Pressed on precisely what messages came through his headset, McIlroy replied: “You don’t want to know. Not for publication.”McIlroy did, however, play down the sense of themost fevered Ryder Cup backdropin history. So much has already been speculated about the treatment European players might receive in New York.The Masters champion said: “I think the more we talk about that, the maddest [crowds] or whatever, we might get there and be like, this ­actually isn’t as bad as we thought it would be, who knows. No matter if you’re an American team going to Europe or you’re a European team going to America, it’s the same. You know you’re not going to be up against not just a great team but the crowd as well. That brings its challenges.View image in fullscreenAlex Norén kisses the trophy after winning the PGA Championship.Photograph: Adam Davy/PA“New York is definitely more of a cosmopolitan city, more of a ­melting pot and more backgrounds and people identify as part European.

The Northern Irishman will cross the Atlantic in fine fettle after a 65 to sign off at the PGA Championship.Meanwhile, a rain-lashed Went­worth hosted a second DP World Tour playoff in as many weeks. This one lacked the dramain which ­McIlroy won the Irish Openbut it was still significant as Alex Norén claimed his second win in three starts. Both came in England and both came after a seven-year wait, after injury affected the 43-year-old Swede.Norén saw off Adrien Saddier on the first sudden-death playing of the 18th as a wonderful chip set up a birdie four. Norén and Saddier both posted fourth rounds of 68 to tie at 19 under par in regulation play. Norén will be a vice-captain with Europe in Bethpage. It feels inevitable that the Swede will be asked to bring his clubs, should injury or illness hit one of Europe’s dozen players.“Sometimes it comes easily and sometimes you’ve got to fight,” Norén said. “I have trusted the process and that paid off.”Norén laughed off any prospect of playing in theRyder Cup. “The other guys have played better than me throughout the year.

Of course this means a lot.”Terence Crawford stuns Canelo Álvarez to become undisputed super middleweight championRead moreAsked when he knew he would beat Álvarez, the laconic Crawford didn’t miss a beat. “When he signed the contract,” he said, drawing laughter from the room. But the one-liners were accompanied by a deeper insistence that this result was no accident. “When I set my sights on doing something and I know what I’m capable of, it’s not like a surprise to me,” he said. “It’s a surprise to y’all, because y’all didn’t believe me. But for me, I knew I could do it. I just needed the opportunity.”Crawford described the first few rounds as controlled rather than cautious. “I felt like I was in control,” he said. “I think he was trying to figure me out.” When Álvarez did get through with punches to the body, Crawford brushed them off. “He wasn’t hitting the body or anything. He was hitting my elbow because I was blocking it.”The sixth round, when Crawford began to stand his ground and land sharp left hands, marked the moment he felt the balance shift. “Around like the sixth round, I felt like I needed to step it up a little more and get more control of the fight, because the fight was going like a seesaw effect,” he said. From there he grew more confident, even smiling at Canelo’s best shots in the late rounds.Much of the buildup had focused on whether Crawford, who had fought at 147lb or below in all but one of his 41 previous fights, could handle Canelo’s power. He was dismissive. “I’ve been hit harder,” he said, citing Egidijus Kavaliauskas,who hurt him briefly in 2019. “[Kavaliauskas] hit harder than Canelo, to me, to be honest.”When told that Álvarez appeared to fade in the later rounds, Crawford refused to diminish his opponent. “He was 1,000% prepared. I just think I was the better man today.”Álvarez, for his part, offered no excuses after turning up for a press conference that most would have understood if he’d blown off. “We knew Crawford is a great fighter … I tried my best tonight, and I just couldn’t figure out the style. You need to take the loss and accept everything,” he said. Later he added, almost ruefully: “Sometimes you try and your body cannot go. That’s my frustration … my body just didn’t let me go any more.”View image in fullscreenCanelo Álvarez, left, and Terence Crawford exchange words after Saturday night’s post-fight press conference.Photograph: Harry How/Getty Images for NetflixThe win made Crawford the first male boxer in the four-belt era to become undisputed in three divisions, an achievement previously matched only by Henry Armstrong in 1938. “It means a lot to me, because anybody can be a nobody,” Crawford said. “That’s all they say I’ve been fighting is nobodies. So what can they say now? Somebody tell me, what can you say now?”Crawford insisted he had nothing but respect for Canelo. “He’s a great champion. He’s a strong competitor,” he said. “Like I said before, I’ve got nothing but respect for Canelo. I’m a big fan of Canelo and he fought like a champion today.” Álvarez even returned the compliment with a striking admission: “I think Crawford is way better thanFloyd Mayweather.”As for his own place in history, Crawford pushed back against the inevitable comparisons. “Floyd was the greatest in his era. I’m the greatest in my era. It ain’t no need to compare me to Floyd or Floyd to me.”And then, the fighter who has built a career on being understated, finished with a reminder that the vindication was as much about the doubters as the believers. “The ones that doubted me, they know,” he said. “I don’t have to say I told you so or rub it in their face. This right here is I told you so.”Explore more on these topicsTerence CrawfordBoxingCanelo ÁlvarezUS sportsFloyd MayweathernewsShareReuse this content"

The finding that about a third of managers report their organisations are monitoring workers’ online activities on employer-owned devices is probably an underestimate, as roughly the same proportion said they don’t know what tracking their organisations do.Many monitoring systems are aimed at preventing insider threats and safeguarding sensitive information as well as detecting productivity dips. But the trend appears to be causing unease. A large minority of managers are opposed to the practice, saying it undermines trust with staff and invades their personal privacy, the CMI found.One manager at an insurance company, which is developing AI systems to monitor staff screen activity to track performance, said it was “unsettling”.“Do they not trust their employees to do their jobs and are they looking to replace them with AI?” they said.One provider ofemployee monitoring offers to reporton workers’ “idle time”, “employee productivity tracking” and use of unapproved AI or social media as well as “real-time insights into employee behaviour, including screenshots, screen recordings, keystrokes, and app usage”.In response to the findings, the ICO said bosses “must make their employees aware of the nature, extent and reasons for monitoring”, and said excessive monitoring “can undermine people’s privacy especially if they are working from home”. It warned it will “take action if necessary”.Last year,the ICO stopped the outsourcing company Sercofrom using facial recognition technology and fingerprint scanning to monitor the attendance of staff at a chain of leisure centres.Monitoring often amounts to checks that inappropriate content is not being accessed, the CMI said. But it warned, “there’s a longer-term impact if you are feeling this is big brother-like and you are being watched”.“If it is being used, it is incredibly important employers are open, otherwise that’s going to cause significant problems in terms of data privacy and protection,” said Petra Wilton, CMI director of policy and external affairs.Other recent examples of surveillance technology at work include plans byHSBC to install a large numbers of security cameras– 1,754 by one estimate – and biometric readers which use handprints as one way to access areas in its new London headquarters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A spokesperson for PwC said this was “accepted by the vast majority of our people”.A former senior worker at a public transport authority, who asked not to be named, called the monitoring they faced, including of their online diary, “intrusive and downright harassment”.“It started with surveillance and it ended with me leaving because I was so infuriated,” they said. One in six managers also told the CMI researchers they would consider looking for a new job if their organisation started monitoring employees’ online activities on work devices.Among managers who knew their organisations carried out surveillance, 35% were monitoring emails. Overall, tracking log in and log off times and system access were the most popular form of surveillance.The study found that 53% of managers supported monitoring of employees’ online activities on employer-owned devices, but 42% opposed it, mostly because it undermines trust but also because they believe it does not improve performance and can be misused or lead to unfair judgments or disciplinary actions.Explore more on these topicsPrivacySurveillanceArtificial intelligence (AI)ManagementnewsShareReuse this content"

So what should you know about where to draw the line between check and cheat?Tess ReidySun 14 Sep 2025 03.00 EDTShareFor many students,ChatGPThas become as standard a tool as a notebook or a calculator.Whether it’s tidying up grammar, organising revision notes, or generating flashcards, AI is fast becoming a go-to companion in university life. But as campuses scramble to keep pace with the technology, a line is being quietly drawn. Using it to understand? Fine. Using it to write your assignments? Not allowed.According to arecent reportfrom the Higher Education Policy Institute, almost 92% of students are now using generative AI in some form, a jump from 66% the previous year.“Honestly, everyone is using it,” says Magan Chin, a master’s student in technology policy at Cambridge, who shares her favourite AI study hacks on TikTok, where tips range from chat-based study sessions to clever note-sifting prompts.“It’s evolved. At first, people saw ChatGPT as cheating and [thought] that it was damaging our critical thinking skills. But now, it’s more like a study partner and a conversational tool to help us improve.”It has even picked up a nickname: “People just call it ‘Chat’,” she says.Used wisely, it can be a powerful self-study tool. Chin recommends giving it class notes and asking it to generate practice exam questions.“You can have a verbal conversation like you would with a professor and you can interact with it,” she points out, adding that it can also make diagrams and summarise difficult topics.Jayna Devani, the international education lead at ChatGPT’s US-based developer, OpenAI, recommends this kind of interaction. “You can upload course slides and ask for multiple-choice questions,” she says. “It helps you break down complex tasks into key steps and clarify concepts.”Still, there is a risk of overreliance. Chin and her peers practise what they call the “pushback method”.“When ChatGPT gives you an answer, think about what someone else might say in response,” she says. “Use it as an alternative perspective, but remember it’s just one voice among many.” She recommends asking how others might approach this differently.That kind of positive use is often welcomed by universities. But academic communities aregrappling with the issue of AI misuseand many lecturers haveexpressed grave concerns about the impact on the university experience.Graham Wynn, pro-vice-chancellor for education at Northumbria University, says using it to support and structure assessments is permitted, but students should not rely on the knowledge and content of AI. “Students can quickly find themselves running into trouble with hallucinations, made-up references and fictitious content.”Northumbria, like many universities, has AI detectors in place and can flag submissions where there is potential overreliance. At University of the Arts London (UAL) students are required to keep a log of their AI use to situate it in their individual creative process.As with most emerging technologies, things are moving quickly. The AI tools students are using today are already common in the workplaces they will be entering tomorrow. But university is not just about the result, it is about the process and the message from educators is clear: let AI assist your learning, not replace it.“AI literacy is a core skill for students,” says a UAL spokesperson, before adding: “Approach it with both curiosity and awareness.”Explore more on these topicsUniversity guideUniversity Guide 2026UniversitiesChatGPTHigher educationStudentsArtificial intelligence (AI)Student workfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You’ve been careful with your details so you can’t work out what has gone wrong, but you have made one mistake – recycling part of your password.Reusing the same word in a password – even if it is altered to include numbers or symbols – gives criminals a way in to your accounts.Brandyn Murtagh, an ethical “white hat” hacker, says information obtained through data breaches on sites such as DropBox and Tumblr and through cyber-attacks has been circulating on the internet for some time.Hackers obtain passwords and test them out on other websites – a practice known as credential stuffing – to see whether they can break into accounts.But in some cases they do not just try the exact passwords from the hacked data: as well as credential stuffing, the fraudsters also attempt to access accounts with derivations of the hacked password.Research from Virgin Media O2 suggests four out of every five people use the same or nearly identical passwords on online accounts.Using a slightly altered passwords – such as Guardian1 instead of Guardian – is almost an open door for hackers to compromise online accounts, Murtagh says.Working with Virgin Media O2, he has shown volunteers how easy it is to trace their password when they supply their email address, often getting a result within minutes.A spokesperson for Virgin Media O2 says: “Human behaviour is quite easy to model. [Criminals] know, for example, you might use one password and then add a full stop or an exclamation mark to the end.”What the scam looks likeThe criminals use scripts – automated sets of instructions for the computer – to go through variations of the passwords in an attempt to access other accounts. This can happen on an industrial scale, says Murtagh.“It’s very rare that you are targeted as an individual – you are [usually] in a group of thousands of people that are getting targeted. These processes scale just like they would in business,” he says.You might be alerted by messages saying that you have been trying to change your email address or other details connected to an account.What to doChange any passwords that are variations on the same word – Murtagh advises starting with the most important four sets of accounts: banks, email, work accounts and mobile.Use password managers – these are often integrated into web browsers. Apple has iCloud Keychain while Androids have Google Password Manager, both of which can suggest and save complicated passwords.Put in place two-factor authentication or multi-factor authentication (2FA or MFA), which mean means you have two steps to log into a site.Explore more on these topicsMoneyScam watchCybercrimeScamsHackingInternetfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But we must not rewrite his lifeMoira DoneganIn the wake of horror, honest accountings of his life have not only become rare – they have also become dangerousSun 14 Sep 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 14 Sep 2025 09.02 EDTShareMaybe it is the gruesome suddenness of his death that has made so many people forget the realities of Charlie Kirk’s life. After the 31-year-old rightwing influencer was shot dead at a college campus appearance in Utah on Wednesday, many commentators rushed to condemn political violence, on the one hand, and to issue warm tributes to Kirk’s life, on the other. The former of these is legitimate: that political policy should not be determined by force, or political disagreements settled through homicidal violence, is a baseline precondition of not just a democratic form of government, but of any functional society. The latter, perhaps, can be explained by the admirable human impulse towards gentleness and reconciliation. The horror and shock of Kirk’s assassination prompted some to offer their generosity, and their sympathy, to the dead man.Perhaps it was these noble gestures toward generosity and sympathy that led some commentators to be more laudatory to Kirk’s memory than an honest recounting of his life would allow. In the days following Kirk’s death, several bewilderingly inaccurate postmortem hagiographies have appeared, including from prominent voices on the left and center, that seem to wish that the tragedy of Kirk’s death could retroactively have given him a more honorable life.The most egregious of these came fromEzra Klein, a center-left columnist at the New York Times known for his ability to channel and influence elite opinion. In a piece published the morning after Kirk’s death, titled Charlie Kirk Was Practicing Politics the Right Way, Klein made a series of strained, bizarre and outright untrue assertions about Kirk’s career and character. Kirk, Klein argued, was, if anything, an example of civic virtue. “Kirk was practicing politics in exactly the right way,” Klein said. “He was showing up to campuses and talking with anyone who would talk to him. He was one of the era’s most effective practitioners of persuasion.” Klein’s point was that political persuasion – the rational debate of ideas between equals in which violence is unthinkable and good faith is presumed – is a cornerstone of liberal democracy, the kind of thing we should all be striving for, the kind of thing we need more of. “American politics has sides,” Klein continued. “There is no use pretending it doesn’t. But both sides are meant to be on the same side of a larger project – we are all, or most of us, anyway, trying to maintain the viability of the American experiment.”Fair enough, I suppose, on its merits, but such a description of reasoned, honest, good-faith debate is so inaccurate a description of what Charlie Kirk engaged in on college campuses – in his series of large, staged events where he “debated” untrained liberal undergraduates with cameras rolling – that it reads as willfully naive, if not outright dishonest. Charlie Kirk’s “debates” were aggressive, unequal, trolling affairs, in which he sought to provoke his interlocutors to distress, shouted them down and belittled them, spewed hateful rhetoric about queer and trans people, women, Black people, immigrants and Muslims, and selectively edited the ensuing footage to create maximally viral content in which his fans could witness him humiliating the liberals and leftists they perceived to be their enemies. This was not “debate”; it was not reasoned, good-faith discourse; it was not the kind of fair deliberation that democracy relies on. It was a mockery of those things.If reasoned debate is a precondition of a liberal democracy, there are other preconditions as well. A state cannot be called democratic if it does not offer equal protection of the law – if not all of its citizens are awarded the same dignity by their government and the same vote, same rights of expression and same prerogatives before courts and elected officials in their attempts to influence its policies and navigate its laws. Civic equality – not just civil engagement – is central to the American experiment, too. It is not to excuse his murder to be honest that Kirk opposed that equality. Some historians and political scientists have argued that the United States did not become a democracy until the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act, the laws that intended to end de jure segregation and racist voter suppression. But Kirkopposedthe Civil Rights Act, calling it a “huge mistake”. Heendorsedthe racist so-called “great replacement theory”, in which nefarious actors (usually cast as Jewish people) are seeking to “replace” America’s white population with immigrants, saying it was “well under way every day at our southern border”. On his podcast, he hosted a “slavery apologist” and a man whosaid that after women“got, you know, the right to vote – after that, it all went downhill”. Kirk himself once said that Black women – he named Joy Reid, Michelle Obama, Sheila Jackson Lee and Ketanji Brown Jackson – “do not have thebrain powerto be taken seriously”. He condemned Democrats for supposedly wanting tomake the US “less white”, and claimed: “There is no separation of church and state. It’s a fabrication, it’s a fiction, it’s not in the constitution.” (It is.) And yet Ezra Klein praised Kirk’s “moxie”. One wonders what such a euphemism is meant to obscure.In the rush to canonize Kirk and revise his history, honest accountings of his life have not only become rare – they have also become dangerous. In the days since his death, journalists, media personalities and others who have not been sufficiently laudatory to Kirk in public have lost their jobs for telling the truth about his life. Matthew Dowd, a Republican political consultant, was fired from MSNBC after saying that Kirk had spoken “hateful words”. In Phoenix, asports writerwas fired for criticizing euphemistic accounts of Kirk’s beliefs. “‘Political differences’ are not the same thing as spewing hateful rhetoric on a daily basis,” he wrote in a social media post. Many of those eulogizing Kirk want to paint him as a champion of free speech, as a man who peddled in honest inquiry, uninhibited expression and the open exchange of ideas. This is a laughably inaccurate picture of the man’s work; it is in these punishments of those who oppose him that we can see a truer reflection of Kirk’s values.I do not find it hard to condemn political violence. To me, to say that Kirk should not have been murdered is the easiest thing in the world. No one should be shot, be they rightwing influencers, or schoolchildren, or grocery shoppers, or churchgoers. It is easy for me, even, to show sympathy for the humanity of Charlie Kirk, who, for everything else he was, was a human being who has now been robbed of the opportunity to learn, grow, and repent. But such commitments – to human life, to nonviolence, to a faith in the possibility of redemption and reconciliation – need not lead us to lie to ourselves about Charlie Kirk. The same values that make us horrified at his violent death are the ones that should embolden our commitment to defeating the politics he worked for in life.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsCharlie Kirk shootingOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

One defender and mother tells me she has been displaced five times, starting from zero each time.Many have already beenkilled.A typical day for a defender begins by going to look for food and water for themselves and their family, fearful they won’t see their children again. If they make it back, there is no guarantee it will be with supplies. “Today I woke up and there was no water,” one woman said, speaking midway through the afternoon. “In order to live and work, what can I do? I can’t even wash my face.”They then travel for hours by foot or donkey to hospitals and camps to gather testimonies from victims, in what they and many experts consider agenocide.Interviews put a target on their backs. As one defender said: “I appear regularly on TV, although it could be life-threatening. Even if I am not the target, the journalist or cameraman could be.”At least 247 Palestinian journalistshave been killed in Gaza since 7 October 2023, according to the UN’s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.Finding electricity is risky. Often, they have to get to the nearest hospital to access the internet and back up their data or charge their devices. The WHO hasrecordedat least 697 attacks on healthcare centres and hospitals in Gaza since the start of the war, such as the 20 people killed in the attack on Nasser hospital on 25 August this year.‘My brother died while I was in a meeting,’ one female defender told me. ‘I cried a little, but continued,’ she saidFunding for their work is so limited it doesn’t cover their basic needs, and several globally respected Palestinian human rights organisations have beensanctionedby the US, including for their legitimate work with the international criminal court.The human rights defenders tell me they feel death approaching, but that they must go on. “My brother died while I was in a meeting,” one female defender told me. “I cried a little, but continued,” she said. Another tells me of her work documenting the killings of children who were born and killed during the war, and of whom there is no official record.The defenders talk about the chaos that has spread through Gaza as a result of the strangleholdIsraelhas placed on it and the ongoing famine. “The value system is upside down,” a defender tells me. “Those who have the power and the might to get their daily bread can. Those who don’t are literally starving to death.”Amal Syam, from the Women’s Affairs Centre, tells me she lost so much weight she was afraid to look in the mirror. “I didn’t recognize myself,” she says. “How can I stand up as an HRD in front of people asking for flour?”I hear from an organisation trying to ensure persons with disabilities are considered in the planning of aid delivery, which isn’t reaching them. “Sometimes we think that the people organising those programmes are living on Jupiter,” they tell me, “whereas we are here on Earth.”The defenders describe a loss in the credibility of human rights in general. “We were told that international law is the umbrella that protects civilians during war,” one HRD says. “But now we are being massacred before the eyes of the world.”When I ask what I can do they tell me there has to be an end to the genocide and war, to the starvation, thirst and forced displacement.They say what Israel is doing will establish a precedent for authoritarians around the world, that the moral compass is broken, and there must be proper documentation to ensure accountability for the crimes.They tell me not to wait until they are killed to document their cases.I am sharing their words here in the hope they will be heard by the people in the United States, and that they will pressure their representatives to use their power to do more to stop the atrocities.

But there are still ways to foil themSun 14 Sep 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 14 Sep 2025 13.06 EDTShareIt is too easy to blame Donald Trump for everything that goes wrong in the world. The ability of any US president to fundamentally change or control the behaviour of other major powers is frequently overestimated. Yet by posing as a sort of uncrowned global monarch and grand arbiter of war and peace, Trump perpetuates fantasies of US hegemony, omnipotence and divine right. Intoxicated by such ego-inflating delusions, he pledged before taking office toswiftly end the Ukraine and Gaza conflicts. Perhaps, in his vanity and hubris, he truly believed he could.Eight months on, the exact opposite is happening. Both crises are expanding and escalating. The bubble has burst, his bluff has been called, the emperor has no clothes – and there is no denying that Trump, by alternately appeasing, excusing and encouraging the two foremost villains of these twin tragedies, is greatly to blame. Last week’s multiple Russiandrone incursionsinto Nato member Poland – which Polish officials are right to call deliberate –risk transforming the Ukraine war into a Europe-wide conflagration. Likewise, the reckless, illegalIsraeli airstrike in Qatar, which blew up the Gaza peace process, physically and metaphorically, has supercharged regional tensions.A common factor in both developments is US weakness, which is to say, Trump weakness. Has any other US president devoted so much effort to making himself look like a strong leader while failing miserably to act like one when it matters? Much of what he does, whether it’s promulgating illegal executive orders, firing senior officials, bullying neighbours and defenceless migrants,ordering troops on to the streetsof US cities, backing afellow coup leaderin Brazil, or picking fights with judges and independent media, is about bolstering the strongman Trump image.The reality is very different. When Trump is faced by tough, unyielding opponents, rather than soft targets, he folds. He chickens out. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, and Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, worked this out long ago.Both men play him for a sucker. They flatter him. They spin lies about wanting peace. They offer easy wins. Then they go home, as was the case with Putin after last month’sembarrassing Alaska summit, and carry on doing whatever they want, which usually involves even greater violence. When an angry Trump calls to complain, as after Netanyahu’s Qatar raid, and whinges, pathetically, that he’s “not happy”, he merely confirms his weakness – and is ignored.Far from facilitating an end to these wars, Trump has become a prime obstacle to peace. His ill-considered interventions, grandstanding and partiality make matters worse, prolonging both conflicts. His dearth of leadership skills, coupled with a lack of integrity and common sense, is shocking for Europeans, accustomed to dealing with mostly rational, relatively competent presidents. Trump’s hostility to the EU and Nato, his tariff wars and his anti-democratic machinations have further undermined western cohesion and confidence – andboosted authoritarian regimes.1:04Poland shoots down Russian drones over its airspace   – videoWatching from his Kremlin lair, Putin acts accordingly. Thedrone incursion into Poland– not the first, but by far the biggest – was a calculated test of Nato reactions and unity. He will have been gratified by the defensive vulnerabilities it exposed and the uneven political response. Trump has said little so far – and done nothing. His silence is telling. He will not admit that his fawning subservience towards Putin has backfired horribly. Nor, despite the many military, diplomatic and economic weapons at his disposal, will he now summon the strength and courage to take a stand. SoPutin gets a free pass, again. Next time it could be worse. What if, say, Russia directly threatens Finland? Or Germany? What will Trump do then?On the evidence to date, the suspicion is: not much. Former president Joe Biden was rightly criticised for playing it cautious on Ukraine. Trump is barely in the game. The UK and European Nato states must stop deferring to Washington, take off the gloves andfinally draw a linewith Moscow. Creating a protected no-fly zone over unoccupied areas of Ukraine, expanding military aid, halting all Russian energy imports,confiscating frozen Kremlin funds, isolating sanctions-busting Russian and Chinese banks, and downgrading or cutting diplomatic ties with Putin’s regime are courses of action repeatedly urged here. And if need be, Europe’s armies must be prepared to shoot back. Waiting for Trump is as futile as waiting for Godot, without the jokes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What price now his grandiose plan to remake the Middle East? US policy is held hostage to Netanyahu’s extremist nihilism. Cut off US weapons supplies to Israel. Freeze bilateral financial aid. Impose sanctions. Support war crimes prosecutions of Israeli leaders. Recognise an independent state of Palestine. Any normal American president might do some or all of this. But Trump isn’t normal. He’s an aberration. He’s out of his depth.Historic failures of international leadership are becoming all too common in this fractured 21st-century world. One was the 2003 US-British decision to invade Iraq. Another is the failure to effectively address the climate emergency. Now two more comparably epic disasters simultaneously loom. If the UN, holding its annual get-together this month, ifEurope, if the west allow Russia and Israel to pursue their murderous, illegal, immoral and ever-expanding aggression, there may be no stopping an accelerating descent into global anarchy.Unless democratic countries unite to secure a rapid halt to these wars, employing all necessary means including military force, then greater calamities will surely follow.

But Saturday’s rally, facing up to Tommy Robinson’s 110,000-strong“unite the kingdom” marchin London, was the only one where I actually felt threatened.I was on the anti-racist counter march and we were outnumbered 20 to one. This was startling: on anti-racist marches, we usually easily outnumber the racists. The march organised by Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, was billed as “a free speech rally”, but free speech in this caseseemed to mean people saying anything they wanted about only one subject: immigration.Some commentators like to say that mobilisations such as this are only expressions of discontent bypeople who feel a little ignored. If they had been in central London on Saturday and seen the sea of men (and they were nearly all men) defiantly waving their St George’s flags, some of themattacking the policeand spitting at people like me, they might want to reconsider that view. The kind of people who were marching usually take exception to being called racists. But it is hard to know what else to call those of them who gathered in the capital to demand mass deportation and insist that black and brown men are a unique threat to white women.Apart from its size, the other thing that was remarkable about Robinson’s march was that it was addressed, via video link,by a billionaire, Elon Musk. He may be a hugely successful businessman, but his grasp of the British political system seemed less than sure. He said, “violence is coming to you, you either fight back or you die” and “I really think that there has to be a change of government in Britain … Something’s got to be done. There’s got to be a dissolution of parliament and a new vote held.” That’s not how we do democracy in the UK.Robinson and Farage’s ‘civil war’ narrative is warping voters’ minds. How is any government supposed to counter it? | John HarrisRead moreThe huge turnout for Robinson’s march was partly a consequence of theonline world we now live in. Social media have made this scale of mobilisation so much easier. But discussing the march afterwards with others from the anti-racist rally, we had the sense that there is something dark bubbling up in British society. Organisations that support the victims of race hate crime say that the number of cases is shooting up. Ugly incidents are increasing – only this weekend, in the West Midlands, a Sikh woman wasreportedly raped in broad daylightby white men shouting racist abuse including “you don’t belong in this country, get out”.One of the problems with our response to race hate incidents, in my experience, is that the parts of society who would normally be expected to take up a progressive cause are reluctant to call them out for what they are. Trade unions are content to let their branches carry their banners on anti-racist marches but are too oftensilent on anti-racism itself. Is it because they suspect that many of their members might be racists and do not want to antagonise them?The Labour party seems to be tying itself in knots to avoid talking about racism at all. It took Keir Starmer until Sunday afternoon to address what happened on Saturday,telling the Guardianthat “we will not stand for … people feeling intimidated on our streets because of their background or the colour of their skin”. But first, the business and trade secretary, Peter Kyle, was sent out to tellthe press that the rally“doesn’t disturb me, because it’s actually proof that we live in a country where free speech, free association, is alive and well”.Perhaps this is Labour’sstrategy for out-Reforming Reform. But in reality,this anti-immigrant politics is not helping the party. Using survey data from more than 30,000 respondents from the British Election Study, which happened to take place in the same month as Starmer’s “island of strangers” speech, political scientists found two things. First, that the public registered the speech and assumed that Labour had moved to the right on immigration; and second, that this did not have a favourable impact.One of the political scientists involved said: “The real story is the negative effect [of the speech] on Labour. They lost votes without gaining any from the people they are aiming to attract or nullifying their perceived threat from Reform.”Britain has seen anti-immigrant politics for generations. Post-war migrants from the Caribbean were harassed and beaten up by the equivalent of Robinson’s followers today. The only differences now are a toxic social media ecosystem and US billionaires prepared to publicly support the successors of the teddy boys.But if the violence and hatred are to be stopped, politicians first need to be prepared to call racism out for what it is. Silence about the racism inherent in events such as Robinson’s march can be seen as tacit approval of its message. It further emboldens the men wrapped in St George’s flags attacking thepolice. Refusing to acknowledge racist attacks for what they are can leave victims feeling alone and unprotected, and tiptoeing around the racist nature of this violence does not seem to alleviate it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Letting go is less about virtue and more about reclaiming peace of mindThe modern mindis a column where experts discuss mental health issues they are seeing in their workSun 14 Sep 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 14 Sep 2025 20.55 EDTShareFamous for his capacity to forgive his persecutors, Nelson Mandela is credited with the quote “resentment is like drinking poison and then hoping it will kill your enemies”.But many people experience a strong temptation to continue to drink the poison of resentment in vain. This often results in enduring low mood and depression that can have profound psychological, relational and physiological affects.What explains the roots of resentment and why is it so persistent?It often stems from a sense of injustice, whether real or perceived. Many grievances, particularly those arising from structural inequalities, discrimination, or unfair treatment, may indeed be morally justified. Yet, remaining bound to these grievances comes with a heavy psychological toll. Chronic fixation on past wrongs narrows thinking, making realistic action toward restitution or reparation difficult. Instead, individuals ruminate and indulge in fantasies of revenge.The hazards of prolonged resentment are manifold. Beyond depression and rumination, an inability to “let go” keeps the nervous system in a state of hyperarousal, mirroring post-traumatic stress patterns. Chronic hostility has been linked to hypertension, cardiovascular risk and a weakened immune system. Moreover, resentment is self-perpetuating: passive-aggressive communication, withdrawal and hostility alienate others, which reinforces feelings of injustice and isolation. Resentment has been identified as one of the primaryfactors leading to marital breakdowns, underscoring its deeprelational consequences.Paradoxically, neuroscience reveals why revenge is so tempting.Studiesshow that imagining or enacting revenge activates the dorsal striatum, a component of the brain’s reward circuitry. These are the same centres implicated in addiction, explaining why revenge fantasies are psychologically “addictive”. However, as with all addictions, the pleasure is fleeting, while the long-term consequences – emotional exhaustion, relational damage, and physiological stress – are severe.To address this, targeted therapeutic approaches are necessary. Central to many of these is the principle that self-forgiveness often precedes forgiveness of others. At the core of many grievances lies shame associated with the belief that one was powerless to resist harm. This internalised “despot” must be confronted before one can truly release anger toward others.It is critical to ask: will revenge erase my loss? Will it enhance my wellbeing? Will it prevent recurrence of harm? Typically, the answer is noMindfulness and emotion regulation have proven effective in weakening resentment. Programs such asJon Kabat-Zinn’s Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction(MBSR) train individuals to observe bitterness with nonjudgmental awareness, thereby reducing its grip on cognition and affect. Forgiveness interventions, increasingly studied in positive psychology, provide structured pathways for emotional release. While forgiveness does not excuse harm, it alleviates the physiological and psychological burden of grudges.One particularly well-researched model isRobert Enright’s forgiveness framework, which unfolds in four phases: uncovering anger, deciding to forgive, working through empathy, and deepening forgiveness to achieve emotional release.Neuroscientific studiesshow that thoughts of forgiveness, like revenge fantasies, activate the brain’s reward centres. However, unlike with revenge, these rewards are sustained, promoting long-term wellbeing. Repeated practice of forgiveness strengthens neural pathways favouring prosocial reward circuits over aggression.The importance of forgiving is illustrated in the case of Marla*, a middle-aged woman overwhelmed by resentment after being betrayed by her business partner. Initially consumed by fantasies of public retaliation, Marla experienced insomnia, social withdrawal and persistent low mood. While initially resistant to relinquishing her desire for revenge, as she felt this meant letting her business partner off the hook, Marla was persuaded that it was she herself that was caught on the hook. She agreed to try Enright’s structured forgiveness therapy, first acknowledging her anger and shame, then gradually developing empathy for her partner. She was able to reframe the situation within a broader context and ultimately practice emotional release. Over time, Marla’s anxiety diminished, her sleep improved, and she reported a renewed sense of agency and freedom.My client attended therapy because he was mandated to. Making progress to stop his use of child exploitation material was vital | Ahona GuhaRead moreGiven the power of revenge fantasies, it is critical to ask: will revenge erase my loss? Will it enhance my wellbeing? Will it prevent recurrence of harm? Typically, the answer is no. Forgiveness, in contrast, frees energy for meaningful action, including at social and structural levels where such action is often crucial. Resentment in marginalised or oppressed communities cannot be reduced to intrapsychic dynamics alone; it reflects systemic injustices. Therefore, healing may require combining personal forgiveness with empowerment and collective action.From a physiological standpoint, chronic bitterness keeps the nervous system on high alert. Conversely, forgiveness has measurable health benefits: it reduces cortisol levels, lowers blood pressure, strengthens immunity, and shifts neural activity toward prefrontal regulation, empathy networks, and sustained reward circuits. Neuroscience thus provides compelling evidence that forgiveness is not just a moral virtue but a biologically adaptive practice.Despite the challenges, forgiveness aligns with wisdom traditions across cultures. Yet it requires more than decision; it demands grace, a capacity to release harm without condoning it. It does not mean allowing injuries to persist, but it allows individuals to reclaim freedom, power and resilience. By confronting internalised shame, cultivating empathy, and integrating moral reflection, individuals can move from the destructive cycles of revenge toward enduring freedom, health, and meaningful connection.*Marla is a fictitious amalgam to exemplify many similar cases that we see.

Perhaps a return to a childhood passion could helpSun 14 Sep 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 14 Sep 2025 05.40 EDTShare‘Please sit down,” I begged my neighbour, who was leaning across the car gearstick, arm stretched around my headrest. My pleas for him to fasten his seatbelt were futile. Now he was jigging about, gesticulating wildly as he revealed his latest plans.He had told me before about the script he was writing for Gary Oldman. I hadn’t thought too much of it, then – all writers have to be a bit grandiose, I had reasoned, otherwise they wouldn’t achieve anything. But now he was telling me he was inventing a flying machine, from which he would fall – and I quote – “like a sycamore seed”. “You very much won’t,” my partner muttered. “What goes up, must come down.”That morning, he had arrived at our door with an extensive shopping list that he demanded we procure for him from Tesco, saying that only the very best red wine would do. Caught off-guard by this bristling confidence, we’d compromised and offered a taxi service instead. At the supermarket, it transpired he had no money – we didn’t have much either – so we got what we could afford and went home, trying to make our new friend promise he would not attempt the flying stunt anytime soon. I wish I could write that we did more to support him. We were young and barely supporting ourselves. The neighbour became very quiet after that, and eventually moved.Some years later, I thought of him. It was a fleeting recollection, like all my thinking at that point. I looked in the mirror, and instead of hating my reflection, as I had for the months previously, I was suddenly glowing with positivity. How lovely, I reasoned; after several years of severe depression, I must have turned a corner. Except it was more of a sharp bend. I hadn’t exercised for months, but that morning I practically sprang out of bed and announced that I was going for a run. When it ended, I set off again.It can take many years to understand that a high can be just as dangerous as a low. Self-care seldom says to watch out for impressive productivity and witty repartee. My neighbour had been experiencing an acute manic episode as part of bipolar disorder. Eventually, I would receive a similar diagnosis: hypomania. These highs are less intense, often associated with creativity and, in my case at least, are less frequent visitors than the lows.Unable to fully escape depression, I rolled out a red carpet for these rare experiences. Allow me to deep clean your house and rewrite your CV, for nothing will tire me! I saw this as a well-earned treat after months of listless sadness. I took risks; I flirted recklessly. I made choices I cannot yet write about. The depression, when it returned, was worse than ever. Back on the therapist’s couch, we unpicked my 20s. “What goes up, must come down,” she warned. And so now, when I start to feel my heart pounding in my head, I lie down. I do not look at my phone; I do not attend a work event. I wait, just like I do when depressed, and focus on getting better.In my quest for wellness, I reconnected with a childhood passion: butterflies. I spent my 30s trudging around woodlands and meadows in an effort to see every British species. I like collecting, and this hobby is all about collections; seeing males, females, mating pairs, aberrations. Some butterflies are easier to find than others – a peacock lives up to its name, rainbow wings with unblinking, heavily made-up eyes. Others live in the canopy, only venturing to terra firma in particular circumstances. It’s a wholesome hobby, or so you might think.InThe Butterfly Isles, the Guardian writer Patrick Barkham wrote about the curse of the purple emperor, a spectacular, elusive insect that – for two weeks of the year – will occasionally descend to the ground to take salts (often on dung) from woodland floors. Lepidopterists lose all sense of perspective in their company, setting up baits to lure the butterfly. (I encountered one man who actually defecated under an oak tree where the emperor had been spotted.)One summer, I spent every spare hour in the woods “emperoring”, as the pastime is dubbed. Then it was hours that weren’t so spare. I missed a deadline. And another. I couldn’t sleep for thinking about a “grounding”, the term for when a butterfly descends. My heart pounded; my dreams turned purple.I stopped going to the woods. It took every drop of willpower I possessed. I cooked; I took some moderate exercise. I tried to avoid the butterfly sightings posted online. The graph took a gentle decline, and stabilised. Previously, I might have rewarded myself with a splurge or a binge. Nature had something better in mind.Later that week, my best friend messaged to say a purple emperor had landed in her open-top car. The chances of this happening were extraordinarily remote, and that it would still be there by the time I arrived, even slimmer still. But I raced to find her anyway. A pristine male purple emperor, lethargic in the blistering heat, waited in the footwell. He sat on my hand, drinking my sweat. We paused together, quiet and content.Claire Jackson is a journalist who writes about classical music, art and animalsDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It was probably finished after the gallery’s cut-off date of 1900, a cut-off the gallery has just announcedit will be jettisoning.To say that I am pleased is an understatement. It always struck me as bizarre that the end date occurs just at the exact point in history when painting is about to become very interesting. Just look atthe Baigneusesand what they represent: the leap towards abstraction in the representation of the human form; the composition and its unidentifiable, but unified landscape; the use of colour, and the lack of discernible religious or mythological subject matter. The painting and its two sisters cast a significant influence on the onward march of 20th-century painting, particularly cubism, as they made a strong impression on both Matisse and Picasso. Yet one leaves the building without much of a sense of how these revolutionary developments ever played out. To stop at 1900 never made much sense.Weird altarpieceshave their place, but there are only so many in the world to acquire, and the public’s appetite for them is likely to be limited.Reports that the National, in dropping the cut-offdate and buildinga large new wingdevoted to 20th-century painting, risks “bad blood” with the Tate are depressing. Before an agreement about the date was reached, the galleries had historically been at each other’s throats. How unedifying it would be to see these two institutions at war again over the acquisition of, say, a Rothko.However, these reports seem overstated. The galleries have formed a joint working group and are planning to collaborate in the interests of the national collection as a whole, and part of that collaboration will no doubt involve considering each gallery’s remit.The National is a gallery of painting, and it traces the history of that artform only, while the Tate encompasses sculpture, photography, installation, works on paper, and more. The 1900 cut-off is so frustrating in part because for a gallery of painting to not tell the story of the seismic shifts in painting during the 20th century is such an obvious omission (it has for some years been trying to circumnavigate this through various shows and collaborations with contemporary artists). Besides, from a tighter focus can come greater clarity in an institution’s storytelling.View image in fullscreenRokeby Venus by Diego Velázquez was slashed by suffragette Mary Richardson in 1914Photograph: IanDagnall Computing/AlamyOne of those shifts, and one which I would love to see embraced by the National Gallery, is the story of the female nude. At the moment, to walk around it is to see the naked female figure as perceived and depicted by men, from Titian’s Diana and Actaeon to Renoir’s Nymph by a Stream and, of course, Diego Velázquez’s Rokeby Venus. The building is essentially a temple to the male gaze. The suffragette Mary Richardson’s infamousslashingof the Venus is testament to that. While I could never slash such a painting, I do understand the impulse, as will many other women who have been subjected to society’s ruthlessly objectifying beauty standards.It goes without saying that the nude is highly political. As Cézanne left us to contemplate his bathers, that same year – 1906 – saw the first nude self-portrait by a female painter in western art history (officially, at least). Paula Modersohn-Becker would tragically not live long enough to see modernism play out, but her approach to the nude changed everything. To halt a survey of the history of painting just at the point where women artists were, for the first time, beginning to depict themselves as subjects after centuries of being objects simply makes no sense. Visitors are left with only part of the story.How wonderful would it be to see the nude as approached by Gwen John, Suzanne Valadon, Frida Kahlo, Amrita Sher-Gil, Louise Bourgeois, Jenny Saville, Tracey Emin, Lisa Brice, Mequitta Ahuja, Kudzanai Violet Hwami … the list goes on. And to see not just women artists’ depictions of the female body, of course, but also, through their gaze, the male. The gallery’s expansion is a wonderful opportunity to redress the balance and introduce the British public to underrepresented artists. Because much as I would love, budget allowing, to see a Rothko or a Magritte or a Hockney at theNational Gallery, I would also like to see a Lee Krasner, a Frank Bowling, or a Dorothea Tanning. As it stands, there are only 27 works by women in the entire collection, and very few works by artists of colour.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I have no doubt that the Tate and the National galleries will come to a workable agreement. As experts they will understand better than anyone that to tell the story of art a certain way always involves a series of choices about whose work, and whose subjectivity, matters. There will be new, and no doubt fraught, decisions to be made, but how exciting. I can’t wait to see where they lead.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.To be fair, Ellis-Bextor is throwing a party later, so she has made an effort. She’s hosting a playback of her new album Perimenopop, which is also very disco, so much so that Chic’s Nile Rodgers is on one of the tracks. During the Covid lockdowns in 2020, the pop star hosted a weekly Kitchen Disco, broadcast live on Instagram from her family home, with her husband, the musician Richard Jones, and with occasional cameos from her five sons. People must think she’s pretty good at throwing a party. “Well, I am capable,” she says, drily. There will be a photo booth. Aptly, the bar already has a giant glitter ball hanging from the ceiling.As a title, Perimenopop is both silly and defiant. It came from a joke in the studio between Ellis-Bextor and her friend Hannah Robinson, who co-writes some of her songs. “We’re a similar age,” she says, “and so we were jokingly saying: oh, it’s perimenopop. And we thought it was hilarious. It just didn’t leave my head.” It’s a showy, attention-grabbing name. “I think I’m in my sod-it era, really.

Shoes:Christian LouboutinShe is 46 now. As she gets older, she is growing much more comfortable in her own skin. “Just shaking off a lot of the peripheral worries of stuff,” she says. She started planning her return to dance music in 2021, having been reminded by the lockdown Kitchen Discos just how much music and dancing can lift the spirits. “Music is often a cape that I will shroud myself in, to boost me up a bit,” she says. She wrote Perimenopop – wall-to-wall bangers, mostly about enjoying life – at home, in comfort, working in the daytime, eating dinner with her family at night. “I stretched myself out like a cat, letting the music lift me and letting it make me feel better.”Perimenopop arrives at a time when perimenopause is slowly becoming part of the cultural landscape, fromBridget Christie’sunderrated Channel 4 comedyThe Change, toMiranda July’sliterary juggernautAll Fours. “I do feel so grateful to all of the women who have made it more of a conversation,” she says. “I was working with someone the other day, just met her, and she was like, ‘Oh, I’m having a hot flush – perimenopause.’” Once, that was a conversation Ellis-Bextor thinks she might have had with her mum, but not with her friends. “Now, there’s much more transparency. Thank goodness. There’s just so much less mystery, and more help for people who need it.”And what about her own experience of it? “It’s funny, because when I said to my mum about the album, she said: ‘You do realise in interviews that they’re going to ask you about it?’” She laughs. “I feel like I’m just on the cusp [of it], really. Maybe in the first room. I don’t know how many rooms there are! But it’s chats that my girlfriends and I have been having.”Many of her friends are women she has known since they were at school together, and they are coming to the party tonight. In a lot of ways,Ellis-Bextor is overdue a celebration. She has been a household name since the turn of the century, when an early career as an indie singer collapsed and led her, inadvertently, to the housey pop of the song Groovejet (If This Ain’t Love), which became an international hit. For years, alongside music, she has done the celebrity circuit, appearing on the likes of Strictly Come Dancing and The Masked Singer. She has a podcast, Spinning Plates, in which she interviews mothers who also work. When the BBC needed a New Year’s Eve host, as 2024 rolled into 2025, they got her to throw everyone a party. She has become the nation’s smart, fun big sister. But her music career has undergone a resurgence on a massive scale, too. It’s not that she ever stopped making records – Perimenopop is her eighth studio album – but in 2024 her other megahit, Murder on the Dancefloor, first released at the end of 2001, became one of the biggest pop songs in the world.View image in fullscreen‘It’s exciting when you have the twists in the road and new experiences.’ Jumpsuit:Meandem.

I’m like, come on,” she laughs. “But, yeah, it was!”Ellis-Bextor and Jones were flown to LA to DJ at the premiere, and afterwards a couple of her friends told her that she was on the verge of becoming a thing. “One of those things where the song goes everywhere. And I was like: I really don’t think so. Let’s not lose our heads.” But by the end of 2024 ithadbeen everywhere, becoming the biggest song of the year by a British female artist, 20 years after it first came out.It’s hardly like you’re at retirement age, I say, but, still, was the song’s belated success surprising, given that pop is so often characterised as a young person’s game? She politely rebuffs me. “Part of what I loved about disco was that a lot of the vocalists were telling stories and singing songs from a point of experience. OK, they could be cautionary tales, they could be stories that were the other side of heartache, but they weren’t all anchored in youth culture.” Then there’s social media. Her oldest son is 21 and tells her that on TikTok nobody cares about the age of the person singing the song, or how old the song is, “if it means something true”.In the heat of the Murder on the Dancefloor revival, last year was “quite a giddy time of my life”, but Ellis‑Bextor has been a professional musician since she was 16. “This year will be 30 years since my first gig,” she points out. “So the years are there, and I’m really into that. I like experience.” A few years ago, when she wrote her autobiography, also called Spinning Plates, she said that she was happier at 42 than she had ever been before. How is it now, at 46? “Same, same. That’s nice!” she laughs. “I’m very content with what I have in my life. It’s exciting when you have the twists in the road and new experiences. But I am also very aware of how good I have it.”I’m happy to acknowledge and explore things that upset me or that hurtThe main impression I got from the book, and one not dimmed by meeting her in person, is that Ellis-Bextor is one of life’s great optimists. “I am very optimistic,” she nods. “I am my mother’s daughter.” Her mother, Janet Ellis, was a Blue Peter presenter who turned to writing novels in her 60s. Ellis-Bextor had a short-lived sideline in selling Blue Peter badges to her classmates when she was at primary school. “Shh! Not so loud!” she jokes. “I haven’t got any with me, I’m afraid.”She reconsiders the optimism question. “[I’m] apragmaticoptimist,” she says. “I’m happy to acknowledge and explore things that upset me or that hurt, but I’m quite good at framing things in a way that can make me feel good about stuff, ultimately.” Her music career, now spanning four decades, involves quite a lot of pragmatic optimism. I don’t want to say that she has been lucky – “There’s definitely been a lot of luck,” she interrupts, cheerfully – but there is a sense that a lot of things happened to her as if by chance. “Oh, 100%. Serendipity. But I suppose the trick is to be able to get the most out of these opportunities when they come your way.”As a teenager growing up in west London, Ellis‑Bextor thought she wanted to act, but music was her real love. She bought the NME and Melody Maker every week, and was obsessed with Britpop. At 16, she started going to an indie night in London called Popscene, “living for the weekend”, as she puts it, in her Rimmel Black Cherries lipstick, a 1995 staple. One night, she met a journalist from Melody Maker who passed her a note with a phone number on it and told her that his mate was looking for a singer. She recorded a tape of herself singing Oasis covers and handed it over the next night.That band was called Theaudience. For a brief moment, they were music press darlings. It must have given her whiplash to go from reading Melody Maker to being on the cover of it. “It was terrifying,” Ellis‑Bextor says now. “It was a baptism of fire, and I was a closet square, really. I felt like: oh my God, I’m not cool. I can’t keep up. I don’t fit in. And, of course, it turned out everybody was feeling a bit like that.” Theaudience had a moment, did OK, but they were signed to a major label, and OK wasn’t enough. They were dropped after their debut album, and the music press turned on them.  “It is hard to avoid the suspicion that she is part of some sly television exposé on how to get ahead in the music industry,” read one of the more vicious gig reviews from that time.“It’s hard, because you’re reading all the stuff about you that you’re worried is how people think about you, so …” She laughs. “As a teenage girl, it’s not ideal.” But, of course, she has found the positives. “The good news is: it definitely built up a kind of resilience!”When Theaudience got dropped, she thought it was all over. “I was like, oh my God, I’ve already had the highest high already, and I’m not even 20. Now, for the rest of my life, I’m going to be this tragic person who’ll say: ‘I had a record deal once when I was 18.’” Why did she feel she could plough on, when others might have walked away? “I just didn’t have anything else I felt I could do,” she shrugs. Then serendipity intervened once again. She recorded a speculative vocal for a dance track that turned into Spiller’s Groovejet (If This Ain’t Love), even though she kept saying that she didn’t like dance music. “I was just a proper indie kid!” she protests. Obviously, she loves it now. “I remember thinking: Melody Maker and NME won’t even know I’ve done this, and then they won’t be bruising me, because it’s a whole different world.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But I think also, because I’d had the failure with the band, I was probably just a little bit less of a brat than I might have been.”She met her husband when they were both 22. Jones was auditioning for her band (he would go on to form the Feeling), and when he joined her on the road they became firm friends. Both were in other relationships at the time, but after a while their mutual attraction was obvious. They celebrated their 20th wedding anniversary in June. They had only been seeing each other for a few weeks when Ellis-Bextor discovered she was pregnant. Her first solo album had just come out and she had become a target for the tabloids. That whole time was “freaky”, she says, because when she was in Theaudience nobody ever really knew who she was. Then all of a sudden, after Groovejet, she would be recognised in the street. “And that was simultaneous with phone hacking, so I just thought that being known, in that era, meant that you didn’t have any ownership over information. It just was so normal to me.”Before she had told her friends that she was pregnant, her press officer called her to ask if it was true, and to let her know that the papers were running the story the next day. At the time, she brushed off the tabloid intrusion. “I just thought that was what happened. But now I’m like, God, that is outrageous.” For a moment, she looks almost appalled. Their relationship was so new that they hadn’t yet said I love you. They didn’t move in with each other until two weeks before Sonny was born. But still, she finds a silver lining. “It’s OK. I was just starting out with Richard. I was falling in love with him. So there’s lots of reasons to be cheerful, but I do look back and think it’s pretty outrageous, really.”She only learned that she had been a victim of phone hacking many years later, when the police got in touch to let her know. For a long time, she let it lie. “I thought, I don’t want to dredge up any negativity. I’m happy. I’ve got my young family. I don’t need to dwell on something.” But eventually she pursued, andreceived, a settlementfrom the Mirror Group. “I did actually want to be a tiny little thorn in their side, even if only for a split second. I was happy being a little, tiny, teeny pest, even if that’s all I’ve got.” She doesn’t remember the details, she adds, because she was having a baby at the time. “Who’s now 13, so it’s quite a while ago.”She pauses. “Ithinkit was that baby?” I laugh. “Sorry. I was definitely having a baby, and I’m pretty sure it was him.” After all, she has had five of them. She starts to giggle. “Sometimes I’ve got baby pictures and I don’t know which one it is! I don’t remember whose first word was what.” Her youngest is six; her eldest 21. I ask if that means she’s really good at it now, a well-oiled machine. “I don’t know about that, because they’re all individuals. They’ve all got a slightly different relationship with me. I don’t think it’s like, ‘Now I present you with Mother 5.0.’”People are often fascinated by the fact that she has five boys. During her fourth and fifth pregnancies, strangers would tell her that she must be wishing for a girl. “Sometimes you’d get some bore sat next to you at one of those dinners, where you don’t know them, and they’d be like, ‘Oh, how terrible, you have sons.’ I just think people have got quite narrow ideas sometimes.” She is careful to point out that she doesn’t actually consider this to be a big issue. “This is small fry, really. It’s more an occasional lack of imagination than an everyday problem.” Somehow, in her lightness, she manages to sound even more scathing.View image in fullscreen‘In some ways, I think I’m better at being in my 40s than in my 20s.’ Cardigan:Stella McCartneyBut, in the current climate, there has been an increasing interest in what it’s like to raise boys. “It’s definitely become more of a topic recently,” she says, but she shuts it down before it can get going. “It’s a bit clickbaity, isn’t it? It only makes me feel sad, because my children are five really interesting, lovely people, and I don’t really like the idea of their imagined characters being skewed into something for that.”One of the things she has learned from doing her podcast, in which she has long conversations with other mothers, is how to talk about her job with her children. “I don’t diminish it any more. I used to be very apologetic about work. I’d make it tiny.” She puts on a quiet, squeaky voice: “I’ve got to go and do this thing, I wish I didn’t have to, I’ll be as quick as I can, I’d rather be here.” That just isn’t the truth. She loves what she does, and after the lockdowns, especially, she realised how much she needs to perform to feel like herself. Now, when she goes somewhere, she talks about it differently. “I say to the kids, ‘This matters to me. I like what I do. Don’t worry, I’ll be back soon. But I’ve worked really hard to get these opportunities’ – that kind of thing. So I think I frame it better.”In 2013, Ellis-Bextor appeared on Strictly Come Dancing, getting through to the final week. In her book, she was candid about the strain that it put on her relationship with Jones. He gave her permission to write about the fact that he sought counselling when she was on the show, to help him cope with anxiety it triggered about their relationship. “I thought that was really brave of him,” she says. “But, look, it wasn’t like he thought I was going to run off.” It was more than 10 years ago, she points out, a little wearily. “But he felt like it wasn’t involving him. And then, because he was seeing us experiencing things separately, it shook something. He was worried about it.” Every time they went out, she said, people would joke about the so-called curse of Strictly, in which the celebrities and their dance partners supposedly fall for each other. “And I think it just started to wear him down a little bit.”Jones worked through it and was supportive of her time on the show, but Ellis-Bextor was an early critic of some aspects of Strictly, writing about how she felt the contestants were not always well supported psychologically. Is it fair to say that she wasn’t surprised when allegations of unacceptable behaviour emerged in 2024? “I only know what I witnessed on my year,” she says. “I made some really good friends out of it, and I loved doing the dancing, but I think they should have been checking in, because I was seeing real relationships changing and people breaking up.” The programme should have taken that more seriously, she thinks.David Byrne, Little Simz, Jasmine.4.t and more: the best music of autumn 2025Read moreShe calls it “an extraordinary, heady chapter. I think maybe some of the things I spoke about in the book aren’t seen as exotic any more, because more people have contributed to [talking about] the things I experienced.” She wrote that, at times, doing the show was “too intimate, too intense”, and that contestants were, back then at least, separated from family and friends. She practically pinpointed what the show needed to change, long before they agreed to change it, I suggest. “And they’ve done it. All good: chapter closed!” she says, sunnily.Ellis-Bextor has work to do. She is about to swoop off again, to get ready for her Perimenopop party, and before the guests arrive she has to record some clips for Instagram, twirling around in the pink dress, lip‑syncing to her new single. She mentions a conversation that she had recently, with a man who is 20 years older than her, who suggested she take all of August off, as she’s had such a busy year. She asked him how he had felt in his 40s, and he told her that he had felt driven. “And I said: that’s where I’m at. I think that’s not always expected. In some ways, I think I’m better at being in my 40s than in my 20s.” I wonder what the difference is. “I think you’ve curated your life a little bit more. You’re not trying things out for the first time, but doing the things that you know work for you.”What’s next, then, I say: Menopop? She laughs. “Oh my God. Imagine! I’m already getting so many people contacting me, saying: I run this menopause help thing …” But she gets serious for a minute. “What’s next? I don’t know. But I don’t think you should do what I do, if you like knowing what happens next.” This, from the woman whose 20-year-old song has just been a huge global hit again. “Yeah,” she says, smiling. “That doesn’t work.”Perimenopop is out nowExplore more on these topicsSophie Ellis-BextorPop and rockSaltburnfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He opens up about his years of hard graft, his mum’s big acting break, and why things are getting weird with his therapistSun 14 Sep 2025 05.00 EDTShareIdon’t know if I’ve even really celebrated it to be honest, man.”Sitting in a north London bar on a boiling hot evening, resplendent in a matching silk shirt and shorts combo, Mawaan Rizwan is contemplating his life post-Bafta. In May last year, he won best male comedy performance for Juice, his gloriously surrealist BBC series in which he stars as Jamma, a clownish manchild with a bowl cut navigating a chaotic life alongside his dysfunctional family and buttoned-up older boyfriend.In the end, after a few sips of his negroni, Rizwan – whose CV also includes appearances on Taskmaster, Live at the Apollo andDoctor Who, plus a slew of comedy songs about racism, toxic masculinity and skiing’s lack of socioeconomic diversity – pinpoints one way his life has changed; his therapist upped his fee. Rizwan speculates that it might have happened after his viral acceptance speech, in which the surprised and elated actor recounted a prior session’s focus on the dangers of relying on external forms of validation.“I’ve spent a lot of my adult life trying to prove myself so that I can be clapped by people, like: ‘Hey, you know what? Maybe you’re not a loser,’” the 34-year-old says with a grin. “I thought winning an award shouldn’t feel good according to everything I’m talking about in therapy … But it feels fantastic.” Shortly after his win, awkward conversations were had in his therapist’s office. “It was the elephant in the room because I reckon he saw the fucking speech,” Rizwan laughs.Like his onscreen creation, Rizwan has the ability to flit between silliness, sincerity and sadness in the blink of an eye. When I ask why his dad doesn’t star in Juice, like his mum and brother do, he falls silent. Then just when it feels as if he’s on the brink of opening up about their relationship, he switches to joke mode: “I didn’t want to be like Trump, just giving out jobs to my family. Plus, being completely honest, my dad’s CV wasn’t good enough.”Today Rizwan’s energy is also spiked by tiredness; he arrived 10 minutes late for the interview, having just finished the edit on Juice series two, and seems ready to collapse. “This show is a lot, man,” he sighs. “I care about it so deeply. But the downside to that is I don’t have a life.”View image in fullscreenClown show … Rizwan in Juice series two.Photograph: BBC/Various Artists LimitedThankfully, the hard work has paid off. While series one had myriad visual flights of fancy – Jamma tucking into his boyfriend Guy’s arm after it transformed into a cake; an orgasm in a pub toilet punctuated by a jet of glitter – it was still anchored in the real world. Influenced by the playful aesthetics of directors such as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind’s Michel Gondry andSorry to Bother You’s Boots Riley, the more supernatural series two takes place in a miniature Juice Town. It’s a world of tactile sponge-like fantasias, intricate house interiors made entirely of cardboard, and sperm-soaked sofas mistaken for modern art. Its gothic, mist-strewn streets are haunted by a mysterious mystic-slash-vape salesman (played by Kevin Eldon) who trades souls, while an emotional scene involving Jamma’s dad’s journey to the UK is retold using shadow puppets and an egg.First performed at Edinburgh festival fringe as a frenetic one-man show more than a decade ago, it took a while to convince people that Juice could work on television. “There’s a certain way of making British comedy, and if you’re trying to make a show that’s not [like something else] on TV already, that’s a huge risk,” Rizwan says. That risk was heightened by a TV industry contending with financial and political pressures. “I think people are scared,” he says. “Politically, we’re in a very tumultuous time. And that’s the time when art needs to be the most daring, the most honest, the most bold. But on a systemic level and on a commercial level, it’s also a time of austerity, where money tightens, so we often get this paradox: people need to make art that’s more honest, but commissioners want to make stuff that’s a surefire hit. It’s just a hard time for people who want to challenge expectations because everything is a fight.”Politically, we’re in a time when art needs to be daring. But it’s also the time of austerity – commissioners want a sure-fire hitUltimately, he’s aware that not everyone will like Juice and its glorious phantasmagoria and oddball in-jokes (Jamma and his best friend, Winnie, can often be found “smoking” Chipsticks, for example). “If this is not your show, cool, don’t watch it,” Rizwan says. “But if this is your show, the idea is that you become obsessed with it, because it’s a squidgy, almost edible world that feels tangible and sensory.”Despite the familial cast list – Jamma’s flighty artist brother Isaac is played by Rizwan’s real-life younger brother Nabhaan, who has also starred in Netflix’s Kaos and the crime drama Informer; his mother, Shahnaz, stars as frustrated matriarch Farida – Rizwan is at pains to point out that Juice’s narrative arc of self-acceptance isn’t completely autobiographical. “I know monetising our trauma is the ‘in’ thing in our culture, but sometimes it’s not always helpful,” he laughs. “I wanted Juice to feel truthful and personal, but I wanted it to just fly into avenues that are beyond my limited life experience.”View image in fullscreenAll bark … Mawaan Rizwan.Photograph: Tami AftabThere are definite connections, however, not least the fact that series two finds Jamma becoming a professional clown. When Rizwan was 23, he enrolled at a clown school just outside Paris for a month (it was all he could afford). It changed his life. “We would learn about how everyone in the circus has a skill – there’s a fire-breather, there’s a contortionist – but the clown has no skill whatsoever but his stupidity,” he says. “They’re so lovable but so tragic, and that’s an interesting character trait. Jamma has so many of those qualities.” Rizwan is reckoning with his frequent impulse to “use comedy as a way to get love, make people laugh” by making himself “the butt of the joke. There comes a point in your life when maybe that doesn’t serve you, but you still do it because it’s a habit.”I did every kind of dingy fringe venue you can think of: corridors, buses, toilets, on a dancefloor shouting over the VengaboysBorn in Pakistan, Rizwan, like Jamma, moved to the UK as a child with his mum (“a powerhouse who never takes no for an answer”). While the family initially struggled – “Mumhad a really tricky decade of migration battles and economic struggles,” is how Rizwan puts it – their home was a hub of imagination and creativity. They were often in their own bubble, a world that had its own sayings, including one that would influence the title of Rizwan’s show. “My mum used this phrase: ‘When life gives you mangoes, make mango juice,’” he smiles. “She genuinely thought that was the phrase. So I thought that, too. When the Lemonade album came out, I assumed Beyoncé had got it wrong.”As a teenager, Rizwan made comedy home videos, which he’d upload to YouTube. He soon noticed that the videos that co-starred his mum, a former child actor in Pakistan, would get the most views. Eventually, Rizwan received a call from a Bollywood producer asking to speak to her. “So, weirdly, she came full circle and she got to act again.”While his mum was continuing with her acting dream, Rizwan eschewed university in favour of working and going to an arts college. It was during a trip to the Edinburgh fringe that he realised alternative comedy was his calling. “It opens your eyes,” he says of the festival. “I did Edinburgh fringe eight years in a row, in every kind of dingy venue you can think of: corridors, buses, toilets, on a dancefloor shouting over the Vengaboys. It taught me how to play to any kind of audience.” He mentions one punter who threw a Subway sandwich at him: “It was 10pm – what were they even doing having dinner that late?” The early standup version of Juice would often find Rizwan reflecting on his long and winding journey to success (one of his first acting roles involved him dressed as SpongeBob, handing out flyers at a shopping centre), while comparing it to his family’s, particularly his mum’s, almost accidental career ascension.View image in fullscreen‘I took the scenic route’ … Rizwan in Juice.Photograph: BBC/Various Artists LimitedAs he climbed the standup ranks, when he was 24, Rizwan presented a documentary for the BBC called How Gay Is Pakistan? in which he explored queer life in his birth country. “I was trying to process a lot at that point,” he says. “But also a part of me was just trying to get it out of the way. The two most obvious things in terms of identity the industry kept telling me about were my queerness and my Pakistaniness. So it was a way of doing something that was super brash and bold and saying: ‘Well, there you go’. Also it was me trying to understand a part of the world and a part of my history that I felt I wasn’t given access to.” He pauses. “And I thought: Well, let’s do that on taxpayers’ money!” He recognises it was helpful to a lot of people, but says he won’t go back to documentaries: “I definitely enjoy the nuances and subtleties I’m able to have in scripts, over a documentary that sometimes feels heavy-handed.”‘It’s cheap therapy, innit!’: comedian Mawaan Rizwan on family, adulthood  and his brilliant new TV seriesRead moreJuice is full of big themes such as identity, class and social mobility, but its presentation keeps things light, smuggling in topics such as abandonment via a plotline involving a parent rental site called DaddyDays4LonelyGays.com (sadly not real). Every moment of pathos is spiked by a visual gag or a surreal tangent, which makes the whole thing more moving. “Juice was the first show where I combined the clowning and the physicality and the dance and the songs and the singing and the vulnerable stories and the confessional stuff,” Rizwan says. “It somehow all just worked.”The use of the past tense, plus series two’s neatly wrapped final episode, leads to an obvious final question: will there be a Juice series three? Rizwan sighs. He says he’s keen to focus on music next, and not just comedy songs but something more serious. Besides, he’s too tired to think about the future and would rather sit in the moment for a bit. “It was a fucking long journey, man,” he says of his career, cocktail now drained. “I took the scenic route and it’s made me a better artist for it.”Season two of Juice startson18Septemberon BBC iPlayer and BBC Three.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTaskmasterDoctor WhoTV comedyComedyinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The line suggests a gulf between the Swedish dark tragedian and English light comedian but the dramatists have a curious affinity.August Strindberg’s Creditors (1889) and Coward’s Private Lives (1930) both start in hotels where a troubled couple is haunted by a former marriage. It’s unclear if the influence was conscious but, if so, would have been apposite. Strindberg identified his drama as a “tragicomedy”, the genre in which, as Blakemore recognised, Coward is increasingly seen to belong.This revival by Tom Littler (an accomplished Coward and Strindberg director) finds both the gasps and guffaws in Creditors, through a darkly sardonic version (from a literal translation by Agnes Broomé) by Howard Brenton, himself a tragicomic playwright, whose superb Churchill in Moscow was recently directed by Littler at this cramped but dynamicOrange Tree theatre.Adolf, a twitchy artist exhibiting signs of physical and mental illness, is working on a clay model of a naked woman in the hotel parlour when interrupted by Gustaf, a fellow guest who has become a rather coercive mentor, having, through a fierce critique, turned Adolf from painting to sculpture. Gustaf also encourages the other man to talk about his wife, Tekla, a novelist who wrote a book fictionalising her “idiot” ex-husband and has taken a holiday from the holiday after a row over her alleged flirtations. She will soon return and Gustaf coaches Adolf in what to do and say. We sense that, as smoothly and ruthlessly as the Marquise in Les Liaisons Dangereuses, Gustaf is setting traps and, by the time Tekla comes in, suspect Gustaf’s identity and mission.A sense of event comes from the reunion of Charles Dance, Geraldine James and Nicholas Farrell four decades after their performances in ITV’s indelible The Jewel in the Crown. Back on stage after an absence of 17 years, Dance remains a magnetic presence, eyes flashing with amusement and menace between barked half laughs. In the difficult part of Adolf, a stooge and fool, Farrell makes the man pathetic in the classical sense of eliciting sympathy rather than the modern inference of contemptuous.Modern audiences can understandably have a problem with the misogyny that may have been present in Strindberg and is certainly there in Gustaf, who claims that a naked woman looks like an incomplete man. But the warm, engaging Tekla of James mitigates this issue by suggesting that the woman has been slandered by both men. In the final reckoning with Gustaf, she becomes clearly the moral centre of the piece.Exploring how people use each other up in love and art, this Creditors – the title encapsulating Strindberg’s grim metaphor of relationships as a series of loans to be noted and eventually collected – leaves us in debt to Littler, Brenton and the remarkable cast.This chilling portrait of private lives deserves a long public one.At Orange Tree theatre, London, until 11 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTheatreOrange Tree theatreAugust StrindbergreviewsShareReuse this content"

He came to my Blue Note club night in London a few times when it was very underground and he could be left alone. Then he’d come to the studio, where he’d sing through a haze of cigarette smoke like a gorilla in the mist, or I’d take him to see Dillinja in Brixton to hear drum’n’bass, or we’d spend time in his trailer on the Isle of Man set for the film Everybody Loves Sunshine and he’d sit there doing crochet. His thinking was that of an alchemist – he wanted to saturate himself in everything because he knew that inspiration could come from anywhere. He once said to me: “Golds, did you know Michelangelo said that when you blow the dust off a piece of marble, the sculpture’s there inside”? That thought stayed with me.I hope the archive has some of his interviews, especially this one where he talks about DJ culture, the internet and what it’s going to mean: everyone having access to music and the general saturation. Nobody else understood the change that was coming like he did. He said things about it like: “Treat this thing like a velvet claw. It’s very soft and passionate on your skin, but it can cut you like a knife.”Natalie Merchant –Freddie Burretti’s costumes(1972-74)View image in fullscreenOne of Bowie’s  Ziggy Stardust costumes, designed by Freddie Burretti.Photograph: Richard Davis/V&A, LondonVisits to museum-library collections rank high on my list of peak experiences. I’d always imagined the poet Emily Dickinson as deep in thought or mourning or enraptured. Then at the Emily Dickinson museum I saw her favourite white cotton house dress: something meant for cleaning house or baking bread, and for all her forceful words issued on paper, the dress revealed that she was a thin-boned tiny bird of a woman, even smaller than me. I have a feeling the Freddie Burretti costumes would give me a similar insight about Bowie.When I was a 14-year-old kid growing up in rural New York State, someone gave me a copy of The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars and it delivered me entirely to another place. On the back cover, Bowie wore a quilted suit with a geometric pattern, a tight fitted jacket unzipped to the waist and matching trousers. He was otherworldly, cocky, dangerously hip, androgynous, provocative. Burretti’s fabulous costumes during the Ziggy Stardust to Diamond Dogs cycle refined Bowie’s androgynous glitter god persona. If I couldn’t have access to them all, I’d settle for some time alone with thaticonic album cover suitthat played such an important part in my adolescent awakening.Anthony Szmieriek – Freddie Burretti’s Ziggy Stardust costume (1972)As a teenager I found The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust in the bottom of a wardrobe. It’s one of the only things I have of my dad’s – a man I never knew but at least we share a taste in music. For me, this Ziggy costume is about collaboration, trust and bravery. A conversation in a London club [El Sombrero] with designer Freddie Buretti created an androgynous science fiction figure, the first of Bowie’s iconic characters inside a kind of time lord. Bowie’s marriage of music, fashion and art felt so beguiling and eternal that his passing almost felt like another transformation. I’d love to spend time with this costume to understand how that was possible, how it started and what it would lead to.Moby –Hamburg gig poster(1978)When David and I lived opposite each other in New York he would sometimes call up and say: “Hey, do you wanna come over and play guitar or piano on this song?” One night as I was leaving the apartment he shared with Iman, going down this very fancy hallway filled with art, he shouted: “Hold on – I want you to have this” and gave me his black fedora hat. When I rewatched him in the film The Hunger recently I thought: “Hey, there’s my hat!” For years it went missing, I presumed stolen by the crack addicts I’d invite back to my apartment at the end of the night when I was still going hard with liquor and drugs.Two house moves later I was in LA unpacking some boxes and there was theDavid Bowiemagic hat. I’m so glad to have it back, but otherwise the Bowie artefact I’d most like to spend time with is this poster for a gig in Hamburg in 1978. There’s a drawn self-portrait and underneath are some of his records: Low, “Heroes”, ChangesOneBowie and Space Oddity. In terms of a moment in time, you can’t do any better. I’d love to be able to go back to 1978 and see him performing songs from those records and Station to Station, my favourite Bowie album.Peter Murphy, Bauhaus –Ola Hudson, Giorgio Armani and Browns’ Thin White Duke costume(1976)View image in fullscreenReturning … David Bowie’s Thin White Duke costume.Photograph: Richard Davis/V&A, LondonThe first time I saw David in this outfit was in a news article announcing that he had “arrived on UK soil”, which was a thing then. Then the concert at Wembley was an unforgettable experience. This period was a move away from his decadent years and he was trying to clean up, which was reflected in the outfit: clean cut, white shirt and trousers, black waistcoat, slick hairdo. I’d also choose [to see] one of Bowie’s notebooks containing his handwritten lyrics, sketches or fragments of thought. Those pages are where his worlds first took shape, so to spend time with those would feel like being allowed into his head, to witness the beginnings of what would affect the lives of so many.Hamish Hawk –photograph by Paul McAlpine, Serious Moonlight tour(1983)It’s near impossible to pick just one item from such an inspiring collection but I was surprisingly drawn to this one. There’s a pristine, tailored aspect to it where he’s wearing this lovely suit with the perfectly untied necktie, but the live recordings from that tour are wild and unpredictable. It’s so immaculately presented yet he uses what was by then an incredible suite of songs as the basis for experimentation. This is all the different eras of Bowie in one photo. He’d just become a megastar but the photo captures a human look, as if he’s wondering: “Is everyone enjoying it?” But on the other hand he is absolutely in command, looking cooler than he ever has.Roddy Woomble, Idlewild –Labyrinth crystal ball(1985)View image in fullscreenCasting a spell …Bowie’s crystal ball from the movie Labyrinth.Photograph: David Parry/V&A, LondonI remember watching Labyrinth when I was eight years old and my mother telling me: “That’s a musician called David Bowie.” To me he was always Jareth, the king of the goblins, a sort of child-catcher figure who gazes into this crystal ball. It wasn’t until much later that I saw a video of Live Aid and realised who he was. Then in my teens I started listening to his records and loved them all. I still find it hard to compute that the same person could do Under Pressure with Queen and shapeshift into the king of the goblins in the same period, but that’s how transformative he was – and nobody did it better.The Anchoress –EMS Synthi AKS synthesiser used on Low, ‘Heroes’ and Lodger(1977)View image in fullscreenUnpacking the future of pop … EMS Synthi AKS synthesiser used by Brian Eno and David Bowie for ‘Heroes’, Low and Lodger.Photograph: Olivia Singleton/V&A, LondonUntil I first heard this synth on Low, I’d only known Bowie as the writer of hit songs such as Life on Mars and Changes, which my parents would play over Sunday lunch. The more esoteric, experimental, Berlin-era Bowie was a version I could claim for my own. My fascination with analogue synths started there and Brian Eno’s synths on those albums fundamentally shaped me as a producer and artist. I’ve been lucky enough to recently get to work with Pete Townshend’s incredible collection of vintage synths as I’m making a new album. But getting to see the one that started it all for me would be priceless.Joe Elliott, Def Leppard – Life on Mars handwritten lyrics (1971)View image in fullscreenApproaching star … David Bowie’s draft lyrics for Life on Mars.Photograph: Geoff Pugh/ShutterstockI’ve got enough Bowie posters to keep me happy for the rest of my life and his clothing wouldn’t fit me, so I’d love to have or get close to the lyrics to Life on Mars. Taken out of the context of his entire body of work, it stands out as a beacon of brilliance. The lyrics would look great above my jukebox next to my original lyrics of Marc Bolan’s One Inch Rock.The David Bowie archiveopens at the David Bowie Centre at the V&A East Storehouse, Londonon 13 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsDavid BowieV&AfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Inside the club, which is at the centre of the former fishing community aroundNewcastleupon Tyne, something else is brewing.When the Guardian visits, members are playing lunchtime games of pool in the downstairs bar as usual. But upstairs there are still signs of the latest party as huge sound system speakers butt up against the bingo caller’s equipment.This working men’s club has become an unlikely clubbing mecca. Local promoter and artist Man Power (real name Geoff Kirkwood) has brought some of the world’s best DJs and dance music acts to King Street:Caribou, Daniel Avery, Luke Una, Roman Flügel, Prosumer, Optimo and Gerd Janson have all played on the club’s stage and sung its praises.View image in fullscreenGeoff Kirkwood, better known as Man Power, has been putting on events at King Street, in which he owns a stake, since 2022.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“For the first two years, we lost money,” admits Kirkwood, who grew up in Wallsend. “But we could feel that there was something special happening.”He wasn’t the only person to see potential: Sam Fender had an album launch here and has a studio just down the street. But, after the Man Power parties, others started to get in touch. Apparently,Fred Againasked for a slot and was turned down.Kirkwood, who spent time in Berlin and Mexico before moving home, has been putting on events here since 2022. The DJ doesn’t just rent the space; he owns a stake in King Street. His company,Are You Affiliated(AFA), has essentially sublet the concert hall space for the next decade. The club, which has about 1,000 members, functions as usual (bingo nights, psychic acts, club turns) but on the occasional evening the upstairs space is transformed into a night club. Bar takings are up and events are selling out.It’s not just the King Street Social Club that Kirkwood has transformed either. Over the August bank holiday, AFA turned the Beacon Centre car park – a standard multi-storey in the town centre – into an ad hoc rave venue.The King Street model doesn’t just stand out because of the colourful tiles or the intriguing mix of new and old-school clubbing; it’sa success storyin an era when clubbing is often depicted asneeding life support.Covid was a terrible time for British clubs, with abouta third closing for good, which is part of a wider pattern. In 2013, the UK had 1,700 nightclubs; 11 years later there were just 787. In August, the Night Time Industries Association said the UK faced a future of “night-time deserts”, which followed dire headlines such as “UK clubs will be extinct by 2030” because of the closure rate.The reason for club closures is often put down to the changing habits of young people, soaring rents and pressure from property developers. But Kirkwood has also seen a shift in dance music towards a model where thedominance of major promoters and clubsmakes it harder for others to operate.View image in fullscreenThe working men’s club functions as usual, with its pool tables and bingo nights, but on the occasional evening is transformed into a night club.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“We’ve got into a situation where the model is ‘let’s create these few stars who can command a big audience; create these places that can take the big audience and we swallow it up and take market share’,” he says. “Fuck market share.”Kirkwood has taken that outspoken approach into meetings with local politicians who he is trying to convince to include clubbing when thinking about culture, and ensure some of themoney streaming into the areacomes the way of promoters.The impact of the cultural economy is already obvious in North Shields.Kirkwood takes me on a tour of the local area. We snake past theMeadow Well estate, site of a notorious riot in the 90s, before heading to Fish Quay, which Kirkwood describes as a “mini Hackney Wick”.On one street in the area there are two breweries and half a dozen artist studios (one of which is Kirkwood’s). Sam Fender’s studio is close by and there’s a vinyl pressing plant called the Jungle, which is finishing up a batch of records for drum’n’bass artist Nia Archives. “I was their first customer,” says Kirkwood. All the enterprises are connected in some way, with most roads leading back to King Street.Last weekend at the club, Kirkwood helmed a performance of a symphony he wrote while he was artist in residence at the nearby Glasshouse (formerly the Sage Gateshead). But he’s not getting carried away.“You’ve got journalists coming down to talk about it, which is fantastic,” he says. “But it doesn’t change the fact that, like, at 11.30 on Sunday night I was mopping piss up from the flooded toilets. It’s good to have that kind of levelling factor.”Explore more on these topicsClubbingDance musicNewcastleDjango DjangoSam FenderCaribouTyne and WearnewsShareReuse this content"

The discomfort felt by others may have been sharper this year as Promenaders heading to South Kensington shared the streets with the flag-draped hordes who had come to town in support of far-right activist Tommy Robinson.Inside the Royal Albert Hall, however, all was good-natured inclusivity, with pennants from around the globe dotting a sea of bunting from the UK and EU. Perhaps that was the diversity organisers were hoping to capture in a hodgepodge programme where 20-or-so disparate composers battled for attention.Inevitably there was good and bad. A definite plus was Hong Kong-born conductor Elim Chan making an auspicious Last Night debut. A firecracker on the podium, she piloted her forces through a series of orchestral and choral showcases. There was Mussorgsky’s first attempt at A Night on the Bare Mountain, a riot of imaginative ticks and quirks for those familiar with Rimsky-Korsakov’s interventionist rearrangement. Dukas’ Sorcerer’s Apprentice worked his magic, and there was a rip-roaring account of Shostakovich’s Festive Overture whose Soviet Technicolor brilliance felt like John Williams on steroids.View image in fullscreen‘This is in A, right?’ … Bill Bailey plays the typewriter.Photograph: Chris Christodoulou/BBCAnother asset was British soprano Louise Alder who, with limber tone, exquisite top notes and a relaxed, communicative manner, delivered a sparkling Jewel Aria from Faust and a deeply felt Vilja from The Merry Widow. In Rule, Britannia!, the vocal line was more richly decorated than her stylishly restrained Union Jack dress. She even turned in a creditable Eliza Doolittle in a medley from My Fair Lady.‘The cultural landscape is decimated’: Louise Alder on stage fright, arts funding and the Last Night of the PromsRead moreThere was a poignant farewell from trumpeter Alison Balsom who, at just 46, has put her retirement down in part to lack of repertoire. Hummel’s amiable concerto showed her at her best in the galloping finale. There were finds too, including Arthur Benjamin’s Elgarian Storm Clouds’ Cantata, composed for Hitchcock’s The Man Who Knew Too Much with a climactic cymbal crash designed to mask the sound of an assassin’s bullet.On the minus side, new music felt somewhat marginalised. At six minutes, Camille Pépin’s Fireworks did what it said on the tin, but while Rachel Portman’s The Gathering Tree boasted a catchy faux folk tune, it was dogged by some clumsy word setting. A souped-up classical arrangement of Queen’s 50-year-old Bohemian Rhapsody raised more laughs than goosebumps despite featuringBrian Mayon guitar and Roger Taylor banging Britain’s largest gong.For celebrity turns, it was left to comedian and Strictly winnerBill Baileyto save the day, playing a mean typewriter in Leroy Anderson’s eponymous bonbon. “This is in A, right?” he joked, before popping up later for Auld Lang Syne on the Albert Hall organ.

She talks about partying sober, writing in Scots, and why she’s rooting out stigma in her follow-up collectionSun 14 Sep 2025 07.00 EDTShareWhen Len Pennie’s debut, poyums, won the discover book of the year prize at this year’s British Book awards, it was the first poetry collection to do so for 10 years, and the first winner written in Scots as well as English. It’s likely that the 25-year-old can claim another first: she must be the only winner to have had her ID checked at the awards ceremony to verify her age.It’s true that Pennie is strikingly fresh-faced. She doesn’t drink alcohol (she often finds herself tidying up and doing the recycling at parties, and when I suggest that she must be a popular designated driver, she laughs and tells me she hasn’t got a licence. “I’m uselessandsober!”). But she has been through experiences that by rights might put years on a person.She started writing poetry because she was doing so much cross-stitch embroidery that she had the beginnings of carpal tunnel syndrome. And the reason she was sewing with such ferocity in the first place was because, while still a student and in the midst of the pandemic, she had just left an abusive relationship she had been in since she was 17. Now, hands and heart hurting, she turned her focus to something else that was “cheap, portable and doesn’t require specialist skills”.I liked how it felt to write poetry – it’s a weird thing, but it’s a visceral thingHer first poem was Honey: “You called me honey though I said it pained me, / and day after day you bit down and you drained me, / of blood, of nectar, of hope, and desire, / and you opened the stove and threw me on the fire”. It appears in poyums, which became the bestselling debut poetry collection of 2024, which Pennie has now followed with the collection poyums annaw.But in those early days of writing, publication wasn’t the goal – indeed, many of her pieces were performed to a camera, shared onsocial mediaand not written down until the book became a possibility. Neither was writing cathartic: “Poetry isn’t therapy, therapy is therapy,” she insists. “So I was on medication, I was getting therapy, I was putting the effort into making myself mentally healthy, and the poetry was a way to document that journey.”It was also a way to reassert some control over her life and to take the steps into young adulthood that had been denied her. “How do you date? How are you a student? How do you get a job? How do you fill all these roles that you have: to be a daughter, be a friend, re-establish all those connections that have been severed?”Pennie and her abuser had lived together during lockdown. It was only when the restrictions made clear that those extricating themselves from abusive relationships could leave that bubble that Pennie telephoned her family, who arrived an hour and a half later and piled her and her belongings into their car. She describes the early days as a form of withdrawal from the relationship’s toxicity; her mother slept beside her, and she even considered returning to “fix things”.Pennie and I are sitting in a coffee shop in Edinburgh ahead of her appearance at the city’s book festival, and she stresses how much performing her work is central to her sense of herself as a writer. Once again it’s evident that, while her confidence in the creative arena is impressive, the process started very differently. “I liked how it felt to write poetry,” she explains of those first days. “It’s a weird thing, but it’s a visceral thing. People assume that you’re sitting with a quill at a desk. I was writing poetry on the bathroom floor in between heaving sobs. I was writing it in bed. I was writing it at my lowest ebb, because it felt like a kind of thought experiment: if I can make this rhyme, if I can sit with this thought, I can process it. By the time you find the words that rhyme with your pain, it doesn’t have the same impact.”The first poem she posted online was called I’m No Havin Children, not a meditation on motherhood, but on language. The imaginary children will be called weans, “and they’ll be gettin a piece, no a weepacked lunch; / and they’ll be haein a scran, nohaving amunch”; and the poem is not just about different vocabulary and idiom but language as a powerful sociopolitical phenomenon. “I grew up in a house where Scots and English were used interchangeably,” Pennie says of her childhood in Airdrie, “and it was just a real culture of joyful linguistic expression.” It was a shock to realise as she grew older that speaking Scots was, for many, a source of stigma and shame, a signifier of a lack of education or resources. But the antipathy towards Scots, Pennie feels, is “just love pointed in the wrong direction”; a way of coping with a system that would marginalise a long-spoken language in favour of a mode of speech and writing more aligned to the establishment.For the past five years, she has recorded and released a Scots word of the day. “The only way to reduce a vocabulary is through shame,” she says, and tells me how her family and friends all check in to make sure she’s remembered to do that day’s word – even though she often only decides on it just ahead of time. “People think there’s some sort of grand spreadsheet or plan. They ask, what happens if you repeat a word?” She shrugs. “Well, I guess we just double down and say that’s consolidation!”Antipathy towards speaking Scots, Pennie feels, is ‘just love pointed in the wrong direction’Pennie has also had more than her fair share of detractors, particularly online. When she posted I’m No Havin Children on Twitter in 2020, it went viral overnight, but there were negative reactions as well as praise. More difficult are the comments that greet her work with victims of domestic violence and abuse, particularly when the publication of poyums coincided with the transmission of a BBC documentary following survivors of abuse through the court system.Pennie was one of them, having been approached by Victim Support, which was unaware at the time that she was a writer. Pennie’s abuser was convicted of one charge of domestic abuse in October 2023, having changed his plea to guilty on the day of the trial. He was later sentenced to a two-year programme of rehabilitation and a three-year non-harassment order; it had taken four years from initial report to conclusion and, she says, if her case had been dismissed, or found not proven, she would have cancelled the publication of the book.It is telling that poyums annaw features pieces entitled You’re Capitalising on Your Trauma and YourPoetryIs Shit. But it is also clear that Pennie remains determined to root out stigma and shame and face them down. “One of the things I’ve been very, very keen to do with both book tours and any time I do events is to create a space where domestic abuse is not a taboo word,” she says. “People say to me, what’s your book about? I’m supposed to say, ‘Oh, it’s a journey of healing.’ No: it’s about domestic abuse. And most people lean back, but some people lean in, and those are the people that I want to speak to because they feel seen and they feel like they don’t have to hide it.”Transparency is also a societal and political imperative; as Pennie points out, advising the abused to leave their abusers without ensuring a safe place to land – financial provision, accommodation, therapy, properly funded agencies and resources – is counterproductive: “You’re not giving people hope. You’re just removing abuse.” Reducing the length of time people must wait to seek justice is also key, as is support through the legal process; charity Action Against Stalking, Pennie remembers, not only provided legal, therapeutic and financial support, but also someone to walk alongside her in the courtroom.Giving voice to the less tangible aspects of suffering abuse is what art and literature can help to do. Pennie describes wanting to foreground how abuse can manifest itself in peaks and troughs rather than a static state, with the perpetrator switching behaviours: “They’re the best, the loveliest, the kindest, the sweetest – because they’re the one holding you under water, and they’re the ones saving you from drowning.”But even while Pennie knows she is still dealing with the aftermath of her experience, and that it will continue to find expression in her work, she is just as attracted by the idea of “making art outwith the trauma – pivoting, doing different things. One of the things I’ve enjoyed with the new book has been being able to talk about other things.” Another benefit of her career developing is having the opportunity to introduce readers to poetry, including at school level, where she’ll point out to kids who say they don’t like it that they probably have a favourite rapper.

It was probably finished after the gallery’s cut-off date of 1900, a cut-off the gallery has just announcedit will be jettisoning.To say that I am pleased is an understatement. It always struck me as bizarre that the end date occurs just at the exact point in history when painting is about to become very interesting. Just look atthe Baigneusesand what they represent: the leap towards abstraction in the representation of the human form; the composition and its unidentifiable, but unified landscape; the use of colour, and the lack of discernible religious or mythological subject matter. The painting and its two sisters cast a significant influence on the onward march of 20th-century painting, particularly cubism, as they made a strong impression on both Matisse and Picasso. Yet one leaves the building without much of a sense of how these revolutionary developments ever played out. To stop at 1900 never made much sense.Weird altarpieceshave their place, but there are only so many in the world to acquire, and the public’s appetite for them is likely to be limited.Reports that the National, in dropping the cut-offdate and buildinga large new wingdevoted to 20th-century painting, risks “bad blood” with the Tate are depressing. Before an agreement about the date was reached, the galleries had historically been at each other’s throats. How unedifying it would be to see these two institutions at war again over the acquisition of, say, a Rothko.However, these reports seem overstated. The galleries have formed a joint working group and are planning to collaborate in the interests of the national collection as a whole, and part of that collaboration will no doubt involve considering each gallery’s remit.The National is a gallery of painting, and it traces the history of that artform only, while the Tate encompasses sculpture, photography, installation, works on paper, and more. The 1900 cut-off is so frustrating in part because for a gallery of painting to not tell the story of the seismic shifts in painting during the 20th century is such an obvious omission (it has for some years been trying to circumnavigate this through various shows and collaborations with contemporary artists). Besides, from a tighter focus can come greater clarity in an institution’s storytelling.View image in fullscreenRokeby Venus by Diego Velázquez was slashed by suffragette Mary Richardson in 1914Photograph: IanDagnall Computing/AlamyOne of those shifts, and one which I would love to see embraced by the National Gallery, is the story of the female nude. At the moment, to walk around it is to see the naked female figure as perceived and depicted by men, from Titian’s Diana and Actaeon to Renoir’s Nymph by a Stream and, of course, Diego Velázquez’s Rokeby Venus. The building is essentially a temple to the male gaze. The suffragette Mary Richardson’s infamousslashingof the Venus is testament to that. While I could never slash such a painting, I do understand the impulse, as will many other women who have been subjected to society’s ruthlessly objectifying beauty standards.It goes without saying that the nude is highly political. As Cézanne left us to contemplate his bathers, that same year – 1906 – saw the first nude self-portrait by a female painter in western art history (officially, at least). Paula Modersohn-Becker would tragically not live long enough to see modernism play out, but her approach to the nude changed everything. To halt a survey of the history of painting just at the point where women artists were, for the first time, beginning to depict themselves as subjects after centuries of being objects simply makes no sense. Visitors are left with only part of the story.How wonderful would it be to see the nude as approached by Gwen John, Suzanne Valadon, Frida Kahlo, Amrita Sher-Gil, Louise Bourgeois, Jenny Saville, Tracey Emin, Lisa Brice, Mequitta Ahuja, Kudzanai Violet Hwami … the list goes on. And to see not just women artists’ depictions of the female body, of course, but also, through their gaze, the male. The gallery’s expansion is a wonderful opportunity to redress the balance and introduce the British public to underrepresented artists. Because much as I would love, budget allowing, to see a Rothko or a Magritte or a Hockney at theNational Gallery, I would also like to see a Lee Krasner, a Frank Bowling, or a Dorothea Tanning. As it stands, there are only 27 works by women in the entire collection, and very few works by artists of colour.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I have no doubt that the Tate and the National galleries will come to a workable agreement. As experts they will understand better than anyone that to tell the story of art a certain way always involves a series of choices about whose work, and whose subjectivity, matters. There will be new, and no doubt fraught, decisions to be made, but how exciting. I can’t wait to see where they lead.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist.

Critics lauded his creativity as a composer and his virtuoso playing of the keyboard, guitar and saxophone.Born on 22 June 1936, in Alagoas state in Brazil’s poor north-east, he was spared work in the fields as an albino child and instead spent hours learning how to play his father’s accordion and listening to birdsong.His family moved to the port city of Recife when Pascoal was 14, where he developed as a musician before setting off for faraway Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo.He recorded with musicians who became some of Brazil’s greatest performers, including the singer Elis Regina. The percussionist Airto Moreira took Pascoal on tour to the US, where he met Davis, already a jazz superstar.Hermeto Pascoal: The whole world in his handsRead moreDavis, before inviting him to play on his Live-Evil album in 1970, asked Pascoal to join him in his personal boxing ring and, in the Brazilian’s telling of the encounter, got hit hard in the face.“That’s when he started calling me the Mad Albino,” Pascoal recounted in an interview.Davis is also reported to have called the Brazilian “the most impressive musician in the world” and recorded three songs written by Pascoal on Live-Evil.On his own 1977 album Slaves Mass, Pascoal squeezed a piglet to make it squeal for the opening of a track, and a photo of him cuddling the animal appeared on its back cover. Other bizarre instruments he experimented with included children’s toys and cow horns.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

Rosalyn Drexler, who has died aged 98, was all these and more.Operating in the midst of the 1960s New York downtown scene, with artist peers such as Jim Dine andAndy Warhol, Drexler channelled a life lived well but often precariously, and close to the underbelly of society. The images she culled from magazines, adverts and posters for her pop art collages invariably featured gangsters and their molls, fighting couples and kissing lovers, King Kong and Marilyn Monroe. These photographs were pasted on to canvas and partially painted over with thick blocks of red, green, blue and yellow.View image in fullscreenDrexler culled images from magazines, adverts and posters for her collages.Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and Garth Greenan Gallery, New YorkDarker subjects intervened, at odds with the brash palette: references included gender violence, racism, the callousness of corporate America and the nuclear threat. InLove and Violence (1963), Drexler pictures the actors Dean Martin and Geraldine Page mid-embrace from the poster of their just-released film Toys in the Attic, though the image is made more sinister by being isolated amid red oil paint. Money Mad (1988) shows a businessman, a mugger and a homeless person floating against a stark black and brown background with a cascade of dollar bills.Drexler’s political commentary sometimes came from lived experience. Asked aboutThe Defenders (1983), a collage and acrylic work featuring a shootout between mobsters and cops, she explained how she made the painting for a lawyer in payment for his work defending “someone dear to me” against drug charges.Rosalyn was born to George Bronznick, a pharmacist, and Hilda (nee Sherman), both children of Jewish-Russian immigrants, in the Bronx,New YorkCity. As a child she devoured the art posters that came with the newspaper, but she also shared her family’s love for vaudeville. It gave her a taste for the stage and she enrolled at the high school of Music and Art (now the Fiorello H LaGuardia high school) to train as a singer. She then studied arts at Hunter College while taking classes with the New Dance Group, but left after a semester to marry Sherman Drexler, a figurative painter, and the couple moved to Berkeley, California, for Sherman to continue his studies.Under his influence, Drexler began to make plaster assemblages incorporating metal and found objects, and the couple had a joint exhibition in 1954 at the Courtyard Gallery in Berkeley.After the couple moved back to New York,Drexler signed up to a judo gym in the Hell’s Kitchen district of Manhattan, which introduced her to wrestling. “It must’ve been close to a circus, because every day there were tumbling dwarfs on a long mat in the window and an old woman who came in to hang by her neck in a tutu with rice powder on her face.”She soon became part of a travelling, all-female fighting troupe, taking the ring name Rosa Carlo the Mexican Spitfire. “These were tough dames,” Drexler said of her first meeting. “One of them was leaning into a mirror and taking bone fragments out of her gums with a tweezer.” She proved adept at landing fake blows and teasing the crowd. It was the kind of kitsch that Warhol adored, dedicating a series of silkscreens,Album of a Mat Queen (1962), to Drexler as Rosa, the original photographs lifted from a magazine profile on her. Drexler in turn made Warhol promise he would give her one of the works.View image in fullscreenSelf Portrait (1964).Illustration: Courtesy of Garth Greenan Gallery, New YorkAfter years of working variously as a waitress, cigarette and hatcheck girl to make money, Drexler was now a mother of two, and the wrestling tours gave the family some extra financial security. However, playing theatres and sports halls in the south prior to the end of segregation riled her sense of justice and, unable to continue appearing in such venues, after two years she hung up Rosa Carla’s suit. Several years later she would make the painted collage Is It True What They Say About Dixie (1966), depicting the black-suited men who set dogs on civil-rights protesters.In 1960 Drexler had her first solo show at the Reuben Gallery in New York, and started attending art happenings at the Judson Memorial Church. That milieu encouraged her to write the first of several plays, Home Movies, which was performed at the avant-garde venue in 1964, before continuing the same year at the off-Broadway Provincetown Playhouse. While one critic complained the musical comedy “centres on homosexuality and is not only vulgar but obscene”, it won a Village Voice Obie (off Broadway) award.Her first novel was published the following year: the New York Times described I Am the Beautiful Stranger as “subtly liberating and wholly original” with its semi-autobiographical protagonist, a teenage girl intent on reinvention who believes “you can do anything as long as it’s not you and you refuse to recognise yourself in the street”.More books followed, includingTo Smithereens (1972), which centres on the relationship between an art critic and a wrestler named Rosa, and in 1976, under the pen name Julia Sorel, the novelisation of the film Rocky. In 1973 she was part of a team hired to work on a special of the television comedy Lily, starring Lily Tomlin, which won an Emmy. That decade Drexler also supplemented her income by singing in a nightclub.View image in fullscreenSorry About That (1966).Illustration: Courtesy of Garth Greenan Gallery, New YorkA survey exhibition of her art toured the US in 1986, with one critic praising her “tragicomic burlesque of the anxiety and failure of the American dream”. Despite this, exhibitions in the 90s were intermittent until a career revival at the turn of the millennium. In 2000 she had a mini retrospective at Nicholas Davies Gallery, New York, followed by another in 2004 at Rosenwald-Wolf Gallery, University of the Arts, Philadelphia.Rosalyn Drexler: Who Does She Think She Is?, a full museum touring show, opened at the Rose Art Museum in Waltham, Massachusetts, in 2016. In 2018, her gallery,Garth Greenan, presented a show of her early work at Frieze Masters, in London.Sherman died in 2014 and her daughter, Rachel, died in 2010.

It’s like Deliverance in the HighlandsLucy ManganSun 14 Sep 2025 17.00 EDTShareAndrew Lincoln has been Rick Grimes – the leader of a group of survivors of a zombie plague in Frank Darabont’s at first mesmeric and then mesmerically dull post-apocalyptic series The Walking Dead – for 15 years. Off and on (and in a spin-off) but mostly on. Now, at last, he is free. He’s had a shower, a haircut and – thank God – cleared his throat after a decade and a half of rattling phlegmily through increasingly ropey scripts and pretending to care about his son Carl, and is appearing on stage in The Lady from the Sea at the Bridge theatre, London and on our screens in the fairly bananas thriller Coldwater.‘It will be frightening but you have to do it’: Andrew Lincoln and Alicia Vikander’s nerve-shredding stage returnRead moreYou can see what attracted Lincoln to the part. John is the anti-Grimes. We meet him (once the obligatory opening scene of the character covered in blood and running through some woods is over and we’ve flashed back to “Two months earlier”) fleeing the sight of a man in the playground beating up a woman, so panic-stricken that he leaves one of his two children there and has to go back for her. The family then moves to Scotland for a fresh start, although his high-flyer wife, Fiona (Indira Varma), seems far too intelligent for us to believe that she would countenance this as the answer to his post-playground PTSD and/or be married to a berk.For a berk John is. A supposedly willing househusband, he is bad with the kids and fails to keep on top of domestic matters, dumping them all back on Fiona the minute she walks in the door after work. He also can’t manage sex with her, though he’s OK when left to his own devices in the shower. I don’t know who to write to in order to beg for a different way of announcing that a show is going to deal with the crisis in modern masculinity, but there has to be someone. Or at least a helpline I can call.Still, the petty grievances of marriage are nicely interwoven with its vital practicalities in a way that helps keep the storyline engaging, when it could easily have devolved into complete nonsense. Conversations about feeling “old and shit” take place around compiling shopping lists; a laugh about “lady vicars” is shared amid a row about going next door for dinner; the sex thing matters but does not matter; rage and resentment fester for lack of time as much as unwillingness to deal with them – truly all of marital life is here.But John is still a berk. Also an unlucky berk, who becomes the target of a local bully, Angus Gillespie (Lorn Macdonald), after seeing him trying to intimidate the village’s young shop assistant, Catriona (Lois Chimimba). Plus, his new neighbours are a married Christian couple whose vibe is … distinctly off. Rebecca (Eve Myles) is a (lady) vicar who doesn’t believe in God but possibly believes in sapphism with the woman next door. Tommy (Ewen Bremner, head shaved, unblinking stare turned up to 11, no way this is going anywhere good, even before it is revealed that Tommy is almost as obsessed with serial killers as he is with leading them to salvation) really does believe in God and senses in John fruit ripe for the picking.Before you know it, but long after you’ve predicted it, Angus and John meet again, this time in those dark woods we saw John run through in the opening scene. Angus tries to throttle him; John brains him with a rock too many times to claim it was self-defence, and runs home only to be intercepted by the evangelical Christian with a serial killer obsession who offers to help clear up the mess. John, the berk, accepts – and then we’re really off to the races.By episode two, Coldwater has developed overtones of Deliverance-in-the-Highlands as Tommy begins upping the ante, Rebecca’s character becomes more fully fleshed out, and their relatively normal son grows suspicious of the increasing shenanigans (and the box of trinkets in Daddy’s shed). Catriona throws her own spanner in the works and there is a growing sense that the rest of the Bible study group wants watching too.It’s quality hokum, and if the examination of toxic masculinity and marriage gets subsumed along the way, I think I’d rather have a Highland village filling with murders than another shower scene by quite some distance.Coldwater aired on ITV1 and is on ITVX now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewAndrew LincolnreviewsShareReuse this content"

Their neighbours Tommy (Ewen Bremner) and Rebecca (Eve Myles) may be a bit kooky, but Tommy is an unexpected source of peace during John’s midlife crisis. The two men quickly bond over a new secret – but is John about to discover that his new mate is more than just a bit quirky? It’s a curious new drama – with some dark comedy moments – that quickly sucks you in and heads in unpredictable directions.Hollie RichardsonEducating Yorkshire8pm, Channel 4A dilemma for headteacher Mr Burton this week as this revived reality series continues. Year 10 student Scott is a rugby league prodigy with realistic hopes of a professional career. He’s also a handful. Can better behaviour be leveraged by rationing his sporting activity? Elsewhere, his classmate Alexa is struggling with anxiety. As ever, it’s funny, humane and charming.Phil HarrisonFreddie Flintoff’s Field of Dreams: Ultimate Test8.15pm, BBC OneThree years ago, Flintoff set out to prove cricket wasn’t just for the elite by forming a motley team of teens from Preston – many of whom had never played before. Here, he attempts the same in Manchester and Blackpool, showing kids “a different way” to build confidence. “You’ve just got to prove it works,” he says (spoiler: it does).Ali CatterallRob and Rylan’s Passage to India9pm, BBC TwoView image in fullscreenEnlightening … Rob and Rylan’s Passage to India.Photograph: BBC/Rex TV, Zinc Media/Jakob BorgesRylan and Rob Rinder are back with their enlightening travel series in which it is a joy to watch them learn, grow and bicker together. This time they are in India, inspired by EM Forster’s novel, and are still on top form as they start in Delhi. It’s just a shame, then, that it comes after Rylan’s comments on immigration.HRKing & Conqueror9.15pm, BBC OneCould the English stomach having a Frenchman as king? William (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) tries to politic his way to the throne as a mildly stodgy but rewarding enough historo-saga marches on towards the inevitable. Harold (James Norton) isn’t keen and, just as importantly in this more gender-balanced take on the 11th century, nor is his wife Edith (Emily Beecham).Jack SealeWalter Presents: IsolatedMidnight, Channel 4This Finnish survival drama is gleefully suspenseful.

Cate Blanchett plays Lydia Tár, the chief conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic, a celebrated figure in love with her own voice. She’s married to first violin Sharon (Nina Hoss), with whom she has an adopted daughter. But her bullish self-confidence doesn’t help her cause when dark revelations about a past relationship surface.SWLive sportWomen’s Rugby World Cup: France v Ireland, 12.15pm, BBC TwoEngland v Scotland follows at 3.30pm on BBC One.T20 International Cricket: England v South Africa, 2pm, Channel 5The final game from Trent Bridge.Premier League Football: Burnley v Liverpool, 1pm, Sky Sports Main EventMan City v Man Utd is at 4pm.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV tonightfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It begins with a flight to Guyana, in comic mode, and travels towards themes of trauma, motherhood and healing that bring broad-brush dialogue, therapy-speak and earnestness.The women are on their way to the Caribbean island to scatter the ashes of Elaine – Joyce’s mother and Erica’s grandmother. Together they comprise three generations of British Guyanese women who have had to go it alone, from work to child-rearing to financial and emotional support. It examines the cost of that but also how daughters misunderstand, and misjudge, their mothers.Both actors are at ease on stage. Wright is most magnetic while Rosheuvel is heartwarming and playful, albeit emotionally impenetrable to her daughter, even at her character’s most vulnerable.It is energetically directed by Lynette Linton, who is co-creator along with Dennis-Edwards, while Alex Berry’s set pulses with light, sound and projection as the story zooms across memories and time-frames.Mother and daughter are chalk-and-cheese with an amusingly antsy repartee at first: Joyce seems to be living her Shirley Valentine dreams as she kicks back, eyes up the waiter and hits the booze while Erica glowers at her judgingly and reassesses her own relationship to alcohol.The gulf between them has a history of secret anguish which emerges from beneath the humour, but without enough emotional intricacy or depth. Flashbacks to private sadness, depression and loss are well-enacted, in quick temporal switches, but they are too brief, with a repetition of ideas and lines through the play.Both actors switch between playing Elaine and versions of their own character at different ages, but the story brings plot-points that do not amount to much – the discovery of a long lost father that goes nowhere and an early memory for Joyce that haunts her but remains opaque until the end.This venue has had a spate of charismatic two-handers under Linton’s leadership such as The P Word and Shifters. This does not have the same alchemy, despite its central, dynamic duo, whose performances outshine the play.At Bush theatre, London, until 1 NovemberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

But sometimes it’s also wonderful to see lovely dancing set to beautiful music. And London City Ballet, the company revived last year after an almost 30 year hiatus, delivers it.Take Liam Scarlett’s Consolations and Liebestraum from 2009. It helps that it opens with Alina Cojocaru, one of the world’s superlative ballerinas, who is always able to make your heart quietly leap, your breath still for a moment. The Liszt score, played live by Reina Okada, is longingly romantic but sets in train dancing with no schmaltz, unspooling threads of steps that are swift but unhurried: turn and lift, turn and lift in fluid swirl.Scarlett’s later career became mired in controversyand he took his own life in 2021; this is a reminder of the superiority of his craftsmanship.A new commission, Soft Shore by Paris Opera Ballet’s Florent Melac, is easy on the eye and ear too, but suffers from being too close in mood to Scarlett’s piece. The second highlight of the programme is Alexei Ratmansky’s Pictures at an Exhibition. The famous Mussorgsky score was inspired by Viktor Hartmann’s paintings, but the backdrop here has projections of Kandinsky’s colourful circles. Again for solo piano, the music is illustrative, almost comical at points with a heavy, lurching melody, but Ratmansky’s response is not always the obvious – there is brightness and zing – and we are absorbed into the dance’s world. Joseph Taylor (formerly of Northern Ballet) gets a fantastic angry solo against a vivid red canvas; Constance Devernay-Laurence, another former principal with a large company (Scottish Ballet) emits the assurance only experience can bring.Part of London City Ballet’s remit is to revive forgotten works by great choreographers. Here it’s George Balanchine’s Haieff Divertimento from 1947, never before seen in the UK. It has Balanchine signatures a-plenty: the practice-wear costumes; the clarity of individual steps, as if watching a ballet class; the idiosyncratic style of jutting hips and off-centre weight. Dancers train for years to absorb Balanchine’s technique and this is not a Balanchine company – although Cuban dancer Alejandro Virelles does a lovely combination of lightness and authority that’s very in keeping – but it’s a pleasure to see the work unearthed nonetheless.Until 14 September; New Theatre Oxford, 11 November; York Theatre Royal, 14-15 NovemberExplore more on these topicsBalletDanceSadler's WellsAlina CojocarureviewsShareReuse this content"

As it happens, I often eat the creamy, wobbly silken variety straight from the packet, but I wouldn’t disagree: you don’t have to be vegetarian to enjoy a hot, crisp nugget of deep-fried beancurd.Prep15 minCook15 minServes2About 280g firm or extra-firm tofu– if using silken, skip step 3Saltand black pepper4 tbsp cornflour, or other starch (optional)Neutral oil, for deep-fryingFor the chilli crisp (if making)1½ tbsp Sichuan peppercorns3-4 tbsp gochuharu, or other chilli flakes to taste30g roasted salted peanuts, or soybeans, roughly chopped1 tbsp fermented black beans, finely chopped (optional)250ml neutral oil1 long shallot, or 2 round ones, peeled and thinly sliced6 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced1 tsp sugar(optional)¼ tsp MSG powder(optional)1 A note on the tofuFirm or extra-firm tofu is the best choice for frying – silken will be creamy inside, and pressed tofu chewier and more meaty. For the neatest results, cut into bite-sized nuggets about 3cm x 2cm. If you value crunch over appearance, break it into bite-sized pieces instead; the rougher edges will crisp up better than perfectly flat surfaces.2 Soak the tofuView image in fullscreenFor maximum crispness, remove as much excess moisture from the tofu as possible before cooking it. Fill a bowl or pan with boiling water and season very generously with salt, so it tastes like the sea. Drop in the tofu, leave to soak for 15 minutes (the hot water will draw out liquid from the centre of the tofu; the salt’s just for seasoning).3 Dry the tofuView image in fullscreenMeanwhile, line a baking tray with kitchen paper or a clean tea towel. Drain the tofu, put it on the tray and top with more paper or another towel. Put another baking tray or chopping board on top, weigh that down with a couple of tins, or something else heavy, and leave to sit for 15 minutes.4 To coat, or not to coat?Coating the tofu is optional, but it will help with crunchiness. Put the cornflour or other starch (eg, plain or rice flour, potato starch, etc) in a shallow bowl and season generously with salt and pepper, or other spices of your choice. Add the pieces of tofu, toss to coat lightly, then shake off any excess.5 Fry the tofuView image in fullscreenMeanwhile, fill a deep pan by about a third with a neutral oil and heat to 180C (or until bubbles form around the end of a wooden chopstick). Add the tofu, in batches, if need be, stir once, then fry until crisp and golden. Drain on kitchen paper, season and serve with a dipping sauce, or toss through a stir-fry.6 And now for some homemade chilli crispYou may wish to serve your fried tofu (and just about everything else you eat, for that matter, from eggs to rice to steamed veg) with chilli crisp. Though there are many delicious ready-made versions out there, making your own allows you to tweak the basic formula (oil, chilli, crunchy beans or nuts) to suit your own taste.7 Toast and grind the spicesView image in fullscreenToast the peppercorns and/or any other whole spices (eg, black peppercorns, cumin and/or coriander seeds, star anise, cinnamon) in a dry pan, then roughly crush. Chilli-wise, I prefer medium-hot flakes such as Korean gochugaru, but experiment with different varieties. Toast briefly, then grind, if necessary. Put the peanuts, black beans and all the spices in a large heatproof bowl.8 Flavour the oilSet a heatproof sieve over a heatproof bowl. Pour the oil into a wide frying pan, add the sliced shallot and put the pan on a medium heat. Fry, stirring, until the shallot is crisp and golden, then drain into the sieve and return the oil to the pan. Add the garlic, cook until pale golden, then drain again.9 Mix and jarView image in fullscreenPour the hot oil on to the spice and nut mixture, then stir in the sugar and MSG, if using; you may also wish to add salt, depending on how salty your peanuts and black beans are. Leave to cool completely, then stir in the fried shallots and garlic. Decant into a clean jar, seal and store in the fridge.Explore more on these topicsTofuFelicity Cloake's masterclassFoodMain courseSide dishesChinese food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

If only their main trouble was making bottles of chardonnay and pinot blanc, or selling pretty Tillingham tea towels at £36 a pop. But no, Tillingham has (quite literally) many other plates to juggle: it has a fancy restaurant and a vast barn from which they serve pizza, too.There’s also the option to stay over in bell tents, no less, if posh hen weekends or corporate bonding sessions are required. Or in bricks-and-mortar rooms with actual plumbing, if the tent’s compost toilet is not for you. If all this isn’t distracting enough, much of Tillingham’s workforce must be drained dealing with its frequent wine tours; wine experts plod groups of natural wine buffs around the sheds, talking lovingly of clay vessel spontaneous fermentation and how nettle tea aids vine health. All that while handing out samples of natural wine, which naysayers might find quite challenging, if not verging on abrasive.View image in fullscreenThe ‘prettily arrranged’ citrus-cured halibut, at Tillingham’s restaurant.Natural wine is, of course, wildly polarising. What everyone loves, however, is dinner, which is why Tillingham’s huge, formal restaurant overlooking breathtakingly pretty countryside should be its biggest draw. TheSunday feast, for example, has three courses for £45. The short menu, on first inspection, sounds lovely and locally sourced: braised Morebread Farm lamb, Beal’s Farm salami, house-made focaccia and baked cheesecake with poached rhubarb. The vast room was empty when we arrived, although several chefs seemed to be hard at work in the open kitchen, while serving staff hovered around the floor. So far, so good.However, as the meal began, it transpired that not a terrible amount of cooking was going on and, more pressingly, no one on the floor seemed to be in charge or trained to work in a semi-formal restaurant. The amateur-hour shtick of Tillingham’s service could be seen as endearing – our drink order, for example, was taken with no mention of the wine that was being made all of 100m away.View image in fullscreenTillingham’s lobster linguine with a ‘good, rich, slightly piquant, glossy tomato sauce’.It was midday on Sunday and the fresh focaccia from the sharing section of the menu had definitely seen brighter, crisper days. Let’s call that day Saturday. The other “sharing items” were cashews and olives, which would hardly have made chef break a sweat. A starter of citrus-cured halibut with fennel, orange salad and wood sorrel was prettily arranged – in a fancy, wedding-breakfast, mass-catering way – but lacked any discernible zing. Another starter was courgette velouté with more of that stale focaccia.At this juncture, a visit to the ladies’ room led me to discover a small chalkboard, at skirting-board level, alerting diners to the veg from nearby fields that had been picked and was being served today. Tillingham’s restaurant seems determined to hide its light under a bushel. The main courses were the stars of the show: lobster linguine came topped with half a native lobster, with a good, rich, slightly piquant, glossy tomato sauce. The lobster meat was well judged, drenched in garlic butter and impossible not to love. Lamb chop was accompanied by crispy lamb and garlic puree and a complex rosemary jus. Another main of nicely cooked skate wing with brown shrimp sported a delightful beurre noisette. We saw some great cooking here, and sumptuous sides of heritage tomatoes and broccoli chargrilled with honey glaze were further clues that we were eating farm to fork.View image in fullscreenTillingham’s rhubarb cheesecake comes ‘titivated with petals’.Still, this is a restaurant that seems to be currently working to a fraction of its potential; the desserts were a choice of a spin on Eton mess, some cheese and crackers, plus that baked rhubarb cheesecake, which we chose, hoping for something Basque-ish, burnished and wobbling. Instead, it was something clearly pre-made, with a digestive biscuit base, piped with rhubarb gel and titivated with petals. So many cooks, not a great deal of cooking.Wine, wine everywhere and not a drop of it mentioned to drink. We left, and skipped the gift shop for keepsakes, because there was very little here to remember.TillinghamDew Farm, Dew Lane, Peasmarsh, East Sussex, 01797 208226.
