What Christmas TV insiders really watch every yearFrom a show so bananas it could blind people to a classic cartoon that guarantees tears – stars behind the best festive treats on telly reveal what they tune into without failDaniel Dylan WrayTue 23 Dec 2025 11.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 23 Dec 2025 15.37 ESTShareChristmas is a time steeped in traditions. And one big tradition that exists in many of our homes over the period revolves around TV: rewatching old favourites, hunkering down for that special you’ve been dying to see or sitting in a post-lunch fugue with a beloved family film. And, as we publishedlast week, there’s a bounty of Christmas telly to get stuck into this year.But what about people involved in making TV? What do theirChristmasviewing habits look like? Here, a variety of actors, writers, directors and comedians – many of whom may be popping up on your screens this year – share their Christmas TV favourites.Jools HollandOliver TwistMy mother always told me that my great grandmother’s mother had, a bit like the protagonist in the story, died in the union workhouse in Greenwich. So we’d sit watching the film, holding hands, and it was like, wow, I felt like it wasussomehow. There’s something about it at the end where you want to get to Mr Brownlow’s house – the kindly gent that takes Oliver Twist in. Mr Brownlow’s house is the archetype for a place that is safe, which I think is what everybody wants. It had a lasting impression on me and I have probably tried to make a Mr Brownlow’s house in my own life – somewhere to run back to. I like to watch that every Christmas and force the children and grandchildren to watch too.Holland presentsJools’ Annual Hootenannyon New Year’s Eve, 11.30pm, BBC TwoBen Wheatley, directorQuincy’s QuestThis was a 1979 Tommy Steele Christmas Special. I’ve got a very vivid memory of it. It’s bonkers. It’s nightmare fuel. It’s about a toy soldier inside a department store who has adventures with all sorts of toys, giant robots, Lego bricks, witches and so on. As a kid it’s a major fantasy to be able to play with giant toys and it really stuck with me. You can watch it onYouTubeand it’s funny as fuck. Just don’t watch it all because it will make you go blind.Maisie AdamHallmark Christmas filmsView image in fullscreenGuess that plot! … the Hallmark film A Perfect Christmas.Photograph: Brooke Palmer/HallmarkThe Christmas film I’d watch when I was little was alwaysHome Alone– but only one and two. You’ve got to have a Culkin in there – if you go beyond that it doesn’t count. But now that I’m grown up, my husband found a channel that exclusively shows Hallmark Christmas films. It’s become a bit of a game to find ourselves on the Hallmark Channel and to pick the title of a film and try and guess what the plot is based on that. They’re always terrible with cheap sets and the acting is really bad, like they’ll just suddenly look down the lens of the camera by accident. We love them.Adam is in Taskmaster: Champion of Champions on22 December, 9pm, Channel 4Arabella Weir, actorFart filmsGrowing up, pretty much without exception, we’d watchMeet Me in St LouisorIt’s a Wonderful Life. But we have another tradition. In our family, on Christmas Day, you can fart as much as you like and you don’t have to apologise and nobody can complain. So after lunch, brussels sprouts and lots of farty food, we’d sit down to watch these films. I had two older brothers and, of course, in the true tradition of boys, the longer, louder, smellier, the more extended the better. It was farting as a sport and very much the soundtrack to both of those movies.Weir is in theTwo Doors Down Christmas SpecialonChristmas Eve, 10pm, BBC OneJeremy Dyson, co-creator of The League of GentlemenA Christmas CarolView image in fullscreenBeautiful … the Oscar-winning 1971 animated film A Christmas Carol.On Christmas Eve, we watch Richard Williams’ peerless 1971 animated version of A Christmas Carol. It’s some of the most beautiful hand-drawn animation ever committed to film by the genius behind Who Framed Roger Rabbit. It throws me right back to being seven years old, snow on the ground, a carol concert at primary school. Just gorgeous. If you’ve never seen it, savour the 4k restorationhere.Bridget ChristieThe Box of DelightsWe watch The Box of Delights every year without fail. Schoolboy Kay Harker is given a magic box and goes on a journey through time and space. There are wolves and rats that eat gone-off cheese, and it’s one of those delightful children’s shows we used to make in the 1970s and 80s and don’t any more because everyone’s too scared to commission things that are a bit thoughtful and weird nowadays. We started when the kids were little and have carried on the tradition and even though they’re now teens they still love it. Part of the fun of it is me trying to remember what it’s called every year – A Box of Tricks? The Magic Box? A Tray of Delights? It’s captivating and beautiful and has snow in it. Remember that?Paris Lees, writer, What It Feels Like for a GirlTitanicView image in fullscreenLeonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet in Titanic.Photograph: Merie Weismiller Wallace/20th Century Fox/AllstarIn 1998, my mum took me to see Titanic at the Odeon in Nottingham and it’s the only time I’ve heard applause in a cinema – when Kate Winslet mouths: “I’d rather be his whore than your wife!” So when the BBC aired it on Christmas Day, 2000, it felt like an event, and the whole family gathered to watch. I used to find mainstream culture oppressive and corny, but in these fragmented times I’ve come to miss it. Christmas feels like one of the rare times where we still watch as one.Iain Morris, co-creator of The InbetweenersJames BondThe occasional postprandial Bond film was as close as we got to a tradition, and that’s the only thing I’ve carried over with my own kids and any Christmas guests. I am very strict though, and maintain that Roger Moore was peak Bond, so it’ll be one of seven films, with a thumb on the scale for A View to a Kill due to my love of Duran Duran and Grace Jones. I’m forcing my teenage nephews to watch the Inbetweeners at the moment, so there’s a possibility I’ll put that on after Max Zorin’s demise, leave the room to avoid embarrassment, then stand listening at the door praying for laughs.Christine Gernon, director of Gavin and StaceyStrictly Come DancingView image in fullscreenHappy-making … Karen Carney lifts the Strictly Come Dancing 2025 trophy alongside partner Carlos Gu.Photograph: Guy Levy/BBC/PAThe thing that really sums up Christmas for me is the Strictly final. We watch it with friends; it’s generally the beginning of the Christmas week and it feels very festive. We normally have people over: nibbles, champagne, hats, getting into the vibe. I love the show because I love a journey, which is why I always like the people that come in and are a bit shit but get better. It’s a really happy-making bit of TV. It’s very hard to watch without smiling.Harriet Kemsley, comedianElfIt brings me great joy. I insist my family watch it every year and for some people – my brother – it can provoke great fury. But what is not to love about a man who thinks he is an elf trying to find his long-lost father in New York City? I worked out years ago that the reason I love it so much is that when I was 19, I moved to New York and I weirdly relate to an optimistic, naive, elf-like creature struggling to fit in.Holly Walsh, writer, AmandalandThe Christmas Day filmI would beg my parents to buy a TV listings magazine so my brother and I could carefully plan exactly what we’d watch over Christmas. It was a complicated timetable – working out what shows we’d watch live and what we’d record on our ancient video player so as to maximise viewing. Obviously, the Christmas Day movie was the biggy: you’d definitely record that, because it’d be on during lunch – Back to the Future III, Jurassic Park, Crocodile Dundee. Although I never got to see Labyrinth because someone accidentally taped the Paul Daniel’s Christmas Special over it.The Amandaland Christmas special is onChristmas Day, 9.15pm, BBC OneAlan TitchmarshAll Creatures Great and SmallThere are several films that are a must in our house at Christmas: The Holiday, It’s A Wonderful Life, Miracle on 34th Street. But more than anything I’m looking forward to the All Creatures Great and Small Christmas special – a bit of Yorkshire to keep this tyke who’s doing missionary work down south happy. It’s so beautifully filmed and the characters have real depth. We are ardent Mrs Hall fans in our house.Love Your Christmas with Alan Titchmarshis onITVXArthur Matthews, co-creator of Father TedView image in fullscreenI wish it could be Christmas every day … Roy Wood and Wizzard on 1973’s festive Top of the Tops special.Top of the PopsI used to watch the Top of the Pops Christmas specials with my sister. I especially remember the 1970s ones with Slade and Wizzard. It was a big show for me and I’m very nostalgic about it. I watch the reruns but I wouldn’t bother with anything after 1981/82. I think Top of the Pops was terrible after then, with all this very synthetic, artificially sounding stuff. I just didn’t like the 80s. But when I think about Christmas TV it’s still always Top of the Pops.Jessica Swale, writer, Paddington the MusicalChristmas Day soapsWe were never allowed to watch soaps as a child. My dad always said, “imagine what you could be doing with that time instead”. But the exception to the rule was every Christmas at my grandma’s house. She loved EastEnders and Coronation Street and we would watch the Christmas specials. I always thought they were the best TV ever because there was so much drama – so surely the other 364 days of the year, it was just as good. That was our Christmas treat because my parents couldn’t say no. I didn’t understand what was going on but I loved it.Ben Whitehead, voice actor, plays Wallace in Wallace and GromitA post-dinner filmView image in fullscreenSpecial … Wallace and Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl.Photograph: NetflixWatching a film after Christmas dinner is my TV tradition. It doesn’t have to be a classic, just entertaining and preferably new to me. But mostly it’s about who you watch it with. Last year was special. When I learned thatVengeance Most Fowlwas premiering on Christmas Day, I was nervous and excited knowing millions would be watching. My brother hosted a family feast and afterwards we watched the film. I’ll hold that memory very dear for many Christmases to come.Tony Dow, director, Only Fools and HorsesBringing Up BabyOnce my kids got to a certain age, I couldn’t get them to watch a black and white movie, so watching one over Christmas became a bit of an obsession. Bringing Up Baby is absolutely amazing. The quality of what Cary Grant does is gobsmacking. They call it screwball comedy but there’s something naturalistic about it. Grant does all the falling over and Katharine Hepburn is completely natural and just reacts. She doesn’t try to act. Don’t over act is one of the great notes I’ve always given actors, especially in comedy. I look at David Jason and Nick Lyndhurst as having a similar amazing quality – David was the energy, the driver, and Nick was the reactor.Chenée Taylor, actor, Just Act NormalThe John Lewis ChristmasadvertView image in fullscreenWholesome … the 2013 John Lewis Christmas advert, The Bear and the Hare.Photograph: John Lewis/PAThis is the first Christmas advert that I was old enough to properly remember, as I was around 10. I loved it so much: the story of this bear who has never seen Christmas. I like an emotional, sentimental, sad advert for Christmas. Lily Allen’s version of Somewhere Only We Know is still on my sleep playlist. I love it and it calms me. Watching this advert makes me feel hopeful. I watch it every year. It doesn’t even need to be Christmas. It could be June. If I’m feeling like I just want to sit and watch something wholesome and cute, this is my go-to.Isy SuttieThe SnowmanView image in fullscreenNot sad tears, Christmas tears … The Snowman.Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyIt reminds me of being a kid, but I also love seeing my own kids watch it. When I was young, I was obsessed with the idea of flying, to the point where my friend Helena and I took to jumping off her chest of drawers for hours every Sunday after church in repeated demoralising attempts to become like the boy in The Snowman. Nowadays I know I can’t fly, and the music in it makes me cry, but they’re not sad tears, just Christmas tears. Every parent knows the ones.Suttie is in The Great Peep Show Christmas Bake Off on Christmas Day, 8pm, Channel 4Explore more on these topicsTelevisionChristmasCelebrityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Each had lived quietly in Britain for years, waiting for the right moment to stage an attack, and for the right person to give them the support to make it happen.Now, finally, it seemed that “zero hour” – as they called it – had arrived.They planned to disguise themselves as Jews to infiltrate a march against antisemitism in Manchester city centre, before opening fire on the crowd with assault rifles.The pair hoped to throw emergency services into chaos by paying people to make 999 calls across Greater Manchester, allowing them to slip away and continue their attack in the suburbs at the centre of the region’s Jewish community.Saadaoui also planned to attack Christians, saying: “God willing … after we finish with the Jews … we move on to the crusaders.”It would have been, according to senior detectives, the worst terrorist attack the UK had ever seen.Both men envisaged being “martyred”, but neither reckoned with the prospect that a man they believed to be a crucial player in their plot could be a counter-terrorism undercover operative (UCO). Because of the courage of the UCO, known as “Farouk”, Saadaoui was captured in the final stages of preparation in a hotel car park, while Hussein was arrested at the shop where he worked.A prosecution source said of Saadaoui, the prime mover: “This was a man who was quite prepared to go out and kill children and leave his own in the process.” They added: “At one point he says: ‘You know, if we have an AK-47 left over, I will leave it for my son – so he can do what I do when he grows up.’”The disturbing mindset and tactics of the secret IS network of “lone wolves” and sympathisers were revealed in unprecedented detail in a forensic prosecution case laid out in a three month trial at Preston crown court.Now that Saadaoui, 38, and Hussein, 52, have been convicted of preparing for acts of terrorism, and Saadaoui’s younger brother Bilel Saadaoui has been convicted of failing to report them, the full story of the plot can be told.View image in fullscreenLeft to right: Amar Hussein, Bilel Saadaoui and Walid Saadaoui.Composite: Greater Manchester policeA personable man who doted on his pet birdsOn the surface, nothing about Saadaoui, a father of two, suggested he was an extremist who, in his own words, believed Adolf Hitler should be “exulted”. Originally from Tunisia, he was not known to police or security services, had never been referred to the Prevent anti-radicalisation scheme and had no criminal convictions.He came across as a personable, ambitious individual with little interest in religion, let alone extremism. Acquaintances in the UK knew him as a man who doted on his pet birds, dressed casually in sportswear and said he wasn’t a faithful Muslim. When he met his first wife, a British woman, he was working as an entertainer at a Tunisian resort, amusing tourists by the pool with jokes, fitness sessions and dance shows.The couple settled in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex. Saadaoui worked at a Haven holiday village, doing overtime in the resort’s shops, bakery and arcade, before training as a chef and buying an Italian restaurant, the Albatross, in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, in 2018. His marriage ended soon after moving there, and he went on to meet his second wife, with whom he he had two children.“I wanted to progress in life,” Saadaoui claimed seven years later, standing in the dock at court.The truth was much darker.“Walid Saadaoui told Farouk that [he and his brother Bilel] committed to Islamic State when they were young boys in Tunisia,” a prosecutor in the case told the Guardian. “And so that became a driving force for them. And by [the time they were] late teenagers, early 20s, they both got into the tourism industry and befriended English girls and married to come to the UK. They moved into the UK with a very ingrained Isis [IS] creed and conviction.”“Their partners were, without doubt, without knowledge of what was happening,” the source added. “The [brothers] would go off and speak in Arabic together.”View image in fullscreenWeapons seized during the arrest of Walid Saadaoui.Photograph: Greater Manchester policeSaadaoui hated mosques, calling them repugnant. He preferred private prayer groups and online Facebook pages where extremists were drawn together by signifiers, such as Saadaoui’s avatar – a picture of the Paris Bataclan terroristAbdelhamid Abaaoud, whom he idolised.Saadaoui used 10 Facebook accounts to revel in attacks on Jewish people, individual terrorist tactics and disseminate IS propaganda, produced by the group’s media agency, al-Furqan. By 2023 he had moved to Wigan, in Greater Manchester, 20 miles west of one of Europe’s largest Jewish communities, ostensibly to be nearer his brother.To the Saadaoui brothers, even Hamas members were moderate “apostates”. But in 2023, the 7 October attack on Israel became an inspiration. Saadaoui’s antisemitism intensified, along with his desire to stage an attack in the UK.The undercover operationFive days after the atrocity in Israel, he bought an airgun to start practising. On 26 October, he posted an image online of a man preparing to go to war and leaving his children behind.Unknown to him was counter-terrorism police’s immersion in north African jihadist subcultures. This meant Saadaoui, a cautious, secretive individual who had spent years mentally preparing to execute a terror attack, truly believed he had met a fellow IS sympathiser when he began corresponding on Facebook with Farouk in December 2023, the same month he posted on the social media site: “I pray to you Allah not to catch me until I break my thirst with Jewish, Christians and their proxies’ blood.”Saadaoui believed Farouk could get him semi-automatic weapons, sent by divine intervention. He paid a £2,250 cash deposit at their first meeting. It was vital that Farouk let him think he could arm him, as Saadaoui had tried to source guns through Albanian gangsters and police wanted to stop him from getting guns from elsewhere. Farouk had to persuade him he could get AK-47s from Morocco and maintain that ruse until he could be arrested at a handover.Police could have arrested Saadaoui earlier on the basis of his Facebook posts. However, prosecution for those offences would lead to him “being released in a year or two – and then becoming more of a threat”, a senior detective in the case said. But while they believed the undercover investigation was containing the threat from Saadaoui so “the public was never at risk”, the detective admitted the tactic gave him sleepless nights. “There was more than one occasion I thought, what on earth was I doing? What if he goes and does something?” he said.Around the same time he befriended Farouk, Saadaoui recruited Amar Hussein. Describing Hussein’s reaction, Saadaoui said: “I swear to God almighty, this is the first time I saw a man his age crying with tears and hugging me. He said: ‘Bring me a weapon.’”Frank Ferguson, the head of the Crown Prosecution Service special crime and counter-terrorism division, said: “Amar Hussein had military training and experience – which Walid Saadaoui didn’t.”Hussein shared Saadaoui’s “jihadist faith”. He lived and worked at Salim Appliances, a white goods repair shop in Bolton. Saadaoui was worried Hussein, an unpredictable, volatile character, would derail their plans by staging a spontaneous attack of his own. He was known for dressing as a follower of IS – including a tool belt that looked like a “suicide belt”. On one occasion, according to Saadaoui, he threatened someone at a restaurant, saying: “I am Daesh [IS] and I came to you with slaughter.”View image in fullscreenHussein (left) and Saadaoui on a reconnaissance trip to observe the port at Dover.Photograph: Greater Manchester policeDescribing Hussein’s past to Farouk, Saadaoui said: “He is from a Kurdish background, was brought up in Iraq, trained in Saddam’s army … a devotee of the Islamic State. He doesn’t believe in any heretic civilian institution of all kind.”After his arrest, Hussein laid the plot’s motivations bare, telling police: “Your prime minister, you know, he is terrorist that kills our children and gives Israel weapon and kill our children. Terrorism is our religion.”Hussein and Saadaoui travelled repeatedly to Dover in spring 2024 on reconnaissance, observing the port where they believed their weapons – codenamed “goldfinches” by Saadaoui – would be arriving, posing as tourists at the white cliffs.Hussein and Saadaoui had met through Bilel Saadaoui. Jihadist propaganda found on Bilel Saadaoui’s phone included the statement: “To be in a cold icy night in an army of mujahideen waiting to meet the enemy next morning is more beloved to me than a wedding night with the most beautiful bride who I love, or if I were given the good news of having a newborn son.”By May 2024, after all their reconnaissance trips, Hussein and Saadaoui believed they were about to receive guns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition from Farouk, after a last trip to Dover. Their preparations were complete. As Saadaoui readied himself to die, he wrote a will and gave it to his brother, having sold the Albatross, placed £74,000 in a safe in his garden and started to teach his wife to drive.A safe found buried inside a shed during the arrests.Photograph: Greater Manchester policeSaadaoui had already joined Jewish Facebook groups looking for marches to attack. He had taken Farouk around neighbourhoods north of Manchester city centre, observing synagogues, shops and schools, looking for targets. As they watched ordinary people, peaceably going about their business, Saadaoui said to Farouk: “My blood is boiling, brother, let’s get out of here.” He told Farouk: “We are going to carry out the operation in August … brothers from inside (Islamic State)… they will help.”Instead, on 8 May 2024, police executed a sting operation on the car park of the Last Drop Village hotel in Bolton. Saadaoui was caught red-handed. The guns, unbeknown to him, had been deactivated.Explore more on these topicsUK security and counter-terrorismGreater ManchesterCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

Not deliberately, she stresses with a laugh. “I’m just really bad at my phone. I’m such a technophobe, and he knew that,” she says. They had made the Disney+ showA Thousand Blowstogether, in which Doherty plays an East End crime boss in Victorian London, and Graham had talked about an idea he wanted to dramatise, about a teenage boy who is catastrophically radicalised by online misogyny. A couple of months after they’d wrapped A Thousand Blows, Graham and his wife and producing partner, Hannah Walters, kept trying to get in touch. “I was getting voice notes from him and Hannah being like, ‘Erin, pick up your phone!’” Doherty’s girlfriend told her to ring him back and Graham offered her the role in Adolescence. She said yes on the spot, without reading the script.Since it was screened on Netflix in March,Adolescencehas had nearly 150m views. It sparked a huge cultural conversation; it was shown in secondary schools and its creators were invited to Downing Street. Did they have any idea it would become such a phenomenon? “No, and I’m not sure you’re supposed to,” says Doherty when we speak. She is chatty and down-to-earth, even in the year her career went stellar. As well as starring in A Thousand Blows, her role in Adolescence – as Briony Ariston, a psychologist – won her an Emmy for best supporting actress. “But you do know when you’re a part of something that’s good and deserves to be seen, and we knew that about it. I think because it came from such a genuine place, a place of real purity and rawness, it [fed into] the making of it. From day one, it had that electricity.”Doherty’s episode – like all of them, it was shot in one take – is the most tense and revealing of the four-part drama. Her character is interviewing Jamie, the 13-year-old accused of murder, in a detention centre, in order to prepare a report before his trial. Initially, she worried about who they could possibly cast as Jamie. “It was the biggest ask I’d ever read for a young person,” she says. “But the minute we got into the rehearsal room, Owen [Cooper] knew his lines, and he wasn’t daunted or fazed by any of it.”View image in fullscreen‘It had that electricity!’ … Doherty with Owen Cooper in Adolescence.Photograph: Ben Blackall/NetflixDespite the subject matter, it was a happy shoot. The writer, Jack Thorne (with whom Doherty had worked on one of her first jobs, the musical Junkyard), was “so collaborative, and very much: ‘This needs to feel as real and raw as possible, so if there’s anything that doesn’t sit right, let’s change it.’ He’s such an actor’s writer, which is just so freeing.”They rehearsed for two weeks, then filmed two takes a day over several days. There was some self-imposed pressure not to mess up a take, but Doherty’s theatre background proved to be ideal training. Two takes a day was enough, she says, “because of the nature of what [director] Philip Barantini wanted to capture. He wanted it to feel dangerous and organic. Any more than that, and you’d kill it.”Doherty called on her former therapist, whom she saw from around 2017 and only stopped seeing recently, to prepare for the role. “I’m such a big advocate for therapy. I’d had years of admiration for this way of communicating.” Often, she says, screen depictions of therapists are flat, simply there to further the plot and the main character. “I think there’s so much more to them. They’re so skilled to operate between these layers that are going on in any exchange. I wanted to bring that level of humanity to her.” Briony is professional, but she also wants Jamie to show some remorse, some sign that he isn’t irredeemable. “It was interesting to me to put that friction on screen, because otherwise, it’s just one kid in a room, up against this armoured being. Therapists have feelings, and they do battle with their own judgments, so I wanted her to be struggling with that and a genuine investment in this kid.”The 50 best TV shows of 2025: No 1 – AdolescenceRead moreThat Briony is disappointed by the end of their session is somewhat of an understatement, which brings us to the moment where Doherty is almost upstaged by a cheese and pickle sandwich. Earlier in their session, Briony gives Jamie half her sandwich; by the end, shaken, she is visibly repulsed by it, indented with his teeth marks. Her reaction wasn’t in the script, but on that final take, the tension had “built and built. It really did something to me.” Still, she says: “We didn’t place much importance on the sandwich.” She laughs, then in mock actorly reverence: “OK, this is The Sandwich Moment!” Once the show came out, she was intrigued there were so many theories. “I guess on any given interaction, there are many things at play, and it was lovely people were giving it that amount of time to go into the detail of what that represented.”Doherty grew up in Crawley, where her dad worked at Gatwick airport and her mum was a receptionist. Acting was all she ever wanted to do. “I didn’t want a plan B,” she says. “I was just: ‘I don’t know how I’m going to live my life without this thing.’” She was also a talented footballer, scouted to play for Chelsea before acting took over. When she watched England’s women’s team retain their European title, did she have a twinge of envy, and wish she’d chosen that other path? She laughs. “No, because I would be on the [subs] bench day in, day out. They are phenomenal. I just love that they’ve become such a part of our culture and ingrained in our world. That makes me so happy.” Anyway, at the age of 33, she would be eyeing retirement from football now, rather than her acting career moving into the premier league. “I know I made the right choice,” she says with a laugh. “I’d be knackered.”View image in fullscreenDoherty in A Thousand Blows.Photograph: Disney+Initially, Doherty was rejected from drama schools, but she persevered and got a place at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. Did she carry that sense of rejection – even impostor syndrome – into early jobs? “That was definitely a part of it,” she says. “But I think there’s something really helpful about rejection, and it is part of being an actor – you don’t get every job you want.” In the third and fourth seasons of The Crown, Doherty played Princess Anne – she was brilliant, easily as wonderful as Olivia Colman as the queen, and Helena Bonham Carter as Princess Margaret. “I spent so long just staring at these people being like, ‘Oh my God, you’re amazing’,” she says. This year, she says, has felt a bit more of a shift, with the success of Adolescence and A Thousand Blows. And next year, Doherty plays the lead in Hugo Blick’s BBC drama California Avenue, which also stars Bill Nighy and Bonham Carter again. “Maybe I do feel a little more settled. It’s been lovely going into jobs being more excited about collaborating and being creative, rather than, ‘Oh God, I really hope they don’t want to fire me’. That voice is getting quieter.”She says she has been “massively inspired” by Graham, as an actor and as a producer. “I think what he’s done with Hannah Walters is incredible, and also his relationship with Jack Thorne. If I could develop those relationships with writers and producers, and can be a part of making stories that [have been] under the radar, that would make me so happy.” She is, she says, “massively passionate about queer stories. That’s something that needs to be mined for more complexity. I also want to be led by what’s going on in the current culture and by what our reality is.”Doherty had experience of this before Adolescence, with last year’s playClosing Time, the final part of the Death of England trilogy (which began in 2014 as a Guardian-commissioned microplay), in which race, class and what it means to be British was explored, all performed on a stage resembling the St George’s cross. This was the summer that England flags appeared, amid a surge of rightwing support. “I wish we were doing [the play] now,” says Doherty. “I love period dramas, but there is something so necessary about putting on pieces of work that are culturally present.” It was an unnerving experience, she says of her role as Carly, “playing someone who didn’t think they were racist. I had to present as someone completely unaware of these things that they were saying, and my own true self was having to be squashed. I wasn’t in a great place after playing that character.” But it taught her, she says, that “you do have to get out of your own way and tell the stories that need to be told at that moment in time”.This was also the year Netflix’s “casual viewing” genre got more attention – the shows whose makers know audiences are only half-watching, their eyes also on their phone or something else, and so require simple plots and obvious exposition. Adolescence, with its real-time slowness, intense dialogue and brilliant performances, required concentration. As a huge hit, it shows audiences can be persuaded to put their phones away. Doherty hopes others will follow. “I hate the idea that [the distraction of phones] is going to be a component in a creative mind. That, to me, is like the death of art. So yes, I hope this flies the flag for having faith in our audiences. People don’t want to be spoon-fed and they don’t need to be. We’re way smarter than a lot of stuff out there thinks we are.”What does she hope is the lasting impact of Adolescence? “I hope that it continues to be talked about,” she says. “Without being a wanky actor, the dream is that you reach through the screen and you speak to people, and so I hope that people keep going back to it, and keep having those conversations.”A Thousand Blows is on Disney+ from 9 January.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Why is Westminster derailing our plans in Leeds?Thomas ForthA long-promised tram network has been pushed back to the late 2030s – unless we build local, northern growth will be snuffed outTue 23 Dec 2025 11.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 23 Dec 2025 11.52 ESTShare‘As an unabashed socialist, I am concerned with the distribution of wealth, but if you don’t create any in the first place it is a bit of an empty discussion.” For a decade I’ve repeated those words of Richard Leese, who was for 25 years the leader of Manchester city council, in policy discussions across northern England. I have never slammed them down while shouting, “This is what we believe” as Margaret Thatcher did with Friedrich Hayek’s The Constitution of Liberty, but I might start.Greater Manchester, a city region with a population of nearly three million people, generates far too little wealth to make its redistribution a meaningful discussion. Unusually for a rich country, the taxes raised in Greater Manchester, just as in other city regions such asWest Yorkshire, Merseyside and the West Midlands, do not meet the cost of providing local public services. Taxes raised in the south-east of England cover the gap.The legacy of Leese, his chief executive, Howard Bernstein, and many thousands of people they worked with was to help Manchester work towards paying its way. Since 2004, as far back as the data goes, Greater Manchester has hadthe highest productivity growthof any other big city region in England.Transport has been a huge factor in that success. Metrolink trams started running in 1992 and the system has grown to become the most-used such network in Britain. The newly integrated and locally controlled buses and trams of the Bee Network are building upon this, by bringing people back to public transport after four decades of decline since Thatcher’s disastrous deregulation. There is still a long way to go: the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, is working to add some rail services to the Bee Network by the end of next year and has longer-term ambitions to build some form of metro – the city is the largest in Europe without any such system.In West Yorkshire, our mayor is also bringing buses back into local control, starting in 2027. But beyond that we have much less to celebrate. As Metrolink trams started running in Manchester we were deep into planning a three-linesupertram systemof our own. The UK government provisionally approved the scheme and funding for itin 2001.In 2004, Leeds Supertram was paused. Alistair Darling, then transport secretary, demanded a smaller and cheaper scheme and when amended plans were submitted a year later, he cancelled the project. His suggested alternative was a “state-of-the-art bus system”. A proposal was developed locally, committed to with national funding in 2012, and then cancelledin 2016.View image in fullscreenLeeds central bus station in March 2024.Photograph: Gary Calton/The ObserverOther investments in our region have met the same fate. Labour’s 2010 HS2 plans included Leeds. George Osbornebacked them in 2014and added plans for “Northern Powerhouse Rail” from Liverpool to Hull via Bradford on a new high-speed line. Those ambitions are long gone. HS2 to Leeds was first delayed and thencancelled in 2021along with a new railway through Bradford.The apology to our two cities was a promise to build West Yorkshire mass transit, a tram system linking Leeds and Bradford. Now, after four years of studies and consultations, that scheme was this weekdelayed by at least three years. Trams will not run in Leeds or Bradford before the late 2030s. We are promised that this remains a delay and not a cancellation, but we have heard that many times before.Poor connectivity is holding back our cities and our region. Opportunities in fast-growing sectors of theLeedseconomy – such as financial and legal services, health technologies and data processing – are accessible to too few people, especially at the start of their careers when in-person interactions matter most. Businesses grow less quickly, create fewer great jobs and leave too many talented people underemployed.Cultural venues such as the Halifax Piece Hall and the magnificently refurbished Bradford Live struggle to attract big enough audiences to cover their costs, and spread less joy as a result.As a result of delays such as this week’s, every big city region in Britain except London is in thebottom third of European cities for productivity. If we cannot fix how we build, we have little hope of turning that around.To fix this, we must fix how Britain builds. The details will be complicated, but the guiding principle of the solution is stunningly simple. We need the British government, its experts, and our national institutions, overwhelmingly in London, to get out of the way.We have seen this work in Britain. Manchester’s Metrolink extension to its airport was delivered on budget and a year early because Whitehall handed over the cash and let the local team build. In France, where such schemes are funded through local taxes and national legal barriers to building are much lower, things work even better. French cities build transport schemes, with their own money raised through higher local taxes, overtwice as quickly and at below half the cost.We should all be concerned with the distribution of wealth, but we should be at least equally concerned with the infuriating and longstanding barriers to having more of it to distribute.Thomas Forth is a co-founder and the CTO of The Data City, a 35 person tech company in central LeedsExplore more on these topicsTransportOpinionWest YorkshireLeedsNorth of EnglandYorkshirecommentShareReuse this content"

We asked experts how to bring back partiesMadeleine AggelerTue 23 Dec 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 23 Dec 2025 12.10 ESTShareSeveral months ago, staring down another empty weekend, a friend texted me. “Why is no one having parties?” she fumed.Some people were, we agreed, but not nearly enough. Indeed, in January, the Atlantic’s Ellen Cushingdeclared that“America is in a party deficit”, quoting a 2023 Bureau of Labor Statistics report that found only 4.1% of Americans attended or hosted a social event on an average holiday weekend. That figure was down a whopping 35% since 2004.Maybe thepandemicis to blame. Or thelonelinessepidemic. Orsmartphones. I conducted an informal survey (texting my friends) and at least one thing was clear: hostingcan be intimidating. Some said it was too much work or too expensive. Others were worried no one would show up.“Hosting has become more complicated than it needs to be,” says Marina Birch, principal event architect at Birch Design Studio. The extravagant, artfully decorated events you see on Instagram look great, but a party doesn’t have to be so elaborate, aesthetic or expensive.“Hosting is really just about gathering people and making them feel comfortable,” Birch says. “When the focus shifts to how it looks instead of how it feels, it can feel overwhelming.”Below, experts share what you need to know to start hosting parties.Which elements should you consider?Begin with the scale of your party and the guest list. Is this an intimate dinner for your closest friends? Or a larger, rowdier gathering for a bigger group?Start with whatever makes you feel the most at ease, says Rachael Glaws, principal and creative director of RGI Events.“If it is your first foray into hosting a party, do it in a location where you’re going to feel comfortable, and with people you’re going to feel comfortable in front of,” she says.Once that’s settled, move on to logistics. Renee Patrone Rhinehart, CEO and founder of Events by Renee and Party Host Helpers, says essential details include:Timing:Daytime or night-time? How long will it last?Menu:Will there be food? If so, does that mean a sit-down dinner, only appetizers or a buffet? Will you have caterers? “Less is more when it comes to food,” Rhinehart says. “Keeping the menu simple yet delicious goes a long way.”Bar:If serving alcohol, which kinds? Which non-alcoholic beverages will you have available? Don’t skimp on ice, says Rhinehart: “You can never have enough!”Kids:Are they invited, or is it an adults-only affair?How do you host a party inexpensively?“Hosting well doesn’t have to mean spending a lot,” says Birch. She suggests focusing on a few things done thoughtfully. “Simple food that you love, candlelight, good music and a welcoming atmosphere can carry an entire evening,” she says.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’Good lighting is an affordable, often overlooked detail, Glaws agrees. Candlelight makes everyone look their best, she says: “They can totally transform a quick cocktail hour and make it feel polished, sophisticated, sexy and chic.”Limiting the bar is another easy way to save money. “If you’re trying to watch dollars, offer just beer and wine rather than liquor,” Glaws says. She usually offers two types of white wine and two types of red wine, so guests have options.What if you’re scared no one will show up?Give guests plenty of notice. Rhinehart suggests sending out invitations six weeks in advance, and sending periodic reminders.How you write your invitation also matters, says Birch. “When an invitation feels warm and intentional, guests sense that they’re truly wanted,” she says. “Be clear, be confident and invite people into a feeling rather than an event.”If it seems like a lot of people are bailing, expand your pool of guests, Rhinehart says: “Keep a B-list so if a lot of people cannot make it, you can extend your invitations to others.”How do you make a party fun?Don’t try to do too much, says Glaws: “We’re not all Martha Stewart.” If you prefer decorating to cooking, for example, focus your energy on tablescaping and pick up prepared dishes to serve.Get the cheap wine glasses: how to spend less on a dinner party in the US – and impress people moreRead more“If you try to do everything, you’re going to end up with a burnt turkey, flowers that don’t make it to the table and something on fire in the kitchen, and you won’t have any fun,” she says.Making sure you have fun goes a long way to making sure your guests have fun. “Guests relax when the host does,” says Birch.Finally, while it’s good to have a plan of attack, don’t make an event too rigid, says Glaws. “Guests appreciate having time to arrive, settle in and connect naturally,” she says. “Letting things unfold a bit on their own often creates a more relaxed and enjoyable evening.”Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyHow to startfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After an absolutely woeful attempt at a horror-movie cold open where it becomes clear that director/co-writer Tom Gormican hasn’t the merest glimmer of talent for establishing mood, building suspense or even properly unveiling a crazy creature, the movie settles in for the true mission of any great broad comedy: uh, building pathos? After years as an aspiring film-maker, Doug (Jack Black) is succeeding-yet-languishing in his compromised hometown job as a wedding videographer. Meanwhile, his childhood bestie, Griff (Paul Rudd), is following the dream by working as an actor out in Los Angeles, but only just barely. We see him fired from a one-line role on a medical show because of his nerves, in a scene written for nagging sympathy first and comedy a distant second.The Housemaid review – Sydney Sweeney takes the job from hell in outrageous suspense thrillerRead moreWhen the pair reunites for Doug’s birthday, Griff springs a post-party surprise: he has supposedly come into possession of remake rights to Anaconda, an eclectically cast creature feature that they loved as teenagers. Why not seize the opportunity by shooting their own version on a shoestring, and finally make movies together like they always dreamed? Despite a nagging feeling of responsibility to his family, Doug eventually warms to Griff’s idea, and their fellow friends Kenny (Steve Zahn) and Claire (Thandiwe Newton) join the crew. Soon they’re on a boat in the Amazon, dealing with eccentric snake handler Santiago (Selton Mello) and mysterious boat captain Ana (Daniela Melchior).At first, it’s pretty deflating to watch the naturally funny Black and Rudd (who have briefly shared the screen but never properly co-starred) do a poor-little-underdog-dreamers act. Shouldn’t these guys be satirizing Hollywood reboot ridiculousness, rather than cosplaying as humble regular folk who never really made it? But the best twist of Anaconda – and there are several dopey, half-assed ones – is that the sweetness of it lingers pleasantly, rather than thickening into treacle. Gormican works best in montage and when letting his stars bounce off each other, so the sequences of brainstorming, writing and prepping the team’s new take on a giant-snake movie (including Rudd and Black nodding thoughtfully about the topic of “themes”) loosen the movie up, bringing in much-needed laughs without sacrificing its essential good nature. Rudd can work wonders with affectations as small as Griff attempting to act cool with a toothpick in his mouth. Black is a little more subdued than usual, but can still summon his trademark mania when he speaks with great conviction about whether this new Anaconda is a reimagining or a “spiritual sequel”.Like Gormican’s previous film, the Nicolas Cage meta-comedy The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent, Anaconda sometimes mistakes self-awareness for cleverness – and sometimes mistakes simply showing up for self-awareness. While Rudd and Black land real laughs, the movie around them blows opportunities left and right, especially when attempting to figure out how to push the crew into greater danger as they encounter a bigger, scarier snake than the one they’re using for their film. In a bizarre waffle, Melchior’s badass character must appear alternately opaque and invisible to keep her plot options open; well into the movie, it’s nearly impossible to define her relationship with any other single member of the cast, not least because she seems to disappear and reappear at random (despite a chunk of the movie taking place on a small boat).Melchior probably suffers for her closer proximity to the movie’s occasional and appalling attempts to build genuine tension – moments that feel like hurried outlines of suspense sequences, more barely finished storyboards than fully executed scenes. Though the menacing snake is even bigger than before, with less janky CG than the 1997 version, this also denies any opportunity for animatronic-driven closeups that lend the earlier film a dash of retro charm in between the badly dated effects.Still, Rudd and Black make the new Anaconda easy enough to accept as a comedy with a dash of clunky effects-based creature action, rather than a full-blown horror-comedy. Intense fandom of the earlier film isn’t necessary to have a good-enough time at this one, and Gormican deserves some credit for smuggling a mid-2000s-style studio comedy back into theaters under the guise of IP (the universal desire for which also gets shouted out here, naturally). Anaconda never reaches the delirious heights of Steve Martin’s similarly themed comedy Bowfinger. But it shares more DNA with that movie than some silly giant snake.Anaconda is out in cinemas on 25 December in the US and on 26 December in the UK and AustraliaExplore more on these topicsComedy filmsJack BlackPaul RuddThandiwe NewtonComedyHorror filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

There is no indication of whether the woman was a victim of any crime, and Trump has consistently denied wrongdoing.Files featuring redactions that werefound to be removablethrough Photoshop techniques or simply highlighting text to paste into a word processing file.Mountbatten-Windsor has cut a largely secluded figure since it emerged in October that he was to bestripped of his royal titlesand would have to move out of his home at the Royal Lodge in Windsor.He has been dogged by allegations over his relationship with Epstein since 2011, when he accepted a downgrading of his role as a trade envoy months after coming under severe criticism over his ties to the billionaire. That came after an undated photo emerged showing him with his arm around the waist of Virginia Giuffre, then 17, with Maxwell beaming to one side.View image in fullscreenAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor and Ghislaine Maxwell in an image released by the US Department of Justice on 19 December.Photograph: US Justice Department/ReutersAmong the latest tranche of Epstein files are email exchanges in 2001 and 2002 between Maxwell, now serving a 20-year prison sentence forsex-trafficking crimes, and a correspondent who appears as “The Invisible Man” in the email thread, signs off as “A” and says he is writing from Balmoral, the royal residence in the Scottish Highlands.“Have you found me some new inappropriate friends?” says A in one email to Maxwell on 16 August 2001.Maxwell responded a day later, saying: “So sorry to disappoint you. However, the truth must be told. I have only been able to find appropriate friends.”The same email exchanges include mentions by A of leaving the “RN” in that year – an apparent reference to Andrew’s departure from the Royal Navy. They also refer to the death in August 2001 of the valet who had served him since he was a child.Later, in February and March 2002, there is an exchange in which Maxwell forwards correspondence with a third party, Juan Estaban Ganoza, about arrangements for a trip to Peru that include setting up meetings with “girls”. The forwarded message says: “I just gave Andrew your telephone no.” A replies: “I will ring him today if I can.”“About the girls … how old is he?” asks Ganoza. In the reply, A says: “I am overwhelmed at the kindness and generosity of the offers that are being made for me.”He adds: “As for girls well I leave that entirely to you and Juan Estoban!”Maxwell’s forwarded message also asked for help arranging “two-legged sight-seeing” with “intelligent pretty fun” girls from “good families” to make Andrew “very happy”. She added: “I know I can rely on you to show him a wonderful time and that you will only introduce him to friends that you can trust and rely on to be friendly and discreet and fun.”Photographs taken soon afterwards show Mountbatten-Windsor on an official visit to Peru.The latest releases are likely to reignite calls for Mountbatten-Windsor to assist with the attempts in the US to get justice for Epstein’s victims. They follow the release last week of photographs showing Andrew lying on the laps of women whose identities have been redacted at Sandringham, the royal estate in Norfolk, with Maxwell smiling in the background. There is no suggestion that the photograph is evidence of any crime.Keir Starmer last month increased the pressure on Mountbatten-Windsor to cooperate with a congressional investigation into Epstein, saying those who are caught up in child sexual offence cases should disclose any information they have.In Washington DC, the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, called on Tuesday for the US justice department to release details on “at least 10 potentialJeffrey Epsteinco-conspirators” it was looking at and why it did not prosecute.Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinAndrew Mountbatten-WindsorGhislaine MaxwellDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Bizarrely, the Tuesday release includes a letter purported to be from Epstein to the convicted sexual abuser and former Olympics gymnastics coach Larry Nassar – which the DoJ later in the dayannounced was a fake.The numerous references to Trump include an email that suggests he travelled onboard Epstein’s private jet with women who would have been possible witnesses to the case against Epstein’s accomplice,Ghislaine Maxwell.The email – sent by the US attorney for the southern district of New York on 7 January 2020 – has the subject “Epstein flight records”.It reads: “For your situational awareness, wanted to let you know that the flight records we received yesterday reflect that Donald Trump travelled on Epstein’s private jet many more times than previously has been reported (or that we were aware), including during the period we would expect to charge in a Maxwell case.“In particular, he is listed as a passenger on at least eight flights between 1993 and 1996, including at least four flights on which Maxwell was also present. He is listed as having travelled with, among others and at various times, Marla Maples, his daughter Tiffany, and his son Eric.“On one flight in 1993, he and Epstein are the only two listed passengers; on another, the only three passengers are Epstein, Trump, and then-20-year-old REDACTED.“On two other flights, two of the passengers, respectively, were women who would be possible witnesses in a [Ghislaine] Maxwell case.”Throughout his most recent presidential campaign, Trump vowed to release Epstein-related files. This summer, his administration prompted backlash after the justice department announced it would not release any files related to the late financier, and said it had found “no incriminating client list” despite earlier claims from Pam Bondi, the attorney general, that such a document was sitting on her desk.The announcement sparked bipartisan outrage – including from some Trump supporters – and reignited scrutiny of Epstein’s past ties to Trump, with whom he was friendly for at least 15 years before falling out in 2004. The president has consistently denied any knowledge of or involvement in Epstein’s criminal activities and has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.On Tuesday, the justice departmentsaid in a statementthat it had released nearly 30,000 more pages of documents related to Epstein and that “some of these documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election”.“To be clear: the claims are unfounded and false, and if they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already,” the statement reads. “Nevertheless, out of our commitment to the law and transparency, the DoJ is releasing these documents with the legally required protections for Epstein’s victims.”Epstein was founddead in his cell on 10 August 2019while awaiting trial on federal sex crimes charges in New York. The death wasruled a suicide.In the newbatch of filesof files released by the justice department, there are alsonumerous referencesto Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew.The files also include a photo of an Austrian passport that bears Epstein’s photograph but the name listed is “Marius Fortelni” and the residency is listed as Saudi Arabia. There is also an email exchange from a prosecutor in 2019, which states that the real Fortelni is a real estate developer who, for a time, resided in Saudi Arabia. The email suggests contacting Fortelni.“Ask if he has any reason to know why a passport from his native country with his name on it would have Jeffrey Epstein’s photograph on it and be in a safe in Epstein’s mansion??” the prosecutor writes.In a response email, someone with the “NYPD/FBI Child Exploitation Human Trafficking Task Force” writes: “I will give him a call tomorrow.”Fortelni did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Guardian.Elsewhere in the tranche is extensive correspondence regarding Epstein’s controversial 2007 Florida plea deal to resolve a pending sex crimes prosecution under federal law and the government’s obligation to inform Epstein’s accusers of the deal before its completion.One email, subject titled “RE: Special Master’s Selection of Attorney Representative” and dated 19 October 2007, appears to refer to rape claims lodged by a woman against the magician David Copperfield. The Guardian has previously identified the alleged victim asLacey Carroll. Copperfield claimed in an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2012 that he had been “exonerated” by federal authorities.The email refers to a raid by FBI Seattle and FBI Las Vegas “on a warehouse owned by Epstein’s favorite cohort, David Copperfield, in connection with allegations that Copperfield raped an adult female”.“Copperfield spoke with the girls at Epstein’s home on several occasions and tickets with ‘backstage passes’ were a favorite ‘birthday gift’ for Epstein to give the girls,” it says. The sender and recipient are redacted.Later on Tuesday, the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, released a statement demanding transparency from the justice department: “Buried in the Epstein files is an email disclosing the Department of Justice was looking into at least ten potential Jeffrey Epstein co-conspirators. The Department of Justice needs to shed more light on who was on the list, how they were involved, and why they chose not to prosecute. Protecting possible co-conspirators is not the transparency the American people and Congress are demanding.”Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinDonald TrumpGhislaine MaxwellUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

In October, he said of claims about his links with Epstein: “I vigorously deny the accusations against me.”16 August 2001 |From: ‘The Invisible Man’“I am up here at Balmoral Summer Camp for the Royal Family. Activities take place all day and I am totally exhausted at the end of each day. The Girls are completely shattered and I will have to give them an early night today as it is getting tiring splitting them up all the time! How’s LA? Have you found me some new inappropriate friends?”Newspaper reports from the time record that Mountbatten-Windsor did indeed visit Balmoral, the royal family’s Scottish estate, in August 2001. One names him as being at the estate with his daughters, Beatrice and Eugenie, where they had breakfast with the queen and Prince Philip when there was a “fire scare” as a nurse making Princess Margaret’s breakfast burnt a slice of toast.Beatrice and Eugenie would have been aged 13 and 11 that Summer.18 August 2001 |From: ‘The Invisible Man’“Distraught! You probably wouldn’t know but I lost my valet on Thursday.“He died in his sleep. He had been with me since I was 2. I am a little off balance as not only has my office been restructured, I have left the RN and now my whole life is in turmoil as I have no one to look after me. He was a real rock and almost a part of the family.”The use of “RN” appears to be a reference to the Royal Navy, which the then Duke of Yorkleft in July 2001after 22 years in the service.Reports from 2001 record that Mountbatten-Windsor’s valet, Michael Perry, 61, died days before the email was sent. A report in the Daily Mirror said the then prince and his brother Prince Edward were said to be “devastated” at the death of Perry “who has worked for them since they were children.”It added: “Andrew is on holiday at Balmoral. An aide said: ‘He is very, very upset.’”Maxwell responded in an email which appeared to refer to the request days earlier by “A” for “inappropriate friends” telling him: “So sorry to disappoint you. However, the truth must be told. I have only been able to find appropriate friends.”28 February 2002 |From: ‘The Invisible Man’“As for girls well I leave that entirely to you and Juan Estoban!” I am going to have more time after tomorrow to know what will happen and when in Peru so I will be in touch again on Friday.”This was a response from “A” after Maxwell forwarded messages from someone referred to as Juan Estoban Ganoza, outlining possible activities on a visit to Peru, including visiting the Nazca Lines.Mountbatten-Windsor, then still a working royal and UK trade envoy, did visit Peru in March 2002, with photographs recording him being in locations including Lima.3 March 2002 |From: Ghislaine Maxwell“I just gave Andrew your telephone no. He is interested in seeing the Nazca Lines. He can ride but it is not his favorite sport ie pass on the horses. Some sight seeing some 2 legged sight seeing (read intelligent pretty fun and from good families) and he will be very happy. I know I can rely on you to show him a wonderful time and that you will only introduce him to friends that you can trust and rely on to be friendly and discreet and fun. He does not want to read about any trip in the papers whom or what he saw.”A message apparently forwarded after it had been sent by Maxwell to the individual known as Juan Estoban Ganoza, this email is the only time that the name “Andrew” is directly used. In reply to the forwarded message “A” appears to recognise the sentence as a reference to him, saying: “I will ring him today if I can.”Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinAndrew Mountbatten-WindsorGhislaine MaxwellexplainersShareReuse this content"

We shared one thing … our love & caring for young ladies and the hope they reach their full potential.”It continued: “Our president also shares our love of young, nubile girls. When a young beauty walked by he loved to ‘grab snatch’, whereas we ended up snatching grub in the mess halls of the system.”The letter was signed: “Life is unfair. Yours, J. Epstein.”On Tuesday afternoon the DoJposted on X: “The FBI has confirmed this alleged letter from Jeffrey Epstein to Larry Nassar is FAKE.”The post went on to list why the letter was not deemed genuine by the authorities and added: “This fake letter serves as a reminder that just because a document is released by the Department of Justice does not make the allegations or claims within the document factual. Nevertheless, the DOJ will continue to release all material required by law.”Donald Trump, who was president at the time the supposed letter from Epstein was apparently sent, has repeatedly denied any knowledge of or involvement in Epstein’s criminal activities and any wrongdoing.The existence of the letter was first reported in 2023 bythe Associated Pressafter it was discovered in the midst of more than 4,000 pages ofdocumentsheld by the Bureau of Prisons.The letter is postmarked 13 August 2019, notably three days after Epstein died in custody in what was ruled a suicide. It was found by investigators in the jail mail room weeks later after it was returned from a prison in Arizona and marked “no longer at this address”.“It appeared he mailed it out and it was returned back to him,” the investigator told a prison official in an email included in the documents. “I am not sure if I should open it or should we hand it over to anyone?It is unclear if Epstein and Nassar had any relationship.Nassar, the former doctor for the US gymnastics team and Michigan State University, is currently serving a 60-year federal sentence on charges of child sexual abuse images. He was also sentenced in 2018 to a 40-to-175 Michigan state sentence after pleading guilty to seven counts of criminal sexual conduct.At trial, more than 150 women – including Olympic gold medalists Aly Raisman and McKayla Maroney – saidhe sexually abused them.The document comes as questions continue to swirl around Epstein’s death in custody, with his brother, Mark Epstein, continuing to maintain that the sex offender was murdered in his cell.It has also been suggested that Epstein blamed his former friend Donald Trump for his 2019 arrest on sex-trafficking charges, which came more than a decade after he was granted immunity from prosecution under a 2007 Florida state plea deal where he pleaded guilty to solicitation of a minor.In a statement from the Department of Justice about the release of the latest tranche of Epstein-related documents, itsaid: “Some of these documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election. To be clear: the claims are unfounded and false, and if they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already. Nevertheless, out of our commitment to the law and transparency, the DOJ is releasing these documents with the legally required protections for Epstein’s victims.”Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinDonald TrumpGymnasticsnewsShareReuse this content"

However, he appears as a full executor in later versions, dated 2013 and 2014. Summers is also named in the 2014 will as a successor executor, the filings show.Neither Summers nor Staley are in what appears to be the final version of Epstein’s will in 2019.

While an executor is responsible for executing a plan laid out in a will, a trustee is responsible for managing and distributing assets.The Financial Conduct Authority’s original investigation, triggered by a cache of more than 1,200 emails between Staley and Epstein, concluded that the pair were“indeed close”and had a relationship that “went beyond one that was professional in nature”.Staleystepped downas Barclays chief executive in 2021 after the FCA’s investigation became public and he was banned from the UK financial sector in 2023.A spokesperson for Summers said: “Mr Summers had absolutely no knowledge that he was included in an early version of Epstein’s will and had no involvement in his financial matters or the administration of his estate.”The Guardian approached representatives for Staley for comment.Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinJes StaleyLarry SummersBarclaysnewsShareReuse this content"

They planned a marauding attack inGreater Manchester, at the heart of one of Europe’s largest Jewish communities, having answered an Islamic State “call to arms” issued after the outbreak of war in Gaza.Saadaoui arranged for the purchase and delivery of semi-automatic rifles, conducted reconnaissance and identified targets, but the man supplying them with the weapons was an undercover operative.The operative, known to them as Farouk, had infiltrated jihadist social media networks and convinced Saadaoui that he was a fellow extremist.Saadaoui, a former Italian restaurant owner, was arrested in a police sting as he attempted to take possession of two assault rifles, a semi-automatic pistol and almost 200 rounds of ammunition at the car park of the Last Drop hotel in Bolton on 8 May 2024.The weapons were of the type used in Paris on 13 November 2015, when 130 people were killed and hundreds injured in a series of terrorist attacks.A third defendant, Walid’s brother Bilel Saadaoui, 36, who worked in a discount shop, was found guilty of failing to disclose information about acts of terrorism on the same dates.Walid Saadaoui, of Abram, Wigan, Bilel Saadaoui, of Hindley, Wigan, and Hussein, of no fixed abode, denied the allegations in a trial lasting almost three months.The Saadaoui brothers, who are originally from Tunisia and had been living in the UK for several years legally, swore allegiance to Islamic State before coming to the country. Hussein, who had also sworn allegiance to Islamic State and is understood to have been living in the UK legally, had served in Saddam Hussein’s army.Walid Saadaoui had spoken of his connections to Islamic State to “Farouk”, telling him: “I am liaising with brothers who are insiders and are operatives, and God is my witness, they are not just brothers on Facebook, they worked with me three days and we got know each other well and they had to speak to three other people to verify me, they asked me questions about creed for three days and I spoke to them on the phone.“They explain to me the best method of conducting the operations. If we carry out the operation in winter I will be a failure, it is better to carry out the operation in the summer … in the winter everybody is at home.”After the verdicts, the chief constable of Greater Manchester police, Stephen Watson, thanked officers and prosecutors for having “meticulously delivered upon an operation of almost unprecedented complexity”.“It was clear throughout this trial that the scale of the offender’s hatred towards our Jewish community knew no bounds,” he said. “All too recently in Sydney, and of course here in Manchester in October – the very week before this trial began – we have felt the devastation of terrorism directed toward our Jewish community. A terrorist attack upon our Jewish friends and neighbours is an attack on us all and is an affront to all decent people in our country.”The force’s assistant chief constable, Robert Potts, said the attack “could have been the deadliest terrorist attack in UK history” and that it had been necessary for the investigation to continue to the point where officers were satisfied they had enough evidence to get the most serious charges authorised.“There was very real risk and danger for Farouk, who undoubtedly saved lives,” he said. “I cannot overemphasise his courage, bravery and professionalism in the role that he played.”The head of the Crown Prosecution Service’s special crime and counter-terrorism division, Frank Ferguson, said: “The investigation and prosecution deployed a highly trained witness who made sure their plot did not succeed and secured valuable evidence directly from the mouths of the terrorists.“They laid bare their intention to destroy lives, their long-held attitudes and beliefs as well as their credentials” in terms of Islamic State.Explore more on these topicsCrimeGreater ManchesterIslamic StateEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Above the £1m threshold, inherited farmland was to have been taxed at 20%, half the standard inheritance tax rate, in a move initially estimated to raise £520m annually by 2029.Rachel Reeves hands farmers inheritance tax breakRead moreThe announcement was labelled a “family farm tax” by critics andtriggered protests around the UK, with farmers arguing it would prevent many of them from passing on their farms to their children.The reversal follows intensive behind-the-scenes efforts from a group ofLabourMPs who had been pushing for the threshold to be changed, and who made their case to Treasury and environment ministers as well as Keir Starmer.The prime minister conceded at a select committee hearing last week that he had been told of terminally ill farmers planning to kill themselves to avoid the tax.Downing Street sources indicated that a number of backbenchers had “built a strong evidence base” and argued privately against the tax, including Starmer’s parliamentary private secretary, Jon Pearce.Nearly a dozen MPs were involved, including the MP for Peterborough, Andrew Pakes; the MP for Aylesbury, Laura Kyrke-Smith; the MP for Buckingham and Bletchley, Callum Anderson; the MP for Hitchin, Alistair Strathern; and the MP for Hastings and Rye, Helena Dollimore.Markus Campbell-Savours, a Labour MP who represents the rural Cumbrian seat of Penrith and Solway, was suspended from the party earlier this month for voting against the tax.A government source said there was no change in Campbell-Savours’ suspension and that he had been disciplined for voting against a budget resolution.In a statement announcing the U-turn, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said ministers had “listened to concerns of the farming community and businesses about the reforms”.Raising the threshold will mean fewer farms will face inheritance tax – a government source said 85% would not pay the levy at all, up from 75%. According to official figures, the number of estates affected next year will be 185, down from 375.Until now, ministers had claimed the £1m threshold would only affect very wealthy farmers who were buying up agricultural land to avoid paying inheritance tax.The climbdown is the latest policy U-turn by Reeves. The government previously abandoned plans toaxe winter fuel allowance for most pensionersand ditched mooted cuts to disability benefits after a parliamentary backlash.The change means married couples with estates of up to £5m will now pay no inheritance tax on them, as they can combine two £2.5m allowances. It will cost the exchequer £130m, meaning the changes are still expected to raise nearly £300m a year.The environment secretary, Emma Reynolds, said: “We have listened closely to farmers across the country and we are making changes today to protect more ordinary family farms.“It’s only right that larger estates contribute more, while we back the farms and trading businesses that are the backbone of Britain’s rural communities.”Hen cages and pig farrowing crates to be outlawed in EnglandRead moreThe National Farmers’ Union president, Tom Bradshaw, hailed the announcement as a “huge relief to many” that would greatly reduce the tax burden for many family farms.“I am thankful common sense has prevailed and government has listened. I have had two very constructive meetings with prime minister Sir Keir Starmer and dozens of conversations with Defra secretary of state Emma Reynolds. She has played a key role underlining the human impact of this tax.“These conversations have led to today’s changes which were so desperately needed. From the start, the government said it was trying to protect the family farm and the change announced today brings this much closer to reality for many.”The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, said the change was a big win for the Tories’ campaign against the tax.“Earlier this year, I was told to drop our campaign, that there weren’t many votes in it, there weren’t many farmers, and people assumed they were wealthy enough to cope anyway. I ignored the advice and kept campaigning,” she said. “Farmers are exactly the kind of people Conservatives stand up for.”The Liberal Democrats urged ministers to go further and scrap inheritance tax on farms entirely. Reform UK’s deputy leader, Richard Tice, said the concession was better than nothing but also called for the tax to be abolished.The Labour Rural Research Group, which represents Labour MPs in rural seats, welcomed the announcement. Jenny Riddell-Carpenter, the MP for Suffolk Coastal and the group’s chair, said it meant “fewer families facing impossible choices, and greater certainty that farms can continue to operate, invest, and contribute to our rural economy”.Explore more on these topicsTax and spendingLabourFarmingInheritance taxnewsShareReuse this content"

Both detainees are being held on remand at HMP Bronzefield in Surrey.It comes after allegations that Zuhrah was refused an ambulance for more than 18 hours at HMP Bronzefield, which led to a protest outside the prison last week, which the Coventry South MP Zarah Sultana attended. Ministry of Justice officials have previously disputed claims of mistreatment.Four other detainees, Kamran Ahmed, Heba Muraisi, Teuta Hoxha and Lewie Chiaramello, remain on hunger strike, Prisoners for Palestine said.Zuhrah, 20, said on Tuesday: “To our government, do not release your breath, because we will certainly return to battle you with our empty stomachs in the New Year, when you have shamefully returned from your blood-soaked break, to the theatrics of your ‘democracy’.“Our demands however remain inescapable, and this pause is your chance to meet them, to get it right, to stop arming and aiding this genocide, otherwise you will force us to return to confront you with our breaths, which will be far more disastrous and dangerous than this first time.”Gib, 30, said: “We have never trusted the government with our lives, and we will not start now. There will be no turkey dinner and break in the Zionist programme of genocide.“We are committed to the resistance of their script, not until Christmas, but for the rest of our lives … we will be the ones to decide how we give our lives to justice and liberation.”The remaining hunger strikers released a new set of demands on Tuesday, including that Muraisi, who is being held at HMP New Hall in West Yorkshire, be transferred back to HMP Bronzefield where she was initially detained.A spokesperson for Prisoners for Palestine said: “The remaining four will continue to refuse food on the basis of the five demands, as well as specifying their demands to include the end of all non association orders between prisoners; Heba’s transfer back to HMP Bronzefield; and the same access to all courses and activities as sentenced prisoners.“Non association orders are used to further isolate prisoners from each other despite being in the same prison; just as Heba has been moved across the country, away from her family and friends in London.“Due to the extended period of time on remand, well over the usual six month legal limit, it is only fair that the prisoners are able to access the same activities as everyone else.”Earlier this month, Jon Cink and Umer Khalid ended their 41-day and 13-day hunger strikes for health reasons. The pair were admitted to hospital and have since been discharged back to prison.Lord Timpson, minister for prisons, probation and reducing reoffending, said in a statement: “While very concerning, hunger strikes are not a new issue for our prisons. Over the last five years, we’ve averaged over 200 a year and we have longstanding procedures in place to ensure prisoner safety.“Prison healthcare teams provide NHS care and continuously monitor the situation. HM Prison and Probation Service are clear that claims that hospital care is being refused are entirely misleading – they will always be taken when needed and a number of these prisoners have already been treated in hospital.“These prisoners are charged with serious offences including aggravated burglary and criminal damage. Remand decisions are for independent judges, and lawyers can make representations to the court on behalf of their clients.“Ministers will not meet with them – we have a justice system that is based on the separation of powers, and the independent judiciary is the cornerstone of our system. It would be entirely unconstitutional and inappropriate for ministers to intervene in ongoing legal cases.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The latter three cases are alleged to have happened in the Westminster area of London.This year, the BBC apologised to staff after an internal investigation found a number of individuals had concerns about the presenter, who had shows on Radio 2 and 6 Music between 2006 and 2008, but they felt unable to raise them because they thought he “would always get his own way”.The BBC review looked into allegations he had urinated “into cups or bottles while in the studio, throwing objects, allegations of sex on the premises including with competition winners, and exposure while in the studio in front of staff and guests”, as well as comments he made on air, which were featured in the Dispatches and Sunday Times investigation.Channel 4 and the television production company Banijay also looked into his conduct while he was working for them. Banijay found concerns about Brand’s behaviour were “not properly escalated or adequately addressed”, while Channel 4 found “no evidence” anyone was aware of accusations about him.Brand, who now lives in Oxfordshire, was born in Essex and made a name as a standup comedian, later becoming the host of Big Brother’s Big Mouth and starring in Hollywood films such as St Trinian’s and Get Him to the Greek.Since the allegations came to light, Brand has reinvented himself as an alternative Christian wellness influencer and built a large YouTube following, particularly among the alt-right.He has not commented on the new charges but previously said he had been a sex addict when he was younger but “what I never was, was a rapist”.Including the additional charges brought on Tuesday, the alleged offences relate to six women.Brand will appear at Westminster magistrates court on 20 January to answer to the two additional charges. He faces trial for the original five charges, which is due to begin on 16 June next year at Southwark crown court.DCI Tariq Farooqi from the Metropolitan police, who is leading the investigation, said: “The women who have made reports, including those connected to the two new charges, continue to receive support from specially trained officers.“The Met’s investigation remains ongoing, and detectives urge anyone affected by this case, or anyone with information, to come forward and speak with police. A dedicated team of investigators can be reached via email at CIT@met.police.uk.“Support is also available through the independent charity Rape Crisis by contacting the 24/7 rape and sexual abuse support line.”Speaking after he was charged in April, Brand said: “What I never was, was a rapist. I’ve never engaged in non-consensual activity.”He added: “I’m now going to have the opportunity to defend these charges in court and I’m incredibly grateful for that.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Hastings residents were left without water for four days in May 2024 after a pipe, which was flagged for replacement in 2007 but never fixed, burst. Multiple pipes in the Hastings area have previously been listed by the company as “aged assets prone to failure”.Helena Dollimore, the Labour MP for Hastings, Rye and the Villages, said: “I’m deeply frustrated that Hastings is once again paying the price for Southern Water’s failures. A burst pipe has left our town with a limited water supply and this means there could be an outage tomorrow. My immediate priority is protecting residents, particularly the most vulnerable, and supporting local businesses at this critical time.“I’ve pressed Southern Water to act fast to open as many water stations as possible, deliver directly to those on the priority services list, and provide extra water to pubs, restaurants and hotels. I will be holding Southern Water to account and asking the questions that need to be asked, but right now my focus is on ensuring everyone has access to the water they need and limiting the impact of this.”Dollimore haspreviously criticisedthe company for paying large dividends to its shareholders rather than investing in its crumbling infrastructure.Southern Water recently came under fire after a failure at one of its treatment centres caused a spill ofhundreds of millions of tiny plastic beadson Camber Sands and Hastings beaches.Its managing director for water, Tim McMahon, said: “We are taking these measures as a precaution against a worst case scenario and impact on supply tomorrow evening. Our teams will fix the burst main as quickly as possible.“While we work to protect supply to homes and businesses in Hastings, we would ask customers please not to use more water than usual, and not to stockpile mains water, as this will make the situation worse. Thank you for your understanding as we fix the issue.”Explore more on these topicsEast SussexWater industrynewsShareReuse this content"

She said there was as yet no indication of what caused the embankment, which had been inspected last month, to collapse.“At this point in time, we don’t have anything that is telling us, ‘Oh, it’s clearly was that’,” she said.“Canals are old, you know, and they need a lot of care and maintenance. We inspect them regularly. We have some embankments that we are monitoring and more concerned about. And we inspect more frequently. This isn’t one of the ones that we were concerned about.“Fortunately, it’s very rare. And obviously, you know, we do everything we can to make sure the network is stable and safe.”The CRT’s on-site team were installing fabric dams either side of the breach and a pipe to carry water across on Tuesday, so that parts of the canal downstream could be refilled and about half a dozen stranded boats refloated.The boats at the bottom of the hole are not on flat ground and were probably damaged, although they have not been closely inspected, Sharman said. The section of embankment that had collapsed had been between 3 and 5 metres high.Scientists suggested the collapse could have been caused by high water levels and the ingress of water into the earth works holding the canal at its artificial elevation, destabilising them.View image in fullscreenThe scene on the Llangollen canal at Whitchurch after the collapse of the embankment on Monday.Photograph: Shropshire Fire and Rescue Service/AFP/Getty ImagesDr Jamie Pringle, a reader in forensic geosciences at Keele University, said bedrock in the area contained large amounts of salt, “which of course is soluble”.“That part of the Llangollen canal has Triassic Wilkesley halite and mudstone, so soluble rock, hence why they initially thought collapse was due to a sinkhole, I think,” he said.The Llangollen canal was among those the Inland Waterways Association flagged this year as being an amber risk, but its director of campaigns, Charlie Norman, said the designation was the result of lack of funding rather than structural issues.But they pointed out that the last major canal collapse in the UK happened at a similar time of year after a period of wet weather. The Bridgewater canal embankment at Dunham Masseycollapsed on New Year’s Day. It was also said to have been well maintained and not thought to be at immediate risk.“The year is ending as it began, with major incidents on our waterways, and without decisive action these breaches will keep repeating,” Norman said. “Maintenance alone isn’t enough. This canal is a vital piece of national water infrastructure. Every failure shuts down the connected system, disrupting water supplies and local economies and in some cases leaving people homeless.“That’s why IWA hasmapped the risksacross our 5,000-mile network, and this year has shown those risks are growing. It’s fortunate no one was injured here, but a multi-agency investigation is essential.”Sharman said she hoped the operation to refill the canal either side of the breach would begin soon. “I’m really hopeful that we’re going to get the boats floated tomorrow evening, if not maybe the day after, Christmas day,” she said.But a full repair of the damaged section of canal would take most of next year. “It’ll probably take six to nine months and probably a couple of million pounds to get this embankment rebuilt and the canal reopened,” she said.She also said the CRT was trying to support the boaters rendered suddenly homeless on the eve of Christmas. “Our hearts go out to those people and we’re trying to take care of them best they can,” she said.“This is very rare. We don’t want people to worry, but it’s very difficult experience for those people who’ve been right in the middle of it.”Peter Styles, a fomer president of the Geological Society of London, also visited the site and confirmed that the incident had been caused by the collapse of one section which was 200 year old. “It will take some fixing.”Explore more on these topicsShropshireRiversWater transportEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

More than 100 townships, including the commercial capital of Yangon, will vote in this first phase of the elections, followed by another 100 in the second phase on 11 January. The details of a possible third phase are yet to be announced.Who is running?There will be 57 parties on the ballot on Sunday, but the majority are perceived as being linked to or dependent on the military. Only six parties are running nationwide, with the rest only running in a single state or region. The military-backed Union Solidarity and Development party has fielded the largest number of candidates and is in effect running uncontested in dozens of constituencies.View image in fullscreenAn election campaign billboard for the Union Solidarity and Development party in Shan state.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesThe party ofAung San Suu Kyi, which won a landslide victory in the 2020 election but was ousted in the 2021 coup, will not be running. Her National League for Democracywas dissolvedafter it refused to comply with a demand to register with the junta-backed Union Election Commission. Dozens of ethnic parties were also dissolved.According to election monitoring group Anfrel, 57% of the parties that ran in the 2020 general election no longer exist, even though they received more than 70% of votes and 90% of seats.So is the election free and fair?Several countries, the United Nations, and rights groups have described the elections as a sham designed to keep Myanmar’s ruling generals in power through proxies, although the junta insists the polls have public support.The elections will be held amid araging civil war, triggered by the coup which ousted Aung San Suu Kyi’s government and ushered in the military junta. Voting will not take place in rebel-held areas, which cover large swaths of the country.Meanwhile, the junta has arrested more than 200 people for violating draconian legislation forbidding “disruption” of the poll, including protest or criticism on social media. Those convicted of breaking the law can face punishments ranging from three years in prison to the death penalty.View image in fullscreenA man holds an election campaign pamphlet at a  event ahead in the northern town of Nawnghkio.Photograph: Sai Aung Main/AFP/Getty ImagesThe law has been used against young people putting up boycott stickers, film directors and artists who posted reactions on social media, and to charge journalists, according to rights groups.The military government has dismissed international criticism, with a spokesperson for the military government saying Myanmar will “continue to pursue our original objective of returning to a multiparty democratic system”.Which countries are supporting the vote and why?Myanmar’s biggest ally and northern neighbour China has thrown its support behind the junta, and its decision to hold elections. Analysts say that China views the vote as the country’s best path back to stability.Many western governments consider the vote a sham. UN human rights chief, Volker Türk, said this week that the elections were taking place in an atmosphere of “violence and repression” and that military authorities “must stop using brutal violence to compel people to vote, and stop arresting people for expressing any dissenting views”.The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said in October the US was still formulating its policy on Myanmar. The US has previously been a strong critic of the junta, though earlier this year it lifted sanctions designations on several military allies. In November the US Department of Homeland Security said there had been improvements in governance in Myanmar, and cited the election as justification for removingtemporary protected status for Myanmar nationals– an assessment rights groups have strongly disputed.Lashing back at foreign criticism of the poll last week, the junta spokesperson Zaw Min Tun told reporters: “It is not being held for the international community.”What about Aung San Suu Kyi?Myanmar’s former de facto leader has been siloed in military detention since the 2021 coup, but her absence looms large over the elections.View image in fullscreenMyanmar protesters living in Japan hold a rally to call for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi.Photograph: Issei Kato/ReutersAung San Suu Kyi’s reputation abroad is heavily tarnished over her government’s handling of theRohingya crisis. But for her many followers in Myanmar her name is still a byword for democracy, her absence on the ballot an indictment it will be neither free nor fair.She is serving a 27-year sentence for offences ranging from corruption to breaching Covid-19 restrictions, charges which rights groups dismiss as politically motivated. Little has been seen or heard of her since her arrest andconcerns over her health in custodyhave been raised by her family and supporters.“I don’t think she would consider these elections to be meaningful in any way,” her son Kim Aris said from his home in Britain.Explore more on these topicsMyanmarMyanmar coupAung San Suu KyiSouth and central AsiaexplainersShareReuse this content"

His most recent book, Here Comes the Sun, takes a look at the soaring potential of renewable energyIs your latest book a more optimistic take on this world?Optimism may not be exactly the right word. The things that we were warning about in The End of Nature almost 40 years ago have happened. The planet is now warming fast. The scientists were absolutely right. We face an endless series of disasters that will get worse. This is the main legacy of our moment on Earth so far.But as of the last three or four years, we finally have a tool, not at this point tostopglobal warming – it’s too late for that – but perhaps to at least shave some tenths of a degree off how hot the planet gets. And that tool is cheap energy from the sun and the wind and the batteries to store that power when the sun goes down or the wind drops. Alternative energy is the commonsense, obvious, straightforward way to make power on this planet, which is why 95% of new generating capacity around planet Earth last year came from these clean sources.View image in fullscreenBill McKibben in 2014.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianWhat inspired you to write this book?Mostly because I felt like I had a scoop. I’m an old journalist at heart. I do this newsletter every week on Substack calledThe Crucial Years, which, I think because it’s free, has turned into the largest newsletter of its kind around climate and energy and the environment. It means that I get to keep track of all the things that are happening on a weekly basis around the world.About 36 months ago, if you were paying attention, you couldn’t help but notice this sudden spike beginning. We’d finally hit the steep part of the S curve. All of a sudden there were stories coming in from around the world, especially, it must be said, China, which is providing the leadership here, and which is doing things on an almost inconceivable scale. In May, the Chinese were building three gigawatts of solar panels a day. A gigawatt is the rough equivalent of a big coal-fired power plant. They were putting up one of those out of solar panels every eight hours. This is like building the pyramids or something, the scale at which this is going on.There are similar stories from many corners of the world, and they just keep coming. In Australia, they’ve built so much solar power that the government has now decided that electricity will be free for all Australians for three hours every afternoon. Human beings for 700,000 years have worked hard to get energy for our lives, if it meant collecting firewood, if it meant paying your electric bill. Now you don’t have to do that any more, at least if you’re in a place that’s had the foresight to build the solar panels and the wind turbines.View image in fullscreenSolar panels on homes in Springfield, west of Brisbane, Australia.Photograph: Darren England/AAPHow will a transition to solar power address global inequality and the disparities that exist in the developing world, in parts of our country as well, many of which came to be because of the fossil fuel industry?As long as you rely on a source of power that’s only available in a few places, the people who control those places will end up with inordinate wealth and power. John D Rockefeller, the first plutocrat, was the first guy to recognise that. His heirs include Vladimir Putin, who’s using his winnings to run a land war in Europe. They include the Koch brothers, our biggest oil and gas refiners and pipeline suppliers, who use their winnings to systematically undermine our democracy. They include the king of Saudi Arabia, who likes to cut up journalists like you and me with saws.We could have owned these technologies, and instead we’ve just ceded them to our theoretical main rival on this planetThe world on the other side of this is very different, because there’s sun and wind everywhere, for everyone, and it works best toward the equator. So this is perhaps even a way to start rebalancing a little bit of this north-south division. If you’re in the 80% of humanity that lives in countries that have to import fossil fuel, this couldn’t be really better news, because once you’ve paid the money to build your solar panel or your wind turbine, then you no longer have to come up with American money to buy the next tankerload full of oil.Pakistanis, mostly working by themselves, without government help, have put up so many solar panels in the last few years that the Pakistani government last month cancelled the delivery of 27 huge cargoloads full of liquefied natural gas from Qatar. They had to pay a penalty, but it was cheaper to pay the penalty than to import this gas that they didn’t need any more because now they’ve got lots of solar panels.So we have enough money on the planet to make the transition that’s required to really put the brakes on this advance towards climate disruption. What’s keeping folks from providing the resources for poor fossil fuel-trapped countries from making the full transition right away?To some degree, it’s really starting to happen, and it’s happening with Chinese financing and Chinese technology. The Chinese exported half again as much worth of green tech last year as America did of oil and gas. The force that’s slowing down all of this, of course, is the fossil fuel industry, which understands this good news for everybody else as the worst possible news for its future prospects, and they have trillions of dollars’ worth of hydrocarbons in the ground at today’s market prices that they would like to get out and sell for trillions of dollars, which they won’t be able to do if we’re busily converting to sun, wind, to EVs and heat pumps. So they’re doingeverything they possibly canto stop that transition.View image in fullscreenWorkers unload solar panels from a truck at a market in Rawalpindi, Pakistan.Photograph: Farooq Naeem/AFP/Getty ImagesIn our country, where their work is the most advanced, that meant when Donald Trump asked them for a billion dollars in campaign donations last year, they came up with about half a billion in donations and advertising and lobbying in the last election cycle, and that was enough to convince the president to shut down windfarms off the coast of New England that were 80% complete, or put the kibosh on a huge solar farm in Nevada that by itself would have powered 2m homes, more than 1% of American homes. We can’t have this stuff that the rest of the world is busily building because our oil and gas industry has corrupted our president – not that that was a very hard task – and so now we get to pretend that climate change isn’t real, that green energy doesn’t work and that we’re somehow all going to go back and inhabit the 1950s again.Why is it that people are acting this stupid? Let’s be blunt.All transitions are hard and they involve change, and our species doesn’t deal particularly well with change. And in this case, we’ve had 35 years of a full-on disinformation campaign from the fossil fuel industry about climate change, about alternative energy, all designed to drive home the idea that only the way that we’re doing things now could possibly work. And that’s sunk in with too many people, especially in this country, but the rest of the world is quickly shaking off that habit.You could tell watching the climate talks this year in Belém, Brazil, that people are sort of moving past the US, like we’re sort of receding into the rearview mirror. It’s becoming clearer and clearer where the future lies.As patriotic Americans, that should upset us. These technologies were all invented in the US. The first solar cell in 1954 at Bell Labs in New Jersey. The first industrial wind turbine in 1941 at Grandpa’s Knob in Vermont. We could have owned these technologies, and instead we’ve just ceded them to our theoretical main rival on this planet. I don’t think there’s been an act of national self-sabotage quite like this that I can think of anywhere in human history.Here Comes the Sun is a handbook for people who are trying to wrap their heads around this notion that “hey, it really does make a lot of sense to make the transition away from fossil fuel and will be better for us”. It’s not just, I think you use the term, the Whole Foods of energy, that so-called alternative energy. No, this is the main game.This is the Costco of energy, man – cheap, available in bulk, on the shelf, ready to go.How is this book doing? To what extent are people grabbing this and saying: “Oh, my goodness, this really is possible to make a change?”It’s doing well. It’s been fun. We use it as a kind of organising vehicle for this thing in September that we called Sun Day – not Earth Day, but Sun Day. We had 500 events across the country; people are waking up, and I think that they’ll wake up more as the next year goes on.My guess is that one of the two or three key issues for the midterm elections, on which all attention will be focused, are going to beelectricity prices, which are soaring, as you would expect, because we’re permitting every datacentre that anyone could ever want to build at exactly the same moment that we’re constricting the supply of sun and wind. You don’t need to be a Nobel prize-winning economist to know that when you increase demand and decrease supply, prices are going to rise, and that’s exactly what’s happening.Anything you want to add to our discussion?We’ve talked about the economic necessity of doing this and the climate urgency of doing this, but there’s also just a certain amount of beauty that comes with it. When we were getting ready to do Sun Day, one of the things we did was make a playlist of all the songs about the sun. Obviously, I stole the title of my book from George Harrison; Here Comes the Sun is the most listened-to Beatles song on the world’s streaming services. There were hundreds of songs to choose from, which, by the way, is hundreds more than if you tried to compile a playlist of great songs about fracking.The reason is that humans have a deep, deep connection to the sun. We don’t really know how prehistoric people thought, but all the piles of stone they left behind, like Stonehenge, point towards the equinox or the solstice. As soon as people were in the business of making myths, the first thing they had to explain was how the sun rose over here, set over here.View image in fullscreenSunrise at Stonehenge on the winter solstice, 21 December 2025.Photograph: Finnbarr Webster/Getty ImagesI was in Rome in September with the new pope, who had summoned people for a conference on the 10th anniversary of Pope Francis’s epic encyclical on global warming. The new pope said: “Yes, we’re going to continue this work that Francis set us on. In fact, next year, the Vatican will become the first fully solar-powered nation on Earth, when they flip the switch on this big new solar farm they’re finishing up outside Rome.”When it was my turn for my remarks, I just said: “I think this is fantastic. Let’s henceforth concentrate on energy from heaven, not from hell.” I think that’s a useful mantra for the period ahead.This article originally appeared onInside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organisation that covers climate, energy and the environment, in collaboration with Living on Earth,anenvironmental news magazinedistributed by the Public Radio Exchange.

First and most vitally, it must have a grumpy character to soften over the hour. (And it must be an hour – 75 minutes, tops. Anything longer and we’re out of letting-the-children-stay-up-and-watch-as-a-treat territory and that disqualifies it as a contender. Yes it’s a hangover from the days when television was broadcast at fixed points, instead of thrown into the digital ragbag to be pulled out at any time, but what is tradition if not such harkings-back? Come on).Second, there must be snow. I know the planet is burning now, but please see above re tradition and harkings-back.Third, the main parts must be played by great actors throwing their all into a family show and making it work despite a preposterous plot with a particularly unbelievable inciting incident that will be loudly objected to by both the very youngest and very oldest member (these being the most pedantic and exacting viewers) of every household’s audience, before the cosy story – its edges limned with melancholy – works its magic upon them and a blissful silence, interrupted only by the munching of Quality Street and muttered reminders not to put the wrappers back in the box, descends.Stuffed (58 minutes) fits the bill perfectly.Guz Khan(co-creator and star of Man Like Mobeen) plays Arslan Farooqi, a grumpy but loving husband to Hannah (Morgana Robinson – or Morgana the Magnificent as she is known in this house, so wholeheartedly do we worship her borderline bonkers turn as Pippa Middleton in The Windsors), and father to their two daughters, Layla and Fern (Sophia Hussain and Eloide Bains).View image in fullscreenTaken for a ride … Morgana Robinson (Hannah, left), and Sue Johnston (Lily) in Stuffed.Photograph: Janne-Pekka Manninen/BBC/Baby CowWhen we meet them, he is grumbling about the cost of Christmas and Hannah is watching a video of her late mum, who died earlier in the year, and trying not to cry. The mood of both improves, however, when Arslan gets to work and finds out he has been given an £8,000 Christmas bonus – 10 times as much as anyone else has received!Before you/Little Nipper/Grandad can say, “But this is clearly an administrative error. He should tell the accounts department immediately and just enjoy his proper Christmas bonus, of roughly the amount he must have been expecting given that this is something they evidently receive every year,” the family has decided to spend it on the holiday of a lifetime. (“No! At least put it in the bank and have a cushion that could last years!” “Ideally an Isa so your interest is tax-free!” Shush, Nipper. Shush, Grandad.) Arslan is initially resistant, but given the choice of Christmas Day spent watching GB News with Uncle Colin or amid spectacular winter landscapes decorated by the northern lights, he agrees with relative rapidity to the latter. Wise man.Soon we are in Lapland, where the family – including Hannah’s dopey brother Jamie (Theo Barklem-Biggs) – meets lovely but lonely old lady Lily (Sue Johnston), who has come to scatter her beloved husband’s ashes under the northern lights. Hannah quickly becomes great friends with this kindly mother-figure.‘Christmas paid for the extension on my house!’ How Guz Khan became an unlikely festive TV iconRead moreMeanwhile, Arslan discovers that the £8,000 bonus was a mistake! His bosses are bombarding him with furious messages and demanding the money is immediately returned. But they’ve spent it! What can he do? His resourceful daughters, once they’ve realised what is up by sneakily reading his work emails, suggest winning the hotel’s dance competition and parlaying the $1,000 prize money into £8,000 via crypto investment. They succeed in the first part (largely because the girls have given their nearest rivals violent diarrhoea – which is also, when I come to think of it, a pretty common trope in festive specials, but one we won’t dwell on now). But Hannah insists on giving the winnings to Lily because she reminds her so much of her mum.I won’t spoil the ending for you, in case you haven’t worked it out by now. I can only promise you no nasty surprises at the end of a charming hour with just enough quality jokes to keep things bouncing along, just enough sadness to keep you alive to the essential contradictions of the human condition, and a genuinely sweet, unembarrassed, age-appropriate handling of a Muslim-Christian family negotiating the holiday season together. Now finish those Quality Street and get to bed.Stuffed aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewGuz KhanChristmasreviewsShareReuse this content"

What The End of an Era really told us about Taylor SwiftSwift’s six-parter charting her Eras tour began with some riveting revelations – but the drama ebbed away, leaving another piece of mere product for fansSimran HansTue 23 Dec 2025 12.04 ESTLast modified on Tue 23 Dec 2025 12.06 ESTShareIn the behind-the-scenes documentary seriesTaylor Swift: The End of an Era, the singer Florence Welch ascends to the stage to perform their duet Florida!!! to a crowd of 90,000 people. Welch later reflects on their duet at Wembley Stadium with a mix of awe and bemusement. “Taylor is my friend,” she says. “I know her as this very cosy person, and I came out of that lift and I was like, ‘Oh my God, it’s fucking Taylor Swift.’”If Swift is a cosy person, The End of an Era – now complete, with its concluding episodes dropping today – is certainly a cosy watch; the sort of lighthearted, low-demand viewing that feels especially welcome in the lazy days leading up to Christmas and stretching towards the new year. Viewers will be familiar with the story. The Eras Tour was great, it tells us. It broke records, burst hearts and boosted the economy. We know she pulled it off. This is only a problem insofar as it means there is almost zero jeopardy in the series, which feels repetitive and thinly stretched over its six hour-long episodes.Only the first episode offered true revelations, dwelling on a genuine moment of peril: the aftermath of afoiled Islamic State plotto target her three concerts in Vienna in August 2024, just over a week after three little girls were murdered at a Swift-themed dance class in Southport. Swift is clearly and understandably shaken, but wills herself not to break down in front of the grieving parents she has invited to the show: she is graceful enough to know it’s not a good look to make their loss about her.Much less significant, although still a good titbit, was the revelation that it was Swift’s mother, Andrea, who suggested she try dating a fun-loving athlete instead of another tortured poet, namely NFL star Travis Kelce after he said on his podcast that he was “butt-hurt” he hadn’t been able to meet her at an Eras show. The pair are now engaged.The trailer for The End of an Era – videoOtherwise, the choice to focus on the tour’s final months – essentially its victory lap – doesn’t particularly make for dramatic storytelling. In this chapter of the tour, Swift is in a happy and secure relationship, and it’s no wonder she had perfected the show with military precision after an entire year of performing it. There are blatant attempts to engineer tension where there is none. We see male dancer Whyley Yoshimura plucking up the courage to ask Swift if he can perform Ready for It?, which is usually an all-female routine (she barely bats an eyelid). There is a plotline concerning a new bodysuit for the Reputation section not being ready in time (it is). One day, Swift has a cough.There is too little to root for, and too few moments of challenge beyond the sheer superhuman endurance required to deliver a three-and-a-half hour show for 18 months (Swift’s admittedly impressive gym routine montage notwithstanding). Considering the reams written about the tour –the most successful of all time– The End of an Era gives very little insight into the emotional and practical considerations of how they kept this show on the road.So if we learned little in the way of definitive new information, what story did The End of an Era tell us about the world’s biggest pop star? As with most contemporary music documentaries, it’s an act of brand consolidation. Her devoted dancers, backing singers and session musicians are presented as one big happy “family”, but of course they are her employees, too. “It’s more than a job … I never want this to end,” says one singer, while a dancer remarks that her boss “has made us feel seen, worthy and treated with the utmost respect”, as Swift’s song It’s Nice to Have a Friend plays in the background. Much is made of the diversity of the dancers. It is well documented that Swift gave out a reported $197m in bonuses to the Eras tour crew. Is it necessary to show her employees receiving their cheques as a scene here?In one perhaps unwittingly revealing part, Swift glancingly mentions the two breakups that took place during the tour’s first run, without naming the men – firstly her partner of six years, the actor Joe Alwyn, and then Matty Healy of the 1975, with whom she had a fling as the tour was underway in spring 2023. “I didn’t feel like a person, but like a large conglomerate that no one sees as human, especially the men I was dating,” says Swift. But each shrewd decision she is shown making seems to underline the fact that she is indeed a corporation, and one with corporate interests.In the fourth episode, she remarks that the presidential election is in five days but that “the one thing I can provide for people is an escape, like nothing ever could or should ever bother any of us, and nothing will for three-and-a-half hours. I’m glad that I will have given just 100% girlhood and hope and belief and sweat and effort because that’s the job”. She mentions neither Donald Trump nor Kamala Harris, which feels pointedly apolitical, particularly given that she hadformally endorsed Harris, the democratic candidate, two months earlier.View image in fullscreenTravis Kelce (right) onstage with Swift at Wembley, 22 June 2024.Photograph: Gareth Cattermole/TAS24/Getty Images for TAS Rights ManagementYou don’t doubt the sincerity of her relationship with Kelce, pictured sparingly, but it’s also clear how mutually beneficial it is. Swift points out that, once their relationship became public, every 12th person in her audience was wearing a football shirt like his. It’s fun to glimpse her creative process as she secretly recorded this year’s albumThe Life of a Showgirlwith co-producers Max Martin and Shellback in Sweden between Eras tour dates – especially how boozy they seemed, with glögg and sancerre flowing – but the doc glosses over the fact that she made another album on this tour,The Tortured Poets Department, in the wake of the Healy debacle: presumably a more fraught process than the album celebrating her new love. It’s completely understandable that Swift didn’t want the narrative of her failed romantic relationships to overshadow the success and achievement of the tour, but she has offered less and less of herself as she has sold her fans more and more product, including this series.It’s telling that the most electric moments of The End of an Era are of Swift working out her surprise song mashups for the show’s solo acoustic set, which changed for each performance. In a nondescript backstage dressing room for the final night in Toronto, Swift works out how she’ll transition in and out of Long Live, New Year’s Day and The Manuscript on the piano, three particularly devastating examples of her gift for eulogising her own life. I could have watched six episodes of that – of scenes detailing the ease of her musicianship, and her ability to craft an emotional moment.Taylor Swift: The End of an Era review – as she breaks down over the terror plot, it’s impossible not to feel her painRead more“I specifically created this tour on a molecular level to make people feel that sense of escape,” says Swift, and it’s true that the Eras tour offered fans a powerful sensation of belonging. But a question the documentary doesn’t ask is what this kind of undertaking – one whose scale is so big, and whose emotional scope is so reflective, surveying her entire catalogue – offers Swift herself. Archive footage of her as an ambitious and musically talented girl reminds us that she has realised her childhood dream. But it’s not clear what it all means to her as an adult – beyond, once again, the business practicalities. Before the credits roll, text appears on screen saying that the tour’s financial success in part allowed her to buy back her master recordings – her project for the best part of a decade. I can’t help but wonder if there’s more to say.While the series is called The End of an Era, it is careful not to position Eras as a career pinnacle. At the end of the film, we’re told that The Life of a Showgirl, released 10 months after the tour ended, is her “most successful album yet”. Swift may be breaking new ground commercially, but artistically she has been treading water. In an early episode, she says that her goal with this tour was to “overserve” the fans, which is perhaps the show’s sharpest insight. This series, like all her recent output, is for those who are already onside: a shrewd investment with a guaranteed return.Explore more on these topicsTaylor SwiftDisney+Pop and rockDocumentaryTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ditto if it had been the fast route. But I was on the slow train to Derby and knew I was in trouble ...Rachel DixonTue 23 Dec 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 23 Dec 2025 08.02 ESTShareIhad been visiting my boyfriend in London for the weekend. He was a hard-up student and I was still at sixth-form, but beer was pretty cheap in 2000, so we had been out for a few pints. Now we were racing to St Pancras so I could get the last train home to Derby.I legged it through the station and made it on to the train with seconds to spare. No time for the loo, but I’d relieve myself on the train. Or so I thought.The toilet at the end of my carriage was out of order. So was the next one along. With the beer sloshing around and my bladder close to bursting, I lurched down the train and bumped into the ticket inspector. He broke the bad news: all the toilets were out of order.I sat back down and crossed my legs. The minutes crawled by. The fast train from London to Derby takes about an hour and a half, and I could have hung on that long. The only problem was, this was the slow train.I glimpsed the stations as we passed: Luton, Bedford, Wellingborough. Ninety minutes in, and we were only at Kettering. I gritted my teeth and started to sweat. By Market Harborough, I could last no longer. I had two choices: wet myself, or get off the train.I got off. The station was deserted, the toilets long since locked up. In desperation, I crouched down in a siding. I’ll spare you the details, but the relief was immense.Once my most pressing concern was dealt with, I had new problems. I was alone, in the early hours of the morning, with next to no money. I must have owned a mobile phone, but either it was out of credit or the battery had died. In any case, Google Maps and Uber hadn’t been invented yet.There was only one thing to do. I found the station’s payphone and called my friend Portia, my partner in crime, who always had a clear head in a crisis. (She still does, 25 years on; she is now a headteacher.)Somehow, she located Market Harborough’s Travelodge and gave me directions over the phone – thankfully it was a short walk away. I think it was only the second hotel I had ever stayed in; I was more used to campsites, caravan parks and youth hostels. It cleaned out my remaining cash, but at least I had a bed for the night.Weirdly, I can’t remember how my parents reacted when I finally got home the next day. Friends thought I was an idiot for getting off the train, but what choice did I have?There is still no legal requirement for UK trains to have working, or indeed any, toilets. An early day motion on the subject wastabled in 2007, but today there areno toilets on Merseyrail trains,Elizabeth line trainsin London, the newtram-trains in south Walesand various others. Some Southeastern trains are beingretrofitted with toilets.In my case, I brought the problem on myself by boozing before boarding. But for many people with disabilities, thelack of an accessible toiletis a real deterrent to travelling by train.I was lucky to be unscathed by my accidental mini-break in Market Harborough; I have since been on many more nights out and caught countless last trains home. I did learn one lesson, though: I always go to the toilet before I board.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleMy big night outRail travelRail transportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s what the cinema was made for. It looked amazing; its sound was so rich and textured; and the juke joint dance sequence was a genuine WTF surprise that could have been grim but was utter genius. And if you haven’t seen it, please stay for the scene that comes mid-credits: it has to be my favourite five minutes of film all year.Michael, ManchesterPillionPillion blew me away – no pun intended. I’d expected it to be sexy and subversive but it’s a much bigger film than that. We saw it in a pretty full cinema and it felt like all of us were realising that fact together – the first laughs sounded surprised, mine included – but as the film revealed itself, it was clear we were all firmly on side. I left with a massive grin on my face and won’t shut up about it to anyone who so much as mentions a motorbike.Izzy, LondonBlue MoonView image in fullscreenAndrew Scott as Richard Rodgers and Margaret Qualley as Elizabeth Weiland in Blue Moon. Described by our reader Martin McDonald as ‘sharp and witty’.Photograph: Sabrina Lantos/PAI’ve seen 156 films at the cinema this year, 114 of them new. My favourite, rather surprisingly to me, was Blue Moon. It’s just fabulously well done. The premise – lyricist Lorenz Hart trying to come to terms with the end of his professional partnership with composer on the opening night of Rodgers’s and Oscar Hammerstein’s first smash hit musical Oklahoma – is inspired. The script is sharp and witty and the acting superb, especially from Ethan Hawke as Hart, Andrew Scott as Rodgers and Margaret Qualley as Gary’s would-be love interest Elizabeth Weiland. I expect all of them to get Oscar and Bafta nominations, as well as the film itself getting nods for best picture and best original screenplay.Martin McDonald, 60, ManchesterIf I Had Legs I’d Kick YouEvery aspect of the film gripped the audience in terrifying, magnetic ways, up until the climactic final scene. Never leaving Rose Byrne’s captivating performance and never panning to the daughter until the very end, the film captured a side to parenthood that we do not often see represented in media: the particularly devastating toll it takes on one’s capacity to see and deal with the world around oneself, as parent or child.Jonny Lawrence, Ithaca, New YorkNickel BoysNickel Boys is a wonderfully evocative, Malick-style film that effortlessly gets at a depiction of interiority that is so rarely achieved; a literary adaptation that is completely cinematic. A truly unique experience, emotional and thoughtful without descending into the sort of brutality that often punctuates this kind of story. A triumph.Sean, 33, LondonView image in fullscreenTom Basden and Carey Mulligan in The Ballad of Wallis Island, described by our reader Seán Gorman as ‘absolutely gorgeous’.Photograph: Focus Features/PAThe Ballad of Wallis IslandThere have been some superb films this year but The Ballad of Wallis Island takes it for me. Absolutely gorgeous, great soundtrack – and who knew Tim Key could act so well?Seán Gorman, 43, Galway, IrelandWicked: For GoodThe end of the yellow brick road, this film did not disappoint in concluding the emotional rollercoaster that the first film started last year. The more Q&As, interviews, podcast episodes I hear and conversations I participate in, the more I am impressed with every single element of this film. No detail, no motivation, no frame was taken for granted, leaving us with a powerful and incredible experience that changed me for good.M, California, USAOne Battle After AnotherOne Battle After Another is a stunning film with a host of compelling themes about modern America and indeed the world running through it. It’s funny, surreal and frightening. A real treat.Gary Ingrey, 66, Wisbech, CambridgeshireF1It’s difficult to choose, but I really enjoyed F1 the movie. As a keen motorsports enthusiast, I found it was light yet captured elements of the tactical side of racing that are often overlooked. The “experienced” veteran v newbie “dismisser” story also gave me a laugh.Raymond, 58, Kildare, IrelandThe Ice TowerWith its hazy colouring, late-60s setting and fairytale inspiration, The Ice Tower is steeped in a world of nostalgia, making for an easy favourite. Jumping off from The Snow Queen, the film also recalls the temporal uncertainty of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, and the visions of A Matter of Life and Death. Much as The Snow Queen left me as a child, The Ice Tower bound me in chilling wonder.Lauren, 28, LondonOslo Stories TrilogyMy favourite this year was the Oslo Stories Trilogy from writer turned director Dag Johan Haugerud; three films that present a long, meandering meditation on love in its different forms. Beautifully written dialogues and soulful understated acting; just really moving slices of life without the usual bombast. I loved the visual themes too; the stairs inDreams, rooftops inSexand river-quay vistas inLove. Some of the characters appear in all three films, and as a whole the Stories reminded me of Kieslowski’s Three Colours. From the 100 films or so I saw this year, this trilogy really stood out.Ariela Flusser, LondonView image in fullscreenGuillermo del Toro, left, and Oscar Isaac on the set of Frankenstein. Our reader Sylvia Rowe said it was the film adaptation she had waited her life to see.Photograph: Ken Woroner/APFrankensteinFrankenstein byGuillermo del Torois the best film of 2025. I think he did a spectacular job of showing the creature’s empathy towards others and his anguish at being a “monster”, and Jacob Elordi gave a masterly performance. The cinematography was gorgeous, as were the costume design (Kate Hawley is a genius!) and set designs. Alexandre Desplat composed a fitting original score that added childlike whimsy to what could have been considered gruesome scenes, which put me into Victor Frankenstein’s mental state as he was crafting his creation and helped me see his process through his eyes. Oscar Isaac was well cast as the tormented creator and Mia Goth was perfect as the loving and benevolent Elizabeth. This was truly the Frankenstein film I’ve waited for my whole life.Sylvia Rowe, 58, Tennessee, USATrain DreamsTrain Dreams is a beautifully made meditation on life. It’s told with excellent performances throughout, with Joel Edgerton delivering a career best.Patrick, IrelandA House of DynamiteView image in fullscreenRebecca Ferguson in A House of Dynamite. ‘A gripping thriller,’ says our reader Richard Western.Photograph: Eros Hoagland/PAA House of Dynamite is very well written, directed and edited. Excellent cast. A gripping thriller that emphasises the hard truth about the dangers of nuclear weapons in our time. Fictional, but factually accurate.Richard Western, 86, Oregon, USABlack BagBlack Bag is an interesting story that felt almost like a whodunnit. I enjoyed the atmosphere, the scenery and the wonderful cast.Jane, South EastTornadoTornado is a revenge western set in an imagined 18th- t0 19th-century Scotland, with a Japanese hero whose father is a samurai, and who may or may not be a samurai herself. It’s made on film, 90 minutes long. What’s not to like?Tim Bradshaw, DevonThe Perfect NeighbourThe true crime genre has morphed into a standardised, boiler-plate format, forgoing nuance and empathy for schlock and sensationalism. But Geeta Gandbhir’s The Perfect Neighbour bucks this trend through the meta lens of a true found-footage film. Such a cinematic choice risked being contrived, but it gives the film a profound and disturbing power. Despite exclusively using bodycam and CCTV footage, the film’s POV is almost a character in its own right – lingering on scenes and tableaux that resonate. The image of an empty chair in a police interview room, with a handwritten note resting by its leg, will haunt me for a long time.Matt, medical writer, MacclesfieldNouvelle VagueMy favourite film this year is Nouvelle Vague by Richard Linklater. The movie narrates the pre-production and filming of Breathless by Jean-Luc Godard. I went to see it thinking it would be another biographical film filled with cliches and nostalgia about the golden age of French cinema. Instead, it was incredibly witty, funny and heartwarming, with great performances by unknown actors and a really creative and interesting approach to the story that mixes reality with fiction. It was the surprise of the year!Victoria, 22, AthensThe KingdomView image in fullscreenGhjuvanna Benedetti in The Kingdom. ‘Raw and intense,’ says our reader Catherine Laz.Photograph: hi-Fou-Mi Productions/PAThe Kingdom shows a very little-known aspect of Corsica outside France. I’m from Brittany so I totally understand the pride Corsicans feel about their territory and culture. This film was made by Julien Colonna, the son of the head of the Corsican nationalist movement, Yvan Colonna, who murdered Claude Érignac, prefect of Corsica. This film centers around the raw and intense relationship between the head of a clan and his rebellious teenage daughter. They go on the run when their hiding place is discovered. It can only end badly because it’s a story of endless feuds, violence and revenge. It reminded me of As Bestas (The Beasts), another movie about culture clashes. The French government is largely unable to control the situation, and autonomy for the region may be the only solution for this fiercely independent territory.Catherine Laz, 63, LondonCaught StealingThis movie is a throwback not only to its sweating hotdog ofa 1998 New York setting, but also to the kind of film it is. A film where a flawed character gets in an unimaginably horrible situation through no fault of their own and just makes everything worse at every opportunity. I love these kind of movies, the evil Alice in Wonderland story where characters descend into the veins of a living city underworld with a hero ill equipped to overcome any of it (Austin Butler loses a kidney in the first 12 minutes). The film shines in its set pieces, balancing its farcical elements with action. It is, above all, incredible fun. It will join the pantheon of films I put on when I get home from the pub.Tom Crozier, Melbourne, AustraliaExplore more on these topicsFilmBest films of 2025Guillermo del ToroSinnersWicked: For GoodNickel BoysA House of DynamiteOne Battle After AnothernewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianOn the winter solstice, the Cornish town transforms into a rambunctious festival full of dance, delinquency and Morris dancers. Our writer dodges the vegetable missiles – and learns how to get the best out of a horse skullByJames Banyard. Photographs byJonny WeeksTue 23 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 23 Dec 2025 07.55 ESTShareIncense burners as big as basketballs send thick clouds of smoke into the hyped-up crowd. “Hoo hoo Holly!” cries a man in a suit of twisted roots, looking like an oversized Shredded Wheat. The crowd begins to chant: “Make way for the Holly!” And two 10ft tree gods – the Oak King and the Holly King – begin to lash and headbutt each other, as flamethrowers blast the air with hot orange streams. These mysterious-seeming traditions are part of Montol, Cornwall’s biggest solstice festival. Each year on 21 December, Penzance’s high streets close to traffic and crowds of thousands wearing elaborate outfits and horses skulls prowl, throw brussels sprouts and burn effigies of the sun.Elements of Montol have pagan roots, including rituals such as “wearing animal masks and cross-dressing, going from house to house performing ludicrous plays and performing really crap music”, says one co-organiser, Aaron Broadhurst. But Montol itself only began in 2007, when Simon Reed, former Penzance mayor and campaigner for Cornish Culture, found the word, meaning “balance”, in an old Cornish dictionary. In its first incarnation, says co-organiser Paul Tyreman, the festival consisted of a wind band, the Turkey Rhubarb Band, who led a procession up Market Jew Street and through the town. “People gathered, sung carols, lit a beacon, and went home.”Over time, the festival acquired more traditions, some rooted in Cornish culture, others entirely made up. There are osses – people wearing real horse skulls who prowl the streets throughout the day’s events, in keeping with the Padstow May Day “obby oss” and the Welsh Mari Lwyd (Grey Mare) – and Cornish carols are sung. There is guise dancing – costumed dancing – that stretches back to at least the late 19th century.But Reed invented the Guilds, says Broadhurst – the costumed troupes who roam the pubs and streets after dark performing absurd plays and “testing the ale”. (This might remind you of Lewes Bonfire Night, except Penzance’s shop windows don’t get boarded up.) And sprouts are both currency and ammunition for pelting fellow revellers in the street, a tradition with a poignant origin: it honours the late John Dudding of Falmouth, the self-styled Chancellor of the Cabbage who died suddenly in 2021 and had always attended Montol dressed – naturally – as a cabbage, to be duly pelted with sprouts. Before the festivities begin today, a man carries a green crate filled with sprouts through the streets, singing: “I have all the sprouts.”View image in fullscreenOsses on the prowl around Penzance.View image in fullscreenAaron and Nicole Broadhurst, dressed as Lord and Lady Montol, during the Sundowner parade.View image in fullscreenA band plays as they parade through Market Place.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreen(Left) Four horsemen of the apocalypse, including Donald Trump and Nigel Farage. (Right) Cllr Stephen Reynolds gets nibbled by the osses.View image in fullscreenDancers, musicians and revellers swarming on the streets of Penzance.Montol is supported with a £7,500 grant from the town council. “What is really important about our festival culture here in Penzance is that they are community festivals,” says mayor Stephen Reynolds. “They are by the community for the community. Our job is to support, but not direct or control. Everything else comes from volunteer effort.” It’s not about return on investment. “In Penzance, we resist this kind of corporate feel that some festivals can acquire when they get big. We are the antithesis of corporate down here.”The far west of Cornwall only encourages such festivities, says Broadhurst. “When I first moved here from Bristol, someone said to me: ‘You’ve got to understand this about Penwith. Cornwall’s a bit like a Christmas stocking. Where do all the nuts end up? Down in the toe.’ It’s true.”The festival begins gently at 2pm with border morris dancing. Pensans (Penzance) Morris and other visiting troupes take over the traffic-free Greenmarket. They clack sticks in yellow and black costumes and their performance of What Shall We Do With the Drunken Sailor is a sober palate-cleanser for the madness to follow. The guise dancers include the Scaleybacks of Hakeybay, lead by Admiral Hake from St Ives, who dress to a nautical theme: one is a selkie, another a mermaid, there is even a lighthouse. Generally, Broadhurst explains, the poor dress as rich, and everyone wears masks. “The tradition is that you wear tatters, which is a social inversion thing, or you wear mock posh or mock formal, where you take the piss out of the rich.”Tyreman and Aaron and his wife, Nicole, have been the administrative engine of Montol since 2023, when Reed stepped down. When volunteers were asked to take over, the room at the pub where they met suddenly emptied out. “It was like a scene in a comedy, with a sudden scraping of chairs,” says Aaron. “The room was empty apart from four or five of us. We were sat there thinking: ‘Oh shit, what have we done?’View image in fullscreenPensans morris dancers in action, bearing the county’s colours: black, white and yellow.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreen(Left) Festival-goers in full regalia. (Right) Morris dancers on the march.View image in fullscreenMusicians play tunes for the morris dancers.Among the many challenges in mounting a festival that runs for more than eight hours across 22 spots is managing locals’ conflicting takes on what it stands for. “There’s one lady who won’t have anything to do with it because she thinks it’s too pagan,” says Tyreman.Equally, says Aaron, “I have to deal with a bunch of pagans who think it’s a pagan festival, and tell me to get rid of all this Christian iconography! We sometimes describe Montol as a big family – from time to time we absolutely hate each other.”At 3.30pm, the crowd grows around the Farmers Arms for the Cornish carols. Facilitator Kelsey Michael is a community singing leader in Penzance. She draws from a book called Hark! The Glad Sound of Cornish Carols by Hilary Coleman and Sally Burley, a record of carols sung throughout the county. Kelsey keeps the arrangements to simple two-part harmonies to allow everyone to join in. “Despite the singing culture in Cornwall, sometimes people are nervous about it,” she says.View image in fullscreenCarol singing on Causeway.View image in fullscreenFestive performers surrounded by spectators.More nerve-racking, however, are the horse-headed osses. Mid-afternoon, Penhood and Maur Bras are walking slowly down Causewayhead, snapping hats from festival-goers’ heads. Their teasers (minders), Rachel and Sophie, make sure they don’t fall over. Both osses call in to the Zennor Wild cafe, stooping through the doorway and nudging drinkers’ coffees.“With the osses, there’s this tingling sensation,” says Aaron. “Especially with kids, because they are both scared because it’s a big monster who might bite their head off, but they also know it’s a person in a suit. Our osses are so skilful, they can use their teeth to pick up bags of sprouts from the Co-op.”Acquiring a horse skull is simple. Wearing one is more complicated. “The skulls weigh a ton,” says Aaron. “You can buy them on eBay, or you can go to an abattoir. In fact, if you approach an abattoir in advance, they will leave them outside in a bucket for the flesh to be eaten by maggots, so the skull is reasonably clean. Then you take it home and boil it in water and bleach and find someone you know who can articulate the jaw. You want a good snap.”View image in fullscreenCharlotte and Linus carrying the midwinter sun to the ‘burning of the sun’ parade at Princess May Recreation Ground.View image in fullscreenA fire dancer at the recreation ground.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreen(Left) Paul Carey, band leader and bagpiper.

His own bucca (male sea spirit), a 12ft metal pagan god that looks like Count Binface with articulated tentacles, looks fresh from his scrap heap.In the fight itself, of course, this being midwinter, after a few decent body checks, the Oak King wins, as is tradition. “We’ve been doing this for about six years, although it sometimes doesn’t look like we’ve done it before,” says Gray. “As with anything at Montol, there’s a sense of anarchy and misrule and mischief that goes along with all of it.”You can watch a previous year’s tree fight in a short film about Montol that Gray has made with Ryan Mackfall and Kingsley Marshall. Howlsavla Gwav (winter solstice) will be released in 2026, with music byacclaimed local folk musician Daisy Rickman. “It started as a little advert for the festival, but the scope grew into this crazy, uncontrollable plant.”View image in fullscreenThe Skaleybacks of Hakeybay.View image in fullscreenA dragon interacts with spectators on the parade route back from the recreation ground.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreen(Left) Stilt walkers welcome the winter solstice. (Right) Tilly, AKA the court of the counterfeit Kerneweks.View image in fullscreenThe beast of Bodmin Moor tries to break free.Much of the festival is driven by music from the Raffidy Dumitz Band, this year joined by a group of musicians from Callington, far away in east Cornwall, the Kelliwik Golowi Band. After the tree fight, the combined bands are the heart of the procession up to the muddy Princess May Recreation Ground from 6pm, where the sun is ceremonially burned, showering the delighted crowd in orange sparks.By 8pm, during a lull in the formal processions, the Guilds’ “revels” begin – and the first sprouts are lobbed. At the Admiral Benbow pub, one man aims a sprout that bounces off someone’s head, and laughs. Two people advance behind road closure signs, using them like riot shields. Occasionally, the first-floor window of the pub is pulled down and armfuls of the diminutive brassica are flung out, hitting festival-goers. One man escapes from the melee, and yells to his friends: “I got sprouted in the balls! I love this festival!”View image in fullscreenSpectators holding candles ready for the final procession.View image in fullscreenA firepit awaits the late-night revellers.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreen(Left) The ‘chalking of the mock’ by Tas Nadelik, near Jubilee Pool.

Down on the promenade, the Mock, or yule log, is “chalked” – burned in a roaring brazier. At the end of the procession, Lord Montol gives a speech and the remaining sprouts rain down on him.What does it all mean? It’s a festival full of homemade rituals, and Cornish defiance. “The parades are small acts of reconquest,” says Aaron. “We’re taking ownership of our little town.”On the year’s shortest day, it’s also a much-needed injection of energy. “The festival makes your hair stand on end,” says mayor Stephen Reynolds. “It’s amazing to be in the midst of all that energy. The further west you go, the wilder it gets.”Explore more on these topicsThe Guardian picture essayFestivalsCornwallDanceShareReuse this content"

The inevitable correction must prompt a global conversation about intelligent machines, regulation and riskTue 23 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 23 Dec 2025 12.05 ESTShareIf AI did not change your life in 2025, next year it will. That is one of few forecasts that can be made with confidence in unpredictable times. This is not an invitation to believe the hype about what the technology can do today, or may one day achieve. The hype doesn’t need your credence. It ispuffed up enoughon Silicon Valley finance to distort the global economy and fuel geopolitical rivalries, shaping your world regardless of whether the most fanciful claims about AI capability are ever realised.ChatGPTwas launchedjust over three years ago and became the fastest-growing consumer app in history. Now it has about 800m weekly users. Its parent company, OpenAI, is valued atabout $500bn. Sam Altman, OpenAI CEO, has negotiated an intricate and, to some eyes, suspiciously opaque network of deals with other players in the sector to build the infrastructure required for the US’s AI-powered future. The value of these commitments isabout $1.5tn. This is not real cash, but bear in mind that a person spending $1 everysecondwould need 31,700 years to get through a trillion-dollar stash.Alphabet (Google’s parent company), Amazon, Apple, Meta (formerly Facebook) and Microsoft, which has a $135bn stake in OpenAI, are all piling hundreds of billions of dollars on the same bet. Without all these investments, the US economy would be flatlining.Economic analysts and historians of previous industrial frenzies, from the 19th-century railroads to thedotcom boom-and-bustat the turn of the millennium, are calling AI a bubble.Altman has said: “There are many parts of AI that I think arekind of bubblyright now.” Not his part, naturally. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder, has called it a bubble, but the“good” kindthat accelerates economic progress. A good bubble, in this analysis, finances infrastructure and expands the boundaries of human knowledge. These benefits endure after the bubble bursts and justify the ruin of people (little people, not Bezos people) who get hurt along the way.The bullishness of the tech fraternity is a heady mix of old-fashioned hucksterism, plutocratic megalomania and utopian ideology.At its core is a marketing pitch: current AI models already out-perform people at many tasks. Soon, it is supposed, the machines will achieve “general intelligence” – cognitive versatility like ours – leading to emancipation from the need for any human input. Generally intelligent AI can teach itself and design its successors, advancing through mind-boggling exponents of capability towards higher dimensions of super-intelligence.The company that crosses that threshold will have no trouble covering its debts. The men who realise this vision – and the dominant evangelists are all men – will be to omniscient AI what ancient prophets were to their gods. That’s a good gig for them. What happens to the rest of us in this post-sapiens order is a bit hazier.The US isn’t the only superpower to have an interest in AI, so the Silicon Valley dash for maximum awesomeness has geopolitical implications. China has taken a different approach, dictated in part by the Communist party tradition of centralised industrial planning, but also by the simple fact of running second in the race to innovate. Beijing is pushing for a faster, wider implementation of lower-spec (but still powerful) AI at every level of the economy and society. China is betting on ageneral boostfrom ordinary AI. The US is gunning for an extraordinary leap in general AI.Since the prize in that race is global supremacy, there are few incentives for either side to fret about risks, or sign up to international protocols restricting the uses of AI and mandating transparency in its development. Neither the US nor China is interested in submitting a strategically vital industry to standards co-written with foreigners.In the absence of global governance, we will depend on the integrity of robber barons and authoritarian apparatchiks to build ethical guardrails around systems already being embedded in tools we use for work, play and education.Earlier this year, Elon Musk announced that his company was developing Baby Grok, an AI chatbot aimed at children as young as three. The adult version has voiced white supremacist views and proudly self-identified as “MechaHitler”. That flagrancy has at least the virtue of candour. It is easier to spot than the subtler encodings of prejudice in bots that haven’t been given the kind ofhard ideological steersthat Musk gives his algorithms.George Osborne has a new job in tech, and it doesn’t bode well for Britain | Chris Stokel-WalkerRead moreNot all AI systems are large language models (LLMs) like Grok. But all LLMs are vulnerable to hallucinations and delusions gleaned from the material on which they are trained. They don’t “understand” a question and “think” about it like a conscious mind. They take a prompt, test the probability of its key terms occurring frequently together in their training data and assemble a plausible-sounding answer. Often the result is accurate. Usually it is convincing. It can also be garbage. As the volume of AI-generated content grows online, the ratio of slop to quality in the LLMs’ diets shifts accordingly. Fed on junk, they cannot be trusted to disgorge nutritious information.On this trajectory a bleak destination comes into view: a synthetic pseudo-reality mediated by the sycophantic mechanical offspring of narcissist Silicon Valley oligarchs. But that isn’t the only available path. Nor is it necessarily the likeliest one. The irrational exuberance of the AI boosters and theircynical coupling with the Trump administrationis a familiar story of human greed and myopia, not a new stage in evolution. The product is truly phenomenal but flawed in ways that encode the deformed character of its progenitors, whose talents are salesmanship and financial engineering. They have built spectacular engines that prioritise a brilliant performance of intelligence over the real thing.The real bubble is not stock valuations but the inflated ego of an industry that thinks it is just one more datacentre away from computational divinity. When the correction comes, when the US’s Icarus economy hits the cold sea, there will be a chance for other voices to be heard on the subject of risk and regulation. It may not come in 2026, but the moment is nearing when the starkness of the choice on offer and the need to confront it becomes unavoidable. Should we build a world where AI is put to the service of humanity, or will it be the other way round? We won’t need ChatGPT to tell us the answer.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionSilicon ValleyMetaOpenAIAlphabetAmazonXcommentShareReuse this content"

Is this a good idea?Tue 23 Dec 2025 10.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 23 Dec 2025 10.12 ESTShareIwas flicking through a photo album at my grandma’s when I came across a picture of my mum as a child. I took a photo and sent it to her, but on my phone screen, it looked brighter and more vivid than the physical version in my hand.Adding an Instagram filter is something I would now only do ironically. But is my phone increasing the contrast or making other tweaks without my knowledge? To find out, I downloaded an app with a “zero-processing” feature that claimed to take photos without any software alterations. When comparing the photos my camera takes automatically to the photos taken with this app, the results were shocking. The so-called “raw” photos that lack processing had subtle, muted colours, softer edges – a little grainy – while the processed photos were gorgeous and crisp like the inside of a marble. Why were they so different?The answer to this, like everything else these days, is machine learning, used by virtually every major smartphone-maker to enhance the photos taken with their cameras. Professional photographers have been aware of it for years, as you can readily see on Reddit, YouTube or Facebook. On Aurora-Hunters UK, enthusiasts accuse one another of “cheating” by using phone cameras that “automatically brighten the picture”. But outside these niche circles, it’s rarely discussed. We communicate, build relationships, advertise ourselves through our pictures – and yet they are being heavily manipulated without our knowledge. I told my friend about this on a walk, showed them the two photos side by side, and on the train home they said they “couldn’t stop thinking about it”. Tech companies are making decisions on our behalf about what our photos, and therefore our lives, look like.View image in fullscreenA photograph taken without processing (left), alongside the same, processed image.Photograph: The GuardianWe’re used to being lied to, and for new technologies to encourage an increasingly smoothed andyassified reality. It’s a common experience, needing to actively go to our phone settings to turn off smoothing effects on our faces. My sister freaked out when her phone automatically tried out a “jawline enhancer” on her front-facing camera, that she had to turn off.And while the newest phones always come with boasts about improved cameras, this is somewhat deceptive: due to “thinnovation”, phones are physically too thin for the hardware to change dramatically, so instead, it is often computer software that is improving our photos.These decisions, made by expert teams who are designing and programming our phone software, are not taken because they have a specific “photo look” in mind that they want to impart on the rest of the world – in order to control us, leading to world domination etc – but because they are seriously, and religiously, studyingwhat consumers want. As I take photos without processing, I come to prefer them to the lurid, creepily vibrant photos created by my phone’s permanent settings. I am not alone – everyone I ask, amateur and professional photographer alike, prefers photos taken on a film camera, or even digital camera, to photos taken on our phones. But do these musings and taste preferences matter when I need to capture something quickly? No.Consumers apparently want these bright, lurid photos. They want to be able to capture quickly, and still get non-blurry images. Consumers want their faces to look nicer in the photos, because it will make them feel better about themselves – but not too nice, not too edited, because it will seem fake. Tech companies want us on our phones more, and so making our photos more appealing, in a magpie-shiny-objects-way, is going to do that. This is when it starts to feel like a trap.Even before this kind of automatic processing, the way our photos looked was somewhat pre-decided. Sensors pick up light and behave in certain ways to create certain images. Lenses with specific traits inherent in them determine how colourful the picture comes out, so photos are, to a certain extent, cooked eggs, with huge amounts of processing involved already. The “look” of photos, even in the 1970s with Fujifilm, wasn’t necessarily in the control of the photographer.But there are obvious flaws with tech companies deciding what the “majority” preference is – how do they even decide such things? Consumer research? Data collection? Letting consumer desire – or demand – become the be-all and end-all for our products isn’t ideal. The short-term satisfaction given to us by our tech products has tended to cause long-term problems.My mum has recently been going through boxes of old photos that she hadn’t looked at in decades. There are a few that my grandad took in the 1960s – including one of my mum as a toddler, holding a tennis racket that is bigger than her own body, watched over by my grandma. I showed it to my grandma, who was overwhelmed that she had produced such a little “dote”, and couldn’t believe the young woman’s body in the foreground was hers. She told me how photos such as this are rare because it was typical of my grandad to take shots of views, rather than of his family – which made us laugh.My grandad was putting his personality into his photos – even if most of them were bad, or blurry, or failed to get his own wife in, at least they revealed a crucial element of him, some enthusiasm and eccentricity. Looking through these prints can tell a story about what he was like as a person.Whoever designs the tech, designs the image. With higher levels of control from tech companies – including embedded auto-processing that we cannot turn off – we begin to get narrower limits for us to express ourselves through our photos. When I look at them side by side, it’s undeniable that the processed photos are closer to the vibrancy of what I perceive as real life. They add a light or a sharpness that feels like it reflects what I see in the world around me. But what if that’s not what I want from my photos? If my grandad had grown up with a smartphone, what a bounty of wonderful, ultra-HD, glowy, vibrant photos of birds and planes he would have been able to take – but still, I can’t help but feel that that would have been a shame.Isabel Brooks is a freelance writerExplore more on these topicsPhotographyOpinionSmartphonesMobile phonesDigital mediacommentShareReuse this content"

She is always on edge, vigilant to the slightest movement, fearful of sudden danger, and has learned to withdraw herself from the chaos in order to survive. She is keenly observant, sees through people around her who are not drinkers to decipher their underlying motives that might flare into unexpected menace, and practiced in passive aggression of which her interview with Vanity Fair is a classic case study.Wiles defines herself as the child of a raging drunk and it is through that singular lens of her formative experience that she defines her current boss. “I make a specialty of it,” she told the writer Christopher Whipple for hisVanity Fairprofile of the Trump White House chief of staff in one of the eleven interviews she granted him. Donald Trump, she stated, “has an alcoholic’s personality,” though he does not drink. She didn’t stop there, but elaborated that “high-functioning alcoholics or alcoholics in general, their personalities are exaggerated when they drink. And so I’m a little bit of an expert in big personalities.” Trump, she said, “operates [with] a view that there’s nothing he can’t do. Nothing, zero, nothing.”Saying Trump has an “alcoholic’s personality” reveals Wiles’ personal understanding about a megalomaniacal celebrity who fosters pandemonium around himself without any care for others. Her father, Pat Summerall, the great football placekicker and the play-by-play broadcaster of National Football League games on CBS for 40 years, was the original bad daddy. “Alcoholism does bad things to relationships, and so it was with my dad and me,” shesaid. She remembered him as a mostly absentee father and so drunk he “wouldn’t recognize” his granddaughter, which Wiles thought “horrifying.” Alcoholism, she said, is a “disease that clouds your judgment,” and no one, however smart they think they are can “out think addiction.” In 1992, Wiles and her mother staged an intervention to take him to the Betty Ford Drug Rehab Center. She gave him a letterreading, “Dad, the few times we’ve been out in public together recently, I’ve been ashamed we shared the same last name.” That is what she means when she says someone has an “alcoholic’s personality.”Wiles’ descriptions of several of the prominent figures of the Trump second term are cast as pathologies. “Vance’s conversion from Never Trumper to MAGA acolyte, she said, has been ‘sort of political.’ The vice president, she added, has been ‘a conspiracy theorist for a decade.’” Vancerespondedto her comment, “Sometimes I am a conspiracy theorist, but I only believe in the conspiracy theories that are true.” During the 2024 campaign, Vance was the chief proponent of the myth that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio were eating pet cats and dogs. Hejustifiedhis falsehood at the time: “The American media totally ignored this stuff until Donald Trump and I started talking about cat memes. If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that’s what I’m going to do.”Russell Vought, the planner of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 and head of the Office of Management and Budget, Wiles told Whipple, is “a right-wing absolute zealot.” And, he wrote, “When I asked her what she thought of [Elon] Musk reposting a tweet about public sector workers killing millions under Hitler, Stalin, and Mao, she replied: “I think that’s when he’s microdosing”. She claims Musk is “an avowed ketamine [user]”—an “odd, odd duck” and genius megalomaniac—“a complete solo actor”—another addict. (She latertoldthe New York Times that she didn’t have first hand knowledge of his Ketamine use, although Musk has previouslytoldCNN about his medical Ketamine use for depression).Wiles became Trump’s 2024 campaign manager out for blood. She wanted the head of Ron DeSantis. Wiles, a longtime political consultant in Florida, instrumental in the campaigns of Marco Rubio and Rick Scott, was hired in 2019 to right DeSantis’ floundering campaign for governor. Once he won, DiSantis’ wife, Casey, who saw her as a personal threat to her own influence, wanted her cut out, as a close associate of Wiles told me. DeSantis told the Ballard Partners lobbying firm, the largest in Florida, where she worked, to fire her or it would lose its access. She came aboard as chief of Trump’s campaign toeven the score. The campaign against DeSantis was intended not only to defeat him, but exact humiliation. He was depicted in TV ads eating chocolate pudding with his fingers. When he dropped out of the 2024 primaries, Wileswrotehim, “Bye-bye.” Trump promised, “I will be your retribution,” and he was for her.Appointed Trump’s chief of staff, she was hailed as his “Ice Maiden.” She would be a tough taskmaster to control the impulses and whims of a Trump White House who would brook no nonsense. But as she portrays herself in the Whipple interviews, she is invariably the innocent bystander at the circus presiding as an enabler.When she learns that Trump will pardon all the January 6th convicts on Day One, she tries to temper him. “I said, ‘I am on board with the people that were happenstancers or didn’t do anything violent.” “But Trump argued that even the violent offenders had been unfairly treated,” Whipple wrote. Wiles shrugs: “…I sort of got on board.”Wiles’ deputy, James Blair, acknowledges, “There’s so much ego and testosterone around her, there wouldn’t be any room for hers anyway.” She encounters Elon Musk, discovers his drug use and is surprised when he destroys USAID. “I was initially aghast,” she tells Whipple. Trump, she says, is ignorant of the workings of the government. “He doesn’t know the details of these smallish agencies.” She admonishes Musk, “You can’t just lock people out of their offices.” But she is run over. “And so with that attitude, you’re going to break some china,” she says. “But no rational person could think the USAID process was a good one. Nobody.” She does nothing.Then she concedes everything to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr.’s evisceration of public health and science. To Wiles, he’s another pathological case, “quirky Bobby.” But she develops rationales: “He pushes the envelope—some would say too far. But I say in order to get back to the middle, you have to push it too far.”Then she is overwhelmed by Stephen Miller’s crusade for mass deportations and ICE roundups, about whose cruelty she has quiet qualms. “I will concede that we’ve got to look harder at our process for deportation,” she says. She offers excuses about children with cancer and mothers being arrested at immigration courts: “I can’t understand how you make that mistake, but somebody did.” Who is “somebody?” Not the chief of staff.Trump orders the National Guard into cities across the country, prompting cities and states to file lawsuits that claim his actions are unconstitutional. But Wiles complacently suggests that it’s all for the best and will work out in the end. Again, she imagines a happy ending as she helps Trump. “And the idea was to right the ship and then slowly back off. And that’s what we’re doing.” But Trump is not backing off at all and the ship is listing badly.WilesblamesAttorney General Pam Bondi for the attention paid to the Epstein files. “First she gave them binders full of nothingness. And then she said that the witness list, or the client list, was on her desk. There is no client list, and it sure as hell wasn’t on her desk.” Wiles admits that she has read “the Epstein file.” “[Trump] is in the file. And we know he’s in the file. And he’s not in the file doing anything awful.” Trump “was on [Epstein’s] plane…he’s on the manifest. They were, you know, sort of young, single, whatever—I know it’s a passé word but sort of young, single playboys together.” Boys will be boys, even if they are in the 40s and 50s. She admits that Trump has lied about former President Bill Clinton being on Epstein’s infamous island, Little St. James, and any wrongdoing. “The president was wrong about that.” Oh, well.Wiles blames FBI director Kash Patel and his deputy Dan Bongino for the pathological obsession with the Epstein files—and JD Vance. “Because they lived in that world. And the vice president, who’s been a conspiracy theorist for a decade.” She blames deputy attorney general Todd Blanche for interviewing Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s convicted procurer, and transferring her to a lenient federal prison. “It was [Blanche’s] suggestion.” She adds about the transfer: “I don’t know why they moved her. Neither does the president.” The chief of staff is clueless.Wiles’ indiscretion by acknowledging that she has read the Epstein files and concluding Trump and Epstein were “young, single playboys together” may have potentially opened her to become a witness subject to subpoena by Epstein’s victims in their many ongoing lawsuits including against the FBI about any redactions in those files. Wiles may have waived whatever executive privilege she has by speaking on the record on the matter, which in any case is not about her internal communications with the president. She may be asked what she learned about what Epstein and Trump did together as “playboys,” whether the files contain evidence of a financial relationship, and whether Melania is named or depicted. Wiles could also be asked if she spoke about what she saw in the files to any other reporters or writers. She has potentially opened a world of trouble for herself.Wiles opened another can of worms for herself in the interviews when she was asked about Trump’s pattern of retribution in prosecuting his designated enemies. Wiles said in March to Whipple, “We have a loose agreement that the score settling will end before the first 90 days are over.” Whipple returned to ask her in August: “Remember when you said to me months ago that Trump promised to end the revenge and retribution tour after 90 days?” “I don’t think he’s on a retribution tour,” she replied. And then she conceded, “In some cases, it may look like retribution. And there may be an element of that from time to time. Who would blame him? Not me.” Certainly not her. But what about the prosecution of former FBI director James Comey without any evidence in a case that would be eventually thrown out of court? “I mean, people could think itdoeslook vindictive. I can’t tell you why you shouldn’t think that.” So, who is to blame after all if not Trump?Conducting her interviews with Whipple, she misled Trump. She walked out of a meeting with him at one point to see the Vanity Fair writer. “Is this an emergency, that you have to leave?” Trump asked her. “It’s an emergency,” she lied. “It doesn’t involve you.” If Trump didn’t think it was about him, she knew he would not care. He has an “alcoholic’s personality.” She has had a lifetime of tip-toeing around and hiding things from people like him.If any White House aide had behaved as Wiles did with Whipple, that staffer would be either severely admonished or dismissed by the chief of staff. But James Baker doesn’t live there anymore. As the chief of staff to the worst president in American history, Wiles ends her interviews concerned with distancing herself. “So no, I’m not an enabler,” she says. “I’m also not a bitch. I try to be thoughtful about what I even engage in. I guess time will tell whether I’ve been effective.”Wiles herself introduces the therapeutic notion of the “enabler.” The role is that of someone who does not intervene to curb an “alcoholic’s personality,” unlike as she ultimately did to stop her father’s self-destructive spiral. She still thinks of herself as the alcoholic’s daughter, who has the choices of acquiescing, enabling or intervening.As chief of staff, she has stifled her temptation to intervene. She knows it would be in vain and endanger her. In her interviews with Whipple, she presents herself as a manifestation of learned helplessness. But she may know instinctively that Trump, humiliated by her disclosures, might find a way slowly to humiliate her until she resigns. Or were the interviews themselves her retribution for the ineffectiveness he imposes on her?Sidney Blumenthal, former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln:A Self-Made Man,Wrestling With His AngelandAll the Powers of Earth.

Investors chose real gold in 2025Nils PratleyGold is up 70% while the cryptocurrency is down 6% after it failed to bounce back from a rapid October sell-offTue 23 Dec 2025 12.53 ESTLast modified on Tue 23 Dec 2025 15.02 ESTShareAnother week, another record high for the price of gold. And another blow to the bitcoin fan club’s hopeful thesis about owning “digital gold”. This year has been hard for the bitcoin brigade: while real gold soared in value, their cryptocurrency didn’t. Correlation went out of the window.Goldis up 70% so far in dollar terms; bitcoin is down 6%.In theory, conditions should have been perfect for bitcoin if, like gold, it is supposed to be a store of value in uncertain times. Geopolitical tensions have been high all year, withDonald Trump’s unclear intentions towards Venezuelanow added to the mix. Or, if you take the view that bitcoin is a hedge against currency debasement by governments, the news flow ought to have been encouraging. The US budget deficit remains enormous: the International Monetary Fund predicts thecountry’s debts will climb from 125% to 143% of annual income by 2030, or more than Greece and Italy.Alternatively, if bitcoin is meant to be a vehicle for tech-related enthusiasm, the artificial intelligence revolution should have offered semi-helpful breezes. Beyond the debate about a bubble in AI assets, chipmaker Nvidia’s share price is still up by a third since January.Meanwhile, the regulatory backdrop was outright supportive.Crypto exchange-traded fundsare now marketed by mainstream financial houses. The crypto-cautious UK financial regulator has published proposals to regulate many areas of the crypto market.Therein – perhaps – lies half an explanation.Bitcoinis simply more boring now that it has been incorporated into the financial mainstream. If JP Morgan and BlackRock are referring to bitcoin as a regular class of asset, something of the revolutionary spirit is lost. Google searches for “bitcoin” are merely steady these days. Even Elon Musk has other things to tweet about.Graph showing comparative performance of bitcoin and gold in 2025As the chart shows, the paths of gold and bitcoin only properly diverged in October during a rapid sell-off in the latter. Precisely what happened on 10 October is still debated, but large selling by leveraged holders of bitcoin into a thin market, in reaction to a Trump tariff threat towards China, is part of the story. The point, though, is that bitcoin didn’t bounce back afterwards, as stocks and precious metals did. The crypto market as a whole shedmore than $1tn of value in six weeks. From a high of $126,000 in early October, bitcoin now stands at roughly $87,000.In a research note a month ago, Deutsche Bank analysts offered five factors as an explanation of the fall: a broader “risk-off” sentiment in markets in October, hawkish signals on interest rates from the Federal Reserve, less regulatory momentum than expected, thin liquidity and outflows from institutions, and profit-taking by long-term holders.Its conclusion: “Whether bitcoin stabilises after this correction remains uncertain. Unlike prior crashes, driven primarily by retail speculation, this year’s downturn has occurred amid substantial institutional participation, policy developments and global macro trends.”For true bitcoin believers every setback is a buying opportunity. Their faith tends to be unshakable and, given how the cryptocurrency has recovered from falls in previous years, one can’t say they are definitely wrong.Yet it does also feel as if something cracked this year. When demand was high for a proper defensive hedge, investors preferred gold (and silver, which performed even better) over computer code that has failed to take off as a medium of exchange. And the year ends with questions being asked about the real depth of the market for bitcoin and its imitators. The speculative buzz ain’t what it used to be.Explore more on these topicsBusinessNils Pratley on financeBitcoinCryptocurrenciesGoldCommoditiesE-commerceInvestment fundscommentShareReuse this content"

My boys will wake me up at the crack of dawn then tumble downstairs, falling over each other, to find presents under the tree. As the tearing of wrapping paper cross-fades into screams of excitement, for a moment, everything feels exactly as it should. Except for one subtle difference: my children have never believed in Santa.This isn’t the result of an “I don’t want to lie to my children” ideology or some Scroogist attempt to be different. It’s a deliberate choice I have made, one that is rooted in fear. Behind the fairy lights and goodwill of Christmas lurk financial demands that many families cannot meet. According to a YouGov poll for debt charityStep Changeearlier this month, about one in three adults with children will struggle to afford Christmas this year. For many, the festive season brings anxiety, overdrafts and guilt rather than joy.Fed up with Father Christmas getting all the credit? Join the club | Suzy PrinceRead moreThis is not an accidental or unfortunate side-effect of Christmas. It is what I call “the Santa debt trap”, whereby a cultural myth does not encourage generosity, it creates a moral economy in which parents feel judged by their ability to buy. Christmas becomes a test, and going into debt is how many people pass it.Christmas is a weird time for me, as I grew up in children’s homes. It left a particular stain that no amount of therapy will erase. The feeling that I could lose everything at any minute has never quite left me. Security never feels entirely secure. It feels borrowed. Every year so far, despite being financially stable, I have lived with the quiet dread that this will be the year a crisisdestroys everything.I know where this fear comes from. Being a care leaver means living with the knowledge that if it all went wrong, there would be nowhere to go. No door to knock on, no kitchen floor to collapse on, no bed to sleep in. I have no place of last resort.That fear sharpens the cruelty of the myth of Father Christmas. We all know the story: “He’s making a list, checking it twice; gonna find out who’s naughty or nice.” This isn’t harmless fun, this is moral messaging backed by money. It tells children that all they need do is be good and their every wish will be granted regardless of the cost, and it puts immense pressure on parents who feel that a failure to deliver will shatter their children’s self-esteem.I decided early on that my children wouldn’t believe in St Nick because I didn’t want to hurt them. If money runs out, if a crisis hits, if Christmas isn’t affordable one year, what exactly am I supposed to say? Santa judged them naughty because of my lack of disposable income? No matter what explanation I give, that is what they’re going to believe. So I don’t blame the families who go into debt to avoid it.So far, I’ve been lucky. I’ve made Christmas work. People tell me I shouldn’t let my insecurities shape my children’s lives. Maybe they’re right. What they’re really saying is that I should quietly participate so my children don’t ruin their children’s magic. But I’ve seen the devastation this kind of debt does to families. There is nothing magical about that.Don’t get me wrong, Father Christmas still exists in my children’s minds because he’s unavoidable. He’s in school, in shop windows and on the lips of every adult they come across at this time of year. But we are truthful about who he is: he is part of a story people act out, no different from Halloween or fairytales. My children still feel the excitement. They get presents, but not too many. And crucially they know the truth: that their gifts come from their family, not a mythical old guy in a red coat with unlimited resources.I work in recording studios, which means I’m sometimes away for long stretches. My children don’t fully understand why. But they need to know that my absence has value, that my labour matters and that sacrifice has meaning. If I hand the credit for that work to a fictional man with a white beard, what lesson does that teach? Not wonder, but entitlement. Not gratitude, but detachment from reality.Christmas doesn’t need Santa to be joyful. What it needs is honesty. If a myth requires families to bankrupt themselves to sustain it, then it isn’t magic. It’s exploitation wrapped up as tradition. At a time when millions are struggling to survive, perhaps the most radical thing we could do this Christmas would be to stop pretending that poverty is a personal failing – and stop teaching our children that money falls down the chimney.Matt Taylor is a writer, music producer and author of the Underclass Hero Substack newsletterExplore more on these topicsChristmasOpinionPovertySocial exclusioncommentShareReuse this content"

But now, when it comes to Bari Weiss as the editor in chief ofCBSNews, there is no longer any doubt.A broadcast-news neophyte, Weiss has no business in that exalted role. She proved that beyond any remaining doubt last weekend, pulling a powerful and important piece of journalism just days before it was due to air, charging that it wasn’t ready. Whatever her claims about the story’s supposed flaws, this looks like a clear case of censorship-by-editor to protect the interests of powerful, rich and influential people.The tug-of-war over CNN shows how dysfunctional US media has become | Margaret SullivanRead moreThe 60 Minutes piece – about the brutal conditions at an El Salvador prison where theTrump administrationhas sent Venezuelan migrants without due process – had already been thoroughly edited, fact-checked and sent through the network’s standards desk and its legal department. The story was promoted and scheduled, and trailers for it were getting millions of views.I’m less bothered by the screw-ups in this situation – for example, the segment is already all over the internet as, essentially, a Canadian bootleg – than I am by her apparent willingness to use her position to protect the powerful and take care of business for the oligarchy. Which appears to be precisely what she was hired to do.Journalism is supposed to “afflict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted”, but Weiss seems to have it backwards.I can’t know what’s in her mind, of course, but I know her actions – her gaslighting about how it would be such a disservice to the public to publish this supposedly incomplete piece, and her ridiculous offer to provide a storied reporting staff with a couple of phone numbers of highly placed Trump officials.Weiss insists that the story needs Trump administration comment before it can run.But correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi has argued – eloquently and persuasively – that 60 Minutes repeatedly sought substantive comment and was turned down. In a memorable phrase, Alfonsi charges that if that’s an acceptable reason for spiking a story, it’s tantamount to giving the government a “kill switch” for any story they don’t like. Just refuse to comment, and it dies on the vine.It is also nonsensical of Weiss to suggest – again, gaslighting – that the piece somehow lacked sufficient newsworthiness because other news organizations had reported on the prison earlier.As if to counter this specious claim, a federal judge this week ordered the Trump administration to submit plans to return the migrants to the US or give them a hearing. This story is hardly old news.What’s more, hearing directly from an abused migrant on camera, getting his description of the torture and seeing the images of inhumane treatment is striking and newsworthy. TV brings it home, quite literally.Again, I don’t know what’s inside Weiss’s head – but I do know the context. In an unusual chain of command, Weiss reports directly to David Ellison, the son of Larry Ellison, a Trump buddy and one of the world’s richest people.The Ellisons control CBS’s parent company, Paramount Skydance, which is making an aggressive effort to buy Warner Brothers Discovery. They would have to overcome an offer from Netflix that has already been accepted.How? Well, federal regulators (and therefore Trump, who has expressed his interest) would, naturally, have some sway over who succeeds.The Ellisons surely wouldn’t want to antagonize anyone at this critical moment. And notably, if Paramount prevails, they would control CNN, and could do there what they’re doing at CBS News – they could install new editorial leadership that’s more agreeable. Trump has complained bitterly for years about CNN; this matters to him.Conveniently, there’s a blueprint available for how to cozy up to Trump by buckling. A few months ago, as an earlier Paramount merger was on the line, the company chose to settle a frivolous legal claim by Trump over 60 Minutes’ routine editing of a pre-election interview with Kamala Harris.Stephen Colbert, you might recall, termed this a “big, fat bribe”. Then his late-night show was canceled, effective next spring. Ratings, don’t you know?Bari Weiss is a weird and worrisome choice as top editor for CBS News | Margaret SullivanRead moreTrump received his settlement along with a side order of bragging rights, and a few weeks later, the Paramount merger went through. Yes, everybody got theirs – except the public and the CBS News staff.As editor in chief, of course, Weiss has the power to make the decision she did. That comes with the job.But it doesn’t make her decision right. It wasn’t. She’s damaged the institution she’s supposed to be the steward of and, far less importantly, hurt her own reputation. Inadvertently, she has also made sure that far more people are aware of this story, and the horrible underlying situation, than if the story had simply run as planned.At this point, Weiss ought to cut her losses, green-light the piece, and try to start acting like an editor – not like a cog in the machine of authoritarian politics and oligarchy.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsCBSOpinionTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

At this time of year, so many people know about thatTue 23 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 23 Dec 2025 13.34 ESTShareThere is not one saga I have been more invested in this year than the Beckham family feud. In case you are not as shamelessly showbiz-pilled as I am, this is a drama that parses like something between the parable of the prodigal son andCatherine de Medici’s tension with her daughter-in-law Mary, Queen of Scots.It seems that, after years of a trying in-law dynamic, relations between the Beckham family and their first-born, Brooklyn, and his wife,the heiress Nicola Peltz, have soured. Brooklyn has been repeatedly and conspicuously absent from all the family group shots on Instagram and, most notably, mumVictoria’s Netflix documentary, and dad David’s 50th birthday celebrations and knighthood ceremony (and if you know how long Dave’s beenauditioning for that honour, you’ll know that this was the biggest indicator of catastrophe).The roots of the feud allegedly lie in Peltz notwearing a dressfrom Victoria’s eponymous fashion label for her wedding (and an indication that the Peltz-Beckhams hadn’t been happy with the whole affair came when they renewed their vows just three years later, with some reports claiming that the Beckham family found out about it when the rest of us did). Throw in other factors, such as the Peltz family patriarch being aTrump-supportingbillionaire, the perennially directionless Brooklyn having had morerandom jobsthan Homer Simpson, and anoverzealous friendwho spills too much in online comments sections, and this all has the ingredients of a full-blown soap opera. Though I’ve also found it strangely affecting; every time Victoria (whom I love) made an Instagram post without Brooklyn, I found myself thinking: “Please, Brooklyn, just come back home!”It’s now reached fever pitch with Brooklyn blocking his entire family on Instagram – as revealed by his brother,Cruz, who responded to a Daily Mail storythat wrongly claimed that his mother and father had unfollowed their son. No more rumours, speculation, shady comments – finally a member of the firm has spoken directly, and acknowledged the drama that brands as well cultivated as the Beckhams’ are meant to ignore.Following this latest development, I had two thoughts. One more audaciously gossipy: if Cruz has finally spoken, in support of his parents, might we get a “Megxit”-style tell-all sitdown where Brooklyn and Nicola dish dish dish to get the upper hand on the narrative? The other is more sympathetic: that this family drama has exploded around Christmastime gets to the heart of why it’s been so compelling.View image in fullscreenBrooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz at a basketball game between the Los Angeles Clippers and the Denver Nuggets, 24 April 2025 Inglewood, California.Photograph: Allen Berezovsky/Getty ImagesAccording to reports(not that we need them to form that conclusion), Brooklyn will be spending his Christmas with the Peltzes, shunning an olive branch extended by David and Victoria. Where a grown married man spends his yuletide should hardly cause a stir, yet it being such a patent mark of the breakdown of their relationship is upsetting, isn’t it? The family home is a more intimate and fragile setting than Windsor Castle orL’Ami Louis. And I think it speaks to the emotions of this season that often go unspoken: that beyond the postcard pictures of togetherness and board games, family breakdown, dysfunction and absence are thrown into sharp relief during the Christmas period.I know this well. I love my family very much. But since my fatherpassed away in 2016, Christmas has been a challenge, and something I’ve viewed as an inconvenience and a painful reminder of how our family dynamic has been irrevocably changed. I still don’t like to open Instagram on Christmas Day to see all the smiling families with a healthy, greying man at the head of the table. What has abillionaire v millionairefamilywargot to do with my dead dad? Nothing much. Yet I think anyone can relate to that feeling of things not quite being the same, grieving lost relationships, or wondering if you’ll ever be happy during this season again. No doubt the Beckhams will still have a Christmas as wonderful as money can buy – they’ve been all smiles at their milestone events – but the occasion will surely be tinged with sadness and regret because of Brooklyn’s estrangement.Every Christmas since its release in 2021, I’ve watched Spencer, Pablo Larraín’s historical psychodrama set during Christmas of 1991, in which Diana, Princess of Wales (Kristen Stewart), contemplates leaving Charles and liberating herself from the royal family. Christmas is ultimately a festival for families whose members like each other and have no problems. Larraín’s Diana is an avatar for those with more complex feelings, who have moments of wanting to abscond from the table.Viewing Spencer has joined another private tradition of mine, which is to watchThe Muppet Christmas Carol, so I have one as a reminder of happier moments of my childhood, and one to absorb the feelings of seasonal melancholy. I’m sure the Beckhams will have their own ways of coping and, before this inevitably gets nastier, maybe they’ll find some solace in reflecting on when their unit was more whole.Anyway, all of this is to say that beyond the tabloid gossip, this feud has engrossed me this year because it’s been a very human story. I can’t get on my soapbox since I am, and will continue to be, the audience for this, but I can’t help but feel for the pain of having your family fallouts publicly picked over, with the rest of us trying to determine who the real villain is, and projecting our own narratives. So I’m wishing a good Christmas to the Beckhams, and all of us who face heartbreak over and over again this season.Jason Okundaye is an assistant opinion editor at the Guardian and the author ofRevolutionary ActsDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But acts of courage and solidarity can point the way to a better futureTue 23 Dec 2025 13.30 ESTLast modified on Tue 23 Dec 2025 13.56 ESTShareIn one of his lastsermons, the great Christian theologian and philosopher Paul Tillich asked: “Do we have a right to hope?” As an army chaplain to German forces during the first world war and a refugee from Nazi Germany, Tillich had witnessed first-hand some of the horrors of the 20th century. But his answer to the question he posed in 1965 was yes. Nobody could live without hope, Tillich told his Harvard audience, even if it led “through the narrows of a painful and courageous ‘in-spite-of’”.Sixty years on, a similar spirit of defiant optimism is needed to navigate our own era of conflict and anxiety. The fourth anniversary of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is approaching, and dark political forces menace the social fabric of western liberal democracies. More widely, a fracturing multilateral order is delivering a more unstable and threatening world.According to areportpublished in June by the Peace Research Institute Oslo, the number of state‑based conflicts in 2024 was higher than at any time since 1946. In Gaza, the declaration of a ceasefire in October has brought partial relief. But amid the ruins, a suffering populationremainsscandalously short of food and cruelly exposed to the ravages of winter. In Sudan, a relentless and brutal civil war continues to be stoked by outside powers in pursuit of their own interests. The shocking terror attacks atBondi beachand in Manchester, and amercifully foiledIslamist plot to launch another attack on British soil, confirm a global rise in antisemitism following the Hamas massacre of 7 October and Israel’s war in Gaza.Across Europe, fear of conflict is more acute than at any point since the cold war tensions of the 1980s. In her first major speech as the head of MI6, Blaise Metreweliannounceda new “age of uncertainty” as Russia and other hostile states refine techniques of hybrid warfare. An end-of-yearaddressby the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, in which he suggested that Russia could attack the west within five years, reflected the increasingly febrile mood of the times.Yet it remains possible to find reasons in the present to believe in better human futures. The selflessness and remarkable courage shown by Boris and Sofia Gurman, a Jewish couple, and Ahmed al-Ahmed, a Muslim, in confronting the Bondi beach gunmen, was inspiring. So too the resolve and endurance of Ukrainians who have livedunderRussian bombardment since February 2022.In Sudan, the resilience anddedicationof local volunteers has kept community kitchens going across the country, offering a lifeline amid a desperate hunger crisis. As Tillichobservedin a radio broadcast during the second world war: “Love breaks out of the prison of individualism and nationalist stupidity. Love goes to another person, even one with a different language or of a different race, and returns from him richer.”A sense of the power of collective human endeavour will be felt in quite another way on Wednesday as millions tune in to the Christmas Eveserviceat King’s College, Cambridge. The choral beauty of theFestival of Nine Lessons and Carolsmarks for many households the true beginning of the season of peace and goodwill. But it too was conceived against the terrible backdrop of war.Eric Milner-White, who planned the first service as the dean of King’s in 1918, served, like Tillich, as an army chaplain on the western front. Now, as then, the world needs a message of hope in the darkness.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Its launch is timely: more than 1 billion chickens andaround 8 million turkeysare reared each year – with many of the latter slaughtered in the run-up to Christmas. Winter is also peak season for pet abandonments, with animal charities particularly fearful this year, given thealready high numbersof dogs and cats being dumped.Pledges to end the use of cages for laying hens, and cramped farrowing crates for pigs, will be welcomed by all who object to animal cruelty. So will a proposal to replace thecarbon dioxide stunningof pigs with an alternative that is less distressing for them. New rules for farmed fish are also on the way. Until now, fish have been largely excluded from the evolving set of regulations aimed at minimising suffering at the point of slaughter.Most European countries already protect breeding hares from hunters by making it illegal to kill these beautiful animals during the months when they rear their young. The announcement of asimilar measure for Englandis overdue. As the Conservative former environment secretary George Eustice told the Guardian, “even the Victorians recognised the need for a close season” when shooting hares is banned.Pledges to ban snare traps and trail hunting – where hounds chase a scent rather than a fox – were in Labour’s manifesto. Trail hunting is already banned in Scotland, and its continuation in England was a compromise when foxhunting was outlawed. Ministers will need to tread carefully if they want to avoid anotherrow with countryside organisationsand their allies – followingthe U-turn this weekon inheritance tax, which will now apply to farms worth £2.5m rather than £1m. Rightly, the strategy acknowledges the potential for adverse impacts on farmers from higher welfare standards. It pledges that trade policy will be used to protect them if lower-welfare imports gain an “unfair advantage”.When it comes to pets, it is the interests of owners that need to be balanced with animal welfare. With an estimated 10.6 million dogs across the UK, therenters’ rights billincludes a provision that ought to make it easier for private tenants in England to keep pets. But the pet boom has brought problems too. A new registration scheme for dog breeders aimed at stamping out maltreatment, and a review of international rescue schemes, are sensible steps. But enforcement will be needed to back any changes up. Unless councils and other bodies are equipped for inspections and investigations, animals will continue to suffer.As ministers know, animal welfare is popular with the public. Trickier issues such as thedamage to wildlifecaused by dogs andcats, carbon emissions fromintensive livestock farmingand the need toreduce overall meat consumptionare ducked in a strategy that focuses on the recognition of animals as sentient beings. There is a great deal here that is subject to consultation and may take years to come into force. The other UK nations are already ahead in some regards. Electric shock collars for cats and dogs, for example, were banned in Wales in 2010. But ministers are right to highlight the issues. Animals should be treated with compassion, not cruelty. In a world that is changing rapidly for them as well as for humans, the law needs to keep up.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The ethical issues are well established: respect for consent, confidentiality, assessment of mental capacity and vigilance for coercion within the doctor-patient relationship.These prisoners have not faced trial, with some dates set as late as 2027. The damaging effects of prolonged remand on mental health are well known. In this context, voluntary total fasting may be perceived as their only means of protest against detention, so a valid advanced directive, which provides instructions for their medical management when they lose mental capacity, would be essential.Were we responsible for their care, we would refuse to discharge them from hospital unless the patient wished to return to prison, a stance that emerged after the 1989 anti-apartheid hunger strikes and became known as the “Kalk refusal”. It was so called after one of us, as a physician in a Johannesburg hospital, invoked medical ethics to refuse to release hunger-striking detainees back into state custody. The moral burden on healthcare staff should not be underestimated. Following the death of the IRAhunger striker Bobby Sandsin 1981, his doctor later took his own life.Dr David NichollConsultant neurologist, Hagley, WorcestershireDr John KalkRetired consultant physician, OxfordComments by the prisons minister, Lord Timpson, in relation to the Palestine hunger strikers, that “We are very experienced at dealing with hunger strikes … we have averaged over 200 hunger strike incidents every year and the processes that we have are well-established and they work very well”, are misleading and dangerously complacent (Minister says government not mistreating Palestine Action activists on hunger strike, 18 December). The 200-plus “incidents” he refers to are brief periods of food refusal by individual inmates in prison or immigration removal centres, which, as Dr Ian Miller states in your interview with one of the hunger strikers, Teuta Hoxha,tend to be “quickly abandoned” (‘It feels like being suffocated’: Palestine Action activist in HMP Peterborough vows to continue hunger strike, 20 December).This hunger strike is very different. It is a coordinated political act by a group of highly motivated and committed activists, and is much more akin to the IRA hunger strike in 1981, when 10 prisoners died. One of them, Martin Hurson, died after 46 days. Of thecurrent hunger strikers, Qesser Zuhrah and Amu Gib are now on day 51, Heba Muraisi day 50, Teuta Hoxha day 45, Kamran Ahmed day 44 and Lewie Chiaramello is on day 17.Guidance on themedical management of hunger strikingin British prisons concentrates on the initial period, leaving prison healthcare staff unclear about appropriate monitoring and thresholds for escalation in more advanced stages. The risks of permanent, severe damage to the health of the hunger strikers, and indeed of them dying, are now extremely high, no matter Lord Timpson’s bland reassurances.I call on the government to act now, before thegrim warningof the hunger strikers’ lawyers is realised, that “young British citizens will die in prison, having never even been convicted of an offence”.Dr Jonathan FluxmanRetired GP, LondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

They have the economic wherewithal to buy what they want, when they want, so the sense of special occasion, and gratitude, is lost.However, I’d counter that the reason many people have stopped buying presents for partners is precisely because they do appreciate how lucky they are, and see no need for the performative gift-buying for a person who needs, or wants, very little. Deciding not to add to your possessions for the sake of it isn’t ungrateful, and certainly doesn’t preclude giving gifts to others that are needed, wanted and appreciated. I love the undiluted delight on the face of a person who’s just received the perfect gift, however small. I also know that at 55, with a steady income and an established home, there’s very little practical stuff I need, and relatively few affordable treats I can’t afford at intervals through the year.Yes, that means I’m more fortunate than many others, but it doesn’t mean I’m unaware of that fact. I still love to get presents for others, and still love to receive gifts – but if someone said to me they didn’t want anything, I wouldn’t assume they were unaware of the people who do wait forChristmasand birthdays for the things they need. I’d also point out that very often, the people who say they’re not doing gifts follow that up with, “Instead, we’re donating to…”, thereby contributing towards supporting those who really do need the things we may take for granted at Christmas.Becky KennedyWatford, HertfordshireI can think of lots of reasons people might not “do” presents this year, and not one is because a person already has “Seventeen [candles] already, none ever lit”. They may think Christmas has become far too commercialised. They may have less disposable money than other people think. They may say it to spare other people the embarrassment of having to reciprocate with presents they can’t afford. They may be secretly donating to food banks and charities instead. No one should feel obliged to buy presents, and honest conversations need to be had.Laura MatthewsWest Wickham, LondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

What is less known, but particularly relevant in these immigration-sensitive times, is the fate of Camillo Rea, Chris’s grandfather, who founded the ice-cream cafes in 1930s Middlesbrough.After Italy declared war on Britain in June 1940, Winston Churchill ordered the arrest of almost all Italian men living in Britain.Thirteen men from Teesside, including Camillo, were transported to Liverpool and the SS Arandora Star to be interned in Canada. During the voyage the ship was torpedoed, with the loss of 850 lives, including 11 men from Teesside, one of whom was Camillo.Andrew KeeleyWarrington, CheshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

This fourth Ashes Test was tipped to top that remarkable figure potentially but that will hinge on it similarly going the distance. It also needs the locals to be energised still bya series that has already been wonby their team – even if simply beating the old enemy is usually enough.Rob Key to investigate England’s ‘stag do’ drinking habits on Noosa mid-Ashes breakRead moreEngland lasted just seven sessions herefour years ago, the match settled before lunch on day three when Scott Boland ran through them on debut like a bull down the streets of Pamplona. The statue that Mark Howard called for on commentary is yet to materialise but memories of England’s gory innings defeat come flooding back when walking through Yarra Park to the ground.That was also a rare live Boxing Day Ashes Test, albeit only because the pandemic forced the series to start later. This time England are 3-0 down after seeing their challenge disintegrate in just 11 days and they are playing for a combination of pride, World Test Championship points and, as Rob Keyand Brendon McCullumhave both admitted in recent days, potentially jobs.Going by some of their post-match comments after the 82-run win in Adelaide, Australia’s hunger for 5-0 is real. Achieving this would say even more about their resilience. Having battled with high-profile absentees throughout the series, Pat Cummins is now out for the remainder – back rested after that remarkable one-Test cameo – and likewise Nathan Lyon with a torn hamstring.View image in fullscreenBrendon McCullum is under pressure as England head coach with the series already lost before arriving in Melbourne for the Boxing Day Test.Photograph: William West/AFP/Getty ImagesFor England the test of resilience will chiefly be between the ears and may be instructive as to whether McCullum’s “horse-whispering” is still registering with his charges. Key, the team director, still believes in his man, calling him a “bloody good coach” on Tuesday. Although having stuck everything on him last year with a contract extension, he could hardly say otherwise.There may well be a change of personnel among them. Given they have shaken up the bowling attack already in this series, Key slightly gave the game away here. Without naming names, but while holding his hands up to the myriad things that have gone wrong so far on the trip, he admitted to wondering whether changes to the side should have come sooner.The sight of Ollie Pope doing laps of the vast MCG outfield on Tuesday while others were working in the nets pointed to a tap on the shoulder here, his tour having slightly unravelled since a deceptively calm 46on the opening day in Perth. Though a willing conscript to the team’s attacking mantra, the 27-year-old seems the obvious one to make way from a faltering top three that has in turn heaped pressure on the middle order.Unless England bring in an extra bowler – not their style so far, despite what this asks of Ben Stokes, physically – this points to a return for Jacob Bethell, a year on from a promising debut in New Zealand but with little form to speak of since. It represents a huge task for a 22-year-old still awaiting his maiden first-class century, even before factoring in a 90,000-strong crowd.View image in fullscreenJacob Bethell looks likely to replace Ollie Pope in England’s XI for the fourth Test.Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty Images“He is going to be a very good player,” said Key, without confirming Bethell’s spot. “Heisa very good player. And I have no issue with him being able to go out and play a match-winning innings in an Ashes Test for us, if that’s Boxing Day. I wouldn’t be worried about that. Do I think it’d be easy? No.”England should have invested in Bethell during the Test summer by making the switch with Pope sooner. As it is, despitemaking his first senior hundredin a one-day international against South Africa, his season was largely a wasted one. Key made a passing remark about a lack of opportunities at Warwickshire, which, given he released the left-hander for just one County Championship game, may trigger a fair bit of chuntering at Edgbaston.Either way, it would represent another punt by a regime with a gambler’s streak that has started to see fewer and fewer payouts. No Cummins is unlikely to mean any let-up, not least with Boland back on his home ground, the impossibly limber Mitchell Starc set to push through once more, and the fast outswing of Jhye Richardson given a chance to join them.With McCullum frustrated that England were so cautious against Lyon during the first innings in Adelaide, only bringing out the sweep in the second, one area to exploit could be his replacement. Todd Murphy, another off-spinner, was attacked by them during the 2023 Ashes – even if that series seems a long time ago now.Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26The AshesEngland cricket teamAustralia cricket teamAustralia sportCricketBrendon McCullumfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But Marc Guéhi had other ideas and his goal in the fifth minute of stoppage time took this rematch of last year’s quarter-final to penalties. The first 15 were all successful before the unfortunate Lacroix saw his spot kick saved by Kepa Arrizabalaga to sendArsenalthrough by the skin of their teeth.“We conceded the goal and it was emotionally tough to accept after the way the game went,” said a relieved Arteta. “But I think the margin should have been much bigger. That should have been three or four and then you’re not worried about what happens in the last minute.”Of the two sides it was Arsenal who had fared better from Palace’s request to reschedule this game because of their European commitments, with Arteta able to make eight changes to the team who held their nerve in the win away at Everton on Saturday night. But just like last year at this stage against Palace, it needed the arrival of big guns Martin Ødegaard and Bukayo Saka after half-time to finally find the breakthrough before Guéhi’s late equaliser.“I’m delighted with the second-half performance today, especially after the first-half performance, it was really bad,” said Glasner. “For us it’s important to build on the second-half performance and also show great character again.”View image in fullscreenMarc Guéhi slides home an equaliser in the 95th minute to take the quarter-final to penalties.Photograph: Alex Pantling/Getty ImagesThe Palace manager admitted in the buildup that he had no choice but to select virtually an identical side to the one who were hammered by Leeds on Saturday night, although teenager Jaydee Canvot started in an unfamiliar role at right wingback and was given a torrid time by Gabriel Martinelli. To underline just how hectic things have been for Palace, this was Guéhi’s 31st start of the campaign already for club and country. By contrast, Gabriel Jesus has had to wait 345 days for his first since suffering an ACL injury against Manchester United in January. The timing of that was particularly cruel given that the Brazil striker had been on a hot run of form that was kickstarted by his hat-trick against Palace in this competition. It was apt that he should bring up a century of appearances for Arsenal against the same opponents.The jury is still very much out on Arsenal’s £64m signing Viktor Gyökeres so Jesus must have sensed an opportunity to impress and would have capped his performance with a goal had it not been for Benítez.A free signing from PSV Eindhoven in the summer, the Argentine has had to play second fiddle to Dean Henderson but he showed he is a more than able deputy. He was called into action in the third minute when Martinelli set up Noni Madueke, although the England forward could only shoot weakly. Tyrick Mitchell fired over after a brilliant pass around the corner from Jean-Philippe Mateta but that was as close as Palace would come in the first half as Arsenal cranked up the pressure.Martinelli was off target when they failed to clear a corner before Madueke forced Benítez into another save. Not for the last time, Canvot was left for dead by Martinelli when he delivered a cross on to the forehead of Jesus but again the Palace goalkeeper was up to the task. Only a last-ditch clearance from Richards denied Jesus another sight of goal as Arsenal kept knocking on the door with an onslaught of long throws and set pieces.View image in fullscreenWalter Benítez concedes an own goal scored by Crystal Palace’s Maxence Lacroix.Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty ImagesPalace conceded four against Leeds but were somehow able to stand firm until half-time thanks to some heroic defending and Arsenal’s wastefulness. It was no surprise to see Canvot hooked for the vastly more experienced Nathaniel Clyne. Palace immediately looked more competitive and began the second half with renewed belief. There was a long delay when Richards was carried off after trying to challenge Jesus for a header that went inches wide, which will be of major concern for Palace given their busy schedule. He ended up watching the penalty shootout on crutches but the American’s departure was the precursor to a dramatic finale.Arsenal needed William Saliba to slide in and take the ball off Mateta’s toe before the resulting corner was blocked on the line. At the other end, Benítez saved yet again from Jesus and the ball was eventually deflected past the despairing goalkeeper off Lacroix’s toe after more pinball in the box. Palace looked totally deflated but somehow found a way back when Guéhi tapped in after Jefferson Lerma won a header from Adam Wharton’s free-kick. Declan Rice could have won it even later but was once again denied by Benítez, with even more drama reserved for an epic shootout.Explore more on these topicsCarabao CupArsenalCrystal Palacematch reportsShareReuse this content"

The clause is made up of a £60m fixed fee and £5m in add-ons. Nothing has been agreed yet.João Pedro rescues Chelsea draw as Newcastle squander two-goal leadRead moreChelsea explored the conditions of a deal on Tuesday and sought information on the Ghanaian’s wage demands. They quickly withdrew their interest, having decided they are content with their current attacking options, and have left it to rival clubs to agree terms with Semenyo.Liverpool have tracked Semenyo for a while and could try to sign a forward afterlosing Alexander Isak to a broken leg. United have long held an interest in the 25-year-old and have made an attempt to lure him. As it stands, though, City appear the likeliest to win the race. Rival clubs believe that Semenyo, who has eight goals and three assists in the Premier League this season, will join Pep Guardiola’s side and boost their title chances. Semenyo has already rebuffed interest from Tottenham.Bournemouth signed Semenyo from Bristol City two years ago and have seen him develop into one of the best players in England. Andoni Iraola hopes to keep Semenyo for the rest of the season but Bournemouth have show they arenot averse to selling their best players.“I understand that there is a lot of noise around Antoine,” Iraola, said. “If you ask me, I don’t want to lose him, definitely don’t want to lose him. But like we always say, every time the market opens, you never know what’s going to happen.“He has had moments where he hasn’t scored and has still been very valuable for us. At the end, we demand not only the numbers, but he gives us a lot of things. It’s no secret he is a massive player for us.”Explore more on these topicsManchester CityBournemouthLiverpoolManchester UnitedChelseaTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

He joinedthe rival tour in 2022and won five events over four seasons – he was also the first LIV player to win a major atthe 2023 PGA Championship.LIVGolfposted an announcement to its website under a statement that Talor Gooch is the new captain of the Smash team that Koepka had led. Scott O’Neil, the new CEO of LIV, said Koepka and LIV “amicably and mutually agreed” that Koepka will no longer compete after the 2025 season.“Brooks is prioritising the needs of his family and staying closer to home,” O’Neil said. “We appreciate the significant impact he has had on the game and wish him continued success, both on and off the course.”ThePGA Tourpolicy banning players who have joined the rival league requires them to sit out for one year from their last participation. Koepka began his career on the European tour and would have access to play there. LIV ended its season on 24 August.The PGA Tour, while not offering any substance, took the rare step of acknowledging the move involving a player no longer a member. “Brooks Koepka is a highly accomplished professional, and we wish him and his family continued success,” the tour said in a statement. “The PGA Tour continues to offer the best professional golfers the most competitive, challenging and lucrative environment in which to pursue greatness.”“Brooks Koepka will be stepping away from LIV Golf,” read a statement from Koepka’s representatives. “Family has always guided Brooks’ decisions, and he feels this is the right moment to spend more time at home.“Brooks remains passionate about the game of golf and will keep fans updated on what’s ahead,” the statement concluded.Explore more on these topicsBrooks KoepkaLIV Golf SeriesGolfPGA TournewsShareReuse this content"

Their joy lasted just two minutes, though as Nigeria went back in front when Lookman twisted his marker around before unleashing a shot from 25 yards that arrowed into the far corner of the net.Tanzania rallied late on in search of an equaliser and a stretching Kelvin John was inches away from a touch that would have sent the ball into an empty net, before Ibrahim Hamad fired wildly over the bar from close range.In Tangier, Nicolas Jackson scored twice asSenegalgot their campaign off to a winning start with a comfortable 3-0 Group D victory againstBotswana. Jackson converted Ismail Jakobs’s low cross to give his side the lead after 40 minutes as they broke the resistance of a stubborn Botswana, before showing quick feet from Ismaïla Sarr’s pass to finish from close range just before the hour mark.Senegal, who won the 2021 edition and are among the favourites again, overwhelmed their opponents with waves of attacks and added a third late on from Cherif Ndiaye, one of 28 efforts on the Botswana goal.

He might have had a second 13 minutes later, side-footing towards the corner of the net but seeing his goalbound effort blocked by the defender Olivier Verdon.The Congolese, twice continental champions, did have the ball in the net again two minutes into the second half as Cédric Bakambu easily headed home a pinpoint cross from Nathanaël Mbuku, but after a lengthy video assistant referee check, it was ruled offside.Tunisiacontinued the run of winning starts for past Afcon winners in Morocco as they swept pastUganda3-1 in Rabat. Ellyes Skhiri headed home from a corner after 10 minutes to give the 2004 victors the lead in driving rain, befored Elias Achouri added a second five minutes before the break.Achouri then tapped home at the back post after the hour mark to emphasise Tunisia’s dominance.

Luke Littler and Luke Humphries are the leading contenders for the title in January but Van Gerwen is a threat playing like this.Peter Wright’s confidence was wildly misplaced after he crashed out. The two-time champion was dressed in a Santa outfit but there was no festive cheer on show as Arno Merk won 3-1. Wright had claimed he was definitely going to win this tournament but was left red-faced with Merk, on debut, full value for the win, which denied the possibility of a third-round match between Wright and Van Gerwen – a repeat of the 2020 final.View image in fullscreenArno Merk (left) and Peter Wright after their second-round match of the PDC world championship at the Alexandra Palace.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAVan Gerwen remains at the top of the sport – and is a contender for the title – but Wright’s name is no longer in that conversation after a dreadful performance where he averaged just 79.20.“I am stunned, I can’t believe it, I just beat a legend, I am so happy,” Merk said. “I am early in my work, so I am really happy.”Gary Anderson rolled back the years with a vintage display to oust Connor Scutt. The Scot is the last man to defend the title with back-to-back wins in 2015 and 2016 and he showed a similar level of form.

The Euros in 2022 saw the whole industry in England develop very exponentially and that’s why here we said on the cost side we would see that growth but the revenue streams have not been parallel, and it was not possible to keep up with the costs. We didn’t have our development in our own hands, it was with the DFB, but it is the clubs investing in the sport, which is why our first big step was to unite as clubs.”View image in fullscreenKatharina Kiel, the president of the new Women’s Bundesliga Association, says German players starting to look abroad was among the reasons for the change.Photograph: Alex Grimm/Getty ImagesBayern Munich have been pioneers in recent years, winning multiple Bundesliga titles and competing in the latter stages of the Champions League. Bianca Rech, a former Bayern player, has worked at the club for almost a decade in various roles, now as a director, and says commercial growth has been high on the agenda when looking at the WSL as an example.“We have clear ideas when it comes to the commercial side to make much more money when it comes to sponsorship,” she says. “The other part is the ability to make our own decisions. We are part of the DFB but don’t have any power, so if the DFB want to do something we have to say yes.“It’s important for us we set some new rules ourselves, around infrastructure, minimum salaries, etc. We did a lot of research and benchmarking against other leagues and we looked at the WSL as a good example of taking charge of itself. We actually worked with an agency in England to help provide examples of how we want it to look.”Rech, like Kiel, believes Germany missed out on capitalising on past successes, such as back-to-back World Cup wins or their multiple European Championship triumphs. That has meant falling behind England and Spain in recent years, with a disastrous 2023 World Cup ending in a group-stage exit.Rech says: “We missed out in 2011 to use the power compared to England in 2022, the celebrations, the fan growth, etc … But now with theEuros coming here in 2029, the development of the game, women’s football is one of the fastest-growing products and we have to make sure we don’t lose track.”Those Euros in 2029 offer a chance to commercialise the sport but Kiel says decisions will not be rushed.“You have to look at certain timelines and when is a good time to bring change into place?” says Kiel. “Our new media cycle begins in 2027-28, so to bring up change for next season would be very, very late for us now.“We’ll use next season to get things sorted, but also to form a group and an organisation which is capable of providing commercially and economically for the clubs and for the league. We have started this month with the foundation but we are in the process of getting everything done and creating the criteria every club can commit to for 2027-28.”On keeping up with the WSL, Kiel says: “We have fallen behind – it is the reality. People try and differentiate between the Bundesliga and Premier League in the men’s game, but the Premier League is so far away. But for us the WSL hasn’t pulled so far away yet.”View image in fullscreenKatharina Kiel, her vice-presidents and delegates of the 14 top-flight clubs after the agreement to split from the DFB was reached.Photograph: Alex Grimm/Getty ImagesThere is belief and excitement that this can spark a new era of success in Germany, with many of the country’s biggest clubs either in the Bundesliga or closing in on it, and the national team still developing top young players who can compete on an international stage.“There’s a huge opportunity in Germany right now,” Rech says. “You look at the league, teams on the way up, Stuttgart, Dortmund, the league will look different, maybe more compatible with the men’s league.”Kiel says: “Most important is the product you see on the field, and everything around that has to be aligned. We want an attractive game, that’s important for us, and from that we will look at all the consequences that are needed.”On whether that could include involvement from the DFB, Kiel says: “We cannot not talk with them because they are running the league now, so there are some negotiations on certain topics, and topics regarding future collaboration are still open.”Get in touchIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please emailmoving.goalposts@theguardian.com.This is an extract from our free email about women’s football, Moving the Goalposts.

At least three people were killed, including a four-year-old child.Poland scrambled fighter jets to protect its airspace during the strike, the country’s army said in a statement.Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said in a post on Telegram: “A strike before Christmas, when people want to be with their families, at home, in safety. A strike, in fact, in the midst of negotiations that are being conducted to end this war. Putin cannot accept the fact that we must stop killing.”Meanwhile, Ukraine pressed on with strikes against Russian oil and gas infrastructure, hitting a petrochemical plant in southern Russia’s Stavropol region.Footage circulating on Russian media channels showed towering flames in the industrial area, which the regional governor, Vladimir Vladimirov, said had been engulfed by a fire.The strikes follow weekend negotiations in Miami involving Donald Trump’s peace envoy, Steve Witkoff, and representatives from Russia and Ukraine, who each held separate meetings with Witkoff and Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. Witkoff called the discussions “constructive” but there was no sign the talks were any closer to bringing lasting peace.View image in fullscreenAn injured woman looks out of her broken window in Kyiv.Photograph: Efrem Lukatsky/APZelenskyy said in a statement that he was briefed on the state of the talks on Tuesday morning and that “several draft documents have now been prepared”, including an outline for ending the war, options for Ukraine’s future security guarantees and plans for the country’s postwar reconstruction.Ukraine has engaged its European allies to help hammer out a compromise agreement with the US, although Zelenskyy has said the issue of territorial concessions remained a sticking point. There isno sign that Russia is even closeto signing up to the package of agreements Kyiv and Washington have arrived at, despite repeatedpositive messaging from the White Housethat peace is close.“Slow progress is being observed,” the Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, told state media after the talks. However, Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, has said many times that Russia will agree only to a deal that addresses what he sees as the “root causes” of the conflict – a sweeping set of demands that would in effect erode Ukraine’s sovereignty.Putin’s spokesperson struck a downbeat tone on Tuesday, telling Russian media that the latest round of talks had not produced a breakthrough.Russia has continued to hit Ukrainian energy infrastructure as the talks go on, apparently in the hope of making conditions harder for the population and breaking Ukrainian resolve. Tuesday’s attack, which the energy operator Ukrenergo said was the ninth mass attack on energy infrastructure of the season, left three western regions of Ukraine “almost completely without power”, it said.Kyiv and many other cities have been experiencing scheduled power cuts for weeks as the grid struggles to cope with reduced capacity during the winter months. Temperatures have dropped below freezing in many parts of Ukraine, with a high of -5C forecast for Kyiv on Wednesday.Reports suggested a toddler was killed in the north-western Zhytomyr region on Tuesday, while a drone killed a woman close to Kyiv. Authorities in several western regions reported damage to energy infrastructure.Russia struck a series of infrastructure targets in the southern city of Odesa and damaged more than 100 houses, according to local officials. Russia has been attacking the port city relentlessly over recent weeks, leading to sustained power shortages.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

She sat down with a sign saying “I support the Palestine Action prisoners. I oppose genocide.”Two other activists are said to have earlier used repurposed fire extinguishers to cover the front of the building used by Aspen Insurance with red paint before locking themselves to it.The campaign group Prisoners for Palestinesaid Aspen, a global speciality insurer and reinsurer, was targeted because it provided services to Elbit Systems UK, a subsidiary of an Israeli weapons maker.Prisoners for Palestine said the action was also carried out in solidarity with prisoners who have been on hunger strike while awaiting trial for alleged offences relating to Palestine Action beforethe group was banned.Eight prisoners had been on hunger strike. The two to begin the protest are now on their 52nd day and at a critical stage for their health. Three of the eight have stopped because of severe risk.A City of London police spokesperson said hammers and red paint were used to damage a building on Fenchurch Street at 7am on Tuesday.“A man and a woman have been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage. They glued themselves nearby and specialist officers are working to release them and bring them into police custody,” the spokesperson said.“A little while later, a 22-year-old woman also attended the scene. She has been arrested for displaying an item – in this case a placard – in support of a proscribed organisation – in this case Palestine Action – contrary to section 13 of the Terrorism Act 2000.”Police later said the woman had been released on bail to a date in March.While thousands of people have been arrested over the past year at protests for holding placards saying “I support Palestine Action”, campaigners questioned why the wording of Thunberg’s sign had led to her being arrested under counter-terrorism legislation.Families and supporters of hunger strikers have pleaded with David Lammy, the justice secretary, to meet them in an attempt to end the impasse. On Monday, as the protestreached a dangerous stage, lawyers for the hunger strikers sent a legal letter claiming that by refusing a meeting, Lammy had failed to comply with the Ministry of Justice’s policy on the handling of hunger strikes.The demands of the hunger strikers include the granting of immediate bail, ending the ban on Palestine Action and stopping restrictions on their communications.Thunberg said in a statement: “It is up to the state to intervene and put an end to this by meeting these reasonable demands that pave the way for the freedom of all those who choose to use their rights trying to stop a genocide, something the British state has failed to do themselves.”Aspen was targeted after it emerged that two insurance firms that were repeatedly targeted by Palestine Action before the group was banned had stopped insuring UK subsidiaries of Israel’s largest arms manufacturer, Elbit Systems.Allianz and Aviva ended insurance contracts with Elbit Systems UK and UAV Engines respectively. They have all been approached for comment.On Saturday, after Ireland’s Gaelic Athletic Association came under pressure to end its sponsorship by Allianz, the insurance companytold RTÉthat it “has no relationship with Elbit Systems and does not engage in any investment or underwriting activity connected to the Middle East”.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s time for the county’s leadership to halt these disastrous plans and work with the community to explore alternatives to closure.”Linsey Farnsworth, the Labour MP for Amber Valley, last weekraised the issueat prime minister’s questions in the Commons, saying that families and staff were heartbroken and called for a rethink.Keir Starmer replied: “It is deeply concerning to hear about the closure of eight Derbyshire care homes by the Reform-led Derbyshire county council. It will be hugely concerning to residents and their families, while we are making £3.7bn of extra funding available to councils to fund social care.”Derbyshire county council said it had been in “intensive” but unsuccessful negotiations with a provider to take over the running of the eight homes as a going concern.Joss Barnes, a Reform councillor who is the cabinet member for adult care, said he was “devastated” by the failure of the negotiations.“I know this will be extremely upsetting news for all our residents and their families, as well as our hard-working care colleagues, especially coming at this time of year in the run-up to Christmas,” he said. “I’d like to thank everyone for their hard work, patience and persistence and I’d also like to say how incredibly sorry I am that this hasn’t worked out as we’d hoped and planned for.“We have done absolutely everything to progress the sale, but in the end it wasn’t possible. Due to commercial sensitivities, we’re not able to give any more details regarding negotiations.”He said the council would work to support residents to find new homes.The decision to sell the homes was agreed in November 2024 when the authority was Conservative-controlled.Explore more on these topicsReform UKDerbyshireLocal governmentSocial careOlder peoplenewsShareReuse this content"

There have been sustained protests outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Broadview, on the outskirts of Chicago, withaggressive tacticsused against the resistance by the authorities.Last week, authorities arrested 21 protesters and said four officers were injured outside the Broadview facility. Local authorities made the arrests.The justices decided on a 6-3 vote on Tuesday to back a lower court and rule that theTrump administrationhad not met the legal burden needed to show that it was not able to execute the laws of the land without federal military intervention.The three justices leaning furthest to the right on the bench, Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, dissented on Tuesday.The decision was a significant defeat for Trump’s efforts to send troops to US cities as part of his immigration crackdown and arguments that some cities and states are doing a bad job of fighting crime.The justices declined the Republican administration’s emergency request to overturn a ruling by US district judge April Perry that had blocked the deployment of troops. An appeals court also had refused to step in. The supreme court took more than two months to act.The high court order is not a final ruling but it could affect other lawsuits challenging Trump’s attempts to deploy the military in other Democratic-led cities.“At this preliminary stage, the government has failed to identify a source of authority that would allow the military to execute the laws inIllinois,” the majority on the bench wrote.Justice Brett Kavanaugh said he agreed with the decision to block theChicagodeployment, but would have left the president more latitude to deploy troops in possible future scenarios.The White House did not immediately respond to an email message seeking comment.In a dissent, Alito and Thomas said the court had no basis to reject Trump’s contention that the administration was unable to enforce immigration laws without troops. Gorsuch said he would have narrowly sided with the government based on the declarations of federal law enforcement officials.The administration had initially sought the order to allow the deployment of troops from Illinois and Texas, but the Texas contingent of about 200 national guard troops was later sent home from Chicago.The Trump administration has argued that the troops are needed “to protect federal personnel and property from violent resistance against the enforcement of federal immigration laws”.But Perry wrote that she found no substantial evidence that a “danger of rebellion” is brewing in Illinois and no reason to believe the protests there had gotten in the way of Trump’s immigration crackdown.Perry had initially blocked the deployment for two weeks. But in October, she extended the order indefinitely while the supreme court reviewed the case.The Illinois case is just one of several legal battles over national guard deployments.District of Columbia attorney general Brian Schwalb is suing to halt the deployments of more than 2,000 guard troops in the nation’s capital. Forty-five states have entered filings in federal court in that case, with 23 supporting the administration’s actions and 22 supporting the attorney general’s lawsuit.More than 2,200 troops from several Republican-led states remain in Washington DC.A federal judge in Oregon has permanently blocked the deployment of national guard troops there, and all 200 troops from California were being sent home from Oregon, an official said.A state court in Tennessee ruled in favor of Democratic officials who sued to stop the ongoing national guard deployment in Memphis, which Trump has called a replica of his crackdown on DC.In California, a judge in September said deployment in the Los Angeles area was illegal. By that point, just 300 of the thousands of troops sent there remained, and the judge did not order them to leave.The Trump administration has appealed against the California and Oregon rulings.Reuters and the Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS supreme courtChicagoIllinoisTrump administrationUS politicsUS policingUS militarynewsShareReuse this content"

He was never charged and Openshaw said that he had in effect been exonerated.Openshaw said that while the Royal Gibraltar police (RGP) officers were at Hassans, Picardo summoned the commissioner of police, Ian McGrail, to his office and “berated” him while in a “towering rage” in “a grossly improper attempt to interfere in a legitimate police investigation and operation”.McGrail retired a month after the May 2020 incident and the inquiry aimed to establish whether he was forced out.The retired judge said: “I reject Mr Picardo’s defence of his actions. I do not think that he was protecting the reputation of Gibraltar; I think it far more likely that he was moving to protect Mr Levy, his life-time friend and ‘mentor’, from the likely consequences of the warrant being executed or his phones being interrogated.”Picardo was also found to have shared confidential information with Levy’s lawyer about what he thought was the director of public prosecutions’ advice on the warrant as well as information about police disciplinary regulations that appeared aimed at targeting McGrail or the senior investigating officer on the case, which Openshaw described as “sinister”.He said there was “a very high risk” of Picardo’s duties as chief minister conflicting with his interests as a friend and business partner of Levy.Nevertheless, the retired judge found that Picardo’s actions had not “in fact interfered with the visit of the RGP to Hassans; they carried on precisely as had been planned. I conclude that there was no actual interference with the RGP’s actions on 12 May.”The search warrant under scrutiny related to alleged hacking and sabotage of the national security centralised intelligence system and into a conspiracy to defraud Bland Ltd, the private company that was operating the system, in order to benefit another firm, 36 North Limited.Hassans owned a third of 36 North Limited – which had also held security contracts with the government – and, through the law firm, Picardo and Levy owned equity interests too.The inquiry heard that Picardo and the then interim governor, Nick Pyle, claimed to have lost confidence in McGrail over a series of issues including his handling of a fatal collision at sea involving an RGP vessel in March 2020. However, Openshaw said the “real reason” was the police application for a search warrant against Levy and Picardo’s genuine belief that McGrail had lied to him about the investigation.The report found that Picardo believed that McGrail told him the DPP had advised the RGP to apply for a search warrant, even though McGrail did not say this “in clear and unambiguous terms”.Openshaw said McGrail did mention engagement with the DPP but “did not lie” and Picardo’s decision “that Mr McGrail had to go” was “in part based on a misunderstanding” that the police commissioner had deliberately lied.Picardo claimed the government had been completely exonerated. “The report finds that there was no actual interference with the RGP’s investigation by me, by anyone on my behalf or by any officer of the government and no conspiracy to remove him [McGrail] from office.”Openshaw said of McGrail: “I conclude that one of the main reasons that he retired was that he felt under pressure to do so because he knew that the chief minister and the governor had lost confidence in him, but he did so only because he knew he was being unfairly compelled to do so because neither they nor the GPA [GibraltarPoliceAuthority, the policing watchdog] had followed the proper procedures. He was, in effect, being forced out.”He said the procedural irregularities including a failure to examine McGrail’s extremely serious allegations of political interference, “might have been cured” but refused to say whether it would have changed the outcome for McGrail.Explore more on these topicsGibraltarEuropePoliceShareReuse this content"

However, a colder spell expected from Christmas until the new year makes it too close to call definitively.It will almost certainly become one of the UK’s warmest years on record, joining 2022 and 2023 in the top three.Chance of ‘odd wintry flurry’ of snow in UK for a white Christmas – Met OfficeRead more“This should come as no surprise,” said Mike Kendon, a senior scientist in the Met Office’s climate information team. Over the last four decades the UK’s annual temperature has risen by about 1C.“We will have to wait for the year-end before confirming 2025’s final number but at this stage it looks more likely than not that 2025 will be confirmed as the warmest year on record for the UK.2025 could become the UK's hottest year on record“However, it will not be long until this record is broken again. Since the start of the 21st century a new record has been set for the UK’s annual mean temperature no less than six times – in 2002, 2003, 2006, 2014, 2022 and now 2025 [if confirmed] – each record progressively warmer than the last.”If confirmed, 2025 would be only the second year in observational records in which the UK’s annual mean temperature has exceeded 10C.It would also mean that four of the past five years feature among the top five warmest since 1884, with all of the top 10 occurring in the past two decades.Earlier this year, the Met Office saidthe UK had its hottest summer on record, after four heatwaves pushed the mean temperature across June, July and August to 16.1C. All five of the hottest summers on record have occurred since 2000.“In terms of our climate, we are living in extraordinary times,” Kendon said. “The changes we are seeing are unprecedented in observational records back to the 19th century.”Explore more on these topicsUK weatherClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

Forty years ago she planted an oak tree in a small town in southern Zurich – now at the frontier of beaver expansion – and it has just been felled: gnawed by the large, semi-aquatic rodents as they enter their seasonal home-improvement mode.The caller is one of 10 new people getting in touch each week at this time of year. Beavers, nature’s great engineers, can unleash mayhem during winter as they renovate their lodges and build up their dams. For people, this can mean flooding, sinkholes appearing in roads and trees being felled. A single incident can clock up 70,000 Swiss francs (£65,000) in damages.To cope, the beaver-rich canton of Zurich came up with the hotline. The localBeaver Advisory Centreis staffed by ecologists who give advice, assess damages and evaluate potential compensation(the oak tree-bereft woman is advised to wrap wire around the base of the other trees to stop the rodents’ chewing).View image in fullscreenIn Laufen-Uhwiesen, hotline first responder Caroline Nienhuis inspects a beaver dam with maintenance manager Oliver Kuhn.Photograph: Jon Trachsel/The GuardianPart of the job is calming down people furious at their beaver neighbours. “Some farmers are so angry you can hardly understand them, but they calm down when you go and see them,” says first responder Caroline Nienhuis, a biologist from Fornat, the consultancy that runs the hotline.It’s about who’s got more patience: man or beaver?Peter Roos, public works employeeSwitzerland is experiencing a beaver boom. When top predators first recolonise a former habitat – such as when wolves, bears and eaglesreturn to areasacross Europe – the immediate reaction is often one of awe. As the animals spread, however, it can often lead to conflict. Population growth is usually slow when you first introduce a new species, then it moves exponentially.In 2008, there were 1,600 beavers, and in 2022 (when the last full monitoring was done) there were 4,900, with numbers likely to have increased since. What is striking about the Swiss example is the degree to which citizens accept living alongside them. Unlike in most European countries, no beaver has been legally killed inSwitzerlandsince they were reintroduced in 1956.View image in fullscreenBeavers were reintroduced in Switzerland in 1956.Photograph: Christof Angst Bern/Nationale BiberfachstelleThe Swiss approach is not hands-off in its rewilding: its success lies in extensive state management and support. Up to 1m Swiss francs (£930,000) can be allocated each year for beaver damage and prevention – the biggest such fund inEurope.Peter Roos is a public works employee who maintains waterways, roads, streets and paths in the municipality of Hettlingen, home to 3,200 people – and now, a number of beavers. Roos says he calls the hotline up to 20 times a year.The local beavers’ latest trick has been raising the height of their dam – an enterprise that risks flooding the sewage system. Discussing it on site,Nienhuis and Roos agree that the dam needs to be lowered to sort the problem out. The whole decision takes about 30 minutes.“It’s about who’s got more patience: man or beaver?” says Roos. “Once you start manipulating their dams they get inventive and build new dams.” His latest task is to investigate a sinkhole that appeared in the local car park, which the wheel of a lorry fell into. “To keep beaver activity in check is a huge amount of work,” says Roos.View image in fullscreenThe team inspect a sink hole that has appeared in a road in Hettlingen as a result of burrowing.Photograph: Jon Trachsel/The GuardianThe culling controversySome argue that this proves large beaver populations arenot compatiblewith large human populations. In Bavaria,about 2,500are shot a year, which is 10% of the population, but the number continues to grow. Poland issues permits to cullabout 6%of its beaver population each year (about 8,300 individuals).But the effectiveness of culling is questioned in Switzerland. If a river section is favourable for one beaver, it is likely to be favourable for others. “It’s efficient to shoot a beaver – but only until the next beaver comes along,” says Nienhuis. “Then the same conflicts arise.”Nienhuis says prevention and compensation are more effective. “It’s important people feel they can control beavers and their activity so they accept them. As soon as you lose acceptance from the local people it’s a problem,” she says. The biologist believes animals such as beavers, wolves and lynx should not be reintroduced without a system to deal with conflicts that inevitably arise. “If you say ‘deal with it yourself’ that is when illegal shooting happens.”View image in fullscreenCécile Auberson shows the range of biodiversity in Marthalen, the largest beaver wetland in Switzerland.Photograph: Jon Trachsel/The GuardianThe costs of management are more than compensated for by the wildlife and ecosystem benefits beavers bring. Despite causing flooding in some areas, they reduce it in others as their dams slow the flow of water through the landscape, protecting communities downstream from flash floods. “We cannot build what they do. We would miss a huge opportunity if we went and shot them all,” says Cécile Auberson, who works for a national Beaver Centre (Nationale Biberfachstelle). They are, she says, the “most powerful force in river restoration”.A boon for biodiversityMarthalen is the largest beaver wetland in Switzerland and ecologists point to it as an illustration of why people should put up with them.In 2011, a family of beavers moved into the plantation and dammed the small stream that runs through it, transforming four hectares into an alluvial forest, submerging old oak trees and felling others.There has been an explosion of biodiversity in this swampy area. Calls of the black woodpecker and tawny owl reverberate about the woodland. It is a case study in how wild engineering by beavers can reshape ecosystems in the space of a few years. “The effects on biodiversity are just huge. No human-led projects would ever achieve those benefits,” says Auberson.View image in fullscreenA tree trunk gnawed by a beaver.Photograph: Jon Trachsel/The GuardianIn habitats such as Marthalen,researchers have foundup to six times more species of fish, amphibians, water insects, water plants and dragonflies, and up to 60 times more abundance than in the same rivers without beaver activities. “What the beaver can do and how this impacts nature is mind-blowing. It makes you realise how unnatural a lot of our nature is,” says Nienhuis.Beavers are now doing free river restoration work on 2,000km of river in Switzerland they have already colonised. “If we integrate them intelligently they can save us money, and do it better than we can,” says Auberson.‘People see it as a bit exotic’Some areas are already managing their future of coexistence. Two years ago, beavers moved into the stream running through the village of Uhwiesen. In January 2024, after some extensive burrowing, a sink hole appeared in the road, and the following year there was another. The beavers felled 20 trees, turning the riverside bald. They had an appetite for the farmers’ sugar beets and brussels sprouts. Water levels were rising due to their dam building. “I was worried about flooding of the tennis courts and people’s homes,” says Oliver Kuhn, who is in charge of local maintenance in Uhwiesen.View image in fullscreenIn Uhwiesen beavers caused sink holes in roads, felled trees, devoured crops and made water levels rise with their dam building.Photograph: René Manser/Nationale BiberfachstelleThe damage was averted by the construction of a netted beaver boundary, which cost 8,000 Swiss francs, shared between the municipality and the canton.‘Like walking through time’: as glaciers retreat, new worlds are being created in their wakeRead moreNow, most locals are fond of their new neighbours. Kuhn, who named the beavers Justin and Hailey (Biber, pronounced “bee-ber” is German for beaver), has noticed kingfishers have come back since they arrived, as well as more dragonflies and bats.“People see it as a bit exotic and unique that we’ve got beavers here. You can walk along here with your dog and see beavers – that’s special,” says Andi Pfenninger, who lives in Uhwiesen. “People see it as an enrichment of where they live.”Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsAnimalsThe age of extinctionRewildingSwitzerlandConservationEuropeMammalsRiversfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He was not formally arrested. The force did not name the individual who was interviewed and he was informed of the outcome on Tuesday.In a statement, Avon and Somerset police said: “No further action will be taken on the basis there is insufficient evidence for there to be a realistic prospect of conviction.”It added: “The comments made on Saturday 28 June drew widespread anger, proving that words have real-world consequences.“We believe it is right that this matter was comprehensively investigated, every potential criminal offence was thoroughly considered and we sought all the advice we could to ensure we made an informed decision.”The force shared the details of its initial inquiries with the Crown Prosecution Service in July and sought legal advice around a number of offences.A CPS spokesperson said: “We recognise the strength of public feeling about comments made during Bob Vylan’s set at Glastonbury festival in June, particularly among the Jewish community.“We provided early investigative advice to Avon and Somerset police on what evidence might be needed to meet the legal test for charging but we have not been asked to make a charging decision in this case.“A number of offences were considered which each have evidential requirements to prove but Avon and Somerset police have concluded there is insufficient evidence for there to be any realistic prospect of conviction and will take no further action.”In response to the decision, the Community Security Trust, a charity that provides protection to Jewish communities in the UK, said: “It is incredibly disappointing that the police and CPS have decided not to charge in this case, particularly when police forces in London and Manchester are adopting a stronger approach to tackling hateful rhetoric.“It sends completely the wrong message at the worst possible time.”The Metropolitan police said last month they would close their own investigation into Bob Vylan’s gig in May at Alexandra Palace in north London, after advice from the CPS.In September, theBBC partly upheld complaintsover its decision to stream the punk duo’s performance at Glastonbury.Explore more on these topicsBob VylanGlastonbury festivalFestivalsnewsShareReuse this content"

The items, which were destroyed, contained banned chemicals linked to cancer, choking hazards and unsafe wiring.Police and Trading Standards have also ramped up raids of counterfeit goods shops and warehouses in recent months, closing down multiple retailers selling fake designer clothing, bags and toys, in person and online. In many cases, there have also been arrests on modern slavery charges.It is not a crime to buy counterfeit goods, but selling them is punishable by up to 10 years in prison and an unlimited fine.The market for counterfeit Labubus has boomed in recent years, mirroring the popularity of the highly collectible toy. Rare figures can sell for thousands of pounds.Profits at the toymaker Pop Mart have tripled thanks to the craze, which has high profile fans including Rihanna, Dua Lipa and Kim Kardashian, and has beenparodied on South Park.View image in fullscreenAlmost 240,000 harmful fake Labubu toys have been seized at the UK border.Photograph: Home Office/PAThey make up part of a record-breaking year for Border Force, which included £1bn worth of cocaine seized this summer and weapons and firearms.Adam Chatfield, Border Force’s assistant director said: “Preventing cheap knock-off toys entering Britain isn’t about stopping fun at Christmas.“Serious organised criminals use profits from dangerous counterfeit goods to fund their evil activities – exploiting parents and families. Every product seized disrupts criminal networks threatening our border security, spares children from harm and protects legitimate British businesses.”Helen Barnham, the Intellectual Property Office deputy director of enforcement policy said: “With counterfeit toys, what you see is rarely what you get. These illegal and dangerous goods have bypassed every safety check the law requires, behind the packaging can be hidden choking hazards, toxic chemicals and unsafe electrical wiring that put children in real danger.“This Christmas, check before you buy. Be wary of unfamiliar sellers and deals that seem too good to be true. If something doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t. Don’t let your child be the product tester.”Explore more on these topicsCrimeToysHome OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

She can be named as the alleged victim because she has waived her right to anonymity, which would otherwise apply.Young, who was described by police as white British, appeared at Swindon magistrates court on Tuesday charged with 56 offences, including multiple counts of rape and administering a substance with intent to stupefy his former spouse.He is also accused of voyeurism, possession of indecent images of children and possession of extreme images.He was remanded into custody and will appear at Swindon crown court on 23 January.Wearing dark blue jeans and a black jumper, Young spoke to confirm his name and address during the brief hearing. When asked if he wished to indicate a plea at this stage, he shook his head.Young, formerly of Swindon, Wiltshire, and now of Enfield, north London, was a Conservative councillor on Swindon borough council from 2007 to 2010.The five other men charged in the case appeared in court on Tuesday afternoon. They are:Norman Macksoni, 47, a black British national of Sharnbrook, Bedfordshire, who has been charged with one count of rape and possession of extreme images. He appeared in court wearing a dark three-piece suit and indicated a not guilty plea.Dean Hamilton, 47, of Compton Dundon in Somerset, who is white British, has been charged with one count of rape and sexual assault by penetration and two counts of sexual touching. He wore a light-coloured top and combat trousers and indicated a not guilty plea.Connor Sanderson Doyle, 31, of Swindon, described as white British, has been charged with sexual assault by penetration and sexual touching. Wearing a white jumper and with his hair in a ponytail, he did not indicate a plea.Richard Wilkins, 61, of Toothill, Swindon, who is white British, has been charged with one count of rape and sexual touching. He appeared in the dock in a black jacket and did not indicate a plea.Mohammed Hassan, 37, of Swindon, described by police as British Asian, has been charged with sexual touching. He wore a black jacket and did not indicate a plea.The men were released on conditional bail and are to appear at Swindon crown court alongside Young on 23 January.The magistrate Martin Clarke told the defendants: “You are all going to be released on conditional bail. Those conditions are that you have no contact, direct or indirect, with Joanne Young.”He said the men were not to contact her via social media or by passing on a letter, or attend her home. “If you’re caught there, you’re back inside,” he said.The offences are alleged to have taken place between 2010 and 2023.The charges against Young are 11 counts of rape; seven counts of sexual assault by penetration; four counts of sexual touching; 11 counts of administering a substance with the intent of stupefying or overpowering to allow sexual activity; 13 counts of voyeurism specific to videos, as well as voyeurism on at least 200 other occasions; and possession of 230 indecent images of children, including 139 category A images.He is alleged to have been found with three prohibited images and 82 extreme images, and faces one charge each for four types, namely “rape, animals, death and gore”. He is also accused of breaching section 1 of the Obscene Publications Act 1959 on at least 500 occasions.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

This opens up a lot of new directions for us.”Implantation takes place a week or so after fertilisation when the developing embryo attaches and then embeds itself into the uterus wall. It is a crucial phase in pregnancy, but the process is poorly understood because it is so hard to observe. Much of what is known comes from studies of hysterectomies that were performed in early pregnancy more than half a century ago.To build the replica womb lining, Rugg-Gunn and his colleagues obtained uterine tissue from healthy women who donated biopsy samples. From this, the scientists isolated two different types of cells: stromal cells that give structural support to the womb lining, and epithelial cells, which form the lining’s surface. They encapsulated the stromal cells in a biodegradable material called a hydrogel and put the epithelial cells on top.The researchers tested the engineered womb lining with donated early-stage IVF embryos. Writing inthe journal Cell, they describe how the microscopic balls of cells attached and implanted as hoped. They then ramped up secretion of a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), the biochemical marker detected by pregnancy tests, along with other pregnancy-related compounds.The technique enabled scientists to watch embryos grow for up to 14 days post-fertilisation, the legal limit for research. During the process, the embryos formed specialised cells and other cells involved in the growth of the placenta.To understand the process more deeply, the scientists zoomed in on the spots where embryos had embedded in the engineered womb lining and decoded the molecular signals that passed back and forth. Such signals are critical for achieving and maintaining a healthy pregnancy.Equivalent of one child in every British classroom now born via IVF, data showsRead moreScientists will now use the approach to investigate how pregnancies become established and what can go awry. “We know that half of all embryos fail to implant and we have no idea why,” Rugg-Gunn said. Finding answers could provide a much-needed boost to IVF success rates.Further experiments will explore what happens after implantation when the placenta starts to form. Many serious complications of pregnancy are thought to arise at this stage. In the study, the researchers used a chemical to block a particular signal between the embryo and the lining, producing severe defects in the tissue that forms the placenta, demonstrating its power for testing the impact of signalling problems.In aseparate studyin the journal, Chinese researchers created their own replica womb lining and identified drugs that might improve implantation rates in patients with recurrent implantation failure (RIF), where good-quality IVF embryos fail to establish a pregnancy.John Aplin, a professor of reproductive medicine at the University of Manchester, said that during 40-plus years of assisted reproduction, implantation rates had remained stubbornly low.“As the embryo implants, a programme is initiated to begin development of the placenta, which will supply nutrients and oxygen to the foetus,” he said. “The earliest stages are crucial to the progression of the pregnancy, are not well understood, and frequently fail. This work will allow treatments to be explored that seek to improve implantation efficiency.”Explore more on these topicsReproductionBiologyFertility problemsIVFHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

CD players and compact discs are back on Christmas lists this year amid a wave of 90s nostalgia and coveted “deluxe” releases from big acts such asTaylor Swiftand Pink Floyd.Demand for compact discs peaked in the mid-00s and many households ditched their systems and libraries as digital music took off. But the distinctive whirr is returning to bedrooms around the country, with retailers and marketplaces experiencing an uptick in appetite for vintage tech and music to play on it.John Lewis has upped its range of CD players to meet resurgent demand and says sales are up 74% in the last year. “We’re seeing something of a retro renaissance,” said Heather Andrews, one of its electricals buyers.The format’s cause is being helped by the return of classic 90s acts such as Oasis and Pulp – who peaked in the CD era – andfilled stadiums this summer.Although the lion’s share of music sales are through streaming, experts report a burgeoning demand for physical copies, complete with artwork and liner notes to muse over. Fans also know buying a physical copy of an album is a more effective way to financially support artists they like.CD sales peaked in 2004 when music fans bought a staggering 162m, a towering stack in a year when the biggest sellers were the Scissor Sisters and Robbie Williams’ Greatest Hits. But the intervening years have seen a precipitous decline with just10.5m sold in 2024, according to the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). The BPI is due to publish sales figures for 2025 soon.View image in fullscreenCDs on sale in an HMV store back in 2015.Photograph: David Sillitoe/The GuardianNeil Gibbons, the chief operating officer of Key Production Group, which manufactures vinyl, CDs and cassettes, said its orders to make CDs are up 15% year-on-year. “We saw a similar pattern with the vinyl decline … and look what happened there. CDs remain a very robust format for us.”The company’s research found physical music has become increasingly important to young Britons. “In the last 12 months, gen Z have actually bought more CDs than millennials, gen X and baby boomers,” said Gibbons. “These purchases are done mainly online or in-store, such as record shops and high street stores, demonstrating that they are actively seeking these formats out.”The poll also showed nearly half (46%) of gen Alpha were listening to physical music, including CDs. This age group “aren’t just buying CDs to keep on the shelf”, he said. “Over half of gen Alpha know how to use a CD player – a technology they’ve had to adopt from a previous generation.”Physical music has become a big part of artists’ releases again and plays a significant role in official chart results. Swift released four CD editions ofThe Life of a Showgirland at £12 they are less than half the price of the vinyl.Sam Fender also released a deluxe CD version of hisMercury prize-winning People Watchingwith eight additional tracks and for the 50th anniversary of Wish You Were Here, Pink Floyd has released a £215 box set that includes two CDs aimed at deep-pocketed superfans.In some circles, CDs never really went away as they are seen to offer a richer sound compared with digital streaming. However, the number of CDs sold each year is still falling, although the decline has slowed from double to low single figures as music buyers reassess the format, not least because at £10-£11 a go it is so much cheaper than vinyl.‘We are truly doomed’: King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard despair at AI clone appearing on SpotifyRead moreBritons are also scouring marketplaces for secondhand music.

I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, wishing you a happy and healthy end of the year. I myself have a cold.Today, we are looking back at the biggest stories in tech of 2025 – Elon Musk’s political rise, burst and fall; artificial intelligence’s subsumption of the global economy, all other technology, and even the Earth’s topography; Australia’s remarkable social media ban; the tech industry’s new Trumpian politics; and, as a treat, a glimpse of the apocalypse offered by one of Silicon Valley’s savviest and strangest billionaires.Elon Musk, a one-man hurricaneView image in fullscreenTesla CEO Elon Musk attends a memorial service for slain far-right commentator Charlie Kirk at State Farm Stadium, in Glendale, Arizona, on 21 September 2025.Photograph: Daniel Cole/ReutersAt the close of 2024, I wrote that Elon Musk’s support of Donald Trump had made him theworld’s most powerful unelected man. In 2025, his reign turned out to be short-lived. He rose fast and haphazardly, like a whizzing firework, only to explode spectacularly in June when he claimed in a post on X that the president of the United States was named in the government’s files on the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Even in that short period of less than six months, Musk made a tremendous impact. He tore up wide swaths of the US government – tens of thousands of jobs, the security of extremely sensitive data, and entire agencies like USAid – that may never be stitched back together.After Doge imploded, Musk promised to turn back to his business empire, which saw great success and great failures alike in 2025. His rocket company SpaceX saw continued growth and is poised to conduct an initial public offering next year, perhaps as the most valuable private company in the world. Electric carmakerTesla, by contrast, faced violent backlash and major competition from its Chinese counterparts, which produced cheaper and more advanced vehicles while Tesla’s innovation and inventory stagnated. These headwinds caused a global sales slump for Musk’s carmaker.Look back at our reporting on Doge, Tesla, SpaceX, Musk himself:The‘department ofgovernmentefficiency’How an obscure US government office has become a target of Elon MuskHow Elon Musk’s billionaire Doge lieutenant took over the US’s biggest MDMA company | Technology | The GuardianThe chaos Elon Musk and Doge are leaving behind in WashingtonTesla faces backlash over Musk’s politicsEggings, swastikas and dog poop: Tesla bears brunt of people’s ire against Musk‘I’m selling the Nazi mobile’: Tesla owners offload cars after Musk’s fascist-style salutesLook ahead: SpaceX expands in preparation for 2026 IPOInside Elon Musk’s plan to rain SpaceX’s rocket debris over Hawaii’s pristine watersElon Musk’s SpaceX ‘preparing for flotation that could value it at over $1tn’Artificial intelligence blankets the worldView image in fullscreenA pipe lays along a fence line near construction at the Tahoe‑Reno Industrial Center in Storey county, Nevada, on 28 October 2025.Photograph: Bridget Bennett/The GuardianArtificial intelligence has gone from a niche within tech to the industry’s most prominent focus. The Magnificent Seven – Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla – are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into new software that they hope will do the bulk of humanity’s work before too long. The investment is driving the bulk of the growth of the US’s economy, giving rise to fears of a financial bubble and its popping. The US and China are locked in a cold war-esque race against each other, with startups in each country vying for cutting-edge breakthroughs, as governments around the world are forced to decide how they will regulate a new technological force.Before AI can arrive at that future, though, it needs brains a la the Tin Man of The Wizard of Oz. Those brains come in the form of datacenters. These massive buildings, which house the millions and millions of semiconductor chips booming AI development, have cropped up around the world, met with enthusiasm from leaders eager for tax revenue and deep concern from environmental advocates and, increasingly, local community members. The investment in and construction of datacenters wrought huge change in the physical landscape of the Earth in 2025 as tens of billions of dollars chased any available land, electricity, water and semiconductor chips.More from our reporting in the last year:DatacentersThe AI boom is heralding a new gold rush in the American westRevealed: Big tech’s new datacentres will take water from the world’s driest areasThe future of AIWhat will your life look like in 2035?‘It’s going much too fast’: the inside story of the race to create the ultimate AIMultitrillion-dollar valuationsIs AI a bubble that’s about to pop? – podcastWhat is new in UK-US tech deal and what will it mean for the British economy?But does it work?Meet the AI workers who tell their friends and family to stay away from AITech gets in bed with Trump 2.0View image in fullscreenMark Zuckerberg, Lauren Sanchez, Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai and Elon Musk attend the inauguration of Donald Trump in the Rotunda of the US Capitol on 20 January 2025 in Washington DC.Photograph: Abaca/Rex/ShutterstockElon Musk made a full-throated and whole-hearted embrace of Donald Trump in 2024 and 2025. He was not alone. Many of his fellows in Silicon Valley did the same, sitting beside the Trump family at the president’s inauguration after donating millions to his inaugural committee. The tech giants continued their embrace of Trump and his policies by scuttling their diversity, equity and inclusion programs, which they championed during Barack Obama’s presidency, and by cooperating with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Trump’s harsh immigration crackdown.

The Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) has estimated that it costs the sector £4m a week.The shake-up has forced some of the biggest manufacturers to freeze or scale back production. Diageo, the FTSE 100 drinks group behind a number of whiskies such as Johnnie Walker, Talisker and Lagavulin, has reduced production at some of its malt distilleries to “balance capacity against current demand”.The company has scaled back production at some distilleries from seven days a week to five, with operations paused at Teaninich Distillery in the Scottish Highlands. It has also halted production at its Roseisle Maltings site in north-eastScotlanduntil at least June 2026, with future production under review.Diageo’s proposed redevelopment of its Talisker distillery on the Isle of Skye is also uncertain. Its full planning application is awaiting permission from the local council, although it is understood the company does not currently have definitive investment plans for the area.A spokesperson for Diageo said it remained “confident and committed to the long-term growth of scotch whisky” but was managing capacity after a period of sustained investment and stock buildup.This year the SWA warned that US tariffs are costing the sector almost £20m a month in lost sales, and more than 1,000 jobs.Overall scotch sales in the US, the biggest market for the drink, fell 6% in the first nine months of 2025, according to IWSR. That was an improvement on a 9% fall in 2024, but well below growth rates in 2020, when sales rose by 4%.Luke Tegner, of IWSR, added that a broader decline in alcohol consumption was also feeding the slump.“Scotch has had a boom in the last 35 years,” he said. “But more recently it has been hit by tariffs, by affordability and by people moderating how much they drink.”In August, a poll by Gallup found the share of Americans who say they consumealcohol was at its lowestin nearly 90 years, at 54%.“But the scotch industry is very creative – it will find a way out of it,” Tegner added. “We are still forecasting growth by the end of the decade.”In the meantime, some producers are investing in extra storage space to house unsold stock. International Beverage, which owns scotch brands Old Pulteney, Speyburn and Balblair, spent £7m this year on six new warehouses, adding capacity for 60,000 casks.In the US, other distilleries have cut back on production: the bourbon brand Jim Beam, which is owned by the Japanese drinks company Suntory Group, has said it willshut down production at its main site in Kentucky for all of 2026.While the market for scotch has been weaker this year, the broader whisky market has been more resilient, with volumes up 3% in the first half, according to IWSR.Explore more on these topicsWhiskyAlcoholScotlandTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

The independent stores, cafes and restaurants lining Hill Road in theSomersetseaside town of Clevedon are hoping to take advantage of the crucial pre-Christmas period.The street’s colourful shops, along with the town’s Victorian pier, are among Clevedon’s best-known landmarks, making Hill Road popular with locals and visitors. It even stood in for the high street in theITV drama Broadchurch.However, Hill Road’s traders are looking ahead to the new year with concern after proposals by North Somerset council to introduce car parking charges on local streets.They fear customers will be deterred if they have to pay to park, which could reduce footfall, hit trade and even threaten their livelihoods.“We’re greater than the sum of our parts. People come here as a destination. It’s the eclectic mix of independents, it’s the community,” says Sandy Prater, the owner of Fizz gallery, which has recently celebrated its 20th anniversary on Hill Road.View image in fullscreenSandy Prater, owner of the Fizz art gallery.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianSurrounded by paintings of Bristol’s famous Clifton suspension bridge and displays of ornaments, Prater says the council’s introduction of parking charges in neighbouring Nailsea in the summer has already had a worrying impact on local businesses.Amid a backdrop of rising costs, consumers reining in their spending and an uncertain economic environment, the traders fear parking fees could be the final straw for some. They are calling on the local authority to reconsider and recently handed in a petition against the proposed charges signed by more than 3,300 people.Prater adds: “Research shows that when people have to pay, they don’t come as often. We’ve seen it decimate towns and small areas of independents up and down the country.”Indeed, it is a scene being played out across Britain: North Somerset is just one of the country’scash-strapped councilsthat has looked to introduce or increase parking charges in a bid to boost its income. It’s a trend that has beengreeted with dismay by tradersfrom St Albans to Surrey andShropshire.Clevedon shoppers can currently park for free on Hill Road and other surrounding streets for two hours. The parking restrictions apply between 8am and 6pm from Monday to Saturday.The council is proposing giving drivers 30 minutes of free parking, before charging £1.50 for a one-hour stay, £2.50 for two hours and £3 for the maximum three-hour stay. The charges would be in operation from 9am to 6pm, Monday to Saturday.Prater fears even nominal fees could deter visitors: “Those popping in on the way home or on the way through just to grab a pint of milk, a birthday card, you would be amazed at how many times that turns into the sale of something quite significant,” she explains.“Those people are not going to add parking charges to that £2.50 card or £1.50 bottle of milk.”The sloping terrain around Hill Road – the clue is in the name – means there isn’t space for a car park, requiring visitors to park on the street. On the day the Guardian visited, almost all the spaces were taken, which the traders insist highlights the street’s popularity.View image in fullscreenDevvon Wilsher-Day, bridal shop owner.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianThe current parking rules suit the brides-to-be who visit Devvon Wilsher-Day’s shop So Gorgeous Bridal to try on wedding dresses.“Customers come for two-hour appointments, so it works fantastically for us at the moment, because of the two hours free parking,” she says, sitting next to racks of lace and satin creations.Wilsher-Day acknowledges her customers might be willing to pay for parking, but calls the council’s plans “shortsighted”.“If people are coming to Clevedon and spending money in the shops here and local residents run the shops and spend money back in the economy, it’s a wonderful thing,” she says.Wilsher-Day and her mother moved their shop to Clevedon just 18 months ago after years based in a suburb of nearby Weston-super-Mare, where they believe the introduction of parking charges contributed to the decline of the local high street.North Somerset first set out its parking proposals in 2024, saying it would apply a consistent approach to on-street parking, council-owned car parks and other land it owns.It said one of its goals was to create “well-managed and well-maintained parking facilities” that “support local economies” while responding to the challenges of the climate crisis and fostering healthy communities.It also announced its ambitions for “parking that is self-funding where possible or which creates surplus for the council” to be invested back into parking and transport.Local authorities introducing parking charges oftenrefer to earlier researchsuggesting that having to pay to park does not have a negative effect on town centre footfall, while “free” parking is typically covered by taxpayers when the local authority has to pay for the upkeep of spaces and enforcement of the regulations.However, the Hill Road traders are not persuaded by this, says David Sims, who owns the independent bookshop Books on the Hill. “If you look at the places where they’ve done those studies, they’re not here. They haven’t got characteristics like this.”Sims and others worry customers will drive instead to the large Cribbs Causeway out-of-town shopping centre and retail park about 15 miles up the road, where parking is free, or shop online.The council, run by a coalition of Liberal Democrats and independents, has not yet approved the parking charge proposals, nor set a date for their introduction.However, it may face a legal challenge from among its own ranks, according to the Conservative councillor Chris Blades, who sits on North Somerset council and also chairs Clevedon town council.View image in fullscreenThe chair of Clevedon town council, Chris Blades.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The Guardian“Along with the business improvement district we have got solicitors involved,” he says. “The town council is vehemently opposed.”Some locals say North Somerset council has form. It spent about £1.5m to install – andsubsequently remove– controversial “wiggly” road markings in Clevedon, which was labelled a“bizarre road scheme”by the RAC motoring organisation.However, not everyone is opposed to the council’s plans. One resident, Paul Hitchcock, says: “As long as it’s brought in carefully, I think it’s inevitable. Part of me thinks it would stop the parking spaces from being blocked all day.”A spokesperson for North Somerset council said the introduction of parking charges had been “subject to extensive engagement with the public” and it had considered “all views given”, resulting in a lower tariff being proposed for Hill Road than elsewhere.They added: “In Nailsea, we have sold over 36,000 tickets since introducing charges and ticket data shows a month-on-month increase in car park use during that time.”Explore more on these topicsRetail industryLocal governmentMotoringSomersetfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He is able to show us beauty and despair, and the beauty in despair and the despair in beauty. The best track to me is Islands of Men, which builds over this hypnotic instrumental while Winter sings about isolation and self-illusion. Other highlights would be the title track and Half Real, which feels like a dizzy, intoxicated folk song. Geese are the next big thing.Freddie, 18, SurreyLily Allen – West End GirlI loved the wordplay, delivery and melody. The slightly detached layered vocals really sounded like a person in shock recounting what has happened to them. So good to hear an imperfect person tell their own stories. And I forgot how funny Lily Allen is! More imperfect women, please.Alison 37, IrelandPicture Parlour – The ParlourThe Liverpudlian rock outfit’s debut EP was worth the wait. Singer and front-woman Katherine Parlour has such a distinctive voice and guitarist Ella Risi leads the charge with infectious riffs and ripping solos. With an almost baroque and art-rock feel, the album is both uplifting and nostalgic, with plenty of reflection on the journey which has got this under-appreciated duo (and their backing band) to this point. Having seen them in the tiny Windmill in Brixton, I think it is only a matter of time before they are commanding far larger venues.Eddie, LondonSelf Esteem – A Complicated WomanView image in fullscreenHonesty … Self Esteem, AKA Rebecca Lucy Taylor.Photograph: Rosaline Shahnavaz/The GuardianThis album has been on constant rotation. Rebecca Lucy Taylor’s lyrics are full of honesty, humour, sincerity and despair, set to snarly synths, gorgeous choral arrangements and sing-along stadium belters. I was lucky enough to see Self Esteem in concert earlier this year and this album is made for live performances. The drama and emotion evoked from songs such as The Deep Blue Okay and Focus Is Power hits harder live, with a room full of people shouting along through smiles and tears. Rebecca and her incredible family – and they really do feel like they’re a family – of singers, dancers and musicians are so relatable, funny, raw and empowering. She deserves to rule the world.Jacqui Martin, 50, Exeter, DevonBrooke Combe – Dancing on the EdgeThis album has been on constant repeat since its release in January 2025. So much talent in the performing and songwriting. British soul has never sounded so good. The album has a brilliant 70s vibe throughout with no filler tracks. This Town and LMTFA are outstanding songs.James McElhoney, 65, HalifaxNinajirachi – I Love My ComputerNinajirachi started making music because of YouTube. Now she’s up for eight Aria awardsRead moreThis album is like a modern day Phil Spector Wall of Sound creation – except it’s mostly an Australian woman and her computer. She imagines what a computer would like and desire, and builds a sonic world around that – complete with throwback disk drive sounds. The listener comes to feel actual emotion and, at the same time, nostalgia, for the beeps and boops of the titular computer.Anthony D’Orazio, Pennsylvania, USADijon – BabyDijon is a truly unique artist who is stretching the boundaries of what maximalist R&B can be. He uses texture, imperfect samples, time changes and layering to brilliant effect on his second album. This is a sonically glitchy and cracked yet deeply melodic record that almost takes pleasure in trying to hide the hooks that are, in fact, everywhere on tracks such as Yamaha, Baby and Higher! Recent co-writes with Justin Bieber and Justin Vernon – and snagging bass legend Pino Palladino to help out on most of the tracks on Baby – shows just how high Dijon can go.Christian Gibson, South Coogee, AustraliaFlorence and the Machine – Everybody ScreamView image in fullscreenSoaring … Florence Welch.Photograph: Linda Brownlee/The GuardianI’ve played this almost obsessively since its release. Initially I was captured by Sympathy Magic, which channels Dead Can Dance’s Lisa Gerrard, and The Old Religion, featuring the kinds of soaring vocal hooks Florence Welch is known for. But on re-listens, I particularly like the storytelling around a couple revealed in Music by Men and One of the Greats with its angry take on the music industry. The album explores power, the supernatural and the concerns of people in relationships. One of her best creations.Sara, 43, Melbourne, AustraliaTaylor Swift – The Life of a ShowgirlI nearly chose Florence + the Machine’s Everybody Scream or Wolf Alice’s The Clearing (their best album yet). But who am I kidding? There is one album I have been obsessed with for the last two months and that is Taylor Swift’s The Life of a Showgirl. I wake up singing “Elizabeth Taylor!” I dance throughout the day to an ear worm of Opalite. I shed a tear to Ruin the Friendship whenever I think about it. The Fate of Ophelia has been the song of the year and a viral sensation – quite rightly.Anna Harries, OxfordClipse – Let God Sort Em OutThe album starts with an emotional, hard-hitting song about the recent deaths of their parents and the album continues to build from this, with excellent production by Pharrell and great bars from Malice and Pusha T. The album also has incredible features from artists such as John Legend, Tyler, the Creator and Nas. Overall, the album is one of the best rap albums of the decade, showing the immense talent of Clipse more than 15 years after their previous album.Lewis Johnstone, 22, ScotlandEl Michels Affair – 24 Hr SportsClairo producer Leon Michels’ diverse and genre-bending project blends soulful hip-hop beats and classic soul, with a dusty production that at times recalls the likes of MF Doom and J Dilla. Clairo returns the favour by providing guest vocals on one of the album’s highlights. A real gem.Sean, ManchesterLord Huron – The Cosmic Selector Vol 1I only discovered Lord Huron last year and quickly fell in love with their very unique style of music, which blends storytelling and atmosphere to create a true listening experience. Sometimes listening to their albums almost feels like a podcast considering how well they are constructed and how seamlessly each song transitions into another. The accompanying extra media also often hints at a greater story that weaves through every one of their albums. On listening to their previous albums, I also noticed recurring motifs, or little melodies that returned on this record, which gave me a whole new appreciation of music that I already thought was amazing to begin with.Juliet Gentle, 21, AldershotCMAT – Euro-CountryMy favourite was a vinyl copy of Euro-Country by CMAT. It is a lament of a time in Ireland when we thought there would be no end to the prosperity – the Celtic Tiger. How wrong we were and how well Ciara Mary-Alice Thompson captures the highs and lows of that era in a poppy, heartfelt non-nostalgic way. A pure joy.Ger Thunder, Dublin, IrelandLoyle Carner – Hopefully!The songwriting is certainly the gem of this project; parenting and its dynamic with being an artist are major themes, and Carner impresses yet again with the rawness of his words. There are highs and lows that show the beauty and joy of being a father, while also revealing the doubt and self-criticism that arise after we forget that this is our first time on this rodeo, too. The instrumentals complement the message beautifully, creating a rich and wonderful soundscape: smooth and soft breakbeats, hints of synths, and dreamy pianos chirping in at all the right moments. It’s quite pleasing to listen to.Akram, 23, Sunshine Coast, Queensland, AustraliaJerskin Fendrix – Once Upon a Time… in ShropshireView image in fullscreenMasterful … Jerskin Fendrix.Photograph: Tim GuttFor his second album, Joscelin Dent-Pooley crafted a beautifully emotional masterpiece that weaves nostalgia for simpler childhood times with current grief and future anxiety. The sound is both baroque and folksy, simple and complex, from the wonderful opening salvo of Beth’s Farm to the skronky skat of Jerskin Fendrix Freestyle, to the sadness-cracked baritone of Mum & Dad. It’s no wonder he is Yorgos Lanthimos’s go-to man for his soundtracks. That it all holds together as a cohesive and involving whole is a masterful tightrope walk. The emotional heft is deeply personal but also universal, celebrating family, friendship and the wonders of life should you take the time to look around.Tom Bristow, 49, Blandford Forum, DorsetBlack Country, New Road – Forever HowlongEvery time these guys have released an album it’s been my album of the year – which never happens: not even Björk managed that. I love that they’ve changed style again and now sound almost nothing like the band from For the First Time. I love the harmonies. I love how hard the songs hit once they hit. I love watching a band grow. I love how even now, I can hear new bits in the songs. I want to be friends with this band but I’m not cool enough.James, CroydonBig Thief – Double InfinityDouble Infinity cemented itself to my soul and became the soundtrack to my trip of a lifetime to Minneapolis. It slotted into a retro 70s houseboat on the Mississippi, it cheered along to No Kings day. Adrianne Lenker’s voice is treacle, reminding me of how precious love is. I felt loved by Minneapolis and I only need to hear the first few bars of this album to be immediately transported back there.Sue Cattanach, 65, BrightonOklou – Choke EnoughOklou’s Choke Enough has been my No 1 ever since I first heard it. It’s the album I keep going back to. So catchy, so joyously uplifting, I’m never not in the mood for it. Highlights include ICT, the greatest song ever about an ice-cream truck, and Harvest Sky, a witchy dancefloor-filling banger.Chloe, 40, Perth, AustraliaYHWH Nailgun – 45 PoundsI was reading Pitchfork’s weekly album summary and they described the use of rototom on this record, I immediately knew I had to listen to it. I turned it on in the kitchen, and my wife immediately asked: “What is this crap?” The album is beautiful and the percussion is so wild. Just when you think you’ve caught the rhythm it all collapses in on itself. I saw them at Green Man in the summer, and it’s impossible to dance to, but there were some young kids singing along to every unintelligible word ...Matt Jollands, 40, TauntonExplore more on these topicsMusicBest music of 2025Pop and rockHip-hopIndieSoulfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Captioned only “video93884728.mp4”, the 18-minutevideoat first appeared to be a leaked Zoom call in which the Oscar-nominated actor pitched marketing ideas for the movieMarty Supremeto bemused staff at the indie production house A24. It might take a few minutes, and at least one shock interjection of “schwap!” from the very serious-seeming star, to realize that it’s a joke. Well, sort of – the meta video, in which an egomaniacal Chalamet proposes they “highlight international cooperation” by painting both the Statue of Liberty and the Eiffel Tower a “very specific shade orange”, satirizes the tedium of movie marketing desperate to get people in seats, while also introducing a harebrained marketing strategy that’s unabashedly thirsty to get people in seats.Marty Supreme review – Timothée Chalamet a smash in spectacular screwball ping-pong nightmareRead moreThe “leak” heralded an unconventional and extremely committed press campaign forJosh Safdie’s 50s-set ping-pong epic that has turned movie marketing – so often formulaic, cloying or apathetic – into eye-catching performance art. “Movie marketing is trying to be passive, trying to be chic,” Chalamet says in the video, for which he wrote the script. “We’re not trying to be chic.”Not chic, perhaps, but certainly entertaining. In the weeks since Chalamet pitched “fruitionizing” Marty Supreme via big orange blimp (the “vehicle representation of American greatness”), the actor and studio have been somehow bothunpredictable and everywhere. Among the highlights: staged pop-up screenings with Chalamet flanked by bodyguards sporting giant orange ping-pong balls for heads; a near-wordless Instagram live that introduced the refrain “Marty Supreme Christmas Day” to the masses; an ad campaign in which the so-called Goats (Greatest of All Time) of various fields, from Tom Brady to Bill Nye to Misty Copeland, wear a branded windbreaker – “the defining garment of 2025”, according toGQ– for an ad campaign that exhorted people to “dream big”; a mock talent competition with Chalamet and the ping-pong bodyguards as judge; and, of course, a bright orange blimp above LA, with journalistson board. (As of this writing, the Statue of Liberty remains green, but A24 did get the Sphere in Las Vegas to that very specific rust shade.) The hype for an unreleased, original ping-pong movie was sky high even before Chalamet memorablydebunked rumorsthat he’s moonlighting as an underground rapper namedEsDeeKid, when he appeared in amusic videofor a remix of the masked Liverpudlian’s hit 4 Raws.It all makes for easily the most idiosyncratic, unhinged and genuinely enjoyable press run in a year when the movie press run often seemed like it had run out of road. And it appears to be working – in limited release in New York and Los Angeles ahead of the holidays, Marty Supreme scored thebiggest per theater averageopening for a film since 2016, a promising start for A24’s most expensive feature to date, with a budget reportedly around $60m. That’s a rare spot of good news for original theatrical releases this year, which have by and large failed to connect with audiences despite marquee movie-star wattage. Even with top-tier talent making the traditional rounds, films such asA Big Bold Beautiful Journey(Margot Robbie and Colin Farrell),The Smashing Machine(Emily Blunt and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson),Roofman(Channing Tatum and Kirsten Dunst),After the Hunt(Julia Roberts and Andrew Garfield),Good Fortune(Keanu Reeves and Seth Rogen),Kiss of the Spider Woman(Jennifer Lopez) andAnemone(Daniel Day-Lewis, in his first film role in eight years),struggled to attract peopleto theaters in recent months.There are, of course, numerous macro reasons why it’s more difficult than ever for original and/or indie films to compete in a market dominated by remakes, reboots and franchises: the decline of the movie star, for one, as well as the proliferation of streaming and the many, many second screens competing for audience attention. But the Marty Supreme press coup underscores just how important, as well as confounding and inconstant, the work post post-production has become. Many a celebrity and their marketing managers have been bedeviled this year by what Vulturetermed“the New Media Circuit” – the vast, unofficial constellation of celebrity-friendly podcasts, video series and outlet-affiliated gimmicks sought by movie marketers for the vaporous goal of activating the internet.These days, a traditional (“passive”) movie campaign – late-night show anecdotes, junkets, gauzy profiles in a respected outlet – isn’t going to cut it, even when the star at hand is as funny and game as Jennifer Lawrence. (No amount of charm offensive on Hot Ones could get people to see her dark psychodrama Die, My Love.) Winning the attention wars is no guarantee of success, either; Sydney Sweeney was in plenty of headlines and social media posts this fall, but her boxing biopic Christy flopped spectacularly.Fallen stars: why are Hollywood A-listers flopping at the box office?Read moreIn the rules of the new media circuit, there is no guaranteed success, only volume and a willingness to try new things … which is, unfortunately, how you end up with A-list movie stars like George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio on a podcast hosted by the Kelce brothers. (Perhaps that helped get the dudes out to see F1.) In a beyond over-saturated media environment, the name of the game is surprise and memorability. Ryan Coogler’s Sinners, the highest-grossing original film since 2010 and indisputably theindustry highlight of the year, ran a decently standard press campaign, and thrived on exceptional word of mouth.That, and a sincere pitch for the continued existence of original cinema, which equates the purchase of a ticket with a defense of the arts at a critical time. “I believe in cinema,” Coogler wrote ina thank-you noteto Sinners viewers. “I believe in the theatrical experience. I believe it is a necessary pillar of society. To see your response to the film has reinvigorated me and many others who believe in this art form.”Chalamet, already adept at the New Media Circuit from last year’saward-worthy campaignfor the Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown (in which he crashed his own lookalike contest in Manhattan, out-called the sports analysts on College Gameday, fooled around with Brittany Broski, rode a Lime Bike on to a red carpet and taught dude-bro podcaster Theo Von about government-subsidized arts housing), has taken film appreciation as press crusade to the next level. In his handful of more traditional stops on this very untraditional press blitz – the Tonight Show, Good Morning America, BBC Radio – Chalamet has framed all of his extra-ness as in service of independent, original films in theaters. “This is the easiest sell, for me to come here,” hetoldJimmy Fallon, before imploring viewers “you will not regret it” directly to camera one.“People’s attention spans are so short these days ... How do you convince them to go to the cinema, to spend money to see a film, rather than waiting to stream it illegally, or for it to be available on Netflix?” hesaidduring a different junket stop. “I have an audience, so I engage with them, and I give it 150%.”Time will tell if Chalamet’s 150% will make the difference between a social media hit and a cinematic one. But I can’t knock the effort, as a supporter of original film and of press tours being less rote and overwhelming at the same time. Not every film can pair extremely game movie star with sellable pitch with solid cause, and also make it fun. But here’s to hoping others pick up the new marketing playbook in 2026.Explore more on these topicsTimothée ChalametMarty SupremefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sarathy Korwar – There Is Beauty, There AlreadyA 40-minute suite of continuous, repetitive drumming might not sound like the most accessible music but south Asian percussionist and producer Sarathy Korwar’s latest album, There Is Beauty, There Already, turns this concept of insistent rhythm into strangely alluring work. Leading an ensemble of three drummers, Korwar develops a dense percussive language throughout the record’s 10 movements, channelling Steve Reich’s phasing motifs as well as Indian classical phrasing and anchoring each in the repetition of a continual, thrumming refrain. As the album continues, the refrain begins to emulate the hypnotic repetition of ceremonial rhythm, drawing us further into Korwar’s percussive world the longer we listen.9. Yasmine Hamdan – I Remember I ForgetAfter an eight-year break, Lebanese singer-songwriter Yasmine Hamdan returns with a mournful collection of songs expanding on the Arabic-language, dub-influenced sound that has made her a staple of the region’s indie music scene since the 1990s. Hamdan’s voice is quiet and ruminative, singing tender melodies over the bowing strings of Hon and the rumbling trip-hop groove of Vows, while on livelier tracks such as Shadia and Abyss, she employs a wavering, yearning vibrato over north African synth lines and rattling electronic percussion. The production is sparse and understated yet that minimalism provides the perfect setting for Hamdan’s emotive songwriting to shine through. Well worth the wait.8. Debit – DesaceleradasView image in fullscreenMenacing grooves … Debit.Photograph: Monse GuajardoMexican producer Debit has a knack for eerie reinterpretations of historical sounds. In 2022’s The Long Count, she used samples of Mayan flutes to create a new electronically filtered musical language for the ancient instruments and on her latest release, Desaceleradas, she turns her attention to the 90s style ofcumbia rebajada– a slowed, dubby take on the shuffling Latin American dance music genre. Debit slows this sound even further, processing its signature synths and syncopated beat through layers of sludge and static to produce a new, menacing groove. At turns ambient and discomfiting, Debit turns the joyous dancefloor sound of cumbia into a lasting, ghostly echo.Read the full reviewTell us your favourite albums of 2025Read more7. DJ K – Radio Libertadora!Maximalism is the key term when it comes to the records of São Paulo producer Kaique Vieira, AKA DJ K. Coining his own genre of “bruxaria” (witchcraft), Vieira layers a cacophony of sirens, explosive bass tones and screamed lyrics over the longstanding Brazilian dance style of baile funk to emulate the propulsive sound of favela street parties. On his second album, Radio Libertadora!, Vieira cranks up the intensity, adding everything from techno kick drums to the Islamic call to prayer into hisbruxariamix, creating a particularly frenetic and punishingly loud 40-minute listening experience. Surrender to the noise and Vieira’s brash productions become strangely liberating.Read the full review6. Mohinder Kaur Bhamra – Punjabi DiscoView image in fullscreenRediscovered gem … Mohinder Kaur Bhamra performing in Bedford, circa 1980.Photograph: Courtesy of Kuljit BhamraSikh devotional singer Mohinder Kaur Bhamra’s 1982 album of disco music and Punjabi folk melodies is a rediscovered gem. Recorded by her son Kuljit, a music producer, Punjabi Disco’s 10 tracks deliver an unusually engaging combination of the metallic sound of synthesisers and drum machines with her melismatic Indian classical vocal technique. Electronic percussion mirrors the undulating tones of the tabla and synthesiser melody doubles the traditional sound of the harmonium on tracks such as Pyar Mainu Kar, while bossa nova rhythm comes to the fore on Soniya Mukh Tera and Nainan Da Pyar De Gaya channels a fast-paced walking disco bassline. It’s a dancefloor fusion delivered over a decade before the Asian Underground explosion.Read the full review‘I felt caught between cultures’: Mongolian musician Enji on her beguiling, border-crossing musicRead more5. Enji – SonorMongolian singer Enji’s gentle fourth album, Sonor, expands on her jazz-influenced sound to deliver some of her most wide-ranging music to date. Moving away from her training in traditional Mongolian “long song” singing, the record’s 11 tracks veer from the soft Norah Jones melodics of downtempo number Ulbar to the German spoken-word lyrics and trilling guitar lines of Unadag Dugui and the sprightly, funk-inflected cover of 80s Mongolian pop hit Eejiinhee Hairaar. Featuring a full backing band, rather than her usual setup of guitar and bass, Sonor’s sound is still intimate, pulling the listener into the tender acoustics of her singular voice.4. Derya Yıldırım & Grup Şimşek – Yarın YoksaView image in fullscreenTurkish with a twist … Derya Yildirim & Grup ŞimşekDrawing on the 60s legacy of Turkish psychedelia established by groups such as Moğollar, German-Turkish singer Derya Yıldırım’s third recordwith her band Grup Şimşekblends the metallic twang of the electrified saz with woozy Mellotron and classic soul melodies. It’s a 70s throwback sound anchored in Yıldırım’s powerful falsetto and influenced by producer Leon Michels’ analogue tape aesthetic. Yet, on Turkish standards such as the nursery rhyme Hop Bico and 60s song Ceylan, the group reaches lively new territory, developing slinking, downtempo grooves and soaring vocals that lend a new, off-kilter twist to the Turkish psych sound.Read the full review3. Lido Pimienta – La BellezaCatholic requiem mass music, Czech harpsichord folksong and orchestral strings all come together on Colombian singer Lido Pimienta’s remarkable fourth album. Arranging music for the 60-piece Medellín Philharmonic Orchestra, Pimienta and producer Owen Pallett traverse everything from the Gregorian chants of opener Overturn (Obertura de la Luz Eterna) to the dramatic counterpoint melodies of Aún Te Quiero and syncopated dembow rhythms of the woodwind-heavy El Dembow del Tiempo. It’s Pimienta’s indefatigable voice that is the star, though, floating from yearning intimacy on Quiero Que Me Beses to the fierce full-throated harmonies of Busca la Luz, taking on her mighty symphonic backing with ease.Read the full review2. Negros Tou Moria – Mavri ElladaView image in fullscreenDextrous flow … Negros Tou Moria.Photograph: Giannis StasinopoulosAthenian rapper Negros Tou Moria has made his name over the past decade for coining the genre “trabetiko” – a blend of the Greek working-class folk music ofrebetikowith trap. On Mavri Ellada, he supplants folk melodies for a more raw, hard-hitting sound, rolling through the sub-bass and baritone verses of Samatas to the Afrobeats groove of An Einai Dinaton, the bouzouki motifs of the title track and pumping dancefloor synths of PragmatiKotita. Armed with a dextrous flow, an open ear for unusual production and fierce lyrics on his country’s response to immigration, NTM establishes himself as a rap talent moving far beyond the Greek scene.Read the full review1. Titanic – HagenView image in fullscreenDelightfully unconstrained … Titanic.Photograph: Jasmine SalvinoFearlessly experimental, Guatemalan cellist Mabe Fratti has ranked high in more than one of these global end-of-year lists, including for the enveloping introspection of 2021’s solo effort Será Que Ahora Podremos Entendernos? and 2023’s Vidrio, her freewheeling debut as Titanic with her multi-instrumentalist partner Hector Tosta. For their second Titanic release, Fratti and Tosta are delightfully unconstrained, playing through the metal blastbeats of Gotera, 80s stadium synth-pop of Lágrima del Sol, slinky funk of Escarbo Dimensiones and the post-rock moodiness of La Gallina Degollada. An arresting, consistently surprising record that truly sounds like nothing else.Read the full reviewExplore more on these topicsMusicBest music of 2025Pop and rockDance musicElectronic musicClassical musicDiscoJazzfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s barely aged a dayJamie TramTue 23 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 23 Dec 2025 17.03 ESTShareFor romantic comedies and Christmas movies alike, a little misery can go a long way. No one understood this balancing act more than Billy Wilder, whose films ran the gamut from bottomless cynicism (Ace in the Hole) to gender-bending farce (Some Like it Hot). His 1960 film, The Apartment,splits the difference.Like another yuletide classic,Carol, the film finds inspiration in David Lean’s Brief Encounter, which depicts an extramarital affair briefly consummated in the bed of a friend’s apartment. In an old interview, Wilder says he was compelled by a character “who comes back home and climbs into the warm bed the lovers just left”, and so The Apartment’s hero, CC “Bud” Baxter, was born.North by Northwest: Hitchcock’s funniest, most ambitious filmRead moreBaxter, played by Jack Lemmon (hired right off the back of Some Like it Hot), is an insurance worker who scales the corporate ladder by leasing his bedroom to a rotating cast of middle managers. The concept isn’t far removedfrom an Airbnb, though Baxter weathers the additional humiliations of accommodating his superiors’ sexual conquests outside work. On one sorry occasion, a late request sees him stranded in Central Park on a winter’s night.Wilder didn’t necessarily conceive of the film as a comedy (at times, Joseph LaShelle’s shadowy cinematography more readily evokes noir), but in his own words: “When they laugh, I don’t argue.” Wilder and co-writer IAL Diamond’s playful plotting and staccato repartee keep the film from sinking into the gutter, and Lemmon remains endlessly likable while channelling Baxter’s nervous energy into a spectacle of physical gestures. Each dramatic reveal is offset by a similarly unforgettable joke, whether it’s Lemmon fussing over the placement of a bowler hat or straining spaghetti through a tennis racket.When Baxter develops an innocent crush on Shirley MacLaine’s elevator operator, Fran Kubelik, he unknowingly finds himself in competition with Jeff Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray), the company’s personnel director. Kubelik has sworn off Sheldrake after a summer fling (one of many that this family man has conducted within the office), but he lures her back into his arms when he dishonestly vows to leave his marriage for her. The same day, he offers Baxter a promotion in return for exclusive usage of his Upper West Side abode.View image in fullscreen‘Wilder frames [Baxter’s] workplace as an unending procession of desks and bodies, with production designer Alexandre Trauner making clever use of forced perspective tricks.’Photograph: United Artists/AllstarSheldrake may be a philandering emotional terrorist – at the time, MacMurray had become a Disney icon, leaving some audiences scandalised – but Bud discovers the limits to his downtrodden “nice guy” exterior when he encounters a passed-out Kubelik in his apartment on Christmas Eve.As Baxter and Kubelik finally get to know each other, Wilder works through the self-loathing at each character’s core. Kubelik struggles to believe she’s worthy of anything greater than a tryst with a man who leaves her a $100 note before returning to his wife and children for the holidays. Baxter lacks the courage to stand up for himself and risks numbing himself entirely to the spiritual corruption he’s become immersed in. To illustrate the point, Wilder frames his workplace as an unending procession of desks and bodies, with production designer Alexandre Trauner making clever use of forced perspective tricks.The Apartment at 60: is this Billy Wilder’s finest film?Read moreWith the film being made in the twilight era of the Hays Code, MacLaine embodies a more candid, less inhibited form of female sexuality than had been typically portrayed on screen. It’sa sweet, unconventional performancethat’s subsequently informed any number of manic pixie dream girls and alt-heroines; her ecstatic, new year’s sprint through the streets of New York has become the template for the romcom’s climactic dash towards destiny.In romance and business, ethics are always optional; as Kubelik muses, “some people take, some people get took”. Six decades on, its depiction of atomisation and alienation has barely aged; ill-advised workplace affairs endure, forms of self-commodification have multiplied, and insurance companies remain deeply evil.For anyone who finds themselves lonely on Christmas – or any other day of the year – there are few films more comforting than The Apartment.The Apartment is streaming on MGM+ in Australia and the UK and Fubo in the US, as well as available to rent globally.

But, as this overlooked follow-up attests, he was always a class act. In fact, this is one of his best: a rich, rousing ghost story shrouded in trademark gothic gloom but executed with technical flair and a good deal of empathy.As with his later breakthrough Pan’s Labyrinth, it’s part-horror, part-fairytale, with children at its centre. The setting is a middle-of-nowhere boys’ orphanage in 1930sSpain, a leftist sanctuary from Franco’s fascists during the civil war. Newcomer Carlos (Fernando Tielve) must find his feet in this semi-surreal realm, with an unexploded bomb in the middle of the courtyard, some kindly adults (one-legged Marisa Paredes and kindly doctor Federico Luppi), some not-so-kindly adults (aggressive caretaker Eduardo Noriega), and junior bullies to win over. There’s also a ghost in the mix: a pale-faced boy named Santi, whose death no one seems to want to discuss, and to whose empty bed Carlos is ominously assigned.There are moments of eerie suspense as this nocturnal apparition stalks the corridors and lures Carlos down to the cellars; del Toro turns up the dread magnificently, with atmospheric lighting, sharp objects and babies pickled in jars. But the real terror, of course, comes from the mortal grownups, whose approaches to child safeguarding are, let’s say, variable, and whose own intrigues embroil all the children as the war closes in. The political and the supernatural come together beautifully (and violently), and the unsentimental portrayal of childhood is refreshing, with terrific performances from the boy actors. It’s altogether a supremely satisfying tale.The Devil’s Backbone is in UK cinemas from 26 December.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsGuillermo del ToroHorror filmsWar filmsSpainPeriod and historical filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Sprouting at the foot of the Cerro Rico, South America’s most populous settlement produced 60% of the world’s silver, which not only enabled Spain to wage its wars and service its debts, but also accelerated the economic development of India and China. The city’s wealthy elites could enjoy crystal from Venice and diamonds from Ceylon while one in four of its mostly indigenous miners perished. Cerro Rico became known as “the mountain that eats men”.The story of Potosí, in what is now southern Bolivia, contains the core elements of Sven Beckert’s mammoth history of capitalism: extravagant wealth, immense suffering, complex international networks, a world transformed. The Eurocentric version of capitalism’s history holds that it grew out of democracy, free markets, Enlightenment values and the Protestant work ethic. Beckert, a Harvard history professor and author of 2015’s prize-winning Empire of Cotton, assembles a much more expansive narrative, spanning the entire globe and close to a millennium. Like its subject, the book has a “tendency to grow, flow, and permeate all areas of activity”. Fredric Jameson famously said that it was easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism. At times during these 1,100 pages, I found it easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of Capitalism.“No religion, no ideology, no philosophy, has ever been as all-encompassing as the economic logic of capitalism,” Beckert claims, defining it as “the ceaseless accumulation of privately controlled capital”. Accounting for it therefore feels like explaining water to fish. Adam Smith, “the hero of capitalism’s triumphant self-remembrance”, attributed it to benign self-interest. Beckert, however, calls it a revolution, centuries in the making, which depended on things that Smith downplayed: “power, violence, the state”. Far from natural or inevitable, it has always been “unstable and contested”, proceeding by jolts.The word “capitalism”originated in France in the 1840s, around the same time as its antagonists “socialism”, “communism” and “anarchism”, but the system was much older. “Capitalism is a process,” Beckert writes, “not a discrete historical event with a beginning and an end”. He begins tracking the process in the port of Aden in 1150. This vibrant trade hub between Asia and the Middle East, in what is now Yemen, was one of several “islands of capital” which formed a “capitalist archipelago”. Inventing new trades like accountancy and insurance, its “strikingly modern” residents were in the vanguard of a global insurgency. But their accumulation of profit for its own sake was regarded with suspicion by rulers, religions and ordinary people alike. They enjoyed wealth without power or prestige: “capitalists without capitalism”.He visits Barbados, Samarkand and Phnom Penh; he quotes cultural texts from Abba to ZolaWhat they needed was the state’s collaboration. This developed during the “Great Connecting” between 1450 and 1650, when the discovery of the Americas (named after a slave-owning merchant) finally enabled European traders to challenge Asia and the Middle East while makingthemselves indispensable. In the era of “war capitalism”, new trade routes and territorial seizures triggered conflict, which trade then financed. Colonialism established capitalism’s “connected diversity”, which is to say, think global, act local.Like silver, sugar reconfigured the world. On the previously uninhabited island of Barbados, just 74 sugar planters used “American lands, African labour and European capital” to create a private slave colony – the new capitalist avant garde. Across the Americas, millions of enslaved people represented trillions of dollars in unpaid labour. Even after Britain abolished slavery in 1833, there were no clean hands. An ordinary European who began his day with a cigarette and a cup of sweetened coffee was already complicit in three branches of the slave trade. The Industrial Revolution, capitalism’s Great Leap Forward, required less explicit forms of coercion and exploitation. One luminary described Victorian Manchester as “the chimney of the world … the entrance to hell realised”. Meanwhile, envy of America’s vast territories and abundant resources inspired Europe’s dismemberment of Africa, which one French newspaper called “America at our doorsteps”.Beckert enjoys shredding capitalism’s self-flattering myths. He calls the notion of the free market “nothing more than a figment of scholars’ and ideologues’ imaginations”. The Protestant work ethic was deployed to justify child labour at home and forced labour abroad. “It is necessary to use methods that best can shake their idleness and make them realise the sanctity of work,” was how the Belgian King Leopold II rationalised working millions to death in Congo Free State. And yet, impossible though it was to imagine at the time, capitalism outlasted both slavery and empire.Capitalism’s “permanent revolution”, Beckert writes, produces both dynamism and instability. Similarly, its “connected diversity” cuts both ways – when one crucial region or commodity catches a cold, the whole world sneezes. Crisis is in its DNA. Some emergencies, like the long depressions of the 1870s and 1930s, appeared terminal. Karl Marx, of course, believed that capitalism had an expiration date, but so did the conservative economist Joseph Schumpeter, who asked in 1942: “Can capitalism survive? No. I do not think it can.” Yet every Jeremiah underrated its remarkable survival instincts. Infinitely adaptable, agnostic about nations and creeds, and essentially amoral, it keeps on going.If anyone comes out of this story looking good then it’s John Maynard Keynes, who sought to save capitalism from itself. Combined with thriving labour movements, the challenge of communism and the double shock of war and depression, his prescription for state intervention tamed capitalism’s worst instincts during three decades of extraordinary growth and relative equality after 1945. Call it capitalism with a human face. But then the neoliberal counterrevolution, Beckert argues, spurred capitalism towards its endgame: the commodification of everything. In 2025 it would be foolish to argue that capitalism goes hand in hand with liberal democracy.The scope of Beckert’s research is mind-boggling. He visits Barbados, Samarkand and Phnom Penh. He quotes cultural texts from Abba to Zola. He profiles emblematic figures such as the Bavarian merchant Jakob Fugger (possibly the richest man who ever lived), Chile’s General Pinochet (“the Lenin of neoliberalism”), the Indian nationalist and industrialist Ardeshir Godrej and the German steel magnate and war criminal Hermann Röchling. He manufactures a ceaseless, and sometimes exhausting, flow of startling details.The question that Beckert never quite answers is: why capitalism? While it’s hard to argue with his copious evidence of capitalism’s poisonous offspring, from scientific racism to climate change, and the numerous efforts to resist its advance, there must be more to it than war, slavery, imperialism and inequality. Even Marx and Engels gave the devil his due in The Communist Manifesto: for all its savagery, it had “accomplished wonders”. Beckert is so good at decrying the sticks that he downplays the carrots: longer lives, higher living standards, labour-saving innovations, new vistas of experience. In this story, capitalism is the answer to every question, the root of every ill, yet the histories of feudalism and communism suggest that cruelty and exploitation are not unique to one economic system.If Adam Smith was wrong to see capitalism as human nature manifest, then Beckert overcorrects by presenting it asanti-human: a “rogue artificial intelligence”, an invasive species, an alien force, a supernatural hunger. It is insatiable and unkillable. Beckert calls his book an “actor-centred history” about a phenomenon “made by people”, but it is ultimately a kind of horror story about a monster that eats men.Capitalism: A Global History by Sven Beckert is published by Allen Lane (£50).

But Terminator 2D is at its strongest when colouring outside the director’s linesRick LaneTue 23 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 23 Dec 2025 05.01 ESTShareLike Arnie’s pulverised cyborg at the end of T2, the Terminator franchise has lumbered on long past the point of being properly functional. Every film since Judgment Day has been a disappointment or an outright disaster, and its video game spinoffs haven’t fared much better. While some half-decent ones have emerged, such as 2019’s Terminator: Resistance, there hasn’t been a great Terminator game in about 30 years.So it makes perfect sense for Terminator 2D: No Fate to attempt to fix our broken future by travelling back to the past. Developer Bitmap Bureau appeals to the series’ heyday by retelling the story of Judgment Day through a medley of retro 80s and 90s playstyles. The result is a charming and frequently thrilling action throwback, though ironically it is at its strongest when it strays furthest from James Cameron’s film.Terminator 2D begins several years before the events of the film, charting Sarah Connor’s doomed attempt to sabotage Cyberdyne systems before her incarceration at Pescadero Hospital. These early levels, which see Sarah running and gunning her way through a gang of outlaws, police, and hazmat-wearing researchers, are among the game’s best. Bitmap Bureau does a remarkable job capturing Linda Hamilton’s gritty performance in a handful of pixels, while the scenarios eke impressive variety from simple arcade fundamentals.View image in fullscreenGaming greatness … Terminator 2D: No Fate.Photograph: Bitmap Bureau/ Reef EntertainmentThe momentum carries on into the future, where you spend a couple of levels fighting the armies of Skynet as adult John Connor in nuclear-blasted LA. Terminator 2D ramps up the spectacle here, with laser weapons and incendiary grenades deployed against Chrome-plated T-800s and several enormous mini-bosses. The section culminates in a thrilling boss fight against a flying Hunter-Killer drone, at which Bitmap Bureau throws all the fireworks its 16-bit aesthetic allows.No Fate loses some of its thrust once it catches up with Judgment Day. The midsection replicates key scenes from the film in playable form, such as the chase sequences that bookend the story. But these feel overly constrained by the game’s self-imposed limitations and aren’t very exciting to play. Better served are Arnie’s bar-fight scene and Sarah Connor’s escape from Pescadero, which employ beat ’em up principles and stealth respectively. While stylish and capably designed, these ideas deserve more room to breathe.T2D regains its earlier verve in its concluding levels, though the story reaches its denouement quicker than the actual film. Fortunately, as is always the case in Terminator, the end is not really the end. Like its arcade forebears, No Fate places heavy emphasis on replay value. Not only do its harder modes challenge you with adjusted enemy placements, completing the story mode unlocks new pathways that explore alternate futures hinging on Sarah’s choices.While No Fate doesn’t move the needle for Terminator games as much as I’d like, it succeeds in resetting the clock for the series’ interactive arm. It’s a pointed reminder that Terminator has gaming greatness within it.Terminator 2D: No Fate is out now; £24.99Explore more on these topicsGamesPlayStation 4PlayStation 5XboxPCNintendo SwitchNintendo Switch 2reviewsShareReuse this content"

There were sightings, exorcisms, illicit grave excavations and even some desecrations. At the frenzied height of the speculation, the local police force got involved.In real-life events that sound like the stuff of Hammer horror (indeed, the Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing Hammer horror filmDracula AD 1972was apparently inspired by the incident), two men, David Farrant and Sean Manchester, got involved in hopes of solving the case. But rather than becoming a Holmes and Watson of the supernatural dimension, they embarked on a bitterly fought contest to be the first to vanquish the vampire, each undermining the other man’s authority along the way.View image in fullscreenA bitter contest … James Demain as Farringdon and Alexander Knott as Sheffield.Photograph: Charlie FlintHere, Patrick Sheffield (Alexander Knott) is a bishop in robes and cassock while Daniel Farringdon (James Demain) is a tobacconist by day and vampire hunter by night. Written by Demain and Knott, this hour-long comedy is shaped as a lecture which both men try to lead, each wrestling the narrative from the other, stopping, starting, disagreeing, and involving even their lecture’s technician, Audrey (played by Zöe Grain, who is also the show’s projection designer and producer). She apparently creates creepy sound effects in key moments of their testimonies (the sound design and musical composition is in fact by Samuel Heron) and enthusiastically shakes her maraca by the side of the stage during a musical number.Directed by Ryan Hutton, this is surprisingly sweet meta-theatre that zips along like a sketch. The men comically transform into various eye-witnesses and there are some funny lines about Karl Marx, who is famously buried in Highgate cemetery. It is charmingly performed although it could afford to be both sharper and scarier. You feel some goosebumps, such as during the account given by a teenage girl who spots a red-eyed “entity” in the dark that holds her in a vampiric trance – but you wish for more of such moments to contrast the breezy comedy. Still, it is an amusing alternative to a Christmas ghost story, all the more outrageous for its stranger-than-fiction roots.

Though best known for that series of blockbuster military shooters, Zampella touched a huge number of lives – not only the hundreds of people who worked at the game development studios he led under Activision and EA, but the millions of people who played the games that bore his imprint.A lifelong gamer, Zampella had a Pong console as a child, then an Atari 2600 and a Commodore 64. Hetold IGNin 2016 that his favourite game from childhood was Donkey Kong: “I would spend hours at the arcade playing it.” Zampella’s first job in the industry was at GameTek in Miami, which specialised in video-game versions of popular US quizshows. He described his role on the small team as: “producer slash customer services slash tester – whatever needed to be done.”It was at a developer called 2015, Inc in Tulsa that Zampella had his first smash hit as lead designer. Medal of Honor: Allied Assault was the third title in the acclaimed series of second world war shooters, which had been inspired by Saving Private Ryan and written in conjunction with Steven Spielberg. Zampella had envisioned a new type of shooter with an epic, cinematic sense of immersion. The game was a bestseller, acclaimed for its globetrotting narrative and taut, tense action – especially during its thrilling depiction of the Omaha beach landing.He will be remembered as one of the most influential game designers of his eraWhen publisher Electronic Arts made the decision to take the development of Medal of Honour in-house, Zampella and his colleague Jason West left, together with Grant Collier, and set up Infinity Ward in Los Angeles. There they created Call of Duty, a second world war shooter designed to exceed Medal of Honor’s sense of epic drama – indeed, its original development title had been Medal of Honor Killer. Critically, the game featured a range of lead characters including US, British and Russian fighters rather than giving players control of a single “super soldier”. “It’s meant to show you that no one side won the war – it was an allied effort,” Zampella saidat the time.Once again, the emphasis was on dramatic set-piece battles on a vast scale, with the player surrounded by computer-controlled allies giving the impression of being a small part of a wider campaign. “We’re all about authenticity and intensity,” Zampella said. “We’ve strived to put as many guys on screen as possible. It’s about your squad, not you as a lone gunman.”View image in fullscreenCinematic intensity … Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2009).This emphasis on teamwork and cinematic intensity would become emblematic of Call of Duty. While two sequels remained in the theatre of the second world war, for the fourth title, released in 2007, Zampella and West decided to move into the modern era. The result, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, is one of the most important and influential first-person shooters ever made.Its campaign features a group of special forces operatives, including newcomer John “Soap” MacTavish and grizzled SAS captain John Price, taking on Russian ultra-nationalists and a Middle Eastern warlord. It had imaginative and exciting missions, including All Ghillied Up, a sniper mission in the wake of the Chornobyl disaster, and the eerie Death From Above, in which players control the various weapons of a C-130 aircraft, taking out enemies on the ground who appear merely as dots on an infrared screen. Meanwhile, the game’s online multiplayer mode brought new innovations including kill-streaks, which allowed players on a winning run to call in special attacks such as airstrikes. Infinity Ward created the template for multiplayer shooters that is still used today. Call of Duty’s DNA is present in every modern hit of the genre.I always felt he still had his greatest game ahead of him. It’s heartbreaking that we’ll never get to play itIn 2010, Zampella and West were fired from Infinity Ward by publisher Activision, and went on to form Respawn Entertainment, taking more than 30 Call of Duty staff with them. Under new publisher Electronic Arts, the company released Titanfall in 2014, a multiplayer-focused sci-fi shooter intended to innovate within the genre. The game emphasised the player’s freedom of movement, allowing for smooth, parkour-style navigation of obstacles and structures. Players were also able to call in and pilot giant, heavily armed mechs. As Zampella explainedat the time: “It’s taking the old paradigm of these shooter games being very grounded and two-dimensional and now adding this verticality to it and making it something that’s a new experience; something that people haven’t seen before.”View image in fullscreen‘It was an allied effort’ … Call of Duty: WWII (2017).Photograph: Rich Stanton/Call of DutyAfter splitting with Activision, Zampella advised several other game creatives who found themselves at odds with their publishers and were considering striking out on their own. One of them was Hideo Kojima, creator of Metal Gear Solid and, at his own studio Kojima Productions, the Death Stranding series. “When I was preparing to go independent myself, and maybe because he felt we were in similar situations, he took the time to listen to me, offered advice, and supported me in many ways,” wrote a “heartbroken” Kojima on X after Zampella’s death. “He even showed me around the studio. Even after he moved to DICE, whenever I went to Los Angeles, we would have meals together and talk about our respective futures”Titanfall’s sequel added an extraordinary single-player story to the original’s fluid online play – it is still one of the best shooter campaigns around. That series’ emphasis on smooth, seamless movement would also characterise Respawn’s entry into the battle royale genre: Apex Legends. Released with almost no pre-publicity in 2019, it would attract 10m players in its opening 72 hours and still maintains a place in the pantheon alongside Fortnite and Call of Duty: Warzone.Respawn next made two excellent single-player Star Wars games, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Survivor. Zampella’s peers have noted that working on the Star Wars franchise brought him and his colleagues at Respawn great joy.In 2020, Electronic Arts put Zampella in charge of the Battlefield franchise, with a remit to recharge the series after the disappointing performance of Battlefield V and Battlefield 2042. Released in October, Battlefield 6 was widely praised as a return to form, especially the online multiplayer modes. It sold 7m copies in three days, the best ever opening for the series.View image in fullscreenWorking on the Star Wars games brought Zampella great joy … Star Wars Jedi: Survivor (2023).Photograph: Electronic ArtsZampella will be remembered as one of the most influential game designers of his era and a ceaseless innovator in the first-person shooter genre – and with the Star Wars Jedi series, outside it. He was someone whom you always looked forward to encountering or interviewing at games industry events, an outspoken creative who cared deeply about video games and the player’s experience.“Vince was an extraordinary person – a gamer at heart, but also a visionary executive with a rare ability to recognise talent and give people the freedom and confidence to create something truly great,” wrote Geoff Keighley on X, who runs the Game Awards and, as a former games journalist, worked on a documentary about Titanfall with Zampella. “Even when it was difficult or uncomfortable, Vince never wavered in his commitment to honesty and transparency. He believed that the truth mattered, and he was willing to share it with the world. Vince cared deeply about doing the right thing. And even while working inside large organisations, he consistently pushed to put players first – to prioritise the experience, the craft and the people who played the games. He leaves behind an incredible legacy of work … I always felt he still had his greatest one ahead of him. It’s heartbreaking that we’ll never get to play it.”Explore more on these topicsGamesCall of DutyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Since 2019’s Shepherd in a Sheepskin Vest, the Maryland-born songwriter has shared his beguiling meditations on being changed by parenthood and marriage, while his music has loosened and expanded accordingly. The latter is in part down to the chemistry that Callahan has formed with his live band – guitarist Matt Kinsey, saxophonist Dustin Laurenzi and drummer Jim White also of the Dirty Three – audible on the extraordinary 2024 live album Resuscitate! It’s this ensemble and their facility for improv that powers Callahan’s forthcoming solo record, My Days of 58, the first tastes of which offer up some Callahan wisdom.The song Lonely City, he said, was an odd one for him to write, being generally more concerned with “humans and the spirit within”.So writing about concrete and steel felt like a no go. Like I’m going to write a song about a car next?﻿ But of course cities are made by humans so they are human, too. You have a relationship with them, like friends.Bill Callahan: Lonely City – videoYou can ask Callahan about his relationship to cities or his new record when he sits for the Guardian’s reader interview in early January – or his ever-exploratory current listening, the recent reissue of his classic 2001 Peel Session as Smog, whether he remembers anything of his family’s years living in Knaresbrough during his childhood, his perhaps unlikely seeming collaboration with Noah Cyrus (sister of Miley) or his vibey covers project with Bonnie “Prince” Billy. Maybe he’ll let on which British musician Protest Song is really about (also unlikely).

I was born in Harare, Zimbabwe, where I lived until I was 12. It was years later, when my sister’s boy Nicholas was about five, that I first discovered it – and it was through his eyes. We saw one at Stratford East and he was blown away by how cool everything was, how colourful. His mates were in the audience and that felt great, too. It became a tradition we tried to keep until, of course, he became too cool for school. Panto audiences are different, they have this “response-ability”, which I think is interesting when you go as a big family. You are encouraged to disrupt the action that’s happening and you try your best as a kid to help the goodie do the right thing.Vikki Stone’sAladdin at the Lyric Hammersmith in London in 2021truly changed my perspective on what panto could do. It was just after lockdown and she took the piss out of anything she could: the out-of-our-heads silliness of those times, those maddening press briefings – there was also a Boris Johnson lookalike and there are few things more panto than him. It didn’t exclude anybody and it came with the soothing joy of having a proper, bonkers laugh with a bit of music and dance. It was captivating.Although I have been known to make work that engages directly with the audience, I was floored by how they achieved that feeling, that special giddiness.View image in fullscreenSoothing joy … Ellena Vincent, Kate Donnachie and Irvine Iqbal in Aladdin.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe actors have to be in the moment – they are playing a character, but they’re also reading the audience and reacting to them. I think that is a really hard thing to get right. I also think they are particularly African things, because in southern Africa, we sing, dance and act almost simultaneously. Movement is always a part of your expression and so is music. In Britain, I think panto is the only time that I’ve seen that synthesis.I am a queer person from Zimbabwe and I’ve written plays about Robert Mugabe and the trauma of migration. I don’t have a problem with being a writer who addresses those things, but Aladdin changed the trajectory of my work. It took me out of the “making Black/African work” box, allowed me to lean into my own silliness, and at the same time celebrate my tendency towards exactness. You need that for a good panto.And can you believe it? Here we are now, embracing an utterly African central dame inMama Goose, which I co-wrote with Vikki. And Nicholas, now a talented DJ, has his ticket. I hope to make him proud.Mama Goose is atTheatre Royal Stratford East, London, until 3 JanuaryAs told to Lindesay IrvineExplore more on these topicsPanto seasonThe play that changed my lifeTheatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Aside from hugging a fluffy hot-water bottle, sipping theChristmas whiskyand ramping up the thermostat, an electric blanket or heated throw is the best way to ward off the winter chill. When you consider that more than half of a typical household’s fuel bills goeson heating and hot water, findingalternative ways to keep warm– and heating the person, rather than the whole home – seems like a good idea.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Many of the best electric blankets and heated throws cost about 2p to 4p an hour to run, so it’s hard to ignore their potential energy- and money-saving benefits.Electric blankets are ideal for using on your mattress, with the most convenient examples arriving with timers and auto-shut-off features for peace of mind, and dual control panels to keep both sides of the bed happy. Heated throws are better for snuggling on the sofa – they’re practical but also look good, with tactile finishes in materials such as bamboo and pure cotton.I was tasked with sleeping on the job to discover the best of both, testing the most popular electric blankets and heated throws from well-known homeware brands such as Silentnight, Slumberdown and Dreamland. Here are my top picks.At a glanceBestelectric blanket overall:Carmen C81190 fitted electric blanket (double)£44 at AOBest budget electric blanket:Slumberdown Sleepy Nights (super king)£25 at AsdaBest quilted electric blanket:Dreamland Pure Comfort bamboo underblanket (king size)£139.99 at BootsBestheated throw overall:Beurer heated snuggle blanket£79.99 at AmazonBest budget heated throw:Dunelm fleece electric throw£32 at DunelmBest heated fleece throw:Russell Hobbs microfleece heated throw£38.99 at AmazonBest heated duvet:Dreamland Love Mornings heated duvet (king size)£199.99 at DreamlandWhy you should trust meI’ve been a lifestyle journalist for more than two decades. Over the years, I’ve tested everything from breadmakers and bedding to beehives and biscuits – thankfully, not all at the same time.Lately, my focus has been bedding, testing numerous mattresses, pillows, weighted blankets and bed linen – so I know what makes for a decent night’s sleep. Testing electric blankets was the logical next step.Whatever I’m testing, I’ll find practical and useful ways to rigorously measure the value of the product and dig deep to go beyond the marketing jargon.How I testedView image in fullscreenI used an infrared thermometer to determine how fast the blankets warmed up – and how evenly.Photograph: Emily Peck/The GuardianWithout a Cern-grade laboratory at my disposal, I tested 20 of the most popular electric blankets and throws at home. In bed. In my pyjamas. I wanted to assess how each blanket and throw felt while sleeping or resting, and judge its quality and durability.Alongside measuring the max temperature each blanket hit, I timed how long it took to get there – I have zero patience when cold, so quick and efficient heating is crucial. Using an infrared thermometer, I measured the temperatures on the highest settings at 10 minutes, 30 minutes and an hour after being switched on. Since the weight of your duvet and room temperature can affect the temperature of electric blankets, I kept things fair by using all the electric blankets on the same bed, and all the heated throws on the same sofa, with a consistent room temperature of 18C.No one wants a hot back and frosty feet, so I considered how evenly each blanket heated up by taking temperature readings at three different points after an hour on full power. I also used a plug-in power consumption meter to determine each blanket’s hourly running cost based on theOfgem price capas of 1 January 2026, which is 27.69p a kWh.Below you’ll find the 13best of the 20 models I tested.

It comes in both double and king-size versions, and is made from polyester with a cosy fleece finish.Why we love itThe Carmen feels great, heats up effectively and is great value. It’s one of the easiest blankets to fit on to your bed, with a generous elastic skirt sewn on to it rather than the usual, clumsier straps. The skirt ensures the blanket secures neatly under each side of themattressand stays in place.It heats up quickly, reaching an impressive 28.1C in its centre after just 10 minutes – and this was without a duvet on top. I measured the heat at the sides a little cooler, but the temperature increased steadily over an hour, reaching 30.2C in its centre after 30 minutes and up to 33C after an hour. As soon as a duvet was placed on top, it got even warmer and retained its heat effectively long after I had turned off the blanket.While it’s machine washable, the manufacturer recommends you only do this a total of three times in its lifespan, so it will mostly be a spot clean.It’s a shame that …there’s no timer. But for peace of mind, it does have overheat protection that will automatically shut it down if the built-in thermal fuse detects a hotspot or fault in the heated cables.Sizes available:double,king sizeDimensions (double):L193 x W137cmNumber of heat settings:threeTimer included:no, but it does have auto-shut offRunning cost on maximum:4p/hour (0.078kWh each side)Temperature after an hour:33.2CGuarantee:three yearsMachine washable:yesCarmenC81190 fitted electric blanket£44£44 at AOWhat we loveIt’s easy to fit on to the bed and heats quicklyWhat we don’t loveIt doesn’t have a timerBest budget electric blanket:Slumberdown Sleepy NightsSlumberdownSleepy Nights£25£25 at AsdaWhat we loveGenerous straps make it easy to fit on the bedWhat we don’t loveIt doesn’t include a timerNote: stock is running low in double and king size.Toasty Nightsis a similar blanket with quiltingSuper king, £25 at AsdaSmall double, £27 at AmazonGenerous straps for easy positioning and three adjustable heat settings make this electric blanket a good budget buy. It comes in six sizes, can be machine washed for easy maintenance, and arrives with a two-year guarantee.Why we love itFeeling super soft against the skin, this microfibre blanket was simple to set up, with bonus points awarded for the long cord.The lengthy, elasticated straps meant I didn’t have to wrestle too much with the corners of my thick Sealy mattress to position the blanket securely, plus it stayed in place nicely.The blanket heated up to 22.1C in just 10 minutes and 25C in 30 minutes. After an hour on its highest setting, it reached a comfortable 29.5C – more than enough heat for me.When I measured the temperature across the blanket, I found it was hotter in the middle than on the sides. However, I didn’t notice any cold spots when my duvet was on top, trapping in the heat.It’s a shame that …it doesn’t have a timer. The manufacturer suggests leaving this blanket on its lowest setting if you want to keep it on all night.Sizes available:small single,single,small double, double (currently out of stock), king (currently out of stock),super kingDimensions (king size):L150 x W142cmNumber of heat settings:threeTimer included:noRunning coston maximum:3p/hour (0.094kWh)Temperature after an hour:29.5CGuarantee:two yearsMachine washable:yesSlumberdownSleepy Nights£25£25 at AsdaWhat we loveGenerous straps make it easy to fit on the bedWhat we don’t loveIt doesn’t include a timerBest quilted electric blanket:Dreamland Pure Comfort bamboo underblanketDreamlandPure Comfort bamboo underblanketfrom£99.99£139.99 at Boots£99.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIt includes breathable bamboo materialWhat we don’t loveIt costs more than your average blanketKing, £139.99 at BootsKing, £99.99 at AmazonThe king-size version of this underblanket has dual control panels for operating each side independently. There are six heat settings to choose from, and three timer options for one, three or nine hours.Why we love itThis blanket reached 22C at its centre after just 10 minutes, and within an hour, temperatures had risen to a snuggly 32C. I found that the middle and end of the blanket heated well, but the top section remained cool to the touch, working well for under your head.It costs more than your average electric blanket, but is worth it for the quilted, breathable bamboo finish. The filling, like many other electric blankets, is polyester. The control panels on either side were easy to navigate, even when I was sleepy-eyed.It’s a shame that …there are no timer options between three and nine hours.Sizes available:single,double, king,super kingDimensions (king size):L200 x W150cmNumber of heat settings:sixTimer included:yes, one, three or nine hoursRunning coston maximum:4p/hour (0.129kWh)Temperature after an hour:32.2CGuarantee:three yearsMachine washable:yesDreamlandPure Comfort bamboo underblanketfrom£99.99£139.99 at Boots£99.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIt includes breathable bamboo materialWhat we don’t loveIt costs more than your average blanketBest heated throw overall:Beurer HD150 heated snuggle blanketBeurerHD150 heated snuggle blanketfrom£79.99£89.99 at Simply Be£79.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIt feels very smooth and snuggly against your skinWhat we don’t loveIt can be awkward to fold and a little cumbersome to storePhotograph: Emily Peck/The Guardian£89.99 at Simply Be£79.99 at AmazonIdeal for the sofa, this Beurer blanket has averysoft and sumptuous fleece finish. Its six heat settings are all adjustable via the central control panel. I tried the XXL design – a little oversized on my three-seater sofa, but ideal for sharing comfortably with another person. It also comes in asmaller 180 x 130cm size.Why we love itThe soft-to-touch surface of this heated blanket proved just the right level of cosy for a night on the sofa watchingStrictly. Plus, it feels padded enough to disguise the heating elements inside the blanket – not something that can be said of all heated blankets.It heated up fast – reaching temperatures in the low 20s in just 10 minutes – yet it used surprisingly little energy. After an hour, it felt very hot, so I turned it down to setting two, which was more comfortable. Its three-hour automatic switch-off timer means that you can just set and forget about it.It’s a shame that …it didn’t heat up evenly. While the middle was warm, sections around the edges didn’t feel it at all – which might be a problem if you’re sharing it with a blanket hog.Sizes available:small, largeDimensions (large):L200 x W150cmNumber of heat settings:sixTimer included:three-hour automatic switch-offRunning coston maximum:2p/hour (0.055kWh)Temperature after an hour:32.2CGuarantee:three yearsMachine washable:yesBeurerHD150 heated snuggle blanketfrom£79.99£89.99 at Simply Be£79.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIt feels very smooth and snuggly against your skinWhat we don’t loveIt can be awkward to fold and a little cumbersome to storeBest budget heated throw:Dunelm fleece electric throwDunelmFleece electric throw£32£32 at DunelmWhat we loveIt heats evenly and feels a manageable thicknessWhat we don’t loveThere’s no timerPhotograph: Emily Peck/The Guardian£32 at DunelmThis smooth fleece blanket comes in three attractive colours – taupe, charcoal and navy – to match most neutral decor schemes. A handheld digital LED controller allows you to flick between its six heat levels.Why we love itFor less than £35, this heated throw is good value – and at this price, you could even buy it as a gift. The deep navy colour looked great on my sofa, and while it’s not the fluffiest heated throw I’ve tested, it felt lovely to touch – neither too thick nor too heavy. It was the perfect size for one person – and will just about cater for two, if you’re willing to snuggle up close.The blanket warmed up steadily, reaching a comfortable temperature at its max. After 10 minutes on its full heat setting, it measured 19.7C at the centre. An hour in on full power, this rose to 40.3C. While heat wasn’t evenly distributed, this didn’t make much difference to the overall feeling of warmth.It’s a shame that …it doesn’t have a timer, other than a four-hour automatic shut-off, but you’ll need to make sure you switch it off using the controller and at the plug after use.Sizes available:oneDimensions:L130 x W160cmNumber of heat settings:sixTimer included:no, but automatic shut-off after four hoursRunning cost on maximum:3p/hour (0.1kWh)Temperature after an hour:40.3CGuarantee:one yearMachine washable:yesDunelmFleece electric throw£32£32 at DunelmWhat we loveIt heats evenly and feels a manageable thicknessWhat we don’t loveThere’s no timerBest heated fleece throw:Russell Hobbs microfleece heated throwRussell HobbsMicrofleece heated throwfrom£39.99£39.99 at Currys£39.99 at DebenhamsWhat we loveThe microfleece finish feels so softWhat we don’t loveIts darker shades might look harsh in some colour schemesPhotograph: Emily Peck/The Guardian£39.99 at Currys£39.99 at DebenhamsWith its soft microfleece finish, this heated blanket is large enough to cover one person comfortably and also works well for two. It features one digital control panel with multiple heat and timer functions, and an automatic switch-off function for peace of mind. If you intend to sleep with it, Russell Hobbs recommends using it on a lower heat mode, up to setting three.Why we love itThe first thing I noticed about this heated blanket, aside from its soft feel, was its generous 250cm cable. It meant I could drape the blanket over me comfortably on the sofa without accidentally tugging the plug out of the wall socket.The blanket’s microfleece finish felt tactile and comforting, and it was thicker than some of the standard fleece throws I tested, such as the Dunelm fleece electric throw (above). While I could feel the wiring lines inside this blanket, they’re well hidden in the blanket’s sumptuous design.The white digital control panel here is a little bulkier than some others on test, and stands out against the jet-black finish of the blanket I tested. Nevertheless, it was easy to use, with heat settings ranging from one to nine. If you want to use the blanket for more than an hour, the timer function lets you go up in one-hour increments up to nine hours and then jumps to a single 12-hour setting. On its highest heat setting it reached 29C in 30 minutes and a toasty 41.9C after an hour. In addition, the heat seemed to distribute well across the blanket’s surface.It’s a shame that …the throw doesn’t come in pastel colours; the darker shades (such as the black I tested) could look harsh against some softer interior schemes.Sizes available:one sizeDimensions:L180 x W130cmNumber of heat settings:nineTimer included:yes, one-nine or 12 hoursRunning cost on maximum:4p/hour (0.134kWh)Temperature after an hour:41.9CGuarantee:two yearsMachine washable:yes, under 40CRussell HobbsMicrofleece heated throwfrom£39.99£39.99 at Currys£39.99 at DebenhamsWhat we loveThe microfleece finish feels so softWhat we don’t loveIts darker shades might look harsh in some colour schemesBest fluffy heated throw:Glamhaus heated throwGlamhausHeated throwfrom£35.99£35.99 at Robert Dyas£37.50 at AmazonWhat we loveIt heats up quickly and feels great against skinWhat we don’t loveNo storage bag includedPhotograph: Emily Peck/The Guardian£35.99 at Robert Dyas£37.50 at AmazonAvailable in a choice of jewel-like colours, including deep pink, “scuba” blue and green, this electric over-blanket is reasonably priced at less than £50 (£35.99 at the time of writing). The blanket is made from polyester and has a white fluffy trim that contrasts nicely against the vibrant hue of its main body.Why we love itIt may be standard polyester, but the velvety fleece-like finish of this blanket feels luxurious to touch. Its white trim instantly made my sofa look festive, but it will look great throughout spring, too, adding an extra layer of cosiness to your living room.It’s thick and feels more substantial than some other budget heated blankets I’ve tried, so it feels warming even when it’s not switched on. It heated up quickly, too, and within a minute there was a satisfying amount of heat from its centre. The heat felt comfortable rather than scorching, with the heated wires nicely disguised within the throw. The heat also radiates out to the sides effectively, providing an even warmth across the surface. After 10 minutes, I measured the centre of the blanket at 27.2C on its highest setting, and it reached 34.2C after 30 minutes and a sleep-inducing 40.3C after an hour.The control panel is easy to use and doesn’t give you a bewildering number of heat and timer options – there are six heat settings and a three-hour timer, which feels plenty. It comes with the safety of an auto-shut-off feature and can be conveniently machine-washed at 30C too – both features I’d expect to find in a good-quality heated blanket.It’s a shame that …it doesn’t come with a storage bag, which would make it neater to store while not in use. It’s hard to fault this blanket, though, as it’s such good value.Sizes available:one sizeDimensions:L160 x W130cmNumber of heat settings:sixTimer included:yes, three hoursRunning cost on maximum:3p/hour (0.096kWh)Temperature after an hour:40.3CGuarantee:one yearMachine washable:yes, at 30CGlamhausHeated throwfrom£35.99£35.99 at Robert Dyas£37.50 at AmazonWhat we loveIt heats up quickly and feels great against skinWhat we don’t loveNo storage bag includedBest heated duvet:Dreamland Love Mornings heated duvetDreamlandHeated duvetfrom£199.99£199.99 at Dreamland£199.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIt offers soothing heat from above, which works wellWhat we don’t loveCables will hang out of the end of the duvet coverKing, £199.99 at DreamlandKing, £199.99 at AmazonDreamland offers a wide range of heated bedding products – I also have my eye on the brand’selectric heat padsfor specific areas, including your feet, neck, back and hands.Having tried the underblanket (reviewed above), I was keen to see how this heated duvet would compare. Like the underblanket, the duvet is machine washable with the controller removed, and can be tumble-dried, too.Why we love itI was instantly impressed by the tidy stitching and smooth finish of this heated duvet, which is filled with polyester and has a 100% cotton cover. With an October chill in the air, I set up the duvet on my bed, under a breathable cottonNectar duvet cover.The dual controls lead out at the end of the duvet, so you can run them up the side of the bed to plug it in. This means you’ll be able to use it with a buttoned cover, but not one that has a zip.Dreamland states the heat-up time as five minutes, and while it was slightly warm after a few minutes, I did have to go hunting for the warmer spots during my tests. After 10 minutes on the highest setting, I measured the temperature at 26.6C at the centre, and after an hour it was 36.3C, which felt comfortable – although this probably isn’t a heat level I’d like to sleep in all night.The duvet’s dual controls worked well for my partner and me: I could blast the heat on my side while he, who prefers cooler climes, didn’t need to have it on at all.It’s a shame that …it doesn’t come with a cover. Also, while having the heat filter down from the duvet above me felt cosy on a really cold night, I prefer the heat from an electric blanket underneath.Sizes available:single,double, king sizeDimensions (king size):L225 x W220cmNumber of heat settings:sixTimer included:yes, one, three and nine hoursRunning cost on maximum:3p/hour (0.101kWh a side)Temperature after an hour:36.3CGuarantee:two yearsMachine washable:yesDreamlandHeated duvetfrom£199.99£199.99 at Dreamland£199.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIt offers soothing heat from above, which works wellWhat we don’t loveCables will hang out of the end of the duvet coverBest heated throw for one person:VonHaus pink heated throw blanketVonHausPink heated throw blanketfrom£37.99£37.99 at VonHaus£37.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIts silky finish and pretty pink hueWhat we don’t loveIt could be thickerPhotograph: Emily Peck/The Guardian£37.99 at VonHaus£37.99 at AmazonWith nine temperature settings, this soft and silky pink blanket offers a good range of heat options up to a maximum of 43C. It has a one-hour default timer, plus one that can be set for up to nine hours in total. If you’re going to sleep with it or are using it for extended periods, VonHaus recommends setting the heat to level one for the duration.Why we love itMeasuring 160 x 130cm, I found this heated blanket just the right size for one. While its vibrant pink finish might not go down so well with some, personally, I didn’t mind it. It’s machine washable at 30C (with the control panel removed) on a gentle cycle and low spin, and the 2.15m cord length should be long enough to reach a nearby socket.The blanket felt smooth underhand with an almost silk-like finish, but I could feel the wiring inside. Nevertheless, it was subtle, and the blanket’s layers of fabric are well structured to make it easy to fold or lay flat on the sofa or bed. It heated up evenly, but not as quickly or as hot as others on test, reaching 25.5C within 30 minutes and 34C after an hour.It’s a shame that …the pink colourway may not to be everyone’s taste.Sizes available:oneDimensions:L160 x W130cmNumber of heat settings:nineTimer included:yes, up to nine hoursRunning cost on maximum:4p/hour (0.156kWh)Temperature after an hour:34CGuarantee:two yearsMachine washable:yes, up to 30CVonHausPink heated throw blanketfrom£37.99£37.99 at VonHaus£37.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIts silky finish and pretty pink hueWhat we don’t loveIt could be thickerBest heated cushion:Beurer HK48 cosy heated cushionBeurerHK48 cosy heated cushionfrom£34.99£42.39 at Lakeland£34.99 at AmazonWhat we loveThe fact that it both props you up and heats you upWhat we don’t loveThe control panel is very basicPhotograph: Emily Peck/The Guardian£42.39 at Lakeland£34.99 at AmazonThis heated cushion, made by German brand Beurer, would make an excellent gift.Of its two sides, it’s the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 fleecy fabric that warms up for a soothing effect; the other side is a breathable cotton with a removable pad inside. The cover is removable and machine washable on a gentle wool cycle at 30C, but it can only be cleaned up to 10 times in its lifespan. For an extra £9.99,replacement covers are availablein five attractive colours, including green, red and orange.Why we love itAn alternative option to your standard heated throw, this cushion provides a more targeted approach to warming and could work well for general pain relief. It comes with three heat settings, and felt great positioned near the lower back and under the neck, upper legs, knees and ankles.The cushion was super-quick to heat, reaching 34C in 10 minutes, and a very warm 43.4C after an hour. It never really felt too hot, and the heat seemed to radiate to the sides nicely. The three heat settings are useful, but a timer alongside would have enhanced the design. That said, it does come with a 90-minute auto-shut-off feature.It’s a shame that …the control panel isn’t a little more hi-tech, but it does the job effectively.Sizes available:oneDimensions:H40 x W30cmNumber of heat settings:threeTimer included:no, but it has 90-minute auto-switch offRunning cost on maximum: 0.6p/hour – less than 1p (0.023kWh)Temperature after an hour:43.4CGuarantee:three yearsMachine washable:the cover is machine washable at 30C wool cycle; the inner pad is not washableBeurerHK48 cosy heated cushionfrom£34.99£42.39 at Lakeland£34.99 at AmazonWhat we loveThe fact that it both props you up and heats you upWhat we don’t loveThe control panel is very basicThe best of the restView image in fullscreen‘Good for transitional seasons when you don’t want anything too heavy’: the Silentnight luxury heated throw.Photograph: Emily Peck/The GuardianSlumberdown Elegantly Warm luxury heated throwSlumberdownElegantly Warm luxury heated throwfrom£48£60 at Argos£48 at AmazonWhat we loveIt gets satisfyingly hotWhat we don’t loveIts heat settings aren’t as intuitive as we’d likePhotograph: Emily Peck/The Guardian£60 at Argos£48 at AmazonBest for:those looking for a stylish, neutral colourThis heated throw looks elegant and feels luxurious – just as the name suggests. My review sample arrived in the Mole colourway, which will suit both modern and traditional interiors.The blanket’s 10 heat settings allow for good control, although I found it difficult to “feel” a difference past heat setting six. The blanket reached a hot 31.9C after 10 minutes of being turned on; and while the borders didn’t get as warm, the heat did seem evenly distributed across the surface.Made from polyester, the blanket is washable at 40C on a wool cycle, but it can only be air-dried.It didn’t make the final cut because …when you turn it on, it starts at setting five. It would make more sense if it started at setting one.Sizes available:one;dimensions:L160 x W130cm;number of heat settings:10;timer included:yes, up to ten hours;running cost on maximum:3p/hour (0.104kWh);temperature after an hour:42.5C;guarantee:two years;machine washable:yes, up to 40CSlumberdownElegantly Warm luxury heated throwfrom£48£60 at Argos£48 at AmazonWhat we loveIt gets satisfyingly hotWhat we don’t loveIts heat settings aren’t as intuitive as we’d likeSnuggledown Intelligent WarmthSnuggledownIntelligent Warmthfrom£100£100 at Argos£125 at John LewisWhat we loveEach side can be controlled independentlyWhat we don’t loveIts filling is polyester, which is less breathableKing, £100 at ArgosKing, £125 at John LewisBest for:couples who share a bed and can’t agree on temperatureWith a sustainable 180-thread-count pure cotton cover, the surface of this electric blanket is luxuriously soft and breathable, while the quilted finish adds extra padding and warmth to the mattress before the blanket is even turned on. The fastening straps for the corners and the blanket’s base material ensure a secure fit to the mattress.There are two control panels that let you tailor each quarter of the mattress to suit your upper and lower body, so it’s a great option for bed sharers or those who like to keep their feet at a different temperature from the top half of their body.

There’s no timer, but it turns off automatically after two hours, which should be more than long enough to warm you up.The throw is thin and light, so it would be good for transitional seasons when the weather is a little warmer and you don’t want anything too heavy. The box says it costs 1p an hour to run on the lowest setting, which sounds about right – I measured it as 3p an hour on maximum.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s quite thin, meaning you can feel the wiring inside.Sizes available:one;dimensions:L160 x W120cm;number of heat settings:nine;timer included:no, but two-hour automatic shut-off;running coston maximum:3p/hour (0.102kWh);temperature after an hour:33.6C;guarantee:three years;machine washable:yesSilentnightLuxury heated throwfrom£39.99£41 at Silentnight£39.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIt’s lightweight and heats evenlyWhat we don’t loveIt’s not as thick as some of the throws we’ve triedWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenHow much do electric blankets cost to run?In my tests, the average king-size electric blanket costs 3p an hour to run. This shows that even if used for a few hours a day, it could cut down on your heating use and save you money over the year – depending on how much you spend on the blanket in the first place, of course.“There are factors to consider when calculating the costs, as not all electric blankets are the same,” says John-Paul Drake, energy expert atLove Energy Savings. “Some come with timers, different heat settings and various efficiency ratings. But it could be wise to take advantage of both an electric blanket and a lower thermostat setting as an optimal way to save money on energy bills this winter.”How much should you spend on an electric blanket?Prices for an electric blanket range from about £30 to £140, depending on the size. Expect to pay anything from £20 to £150 for a heated throw.Are electric blankets safe?Electric blankets should be used with caution, and never by young babies and toddlers. Most manufacturers do not recommend use by young children, unless they’re supervised by an adult and have a clear understanding of how to use them safely. Always check the manufacturer’s guidelines for safe use. Not always obvious on the box, but the latest electric blankets should have passed electrical safety checks. Look for safety marks such as “BEAB approved” (British Electrotechnical Approvals Board) or “KEMA-KEURsafety tested” for peace of mind. For more advice on electric blanket safety,read this advice from London Fire Brigade.Consider safety features such as an automatic switch-off timer that will turn off the blanket after a set time, or overheat protection, which switches off the device if it senses it’s getting too hot.An electric blanket should fit securely on your mattress, starting just below the area beneath your pillow to stop your head from overheating. It shouldn’t be folded or creased, as this can damage the wiring inside. The safest place to leave your blanket when it’s not needed is flat on your bed.Is my electric blanket compatible with my mattress?Electric blankets are compatible with most mattresses, but can potentially cause damage to some mattresses made from memory foam or latex. “Memory foam mattresses are heat-sensitive, and there has been a concern in the past that they could soften too much when heated by an electric blanket, damaging the foam’s structure and reducing support,” says Chelsea Brown, lead product adviser atOpera Beds.“Most modern electric blankets shouldn’t reach high enough temperatures for this to be an issue, but you should use them with caution. Memory foam is designed to mould to your body, so directly placing an electric blanket on top can also prevent the mattress from fitting your body snugly. Consider using a mattress topper under the electric blanket or keeping it on a low heat to prevent damage to your mattress.”Emily Peck is alifestyle journalist who’s been writing and editing for more than twodecades.

There’s generally no need to buy a fresh phone just because new models have been released, as hardware updates are broadly iterative, adding small bits to an already accomplished package. But if you do want a replacement handset, whether new or refurbished, here are the best devices of the current crop of Apple smartphones.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Many other smartphones are available besides the iPhone, but if you’re an Apple user and don’t fancyswitching to Android, there are still a few choices to make. Whether your priority is the longest battery life, the best camera, the biggest screen or simply the optimal balance of features and price, there’s more to choose from in the Apple ecosystem than you may expect, especially after the release ofthe cheaper iPhone 16eand super-thiniPhone Air.How I testedQuick GuideHow I testedShowWe combine real-world testing with various tools, such as benchmarking systems that perform standardised tasks. These help us  evaluate a phone,  measure its performance, confirm that it works as expected and compare it with its competition and predecessors.We use the phones at different times and in various environments, from firing off emails on packed commuter trains to weekends spent shooting photos in national parks, and everything in between. We do everything a typical smartphone user would, such as messaging, browsing, using apps, listening to music, watching videos, playing games and navigating the real world. That gives us a good impression of how a smartphone handles the rigours of day-to-day life – plus, it shows us how long the battery lasts and the strength of its wireless performance.The findings from our general use of the phones are combined with the results from specific tests for things such as the camera zoom, video playback and charging, to inform the reviews and help us rank the devices.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Why should you trust me?I have been reviewing consumer electronics for 18 years, with more than a decade spent as the Guardian’s gadget expert. In that time I’ve seen all manner of tech fads come and go, smartphone giants rise and fall, the cutting edge morph into the mainstream, and have poked, prodded and evaluated more than 1,000 devices –sometimes to destruction.At a glanceBest iPhone for most people:iPhone 17£799 at John LewisBest iPhone for camera:iPhone 17 Pro£1,099 at ArgosBest iPhone for battery:iPhone 17 Pro Max£1,199 at ArgosBest thin and light iPhone:iPhone Air£999 at AppleCheapest new iPhone:iPhone 16e£549 at John LewisThe best iPhones you can buy in 2025View image in fullscreen‘Great for games and other intensive tasks’: the iPhone 17 Pro.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianBest iPhone for most people:iPhone 17AppleiPhone 17from£799£799 at John Lewis£799 at ApplePhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian£799 at John Lewis£799 at AppleThe base-model iPhone has been the best for most people for years, but this year the iPhone 17 is closer to the Pro models in features than ever before, making it an instant recommendation.While it may not look that different from last year’s iPhone 16, the screen has finally been upgraded to bring it up to par with the Pro iPhones. It is a 6.3in super-bright OLED with a 120Hz refresh rate – double previous standard iPhones – and ensures day-to-day scrolling and animations are smoother and more fluid than ever before. The screen’s glass is stated as being three times tougher than previous models, while the always-on display mode shows the time, notifications and music when idle – another feature that was Pro-only until now.The rest of the iPhone 17 is fairly standard. It has the latest rapid A19 chip, but with twice the starting storage at 256GB of its predecessor – which should be more than enough for most people. The battery lasts just shy of two days between charges, and it fast-charges via USB-C or MagSafe/Qi2 wireless charging.The phone is still relatively light and compact for a modern smartphone, with aluminium sides and a glass front and back, and it arrives with an IP68 water-resistance rating (down to depths of six metres for up to 30 minutes). Along the edge of the device you’ll find the recently added action and camera control buttons, as well as the standard power and volume buttons.Sporting main and ultra-wide options, the iPhone 17’s dual 48MP rear camera shoots great photos and videos across a range of lighting conditions, including automatic portrait capture and a fun macrophotography mode for closeups. It lacks a telephoto camera, however, limited to a 2x crop zoom on the main camera with digital zoom on top.A new 18MP Centre Stage selfie camera on the front has some fancy tricks. It can automatically pan and zoom to fit in everyone for group shots, and can shoot landscape selfies while being held in portrait orientation.The iPhone 17 runs thesame iOS 26as the rest of the iPhone family, which introduces Apple’s new glass-like design, improved spam filters and several other features. It also has Apple’s AI tools, which still lag behind the competition.The biggest downside is that in a year where every other iPhone has had a redesign, the iPhone 17 looks the same as last year’s model.Why should you buy it?The iPhone 17 offers almost everything that’s great about Apple’s Pro phones, including 256GB of storage, solid battery life, a fancy new screen and rapid performance, but in a lighter, cheaper package.Buy if:you want a great iPhone experienceDon’t buy if:you want optical zoom on your camera or a new designRead ourfulliPhone 17 review: the Apple smartphone to get this yearScreen:6.3in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED)Processor:Apple A19Storage:256 or 512GBCamera:48MP main+UW; 18MP front-facingDimensions:71.5 x 7.95 x 149.6mm (WDH)AppleiPhone 17from£799£799 at John Lewis£799 at AppleBest iPhone for camera:iPhone 17 ProAppleiPhone 17 Profrom£1,099£1,099 at Argos£1,099 at CurrysPhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian£1,099 at Argos£1,099 at CurrysThe iPhone 17 Pro takes all the good bits from the standard iPhone 17 and slaps them into a new design that stands out over years of similar-looking models from Apple.It shares the same super-bright, 120Hz 6.3in OLED screen as the iPhone 17, but in a new aluminium unibody with smoother edges. A new camera “plateau” covers the full width of the top quarter of the phone’s rear, with a glass panel inlaid below it for wireless charging and magnetic accessories. New dark blue and bright orange colour options help it stand out, and despite its 204g weight, the 17 Pro remains pretty compact for a phone this capable.Housing Apple’s fastest A19 Pro chip with a cooling system to allow it to run at peak performance for longer, the new Pro is great for games and other intensive tasks. Basic storage starts at 256GB, and the battery lasts about 42 hours between charges with general use. It fast-charges to 70% in 30 minutes via USB-C and supports 25W Qi2 wireless charging.The biggest feature upgrade over the regular iPhone 17 is the Pro’s camera system. It’s made up of three 48MP sensors, including a larger main camera and a new 4x telephoto camera, which offers a 2x crop zoom to hit an effective 8x optical zoom to close the distance to objects. Combined, they capture excellent photos across a range of lighting conditions and environments. On the front, you’ll find the 18MP Centre Stage selfie camera for easy group shots.Why should you buy it?This is Apple’s best phone, with a new aluminium unibody design, its most powerful camera and top performance, all in a device that’s still easy to fit in a pocket.Buy if:you want a new design and the best camera in an iPhone but don’t want a huge displayDon’t buy if:you want the longest battery life or biggest display on an iPhoneRead our fulliPhone 17 Pro review: different looks but still all about the zoomScreen:6.3in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED)Processor:Apple A19 ProStorage:256, 512GB or 1TBCamera:48MP main + 48MP UW + 48MP 5x; 18MP front-facingDimensions:71.9 x 8.75 x 150mm (WDH)Weight:204gAppleiPhone 17 Profrom£1,099£1,099 at Argos£1,099 at CurrysBest iPhone for battery:iPhone 17 Pro MaxAppleiPhone 17 Pro Maxfrom£1,199£1,199 at Argos£1,199 at CurrysPhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian£1,199 at Argos£1,199 at CurrysThe iPhone 17 Pro Max is Apple’s biggest and most expensive model this year. Super-sizing the regular 17 Pro, it has a massive 6.9in OLED screen on the front and a huge battery in the back.Design-wise, it sports the same new aluminium unibody and top-performing A19 Pro chip of the new models, and a glorious screen that makes it excellent for gaming. It comes with at least 256GB of storage with options up to 2TB, great for those who want to use its triple rear camera for movie-making.Standout, though, is the Pro Max’s battery life, which at about 55 hours of general use will see the phone last well into a third day without needing a top-up.The result of that extra capacity is that the 17 Pro Max is both huge and heavy. It would definitely benefit from using aPopsocket, handle, lanyard or other strapto help keep hold of it.Why should you buy it?Apple’s longest-lasting, largest phone comes packing a powerful camera, top performance and everything good from the regular-sized 17 Pro.Buy if:you want super-long battery life and a massive screenDon’t buy if:you want a smaller, lighter or cheaper deviceScreen:6.9in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED)Processor:Apple A19 ProStorage:256, 512GB, 1TB or 2TBCamera:48MP main + 48MP UW + 48MP 5x; 18MP front-facingDimensions:78 x 8.75 x. 163.4mm (WDH)Weight:231gAppleiPhone 17 Pro Maxfrom£1,199£1,199 at Argos£1,199 at CurrysBest thin and light iPhone:iPhone AirAppleiPhone Airfrom£999£999 at Apple£999 at ArgosPhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian£999 at Apple£999 at ArgosThe iPhone Air is a bit of a wildcard in the current Apple phone lineup. It is an entirely new model built to be the thinnest and lightest iPhone ever made. The bulk of the body is just 5.64mm thick, although it feels even thinner thanks to its rounded titanium sides.It weighs only 165g – 12g lighter than the already light iPhone 17 – but it also has a large, bright and 120Hz-smooth 6.5in OLED screen. It’s the kind of device that deserves to be used without a case, immediately feeling special the moment you pick it up.On the rear, the camera plateau that stretches across the top of the device is also home to the phone’s components, with the rest of the body dedicated to the battery. It still has a version of Apple’s fastest A19 Pro chip, at least 256GB of storage, and runs iOS 26 with all the features.The super-slender frame creates three downsides for the Air. First, its battery lasts about 40 hours of general use, which isn’t terrible, but it’s shorter than other iPhones.Second, it doesn’t have a nano Sim slot, relying entirely on downloadable eSims for connection to a phone provider. While most of the major networks support eSims, not all in the UK do, especially the more budget-friendly providers.However, the biggest compromise is that it only has a single 48MP camera on the rear, with no ultra-wide or telephoto options. While it still takes excellent photos, if you can’t walk back and forth to zoom in or out from your subject, you won’t be able to get the shot. You still get the new 18MP Centre Stage selfie camera as the rest of the iPhone 17 line, though.Why should you buy it?The iPhone Air is an exquisite piece of hardware that offers a big screen without the bulk or weight.Buy if:you want thinness above all elseDon’t buy if:you want long battery life, multiple cameras or you can’t get an eSimRead our fulliPhone Air review: Apple’s pursuit of absolute thinnessScreen:6.5in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED)Processor:Apple A19 Pro (5-core GPU)Storage:256, 512GB or 1TBCamera:48MP rear; 18MP front-facingDimensions:74.7 x 5.64 x 156.2mm (WDH)Weight:165gAppleiPhone Airfrom£999£999 at Apple£999 at ArgosCheapest new iPhone:iPhone 16eAppleiPhone 16efrom£549£549 at John Lewis£599 at ApplePhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian£549 at John Lewis£599 at AppleThe cheapest new phone sold by Apple is the iPhone 16e, the spiritual successor to theiPhone SE, but with a more modern design and chip.It has an aluminium body, glass front and back, and a decent 6.1in OLED screen with the older-style notch from2022’s iPhone 14. It’s thin, light and pretty compact for a modern phone, and is water-resistant like the rest of Apple’s iPhones.Inside sits 2024’s A18 chip, paired with at least 128GB of storage. This hardware enables the Apple Intelligence features found across the rest of the iPhone 16 lineup – capabilities that won’t run on the iPhone 15 and older models – although none have as yet emerged as true killer features.The iPhone 16e will last up to two days of general use and charges via USB-C. However, it lacks a few features common to other iPhones, including the Camera Control button, MagSafe on the back for accessories and charging, Wifi 7, and a handful of other specs. A bigger deal-breaker might be the single camera on the back, which is decent but lacks any ultra-wide or telephoto options.Despite costing about 25% less than the regular iPhone 17, the 16e still isn’t cheap, so better options can be found refurbished for similar or less money.Why should you buy it?The 16e offers the modern iPhone experience with a fast chip and AI, but with features such as a dual camera and MagSafe missing to hit a lower price.Buy if:you want the cheapest new iPhone from AppleDon’t buy if:you are at all into photography or have MagSafe accessoriesRead our fulliPhone 16e review: Apple’s cheapest new phoneScreen:6.1in Super Retina XDR (OLED)Processor:Apple A18Storage:128, 256 or 512GBCamera:48MP rear; 12MP front-facingDimensions:71.5 x 7.8 x 146.7mm (WDH)Weight:167gAppleiPhone 16efrom£549£549 at John Lewis£599 at AppleOther iPhones still on sale at AppleView image in fullscreenThe iPhone 16 will continue to receive about five to six years of software support.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe iPhone 16, released in 2024, sports the same design as the current iPhone 17, but misses the new Pro-grade screen and Centre Stage selfie camera.

If it’s past its best, a replacement costs£65 to £109 from Apple, or cheaper through third parties, and will give your iPhone a new lease of life. To speed things up, check you have enough free storage and clear out any unused apps or content, off-loading photos and videos to the cloud and deleting music. Aim for at least 2GB of free space.If your phone is worn out, broken beyond repair or no longer receives crucial security updates, it’s time to upgrade. The latest software, version iOS 18, supports devices back to 2018’siPhone XS/XR, so anything older should be replaced soon – though some older models may still receiveoccasional security updatesfrom Apple.What to look out for in a refurbBuying refurbished phonesis better for the planet and your wallet. The iPhone makes for an excellent refurbished phone, typically staying responsive for years and being supported with software updates for about seven years from release, or longer in some circumstances. That means you can use an older model for several years before it will need replacing.There are broadly two types of refurbished iPhone available: those refurbished andsold directly by Applethat come, essentially, as new, and those refurbished by third parties that come in various grades or condition – but cost less.Quick GuideA buyer’s guide to refurbished phonesShowSeveral third-party retailers offer refurbished phones, including the UK high street chainsCeXandGameand online stores such asmusicMagpieandEnvirofone. Marketplaces likeAmazonandeBayand refurb specialistBack Marketalso have a wide range. And some phone operators, includingO2,giffgaff,EEandVodafone, sell refurbished iPhones.The condition of the phone is among the most important things to consider before parting with any cash. This is graded as follows:Grade A– virtually identical to a new phone on the outside, usually with the original box and accessories. These are often customer returns rather than trade-ins and are the most expensive.Grade B– in full working order but typically with light scratches, dents or nicks, and may come with original accessories.Grade C– in full working order but visibly worn and typically sold without original accessories.Grade D– also known as “for spares and repairs” or similar. These are broken devices sold for people to fix or gut for parts.Once you’re satisfied with the condition of the phone, be sure to also size up the device’s:Battery health– batteries wear out, typically only maintaining up to 80% of their original capacity after 500 full-charge cycles (about two to three years of nightly charging). Has it been replaced?Charging port– check for signs of damage, as these are among the first parts to break.Buttons– do they all work without pressing too hard? Broken buttons make phones difficult to use and can be expensive to fix.Fingerprint scanner– is the fingerprint reader functioning as it should? Scratches or repairs can cause them to be faulty.Network locks– check the phone works with the provider of your choice, as some are originally sold locked to certain networks and must be unlocked before being used on another.Unauthorised parts– not all repairs are done by the manufacturer or using certified parts, which can affect performance.Check it isn’t stolen– check the phone’s 15-digit IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number against adatabase of stolen devicesthrough a service such asCheckMENDor similar.Warranty– what kind of warranty does the retailer offer on its refurbished phones?Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Do not buyAny model older than an iPhone 13, because you won’t get many years of software support before you’ll have to replace it.An iPhone 13 mini, unless it has a new battery. It had a relatively short battery life to start with and needed more frequent charging than larger iPhones, so its battery wears out faster.For more, readhow to make your smartphone last longerand thebest phone strapsSamuel Gibbs is the Guardian’s consumer technology editorThis article was originally published on 4 October 2024.

And I’m tiny, I’m literally nothing in the whole internet of people. So that is massive for me,” she says. But soon she realised that the demand had been prompted by a growing online trend.The homemade velvet ribbon chain garland is one of the most popular home accessories this festive season, upgrading the nostalgic paper chain to a more luxe material.Viral tutorials collecting thousands of likes on TikTok and Pinterest showcase the colourful handmade decoration circling the Christmas tree or draped over the mantelpiece, intertwined with twinkling golden fairy lights.

I’ve never had that traction before,” she says.Making the garland is a relatively straightforward, family-friendly activity, involving cutting strips of velvet ribbon to approximately 20cm and looping them together to create a long chain.My weirdest Christmas: I sat on a desk chair watching the strangest film I’ve ever seenRead moreUnlike the expected festive shades of red and green, unconventional colourways are popular this year, such as orange paired with teal, and burgundy partnered with pale pink.In previous years, Rossington’s supply of velvet ribbon fromher shopwould reach as far as the wreath-making groups in her local town, but this year she’s selling her inventory in Lapland. “I have to Google some of these places,” she says.Howard’s sales are also widespread, from a chocolatier in London to a hotel in Switzerland. She estimates she’s sending approximately 250 packages a week. “The opportunity has been incredible. I can’t believe it,” she says.View image in fullscreenMaking the garland is a relatively straightforward family friendly activity involving cutting strips of velvet ribbon and looping them together.Photograph: Emma HowardThe high demand for velvet ribbon is also evident in the major retail market.

They’re nostalgic, lightweight [and] recyclable.’Photograph: Emma HowardThe craze is indicative of the shift that Christmas decorating has taken towards handmade, nostalgic aesthetics – what experts are referring to as “retromaxxing”.“Garlands have been a breakout star of 2025, in all their shapes and sizes.” says Whinnie Williams, an interior designer and trends forecaster for the artificial Christmas tree company Balsam Hill. “Paper chains and honeycomb garlands in particular have surged. They’re nostalgic, lightweight, recyclable, and handmaking paper chains adds a unique and sentimental touch to any home.”Africa Daley-Clarke, a home interiors writer, says the homemade, velvet ribbon garland complements a family environment. “It’s less about a perfect tree and more about a home that reflects the people living in it,” she says. “Rustic textures, softer styling, fewer fragile precious pieces and more tactile decorations that can handle real family life.”Viral trends may come and go but Howard believes that the velvet ribbon chain can outlast the passing Christmas season. “These are decorations that people could buy and then use next year,” she says. “The craft is a lovely thing to do with the family and it creates memories.”Explore more on these topicsChristmasInteriorsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

During the summer of 2021-22, the chef was one of three kitchen crew stationed at Scott Base, New Zealand’s only Antarctic research station. The dining hall was the hub of social activity, serving breakfast, morning tea, lunch and dinner for up to 85 people at its peak. It’s like working in a restaurant, Chapman says – one where you can sometimes see penguins from the kitchen.Speaking of penguins: Chapman is adamant they aren’t eaten, unlike in the early days of Antarctic exploration. Not just because they’re protected under the Antarctic treaty, or that starvation is no longer a serious concern; Chapman says it’s important to serve food people like, especially when they’re working in such an isolated part of the world, in extreme conditions.“If someone’s had a rough day, a warm meal can really lift spirits.”So inAntarctica, what’s on the menu? Chapman would serve fresh bread and croissants for breakfast, then curry or chicken Marbella (chicken with prunes, olives and capers) and collard greens for dinner. He’s an enthusiastic baker too, turning out trays of brownies and bakewell tarts. He would sometimes run baking classes for station staff too.Cheese rolls, or“southern sushi”, the rolled-up-grilled-cheese-sandwiches hailing from southern New Zealand, were always a hit. “You’d put them out, and they’d just be gone. People love that taste of home,” Chapman says.View image in fullscreenChef Al Chapman with cheese rolls for staff at New Zealand’s Scott Base in Antarctica.Photograph: Anthony Powell / Antarctica New ZealandOn the other hand, Paddy Rietveld says: “New things can go down well, because days can get really repetitive.” Rietveld is something of a veteran of cooking on ice, having completed four seasons in Antarctica, including a 10-month stint at Scott Base this year as the sole chef for a crew of a dozen hardy souls. This winter, as the finisher to a meal of sweet and sour chicken, he made fortune cookies – and even wrote the fortunes that went inside. Thursdays were “American night” with barbecue, burgers or nachos on the menu and 10 extra seats for staff from the nearby American-run McMurdo Station, the largest settlement in Antarctica with a winter crew of 150 to 200 people, and up to 1,200 in summer. The guest seats became so coveted a lottery system was introduced.At the station, allergies and diets – vegetarian, vegan, halal – must be accounted for. An added challenge, say Chapman and Rietveld, is that food takes longer to cook in Antarctica, due to the lower temperatures and high elevation.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningTo help stretch out supplies and minimise waste, Chapman says ingredients must be repurposed as much as possible. Leftover vegetables from a roast meal might end up in a future stew, while chicken and beef from dinner might make its way into sandwiches or wraps for lunch the next day. “If you eat something in Antarctica once, you’ll probably eat it again in a different form,” he says.Those challenges are small fry compared to his most recent three-month season as the sole chef atSWAIS2Ccamp. There, Chapman cooked in a tent, on an electric stove; in temperatures that could drop to -40C. Ingredients were ordered a year in advance and transported to camp via overland traverse, a 15-day journey over treacherous terrain, then stored in a makeshift freezer three metres under the ice.View image in fullscreenThe Christmas spread at the SWAIS2C field camp in 2024.Photograph: Al ChapmanView image in fullscreenAl Chapman, second from right, was the sole chef at the SWAIS2C camp from November 2024 to January 2025.Photograph: Anthony Powell/ Antarctica New ZealandYet the cuisine was varied: Chapman served steak, venison, “pretty much every kind of protein you can imagine”. Despite the extreme remoteness, there were sausage roll Tuesdays and fish and chip Fridays; Christmas was ham, smoked salmon, rump steaks, vegetables, mince pies,pavlovaand a single prized punnet of strawberries, shared among 27 scientists and support staff. They were stationed at the camp to drill into ice, to understand how past warming affected Antarctica and the rest of the world.In Antarctica’s legendarily bleak conditions, where food can have a big effect on morale, desserts hit the sweet spot.In 2001, Chris Martin was the science leader at the US-operated Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, the southernmost year-round research station in the world. About 50 staff were stationed during the winter, but they were – according to the contracting company that employed the on-base chef – consuming too much chocolate. Fresh supplies were not expected until October at the earliest, and the contractor decreed that the much-prized supply of chocolate chip cookies be rationed.There was discontent, says Martin, who helped found the station’s People’s Chocolate Chip Cookie Liberation Front (PCCCLF). The group established a recon division, as well as an infiltration and extraction team to “liberate” and distribute cookies to the masses in ziplock bags, with a PCCCLF logo drawn on.View image in fullscreenFood supplies at the US-operated Amundsen-Scott south pole station.Photograph: Chris MartinThe cookies, Martin says, were a way of keeping people sane amid the long winter, where temperatures can drop to as low as -80C, there is about six months of darkness, and staff rarely venture outside.Despite the harsh conditions, both Chapman and Rietveld hope to return to Antarctica in the near future. Rietveld says: “It’s quite nice – you sort of become like a private chef. You really get to know people’s likes and dislikes.”As for Chapman, it’s not just the occasional glimpse of penguins that lures him back. With windows that look out to beautiful pile-ups of sea ice, the kitchen, he says, has one of the best views at Scott Base.Explore more on these topicsFood and drinkAntarcticaChristmasNew ZealandChefsFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

How did it become a family favourite?Jimi FamurewaTue 23 Dec 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 23 Dec 2025 07.03 ESTShareThe culinary essence of the festive season is a kind of sanctioned chaos. Never mind that, from one angle,Christmasis mostly just rigidly observed collective food traditions and grown adults dying on the hill of whether yorkshire puddings should be served with turkey.I don’t think I ever really feel that warming yuletide rush until I have turned a disparate assemblage of leftovers into what, to the casual observer, looks distinctly like a completely unhinged plate of food. I think most of us will know the sort of thing: there will be ragged hunks of surplus cheese, brine-slicked olives, stray bits of fruit and thick slices of the last of the cola-glazed ham; there will be a splat of cranberry sauce, a wodge of stewed red cabbage, and a dense, sticky slice of breathalyser-troubling Christmas cake. It is, I suppose, what most people think of as a Twixmas picky tea. Or maybe even aTikTok “girl dinner”, where the specific “girl” being channeled is an exhausted Mrs Claus pouring herself a massive Baileys on Boxing Day.What began as a use for an accidental surfeit of stuffing-bound sausage meat has become one of winter’s most potent pleasuresHowever, in our household, these fridge-forages tend to feature one constant: a hulking, golden-yolked half of one of the peppery homemade scotch eggs that have become my mum’s most beloved signature and our family’s most sanctified, non-negotiable Christmas food tradition.Christmases vary with changing life circumstances. The past 25 years or so of festive celebrations have featured inconveniently timed hospital stays, Covid-induced separation, a mass decamping to Florida, and those adolescent, semi-fallow years where my brothers and I would generally slump beside a scantly decorated tree, silently contending with our Yates’s Wine Lodge hangovers. Despite all this, and whether they arrive in steamed-up Tupperware or hot and burnished direct from the stove, there is no Christmas without those boulderous, deep-fried orbs.One Christmas Day, in our indolent, child-free years, my wife and I had both nodded off on the old corner sofa, stuffed and content, only to wake at 1am to the sound of commotion and the drifting scent of sizzling pork. “Good news,” chirped mum, bustling in with a manic gleam. “The scotch eggs are ready.”What began one year as a use for an accidental surfeit of stuffing-bound sausage meat has become one of winter’s most potent and long-lasting pleasures. And its popularity in West Africa in particular is longer established than I realised: once eggs were introduced to the culinary vernacular by colonial missionaries in the 1920s and 1930s, scotch eggs emerged as a favoured menu item at Nigerian fast-food chain Mr Bigg’s, and are especially beloved in Cameroon, where spiced mackerel is often substituted for pork. My adaptation of Mum’s recipe doesn’t feature anything quite so experimental as that, though I do “double scotch” them, as she does, with the enlivening addition of some scotch bonnet pepper and all-purpose seasoning. While I always thought their Christmassiness was an incidental quirk specific to my family, so many things about them – their laborious sense of festivity, the core ingredients required, their utility as part of the omnivorous household’s post-Boxing Day cavalcade of scavenged grazing plates – make them perfect for this time of year.Start by gently placing four medium eggs in a bubbling pan of well-salted water and boiling for seven minutes exactly (this will get you fudgy, just-set yolks for eggs kept in the fridge; cook longer for a harder boil). Plunge them into a bowl of cold water to rest, cracking lightly at their bases to make peeling easier. Now, add a teaspoon each of black peppercorns, fennel seeds, all-purpose seasoning, chopped fresh sage and a finely chopped quarter of scotch bonnet to a mortar before grinding into a dryish rub and setting aside.Split eight good-quality pork sausages (around 450g), discard the skins, and add your seasoning paste to the sausage meat. Mix well, before forming into four balls. Squash these between two pieces of clingfilm to about coaster-thickness, peel the eggs, lightly dust them in plain flour and then form each meat patty around each egg, patting together to form an even, tightly sealed oval.Now make a pane line: three dinner plates, one filled with 120g plain flour, another with one beaten egg, and a final one with 120g panko breadcrumbs. Roll each sausage ball along the line, dunking in the flour and egg wash, before thoroughly coating in breadcrumbs. Warm about two and a half inches of vegetable oil in a saucepan to a medium, rippling heat(about 150C on a cooking thermometer, or at the point that a few breadcrumbs sizzle and take on colour after a few seconds), and fry the breaded scotch eggs in batches for six to eight minutes, keeping an eye on the crumb to make sure it doesn’t darken too quickly. Drain and leave to cool on kitchen paper. Serve with piccalilli or brown sauce, a chaotic plate of leftovers and, if you like, a fistful of mid-tier Celebrations in lieu of petits fours.Picky by Jimi Famurewa is published byHodder & Stoughtonat £20.

The retired teacher was sweeping his metal detector across a hillside in Leicestershire’s Welland valley when a series of beeps brought him up short. Digging down, he found a cache of buried coins almost two millennia old. He had chanced upon one of the UK’s most important iron age hoards, totalling about 5,000 silver and gold coins.More than 25 years on, I’m staring at Ken’s find at the civic museum in the nearby town of Market Harborough. The now gleaming coins are decorated with wreaths and horses. They’re about the size of 5p pieces, but speak of a wild-eyed age of tribal lands and windswept hill forts.A map of the Welland valley area.Hidden riches are something of a local theme here. The treasure was unearthed close to the Leicestershire-Northamptonshire border, in a sloping, sheep-dotted landscape where the River Welland ribbons eastwards in no special hurry. The town (“people just call it Harb”, one of the museum staff tells me) is the main settlement in this stretch of the valley. I’ve come here on a short winter visit to see why the area – hills, villages, Harb and all – gets described as an unsung alternative to the Cotswolds.View image in fullscreenThe stilted Old Grammar School in Market Harborough.Photograph: Colin Waite/AlamyThe town itself has ancient Saxon roots and is easy to like, with a head-turning mix of Jacobean, Georgian and Victorian architecture. I stumble onQuinns, a cracking independent bookshop tucked down an alleyway, then devour a curry bowl at a lively cafe calledTwo Old Goats. A board on the street lists notable town residents through the ages, the most recent being rugby giant Martin Johnson. I read this, then turn and immediately see him on the pavement 10 metres away. It’s unclear if this clever routine is something he does for all visitors, but he’s hard to miss in any case.I head to Foxton Locks, where 10 early 19th-century locks transport boats up and down a hillside, for a gawp and a wanderThe real pull of the Welland valley is the countryside, a slow-moving world of hushed green dales and drifting red kites. On local advice, I head to ruralFoxton Locks– Britain’s highest combination of staircase canal locks, where 10 adjacent early 19th-century locks transport boats up and down a 23-metre hillside – for a gawp and a wander. “It takes 50 minutes for boats to get from one end to the other,” says volunteer Malcolm, who seems delighted to have a visitor to talk to. The neatly painted locks rise up handsomely beside us.You need a decent woolly hat to go gongoozling (that is, canal-watching) in December, but there are rewards to be had. The skies are already fading to a wintery grey when I climb past the locks to the upper towpath. The narrowboats I see are moored up, their chimneys smoking and their roofs decorated with bums-out gnomes. I walk the path for an hour of rippled quietude, passing little other than moorhens and blackthorn sloes, then return the same way.View image in fullscreenFoxton Locks.Photograph: Ben LerwillBack at the locks I stop at tiny canalside pubBridge 61, where I find a crackling log grate and a row of Camra certificates. The barman pours me a Widebeam bitter from Langton Brewery. “Local ale,” he says. “From three miles up the way as the crow flies.” Proof, it turns out, that beer doesn’t have to travel far to hit the spot.My base is nearby Medbourne, one of numerous placid, calendar-pretty villages that stud the Welland valley. Medbourne has a clear stream, a lovely pub – theNevill Arms, where I spend the night in a four-poster and enjoy exactly the kind of warming, candle-lit dinner you’d want from a country inn in winter – and cottages built of tough, reddish Leicestershire ironstone.Even a short trip needs a finale, which comes in the form of the extraordinary Harringworth Viaduct, a colossal 82-arch span stretching right across the valleyThe next morning I meet local author and poet Tim Relf for a three-hour footpath ramble in the hills. Crossing stiles and ridge-and-furrow fields, he leads us to a spot above his home village of Drayton, from where the valley’s rolling green folds reveal themselves to the full. “You can make out six churches from here,” he says. He’s right. Their medieval spires punctuate a view that tumbles out for miles in all directions.Drayton itself is home to the smallest of these churches, a stone chapel with pews that seat about 25 people. It once spent time as the village bakery and still has a bricked-up serving hatch. “The vicar likes joking about the fact that Bethlehem translates as ‘House of Bread’,” Tim smiles.Close by, they’re used to far bigger crowds at the hilltopNevill Holt Hall. In early summer, the Grade I-listed hall draws thousands of opera and music lovers for its annual arts festival, though when we pass it on this midweek December morning its trimmed lawns and topiary are as quiet as everywhere else.View image in fullscreenThe Nevill Arms in Medbourne.Photograph: Ben LerwillWe finish in Great Easton, another village of thatched roofs and wide lanes. It has a little cafe, aptly calledthe Great, where I refuel on coffee and sticky spiced ginger cake before heading toEyebrook reservoiron the village outskirts. It’s a glorious spot for winter birding – teal, wigeon and great white egrets in the shallows, a 200-strong flock of lapwings billowing overhead – and completely uncommercialised, with a tiny car park and just one other birdwatcher. He’s excited at seeing five smew a little earlier. I give it an hour and don’t see them, but still leave feeling enchanted.Even a short trip needs a finale, which comes in the form of the extraordinary Harringworth Viaduct. I’m staggered when it comes into full view. The viaduct is a bona fide marvel of Victorian mega-engineering, a colossal 82-arch span stretching right across the valley. Glinting beneath it is the River Welland itself, looping and languid. It seems improbable that such an attractive valley should be hiding in plain sight in the middle of the country, but there’s not a tour bus to be seen. A treasure, indeed.The trip was provided bytheNevill Armsin Medbourne, which has doubles from£140B&BExplore more on these topicsEngland holidaysDay tripsShort breaksWalking holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

My flatmate was from Lithuania, and was due to go home in January, and our other flatmate, his girlfriend, was away forChristmas. I’d been home to Canada the month before, so for Christmas Day itself it was just the two of us.I bought a small chicken to roast, and served it with stuffing I’d brought back from Canada – it’s the same concept as the stuffing in the UK but somehow fluffier and with more texture – and some pasta. I made brussels sprouts, trying to recreate a dish I like from a restaurant in my home town by cooking them with bacon, maple syrup, parmesan and a mayonnaise drizzle. It wasn’t very nice. We had some prosecco that my flatmate had won in a competition, even though neither of us really liked prosecco. It felt like we should, because it was Christmas.My flatmate set up a projector in his bedroom – we didn’t have a living room – and we sat on desk chairs, eating our weird Christmas lunch on our laps, and watching a film I’d always wanted to see: Tiptoes, in which Gary Oldman plays a man with dwarfism. Matthew McConaughey plays Oldman’s twin brother, who is average-sized (and obviously much younger in real life), and has kept his family – all of whom have dwarfism – secret from his pregnant girlfriend, played by Kate Beckinsale. I think it was supposed to be a comedy, or at least a dramedy, but it was still a difficult premise.Tiptoes had intrigued me and my best friend from back home for years – despite never having seen it, we talked about it a lot and watched loads of YouTube videos where people shared their reviews. We also collected weird facts about the movie, such as Beckinsale only agreeing to be in the film if she wasallowed to wear her “lucky hat”during filming. It looks a bit like a Santa hat, but with black-and-white stripes. Having now seen the film, I can confirm it looks as odd as it sounds.Although the film does have roles for actors who have dwarfism, including Peter Dinklage, the main character is played by Oldman, who largely walks on his knees, placed in his shoes. There’s a scene where he’s on a sofa, and it’s obvious that the rest of his body is hidden inside it. It’s not as if the film is really old – it was only released in 2003 – so its inappropriateness feels even more jarring. My overwhelming feeling was: how did this get made?There is supposed to be a quite artistic director’s cut somewhere, which is interesting because the film that was released is comically bad: poorly written, with dialogue that feels deranged.I felt guilty watching it without my best friend, and later, when I confessed, she was furious. But I think if we had watched a Christmas film, it might have made us sad not to be with our families. A weird film, with weird food, on a weird Christmas Day seemed right.As told toEmine SanerExplore more on these topicsChristmasMy weirdest ChristmasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Cue plot twists and months of public intrigueArwa MahdawiTue 23 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTShareOn 16 July 2025, Andy Byron and Kristin Cabot went to a Coldplay concert in Boston. You know this, I know this, my pop-culture-averse neighbour Norma knows this. Millions of people around the world are intimately acquainted with what happened that fateful day: the co-workers were caught cuddling and thenjumping apart in horroron Coldplay’s kiss cam. Attention spans are short and fresh memes are minted daily. Unfortunately for Byron and Cabot, this wasn’t just another meme; the video of their shocked reaction contained all the ingredients of a viral moment with unusual staying power.First, there was the format: the clip – uploaded on social media by a fellow concert-goer – was only a few seconds long and easy to recreate. Then there were the protagonists: Byron was the married CEO of software company Astronomer and Cabot was the head of HR. Inequality is at record levels and eat-the-rich narratives are everywhere; everyone loves the chance to hate on wealthy tech types.While Byron and Cabot presumably did a lot of explaining in private after the concert, their moment of shame took on a very public life. Every baseball team in the US seemed to have a bash at re-enacting the moment on stadium big screens. The first high-profile parody was by the Philadelphia Phillies baseball team’s mascot, the Phillie Phanatic, who mocked the pair’s panicked reaction on the JumboTron at Citizens Bank Park. The stadium alsoplayed an audio clipof Coldplay’s Chris Martin’s reaction: “Uh-oh, what? Either they’re having an affair or they’re just very shy.”On TV, the Late Show host, Stephen Colbert, incorporated Donald Trump into the meme. In May, you might remember, CBS announced that Colbert’s show was getting cancelled: weirdly, this news cameonly a few daysafter the late-night host criticised the network’s parent company, Paramount, for settling a lawsuit with Donald Trump for $16m (£12m). Colbert called the settlement a “big fat bribe”. On 21 July, the first show after the cancellation was announced, Colbert parodied the Coldplay moment with a cartoon of Trumpshiftily hugging the Paramount logofrom behind.View image in fullscreenEven Strictly got in on the act.Photograph: YoutubeStrictly Come Dancing also got a dig in during an October broadcast when hostClaudia Winklemancosied up to the show’s conductor, Dave Arch, even though it had been a whole three months since the moment went viral (a thousand years in internet time).It wasn’t just sports teams and TV stars piling in: if there’s a viral moment, you can bet there’s a brand desperate to jump on it. The German arm of language learning app Duolingo posteda guide on Instagramdescribing what to do when you’re “caught in 4K but you’re fluent in denial”. Ikea Singapore posted aphoto of two stuffed animalscuddling with the headline “HR approved”. Nando’s Australia ran a promo for a free side dish with your main meal, billed as “a little something on the side”,with promo code COLDPLAY. Even theNew York Department of Sanitationincorporated the video into a public service announcement about dumping trash, warning, “We WILL catch you.”And what of our star-crossed (alleged) lovers? Byron resigned from Astronomer. The state of his marriage continues to be a matter of public intrigue: in November it was reported that he sold his $5.8m Manhattan apartment, with the deed suggesting that he isstill with his wife. Byron was also papped with his wife on a stroll in Maine in September. You don’t have to feel sorry for the man, but stalking him months after a viral moment feels a tad unnecessary.Obsessed with the Coldplay kiss cam story? I was too, until I realised the sinister truth at the heart of it | Arwa MahdawiRead moreCabot, meanwhile, spoke about the incident in an interview withthe New York Timeslast week. For weeks, Cabot said, she received 500 or 600 calls a day along with death threats and nasty comments about her appearance. She is still recognised when she goes out. Cabot also reiterated an earlier statement that she had separated from her husband “several weeks before the Coldplay concert”. Indeed, as was reported inSeptember, her husband was at the same Coldplay concert with a date of his own.“There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about,” Oscar Wilde famously said. I doubt Byron and Cabot agree with that,but the new CEO of Astronomer would seem to concur. Shortly after Byron made international headlines, Pete DeJoyannounced on LinkedInthat he had stepped into the role of interim CEO. “While I would never have wished for it to happen like this, Astronomer is now a household name,” DeJoy wrote. And the company quickly milked their new brand recognition for all it was worth, working with Ryan Reynolds’ advertising agency to put outa promotional video tied to the drama, starring Gwyneth Paltrow.Clearly Astronomer was over the moon with DeJoy’s performance because, in late November, the interim chief exec updated his LinkedIn again: he officially became the company’s new CEO. At least DeJoy got a happy ending.Explore more on these topicsLife and style2025: what happened next?Social mediaColdplayfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the sound of my first granddaughter wailing like an ambulance was the most beautiful I had ever heardBob BrodyTue 23 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 23 Dec 2025 13.57 ESTShareJust days beforeChristmasin 2018, I took a flight from New York City to visit my family in southern Italy. My wife, Elvira, and daughter Caroline had moved to a small town in the countryside a few years earlier, and I planned in due course to join the festivities permanently.I’d made the trip before, once or twice a year since they moved, mainly to get the lay of the land. But this time was different. Caroline had recently had her first child and our first grandchild. And now, after making do with photos and videos, I was finally going to meet Lucia Antonia, all of 11 weeks old. Rarely in my life had I felt more giddy about an encounter in the offing.Coming out of the airport, I spotted Caroline, cradling the baby in her arms. “Hello, Lucia,” I said, reaching out to take her tiny hands in mine. “I’m Grandpa. I’m thrilled to meet you.”So far, so good, I thought. Except we all then got in the car for the 134-mile drive to our houses in Guardia Sanframondi, an ancient town of 4,700 residents perched on a hillside in the Campania region. And Lucia immediately started crying. Hard. For the next hour.We stopped for lunch at a roadside restaurant, where Lucia took a breather. But once we buckled her back in her seat, she resumed crying, only more intensely now. She wailed like an ambulance siren, her eyes crinkled shut, tears streaming down her cheeks, gasping between sobs.All the while, Caroline cooed to Lucia in a tender singsong voice, trying to soothe her. “We’ll be home soon, baby,” she said. “Then you can go right in your crib and feel better.” My son-in-law Vito did the same from behind the wheel, but to no avail. Lucia kept squalling away for another hour, her lungs billowing like bellows. As we neared our destination, after almost three hours en route, Lucia reached a crescendo, her decibel level almost operatic.“I’m so sorry, Dad,” Caroline said from the back seat. “Lucia must be making quite a first impression. Are you sorry you came?”“No,” I said. “Why would I be sorry? I’m listening to our first grandchild. I can imagine no sound in the world more beautiful.” And I meant it.Naturally, I was sorry Lucia was upset. Maybe she was hungry or thirsty or felt stifled strapped into her seat. But this much I knew: babies cry. And may cry no matter what you do. I assumed Lucia had her reasons.By then, even though we’d just met, I already had some history with Lucia. Seven weeks before her birth, we’d seen her image on a sonogram. She was floating in utero, all three pounds of her, ensconced in her amniotic castle. We heard her heartbeat thump away, too. My wife had called me just hours after Lucia was born. “She’s here,” Elvira whispered, her voice catching in her throat. “And she’s perfect.”Later, I learned that Lucia had emerged from the womb with her eyes open, as if to signal she was ready for action – a phenomenon seen in only about one in three babies.Suddenly, arriving home from our ride, I was stricken with a strange sensation. This was going to be my first Christmas as a grandfather. And, by extension, my first designated officially as “old man”. It was foreign terrain. Would I do right by Lucia as her “Nonno?” How well would I adapt to my new station in the precincts of the elderly? I would find out soon enough.Today, we live a five-minute walk away from Lucia. She is now seven years old, a second-grader at middle school. Any time she goes to the park in the town, all the kids call out to her, ready to partner in play. Usually toddling along next to Lucia, hand in hand with his big sister, is her two-year-old brother Nicola.Lucia changed the equation for me once and for all that day. So what if she cried her eyes out for three hours in the car? Since then, her arrival on the planet has enriched my every moment, and never more so than when Christmas rolls around.Playing Catch with Strangers: AFamilyGuy (Reluctantly) Comes of Age by Bob Brody is available now (Heliotrope Books)This article was amended on 23 December 2025 to correct the spellings of Guardia Sanframondi and Campania.Explore more on these topicsChristmasMy weirdest ChristmasFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The internet says yes; coffee grounds are packed with nitrogen and organic matter, in theory making them a natural fertiliser and pest deterrent. But can the dregs from your cafetiere really replace plant food, or will they do more harm than good?The hackAdding used grounds to your plant’s soil provides a nutrient boost and improves soil texture. Some also sprinkle them directly on to the surface of pots to deter pests. It sounds like a sustainable dream come true – recycling waste into nourishment – but it’s not quite that simple.Houseplant hacks: how can I stop my plants dying when I turn on the central heating?Read moreThe methodUsed grounds are slightly acidic and dense. Sprinkled thickly, they can form a crust that repels water and suffocates roots. Instead, mix small amounts into compost (no more than 10%), or add to an outdoor compost heap where worms can break them down properly. Never dump fresh, wet grounds straight on to houseplants.The testI mixed a few tablespoons of dried coffee grounds into the soil of a spider plant. I didn’t observe any crazy growth spurts or any signs of damage, but when I tried watering the pot directly, the soil compacted and water pooled on the surface. Clearly not ideal.The verdictCoffee grounds are great for compost but risky for pots. Used sparingly and well mixed they add nutrients, but on their own they can smother roots. Think of them as a soil additive, not a fertiliser.Explore more on these topicsHouseplantsHouseplant hacksGardening adviceGardensfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It opens with footage of the mega-prison and shows detainees being shackled upon arrival in El Salvador.The episode was published on a streaming platform owned by Global TV, the network that has the rights to 60 Minutes in Canada.‘Cemetery of the living dead’: Venezuelans recall 125 days in notorious El Salvador prisonRead more“The first thing he told us was that we would never see the light of day or night again. He said: ‘Welcome to hell,’” recalled Luis Muñoz Pinto, a Venezuelan college student now living in Colombia, who speaks in the segment.He had traveled to the US seeking asylum and was arrested in 2024 at his appointment with US Customs and Border Protection in California.“They just looked at me and told me I was a danger to society,” Pinto recalled. He told correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi he had no criminal record. “I never even had a traffic ticket.”The episode had been slated to air on Sunday, but was pulled byCBS, which said the segment “needed additional reporting” and would “air in a future broadcast”. The removal of the episode prompted backlash both within CBS News and externally.Alfonsi issued a private note to herCBScolleagues on Sunday, noting the episode “was screened five times and cleared by both CBS attorneys and standards and practices. It is factually correct. In my view, pulling it now, after every rigorous internal check has been met, is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.”On Monday, Weiss addressed the episode being pulled in a statement to employees: “My job is to make sure that all stories we publish are the best they can be. Holding stories that aren’t ready for whatever reason – that they lack sufficient context, say, or that they are missing critical voices – happens every day in every newsroom. I look forward to airing this important piece when it’s ready.”Elsewhere in the episode, Pinto details how guards at Cecot treated him.“Four guards grabbed me, and they beat me until I bled until the point of agony. They knocked our faces against the wall. That was when they broke one of my teeth,” he said.Alfonsi notes the poor conditions in the prison, showing images of half-dressed men with shaved heads all lined up in rows in front of bunks stacked four high. The bunks have no pillows or pads or blankets. The lights are kept on 24 hours a day and detainees have no access to clean water.Alfonsi pointed to a 2023 report from the state department that “cited torture and life-threatening prison conditions” in Cecot, she said: “But this year, during a meeting with President Bukele at the White House, President Trump expressed admiration for El Salvador’s prison system,” before airing footage of Trump saying: “They make great facilities. Very strong facilities. They don’t play games.”The segment also talks to Juan Pappier, deputy director at Human Rights Watch, who helped write an 81-page report that detailed Cecot’s pattern of “systematic torture” and found that nearly half the men in the prison did not actually have a criminal history. Pappier said the study was based on information obtained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)’s own records. Alfonsi confirmed that 60 Minutes independently corroborated Human Rights Watch’s claims.William Losada Sánchez, a Venezuelan national and former Cecot inmate, also describes to Alfonsi what it was like to get sent to “the island” – a punishment room where prisoners would be sent if they could not comply with being forced to sit on their knees for 24 hours a day.“The island is a little room where there’s no light, no ventilation, nothing. It’s a cell for punishment where you can’t see your hand in front of your face. After they locked us in, they came to beat us every half hour and they pounded on the door with their sticks to traumatize us,” he said.The segment briefly touches on Kristi Noem’s visit to Cecot. Pinto claims the Department of Homeland Security secretary did not speak to a single detainee during her visit. There is also a video of Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, saying: “These are heinous monsters, rapists, murderers, kidnappers, sexual assaulters, predators who have no right to be in this country, and they must be held accountable.”The segment also says that DHS and the government of El Salvador declined to comment.On Tuesday afternoon, a CBS News representative confirmed to the Guardian that their Canadian broadcast partner, Global TV, “mistakenly published” the Cecot episode.“While Global TV has removed the episode from their app, this segment has since been posted on social and digital media. Paramount’s content protection team is in the process of routine take down orders for the unaired and unauthorized segment,” the statement said.Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic senator, shared the episode online, saying: “Take a few minutes to watch what they didn’t want you to see. This story should be told.”The removal and then subsequent leaking of the segment comes amid ongoing turmoil between 60 Minutes and the Trump administration. On 16 December, Trump wrote on Truth Social: “For those people that think I am close with the new owners of CBS, please understand that 60 Minutes has treated me far worse since the so-called ‘takeover,’ than they have ever treated me before. If they are friends, I’d hate to see my enemies!” A week before that, Trump blasted 60 Minutes for its interview with Marjorie Taylor Greene, whom he called a “very poorly prepared Traitor,” and said of parent company Paramount: “THEY ARE NO BETTER THAN THE OLD OWNERSHIP.”Larry Ellison put through a $108.4bn hostile takeover bid via Paramount for Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) this week in an effort to make WBD renege on the deal that was announced last week with Netflix. The tech billionaire’s Skydance Media acquired Paramount Global earlier this year and then went on to acquire Weiss’s independent media outlet The Free Press. He then appointed Weiss as CBS News’ head of editorial.Explore more on these topicsCBSEl SalvadorAmericasUS television industrynewsShareReuse this content"

They chose as the spokesperson for the sandal someone who is openly left wing.”Neither Torres nor the brand have commented publicly on the controversy.“I’ll tell the marketing people [at Havaianas] to get advice from the Budweiser marketing department here in the US, which also lost touch with reality and took a billion-dollar loss,” said the former congressman, referring to the backlash Bud Light faced after running an advert featuring the transgender TikTok star Dylan Mulvaney, before later being “forgiven” by Trump.View image in fullscreenFernanda Torres said in the ad that she hoped audiences would start 2026 not ‘on the right foot’, but ‘with both feet’.Photograph: Mauro Pimentel/AFP/Getty ImagesThe first day of the flip-flop boycott, on Monday, is saidto have wiped about £20moff the company’s market value.On the left, reactions ranged fromearnest appealsurging Bolsonaro supporters to donate their sandals, tomockery, including offers to swap the flip-flops for an electronic ankle tag in Brazil’s national colours.The device has become a running joke since Bolsonaro was caught trying todestroy his own ankle tagwith a soldering iron, prompting his transfer from house arrest to a cell where he began servinghis sentenceafterbeing convictedof masterminding a plot to overturn the result of the 2022 election.Explore more on these topicsBrazilJair BolsonaroAmericasThe far rightnewsShareReuse this content"

If it receives Senate approval in February, the bill will become law.“It’s very regressive in terms of refugee protection,” said Idil Atak, a professor of refugee and human rights law at Toronto Metropolitan University.Atak said the legislation marked an unprecedented expansion of executive power, in terms of information-sharing about refugees between government agencies and the ability to control, cancel or change immigration documents or processes.One of those changes is that asylum claims made more than one year after the claimant arrived in Canada would not be referred to the immigration and refugee board of Canada, but instead sent to an immigration officer for a pre-removal risk assessment.Such assessments depend on a single officer reading the file and have a high rate of rejection, according to a recent op-ed by40 lawyers and legal practitionersin the Toronto Star.The authorsargued thatthe new law evokes some disturbing eras in the country’s history around immigration law, including exclusionary policies at the turn of the 20th century which targeted specific racial groups, including south Asians and those from China and Japan.Audrey Macklin, an immigration and refugee law professor at the University of Toronto, said there were a variety of reasons why an individual might not claim asylum immediately, for example a student who is a member of a persecuted sexual minority might feel unable to return to their home country after living openly in Canada.As Canada has placedsignificant restrictionson international student numbers since 2024, some of those people might need to claim asylum – but would face significant barriers under the new laws.On Tuesday, the Toronto Starreportedthat Canada deported 18,000 people in 2024, the highest figure since the 2006-2015 government of Stephen Harper. Those deportations reportedly cost $78m – a 50% increase in costs from 2019.The pre-removal risk assessment process is one that does not give asylum seekers a fair hearing and really seeks to remove them from the country as swiftly as possible, she said.“Bill C 12 borrowed ideas from the United States about how to make it more difficult,” she said.The other element of the bill that has alarmed civil rights groups across the country is that asylum claims made at the land border with the US would also not be referred to the board if made after 14 days.Under the safe third country agreement between Canada and the USrefugees are required to seek asylum in the first safe country they arrive in.But Macklin says the US has never met the requirements of being a “safe” third country. And now, asICE raids aim to fast-track deportations without any due process, the US is proving to be “flagrantly unsafe for people to seek and obtain refugee protection”. It’s unfair to turn people away simply because they did not feel comfortable seeking asylum in the US, she says.Syed Hussan, the executive director of the Migrant Workers Alliance for Change, a Canadian migrant rights advocacy organization, says the legislation is the result of the Liberal and Conservative parties pushing rhetoric that migrants are to blame for Canada’s affordability crisis.“Do you blame CEOs or corporations for their misery, which we should … but we’re all being tricked into blaming migrants,” he said.The new measures also appear as attempted capitulation toward the Trump administration to “secure” the border, in order to appease the president as Canada has yet to reach a trade deal, said Atak.But all it really did was erode Canada’s image as a welcoming country and shirk international agreements to help asylum seekers, she said. “We do have an obligation, a moral obligation, to protect refugees.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaRefugeesAmericasMigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

So we can’t say for sure that these activities are directly targetingVenezuela, but I think it’s naive to suggest that they’re not somehow related,” she added.3:34'War on drugs' or political agitation? Assessing Trump's actions in Venezuela – video explainerRecent agreements include the “temporary”deploymentof US air force troops to Ecuador – despite Ecuadorians havingrejectedin a referendum the establishment of foreign military bases – and adecisionby Peru’s congress, after a request from the White House, to authorise US military and intelligence personnel to operate armed in the country.“And this has nothing to do with drugs,” said Jorge Heine, a former Chilean ambassador and a research professor at Boston University’s School of Global Studies. “Paraguay is not considered a major centre for either drug production or distribution, nor is Venezuela. This has much more to do with theUS national security strategydocument,” he added.In what it calls a “Trump Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine – the “America for Americans” foreign policy set out in 1823 by the US president James Monroe and later used to justify US-backed military coups in Latin America – the recently released document calls for an “expansion” of the US military presence in the region.Radar revelation stokes fears Caribbean could be drawn into US-Venezuela crisisRead moreIn the Caribbean, after Trinidad and Tobago allowed the installation of a US radar system and granted access to its airports, the Maduro regimeaccusedthe Caribbean neighbour of taking part in the seizure of the first oil tanker two weeks ago and announced the immediate termination of any agreements on fossil gas supplies between the two countries.Last week, Trinidad and Tobago’s prime minister, Kamla Persad-Bissessar, said the “best defence” for her country was military cooperation with the US. On Monday, Venezuela’s interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, said: “If Trinidad lends its territory to attack Venezuela, we have to respond.”View image in fullscreenUS fighter jets at the former Roosevelt Roads naval base in Ceiba, Puerto Rico.Photograph: Ricardo Arduengo/ReutersIn recent months alone, the US has signed similar agreements withGuyana, theDominican RepublicandPanama, while other countries in the region have already been drawn into the military buildup against Venezuela through existing US bases in Puerto Rico, Honduras and Cuba, and surveillance hubs at airports in El Salvador, Aruba and Curaçao.John Walsh, the director for drug policy at the Washington Office on Latin America, described the new US strategy as “gunboat diplomacy on steroids”, aimed at rewarding allies and sending a warning to those who fall foul of the Trump administration.In a letter sent on Monday to other presidents across Latin America and theCaribbean, Maduro issued an “urgent call” against what he described as a US “escalation of aggression … whose effects go beyond my country’s borders and threaten to destabilise the entire region”.Since being re-elected last year in a vote widely thought to have beenrigged, Venezuela’s dictator has had almost no contact with other presidents in the region, including former allies such as Brazil’s Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Colombia’s Gustavo Petro, two of the few leftwing leaders to remain after awaveof rightwing electoral victories. Lula was sidelined while facing 50% import tariffs before relationsthawedand Petro has beenthreatenedwith becoming the next US target after Maduro.“For countries that are not onboard, US gunboat diplomacy is an implicit threat that the US military is right nearby – making sure they don’t cross the US,” said Walsh.Explore more on these topicsUS militaryDonald TrumpVenezuelaAmericasEcuadorCaribbeanParaguayfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The number of loaded tankers that have not departed has increased in recent days, leaving millions of barrels of Venezuelan oil stuck on board ships, while customers demand deeper discounts and contract changes to take risky voyages beyond the country’s waters.China’s foreign ministry said on Monday that the seizure of another country’s ships was a serious violation of international law, after theUS intercepted a China-bound oil tankeroff the Venezuelan coast on Saturday.The tanker, which the White House said was part of Venezuela’sshadow fleetand carrying sanctioned oil, was not currently sanctioned by the US. However, Panama’s foreign minister said that the supertanker, Centuries, which was flying Panama’s flag when intercepted on Saturday, did not respect the country’s maritime rules and had altered its name and disconnected its transponder while carrying an oil cargo out of Venezuela.0:44Footage shows US forces seizing second oil tanker off Venezuela – videoVenezuela has the right to develop relations with other countries, China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a daily press briefing, adding thatChinaopposes all “unilateral and illegal” sanctions.China is the biggest buyer of Venezuelan crude, which accounts for roughly 4% of its oil imports.Later on Monday, the foreign ministers of Russia and Venezuela criticised the US actions, which have also includedstrikes on alleged drug-trafficking boatsand, on Sunday, the targeting of a third tanker.The Russian foreign ministry said Yván Gil and Sergei Lavrov expressed their “deep concern over the escalation of Washington’s actions in the Caribbean Sea, which could have serious consequences for the region and threaten international shipping.“The Russian side reaffirmed its full support for and solidarity with the Venezuelan leadership and people in the current context,” the statement read.The empty supertanker Bella 1, which theUS coast guard tried to intercept on Sundaywhen the ship approached Venezuela, was drifting on Monday north-east of the Caribbean, a satellite image obtained by TankerTrackers.com showed.A US official told Reuters on Sunday the tanker had not been boarded.Trump claims Venezuela, under Maduro, is using oil money to finance “drug terrorism, human trafficking, murder and kidnapping”. US forces have since Septemberlaunched strikes on boatsthat Washington claims, without evidence, have trafficked drugs in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean. More than 100 people have been killed – some of them fishermen, according to their families and governments.Caracas, in turn, fears Washington is seeking regime change, and has accused Washington of “international piracy”.On Monday, Maduro fired back at Trump, saying the US president would be “better off” focusing on domestic issues rather than threatening Caracas, in a speech broadcast on television.With Reuters and Agence France-PresseThis article was amended on 23 December 2025. An earlier version incorrectly said that Bella 1 was drifting north-east of Bermuda.Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaNicolás MaduroUS foreign policyOilAmericasCommoditiesRussianewsShareReuse this content"

Hiding out at a friend’s house in a Beijing suburb, Gao Yingjia and his wife, Geng Pengpeng, rushed downstairs to meet the group of plain-clothed men who said they were police officers. Their son, nearly six, was sleeping upstairs, and Gao and Geng wanted to minimise the ruckus. They knew their time was up.Two months later, Gao is in a detention centre in Guangxi province, southern China, charged with “illegal use of information networks”. His arrest was part of the biggestcrackdown on Christians in Chinasince 2018. It has prompted alarm from the US government and human rights groups, with some analysts describing it as the death knell forunofficial churchesin China.“We both knew that as Christians inChina, there were risks,” said Geng, who fled overseas for safety with her son. “But to be honest, you can never be fully prepared.”Gao is a senior pastor in Zion Church, one of China’s most prominent underground “house churches” with thousands of members across the country. His arrest, and those of more than a dozen other church leaders, came after months of increasing pressure on the network. But the crackdown has not been limited to Zion, prompting fears of a nationwide assault on Chinese Christians.On Sunday, Human Rights in China said more than 100 people had been detained in Wenzhou, a city in Zhejiang province, eastern China, in a raid on Christian groups last week. The US-based NGO said pressure had been mounting on Wenzhou’s Christians for months after a dispute about installing a Chinese national flag inside a local church.View image in fullscreen‘Sometimes I wonder, is this real?’ says Geng Pengpeng.Photograph: Amy HawkinsNow Geng is grappling with a set of impossible choices: should she return to China to be nearer to her husband, but risk arrest herself? Should she stay in Thailand, a country that has relaxed visa policies for Chinese nationals but has a history of complying with deportation requests from Beijing? Should she go elsewhere? Earlier in her religious journey, she sometimes felt her prayers would hit the ceiling and come back down. Now her faith is steadfast, but she’s waiting for guidance: “Sometimes I wonder, is this real?”The most prominent pastor to be detained in the recent raids isJin Mingri,56, Zion’s founder, also known as Ezra Jin. He was detained along with Gao and nearly 30 pastors and church members in October. Eighteen of the pastors have been formally arrested and face lengthy prison sentences.Following their arrests, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, condemned the crackdown and called for the release of the church leaders. He called on the Chinese government to “allow all people of faith, including members of house churches, to engage in religious activities without fear of retribution”.China has five officially recognised religions: Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Protestantism and Catholicism, but religious activities outside of officially sanctioned institutions are banned. Christians in particular have long gathered in unofficial house churches to worship away from the eyes of the state.View image in fullscreenJin Mingri, 56, the founder of Zion Church in Beijing, has also been detained.Photograph: SuppliedZion, founded in 2007, for years operated openly in Beijing in a converted nightclub. But in 2018 the church’s physical space was forced to close amid a nationwide crackdown on unofficial Christian gatherings that led to Wang Yi, the leader of the Early Rain Covenant, another house church, beingsentenced to nine yearsin prison for inciting subversion.That crackdown prompted Zion to move to a hybrid model that combined large online sermons with small in-person gatherings, with followers resorting to creative methods to avoid detection, such as by renting a tour bus to worship together on the move.“After 2018, all of these [unofficial] churches went underground, trying to find ways to bypass the tightening controls. Jin’s church was one of the most successful in doing that,” said Ian Johnson, the author ofThe Souls of China, a book about China’sreligious resurgence. With the arrests in October, he said, the government wanted to “make it clear to everyone that this is not acceptable”.In September, China introduced new rules banning unlicensed religious groups from holding online sermons. Xi Jinping, China’s leader, chaired a senior Communist party meeting in which he urged for the “Sinicization of religions”.But pressure has been increasing on Chinese Christians all year. In May, the pastor Gao Quanfu from the Light of Zion church (a separate organisation to Zion) and his wife were arrested. Around the same time, several members of theGolden Lampstand Church, an evangelical network, were reportedly given lengthy prison sentences on charges of fraud. And over the summer, more than 100 Zion members were questioned by police and several physical branches forced to close.View image in fullscreenGao Pu, son of the jailed pastor Gao Quanfu, and Grace Jin Drexel, the daughter of Jin Mingri, in Washington DC, US, draw attention to their fathers’ detainment.Photograph: SuppliedJohnson said the “writing has been on the wall for all of these churches since the 2000s” and the latest arrests marked “the final nail in the coffin”.By some measures, the crackdown is working. About 3% of China’s population identify as Christian, according to official estimates, a level that has remained stable for over a decade despite efforts by churches to grow their numbers. But that figure could be an underestimate, considering the increasing risks of publicly identifying as a Christian. Another survey from 2018 suggested 7% of Chinese people believed in some kind of Christian deity.Jin held a steadfast belief in Zion’s appeal. After the 2018 crackdown, he was confident that the church would continue to grow, said his daughter, Grace Jin Drexel, who lives in the US. Indeed, in the following years its core membership swelled from about 1,500 to 5,000, with online sermons reaching double that that number.But for months it has been clear that this year would be challenging for the church. A few weeks before the crackdown, Sean Long, a senior pastor who is now the interim leader, asked Jin if he’d considered the possibility that he could soon be arrested. Jin replied: “Hallelujah, a new wave of revival will follow.”China’s ministry of public security did not respond to a request for comment.Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsChinaChristianityHuman rightsAsia PacificReligionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The city can expect a cloudy day with medium chance of showers, rainfall totals across the city should be less than 5mm, with less than 1-2mm more likely.There would be heatwave conditions and extreme fire danger in parts of WA over Christmas, particularly around the south-west, said Natural Hazards Research Australia’s chief executive, Andrew Gissing.“WA folks are facing extreme heat … the strength of the winds and the relatively low humidity is taken into account when calculating those fire danger ratings.Sign up: AU Breaking News email“WA has also been experiencing this longer-term drying trend, which has been escalating … and when you have bushfire and extreme heat, you’ve also got the associated health risks of the bushfire smoke.”Canberra (27C) and Adelaide (25C) were the only capitals expecting a fine and relatively mild Christmas Day, while Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, and Hobart could expect showers, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. Darwin could get a 50mm tropical downpour.On Christmas Day, Sydney can expect a shower or two and a top of 23C, and Brisbane is predicted to be a balmy 34C.Perth will have a scorcher, with 41C forecast before a milder 27C on Boxing Day.Hobart will experience the coolest temperatures of all the capital cities on Christmas Day, with a top of 15C, while Darwin is expected to hit 31C.Australia has been experiencing a “reasonably active”bushfireseason amid hot weather, said Gissing.“In New South Wales we had about 16 homes lost recently, a similar number at Dolphin Sands in Tasmania and there’s been a few lost inWestern Australiaas well, and tragically, we’ve lost firefighters as well,” he said.“Other than bushfires, you’ve also got widespread heavy rainfall across northern Australia, which will lead to potential flooding,” he said.“And you’ve also got this category-two cyclone that’s firmed up in the Indian Ocean, which might impact the Cocos Islands on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day as well.”Explore more on these topicsAustralia weatherWestern AustraliaNew South WalesQueenslandVictoriaSouth AustraliaNorthern TerritorynewsShareReuse this content"

Tributes to the popular MP poured in from across the political spectrum, led by prime minister Anthony Albanese and opposition leader Sussan Ley, and former colleagues Peter Dutton, Josh Frydenberg and Scott Morrison.Allen, who worked as a paediatric allergist and gastroenterologist at the Royal Melbourne hospital before her career in politics, revealed earlier this year that she had a rare form of cancer known as cholangiocarcinoma.In a statement posted to Allen’s Facebook account yesterday, her family announced the passing of “our beloved Katie (Mum)”.“She spent her life caring for others as a mother, doctor, professor, MP and friend. She is deeply loved,” the statement said.“She passed in peace surrounded by family and lived a full, beautiful life, all the way to the end.“We love you so much.”Allen is survived by her four children, one grandchild, and her husband, Malcolm.She was diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma, an aggressive cancer of the bile ducts, in November 2023 but did not announce it beyond her close family circle until after the federal election in May, in which she ran unsuccessfully for the seat of Chisholm.Shetold The Age in Novemberthat her husband encouraged her to push ahead with her political ambitions, and she kept the diagnosis private to avoid the sympathy vote.“Now and then, if someone would do something really mean, I would think ‘If only you knew I had cancer’,” she said.In a message on social media, Albanese said Allen had “dedicated her life, her talents and her courage to making our nation a better place”.“Katie believed deeply in serving her community, her nation and her fellow Australians,” he said.Ley described her as a “trailblazer”, paying tribute to her “exceptional intellect, courage and warmth”.“You only had to be in a room with her to feel her passion. Passion for women, for medicine, for education, for the Liberal Party, and above all for people who needed a helping hand,” she said in a statement.“She was the smartest of colleagues, the kindest of friends, and an extraordinary wife and mother. Her beautiful family were the humanity that shone through everything she did.”Morrison, who was prime minister during Allen’s term in parliament, praised her “extraordinary talents, passion and love”.“Her focus was always on the people she was trying to help and support, whom she kept firmly in her gaze. Thank you for all your dedicated service Katie. She will be greatly missed,” he said on social media.Dutton called her an “amazing mother and wife, gifted doctor and passionate community advocate”. Frydenberg said she was “brave, bright and beautiful …special, a cut above the rest”.Tributes also came from defence minister Richard Marles, shadow ministers Andrew Bragg and Tim Wilson, former health minister Greg Hunt, and independent MP Allegra Spender.Liberal senator Sarah Henderson said Allen was “a woman of extraordinary intellect and achievement” and “a warrior for the people she represented”.Liberal senator James McGrath paid tribute to his former colleague, telling Radio National on Wednesday that “to know Katie was to love Katie and to love life”.“She was one of those people who just brought in a spirit of deep thought and a spirit of just the joy of life,” he said.“But to underestimate Katie, you did so at your own risk. She had a very strong – she had an iron fist hidden by a velvet glove, and Australia is poorer with her loss… she’ll be missed and we all loved her.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian politicsLiberal partynewsShareReuse this content"

The Liberals joined the Labor government members in voting for the bill, while the Nationals and Shooters voted against. The Greens members abstained.The new laws mean the state police commissioner will now have powers to ban protests on the streets of NSW for 14 days and up to three months, once a terrorism determination has been made.Guns, terror symbols, protests and hate speech: NSW is pushing through changes after Bondi – so what are they?Read moreGun laws have also been tightened, with gun owners now generally restricted to owning four guns, while farmers and professional shooters will be restricted to 10 weapons. Gun owners must also be Australian citizens.Firearms that allow multiple shots without reloading, similar to those used by the alleged shooters, will also be banned and gun licences will need to be renewed every two years, allowing greater scrutiny by police.Appeals against refusals by police to grant a licence will also be curtailed.The bill, which included amendments to multiple pieces of legislation, was criticised by both progressives and conservatives.But because it was an omnibus bill and the government and the Liberals resisted splitting it into two bills, parliamentarians were ultimately forced to vote it up or down.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe NSW Liberals supported the government, though Liberal member Susan Carter attempted unsuccessfully to amend the bill to make the protest ban apply to rallies on beaches and in parks.The government’s ban only applies to street marches which require a form 1 permit, which protects protesters from prosecution for offences such as obstructing traffic and is necessary for demonstrations using public streets.The Greens, who were vehemently opposed to the ban on protests, were torn as they have long advocated for stronger gun control.“I thought the recalling of parliament to take this action was reasonable,” Greens MLC Sue Higginson said. “I supported moves to take a strong evidence-based stand against hate fuelled extreme gun violence by drawing a line in the sand and passing world-leading gun law reform in the immediate aftermath of the attack.“But partisanship and division have clouded out the capacity for leadership from these individuals, and the anti-protest provisions of this bill is a departure from the fundamental principles of peace, non-violence and good governance.“Peaceful assembly is a fundamental civil liberty and now is not the time to restrict our civil liberties. If the government is hell bent on doing this, then they must at the very least make these powers temporary.”On Tuesday, a coalition of groups that regularly organise protestssaid they were preparing a constitutional challengethat would be lodged as soon as the bill became law.The premier,Chris Minns, said in response that his government had “run our legislation thoroughly through the crown solicitor. We are alive to the threat from the high court and a reversal of these changes … We’re all confident that they’re sound constitutionally.”The NSW Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party and the NSW Nationals led opposition to the tougher gun controls and attempted to delay the bill’s passing through the upper house by moving dozens of amendments.Upper house Shooters MLC Mark Banasiak said he spoke on behalf of “260,000 law-abiding firearm owners in this state” and pointed the finger at government failures.“Licensed firearm owners did not radicalise the [alleged] offenders,” he said.“We were not the ones who ignored the advice of our own security agencies, and that risk was known, the warnings were clear, and yet state and federal governments did nothing, nothing, until the moment came when the public demanded answers,” he said.“They chose to point the finger at 260,000 law-abiding firearm owners, Australians who do the right thing every single day, farmers, sporting shooters, hunters, collectors, regional Australians, people who comply with the law, people who submit to background checks, to inspections, to licensing requirements, to ongoing scrutiny, people who are already the most regulated citizens in this state.“The blame for this atrocity does not rest with them.”The Nationals’ Sarah Mitchell raised her concerns about the impact on farmers, whom she said had not been properly consulted.Ten guns might be enough for some farmers but that limit might not work for all, she said.The debate also again laid bare the deep divisions within Labor over the direction Minns has taken in dealing with the aftermath of the Bondi massacre.Upper house member Stephen Lawrence, who is also a barrister specialising in public law, told parliament he believed the laws would limit the implied freedom of political communication in the Australian constitution.A provision allowing a “public assembly restriction declaration” or “Pard” to be made if there is a concern for public safety would be satisfied “by any large protest at any time”, he said.He added that changes giving police move-on powers if a person is obstructing another person or traffic under a Pard would also capture crowd behaviour at most protests.“In summary, our freedom to politically communicate by way of protest will be limited by this bill,” he says.Anthony d’Adam, a Labor MLC who has fought for civil liberties and acknowledgment of the Palestinian genocide, said he would support the bill but expressed serious reservations about the protest restrictions.Explore more on these topicsBondi beach terror attackNew South WalesChris MinnsNew South Wales politicsGun controlProtestFreedom of speechnewsShareReuse this content"

At least three people were killed, including a four-year-old child.Poland scrambled fighter jets to protect its airspace during the strike, the country’s army said in a statement.Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said in a post on Telegram: “A strike before Christmas, when people want to be with their families, at home, in safety. A strike, in fact, in the midst of negotiations that are being conducted to end this war. Putin cannot accept the fact that we must stop killing.”Meanwhile, Ukraine pressed on with strikes against Russian oil and gas infrastructure, hitting a petrochemical plant in southern Russia’s Stavropol region.Footage circulating on Russian media channels showed towering flames in the industrial area, which the regional governor, Vladimir Vladimirov, said had been engulfed by a fire.The strikes follow weekend negotiations in Miami involving Donald Trump’s peace envoy, Steve Witkoff, and representatives from Russia and Ukraine, who each held separate meetings with Witkoff and Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. Witkoff called the discussions “constructive” but there was no sign the talks were any closer to bringing lasting peace.View image in fullscreenAn injured woman looks out of her broken window in Kyiv.Photograph: Efrem Lukatsky/APZelenskyy said in a statement that he was briefed on the state of the talks on Tuesday morning and that “several draft documents have now been prepared”, including an outline for ending the war, options for Ukraine’s future security guarantees and plans for the country’s postwar reconstruction.Ukraine has engaged its European allies to help hammer out a compromise agreement with the US, although Zelenskyy has said the issue of territorial concessions remained a sticking point. There isno sign that Russia is even closeto signing up to the package of agreements Kyiv and Washington have arrived at, despite repeatedpositive messaging from the White Housethat peace is close.“Slow progress is being observed,” the Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, told state media after the talks. However, Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, has said many times that Russia will agree only to a deal that addresses what he sees as the “root causes” of the conflict – a sweeping set of demands that would in effect erode Ukraine’s sovereignty.Putin’s spokesperson struck a downbeat tone on Tuesday, telling Russian media that the latest round of talks had not produced a breakthrough.Russia has continued to hit Ukrainian energy infrastructure as the talks go on, apparently in the hope of making conditions harder for the population and breaking Ukrainian resolve. Tuesday’s attack, which the energy operator Ukrenergo said was the ninth mass attack on energy infrastructure of the season, left three western regions of Ukraine “almost completely without power”, it said.Kyiv and many other cities have been experiencing scheduled power cuts for weeks as the grid struggles to cope with reduced capacity during the winter months. Temperatures have dropped below freezing in many parts of Ukraine, with a high of -5C forecast for Kyiv on Wednesday.Reports suggested a toddler was killed in the north-western Zhytomyr region on Tuesday, while a drone killed a woman close to Kyiv. Authorities in several western regions reported damage to energy infrastructure.Russia struck a series of infrastructure targets in the southern city of Odesa and damaged more than 100 houses, according to local officials. Russia has been attacking the port city relentlessly over recent weeks, leading to sustained power shortages.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It said Ryanair had prevented online travel agents from selling tickets on its flights in combination with other airlines and services, weakening competition.Ryanair said it would immediately appeal against the “legally flawed” ruling.The Ryanair chief executive,Michael O’Leary, had decided to wage war on what hedescribed as “pirate” travel agents, such as Booking.com, Kiwi and Kayak. O’Leary accused the travel agent industry of scamming and ripping off unsuspecting consumers by charging extra fees and markups on ticket prices.O’Leary was prepared to accept lower ticket sales as he tried to prevent travel agents from selling tickets, forcing their passengers to fill out extra forms supposedly as a security measure. The abrupt removal of Ryanair flights from agents’ websites in late 2023caused a drop in sales for the airline.The lower salesdented Ryanair’s profits, although they have not prevented the Irish airline from rising to a record valuation of €31bn (£27bn). That has made it the world’s second most valuable airline, behind only the US’s Delta Air Lines.O’Leary – who is known for his combative and often sweary criticisms of airports, rivals and regulators – is planning to hand over control of the business to a successor within the next five to 10 years. He will begiven shares worth €111m(£97m) if he stays at the airline until the end of July 2028. He was already a billionaire on paper because of his shareholding.Responding to the ruling, O’Leary said it was “an affront to consumer protection and competition law”.He added: “The internet and the ryanair.com website have enabled Ryanair to distribute directly to consumers, and Ryanair has passed on these 20% cost savings in the form of the lowest air fares inItalyand Europe.“Ryanair looks forward to successfully overturning this legally flawed ruling and its absurd €256m fine in the courts.”The vast majority of Ryanair’s sales took place through its website even before the battle against online travel agents. However, the Italian authority said Ryanair had been guilty of “abuse of a dominant position” and using its “significant market power” in trying to stamp out the business.Ryanair’s tactics included rolling out facial recognition procedures for people who bought tickets via a third party, claiming that was necessary for security. It then “totally or intermittently blocked booking attempts by travel agencies”, including by blocking payment methods and mass-deleting accounts.The airline then “imposed partnership agreements” on agencies that banned sales of Ryanair flights in combinations with other carriers, and blocked bookings to force them to sign up. Only in April this year did it allow agencies’ websites to link up with its own services, allowing effective competition.The competition authority said Ryanair’s actions had “blocked, hindered or made such purchases more difficult and/or economically or technically burdensome when combined with flights operated by other carriers and/or other tourism and insurance services”.Explore more on these topicsRyanairMichael O'LearyAirline industryIrelandItalyEuropeRegulatorsnewsShareReuse this content"

These are just some of the labels admirers and critics have attached toPavel Durovover the past decade.The Russian-born tech entrepreneur founded Russia’s version of Facebook before going on to create the messaging appTelegram, launch a cryptocurrency ecosystem and amass a multibillion-dollar fortune, all while clashing repeatedly with authorities in Russia and beyond.But much of Durov’s real story – and the logic that drives him – remains obscured.A new biography aims to change that.The Populist, by the independent Russian writer Nikolay Kononov, traces the 41-year-old’s rise from a St Petersburg schoolboy science prodigy to the founder of Telegram, one of the world’s most influential communications platforms, which has more than a billion users.Kononov describes thebookas the product of a 14-year attempt to map Durov’s strategy and mindset, drawing on conversations with Durov himself and people who worked with him, as well as rivals and critics.The book’s title, he said, refers to a thread running through Durov’s life: his desire to address Telegram’s millions of users directly, allowing him to bypass institutions, the press and any system of representation.“Durov is one of the first digital populists,” Kononov said in an interview, explaining that “from the very beginning, as soon as he started making his digital products, he programmed into them the ability to write and communicate his ideas directly to his audience.”.View image in fullscreenDurov delivering a keynote speech during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in 2016.Photograph: Albert Gea/ReutersBoth VKontakte, Durov’s first venture, and Telegram have at times pushed messages from Durov directly to all users, including users who had not opted in, outlining his libertarian worldview.“He sees himself as a visionary. And obviously wants to be heard,” the author said.That strategy has helped promote Durov’s central promise – almost absolute freedom of expression – even as Telegram has become a go-to tool for dissidents, extremists, scammers and war propagandists.If Durov’s public brand is built on libertarianism, Kononov says his private management style points in the opposite direction: power concentrated in one man’s hands, with few visible checks.“He is essentially the only one making all the product decisions at Telegram,” Kononov said. “Marketing, PR – it’s a one-man show.”The portrait he draws is of a tech founder whose worldview has not wavered over the years, remaining most comfortable within an ultra-libertarian, anti-institutional strand of the right that is often misogynistic and, at times, conspiratorial.“What surprised me most is that Durov hasn’t changed or evolved in all the years that I have interviewed him,” Kononov said.Durov is not an outlier, Kononov writes, but part of a broader new wave of moguls – most visibly in the US – who pair technological dominance with an outsized sense of personal mythology and a deep suspicion of government constraint.Like Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and Jeff Bezos, he has shown a strong interest inlongevityscience as well aspronatalism, the belief that having as many children as possible is a social or civilisational duty.Durov does not drink or use drugs, Kononov says, regularly dispenses spartan health advice – often alongside photos of him shirtless – and has said he hasfathereddozens of children through sperm donation.View image in fullscreenDemonstrators with an icon-stylised painting of Durov protest against the blocking of Telegram in Russia during a May Day rally in Saint Petersburg in 2018.Photograph: Olga Maltseva/AFP/Getty ImagesOne of the book’s most striking sections tells for the first time of Durov’s tense early meeting with President Vladimir Putin in 2013, held behind closed doors.Kononov writes that Durov described the encounter as a one-way conversation, in which the Kremlin leader reprimanded him over illegal content on Vkontakte and suggested that Durov leave the country.Under pressure from the authorities, Durov sold his stake in Vkontakte,left Russiaand eventually settled in Dubai, where he founded Telegram.But the clearest mark on Durov in recent years, Kononov suggests, came not from Russia but from France.Durov, who also holds French citizenship, wasdetainedand held for three days in France in August last year as part of an investigation into crimes linked to Telegram, including the circulation of child sexual abuse images, drug trafficking and fraudulent transactions.His detention came as a shock to the tech mogul. In interviews conducted in Paris after his arrest, Durov described to Kononov a harsh, disorienting ordeal – a permanently lit cell and little sleep – that rattled a man who had spent years insulating himself from the reach of the state.It also appears to have sharpened his hostility towards the west. Kononov says Durov now framesEuropeas sliding toward “total digital control”, and increasingly conspiratorial rhetoric.Most recently, Durov appeared to endorse a conspiracy theory promoted by the far-right blogger Candace Owens, suggesting that Paris was behind the killing of Charlie Kirk.“What interests me about Durov is that, on the one hand, he clearly has a very high IQ,” Kononov said. “But at the same time, he is prone to conspiracy theories.”Kononov is adamant, however, that Durov’s views should not be conflated with formal political allegiances.One of the most persistent claims surrounding Durov is that he is secretly aligned with Russian security services.But Kononov said that in the course of his research, he found no evidence that Durov has worked with, or on behalf of, the Russian state. “He has a huge number of flaws – but not the sin of Telegram acting as a backdoor for the FSB,” Kononov said.Kononov argues that what Durov has ultimately learned is the need to compromise – with both Russian and western authorities – when it serves his interests and allows Telegram to continue operating.Kononov recalls Durov once telling him: “I never waste time on things that are unnecessary or that cannot be useful to me personally.” That self-serving mindset, Kononov said, ultimately ended their personal relationship.About a year ago, the writer asked Durov whether he saw a contradiction between Telegram’s highly centralised, almost authoritarian internal structure and his professed devotion to freedom of expression. After that, Durov stopped responding.“He quickly realised it wasn’t going to be a book to his liking,” Kononov said.Explore more on these topicsRussiaEuropeBiography booksTelegramnewsShareReuse this content"

Both detainees are being held on remand at HMP Bronzefield in Surrey.It comes after allegations that Zuhrah was refused an ambulance for more than 18 hours at HMP Bronzefield, which led to a protest outside the prison last week, which the Coventry South MP Zarah Sultana attended. Ministry of Justice officials have previously disputed claims of mistreatment.Four other detainees, Kamran Ahmed, Heba Muraisi, Teuta Hoxha and Lewie Chiaramello, remain on hunger strike, Prisoners for Palestine said.Zuhrah, 20, said on Tuesday: “To our government, do not release your breath, because we will certainly return to battle you with our empty stomachs in the New Year, when you have shamefully returned from your blood-soaked break, to the theatrics of your ‘democracy’.“Our demands however remain inescapable, and this pause is your chance to meet them, to get it right, to stop arming and aiding this genocide, otherwise you will force us to return to confront you with our breaths, which will be far more disastrous and dangerous than this first time.”Gib, 30, said: “We have never trusted the government with our lives, and we will not start now. There will be no turkey dinner and break in the Zionist programme of genocide.“We are committed to the resistance of their script, not until Christmas, but for the rest of our lives … we will be the ones to decide how we give our lives to justice and liberation.”The remaining hunger strikers released a new set of demands on Tuesday, including that Muraisi, who is being held at HMP New Hall in West Yorkshire, be transferred back to HMP Bronzefield where she was initially detained.A spokesperson for Prisoners for Palestine said: “The remaining four will continue to refuse food on the basis of the five demands, as well as specifying their demands to include the end of all non association orders between prisoners; Heba’s transfer back to HMP Bronzefield; and the same access to all courses and activities as sentenced prisoners.“Non association orders are used to further isolate prisoners from each other despite being in the same prison; just as Heba has been moved across the country, away from her family and friends in London.“Due to the extended period of time on remand, well over the usual six month legal limit, it is only fair that the prisoners are able to access the same activities as everyone else.”Earlier this month, Jon Cink and Umer Khalid ended their 41-day and 13-day hunger strikes for health reasons. The pair were admitted to hospital and have since been discharged back to prison.Lord Timpson, minister for prisons, probation and reducing reoffending, said in a statement: “While very concerning, hunger strikes are not a new issue for our prisons. Over the last five years, we’ve averaged over 200 a year and we have longstanding procedures in place to ensure prisoner safety.“Prison healthcare teams provide NHS care and continuously monitor the situation. HM Prison and Probation Service are clear that claims that hospital care is being refused are entirely misleading – they will always be taken when needed and a number of these prisoners have already been treated in hospital.“These prisoners are charged with serious offences including aggravated burglary and criminal damage. Remand decisions are for independent judges, and lawyers can make representations to the court on behalf of their clients.“Ministers will not meet with them – we have a justice system that is based on the separation of powers, and the independent judiciary is the cornerstone of our system. It would be entirely unconstitutional and inappropriate for ministers to intervene in ongoing legal cases.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

He was not formally arrested. The force did not name the individual who was interviewed and he was informed of the outcome on Tuesday.In a statement, Avon and Somerset police said: “No further action will be taken on the basis there is insufficient evidence for there to be a realistic prospect of conviction.”It added: “The comments made on Saturday 28 June drew widespread anger, proving that words have real-world consequences.“We believe it is right that this matter was comprehensively investigated, every potential criminal offence was thoroughly considered and we sought all the advice we could to ensure we made an informed decision.”The force shared the details of its initial inquiries with the Crown Prosecution Service in July and sought legal advice around a number of offences.A CPS spokesperson said: “We recognise the strength of public feeling about comments made during Bob Vylan’s set at Glastonbury festival in June, particularly among the Jewish community.“We provided early investigative advice to Avon and Somerset police on what evidence might be needed to meet the legal test for charging but we have not been asked to make a charging decision in this case.“A number of offences were considered which each have evidential requirements to prove but Avon and Somerset police have concluded there is insufficient evidence for there to be any realistic prospect of conviction and will take no further action.”In response to the decision, the Community Security Trust, a charity that provides protection to Jewish communities in the UK, said: “It is incredibly disappointing that the police and CPS have decided not to charge in this case, particularly when police forces in London and Manchester are adopting a stronger approach to tackling hateful rhetoric.“It sends completely the wrong message at the worst possible time.”The Metropolitan police said last month they would close their own investigation into Bob Vylan’s gig in May at Alexandra Palace in north London, after advice from the CPS.In September, theBBC partly upheld complaintsover its decision to stream the punk duo’s performance at Glastonbury.Explore more on these topicsBob VylanGlastonbury festivalFestivalsnewsShareReuse this content"

Hastings residents were left without water for four days in May 2024 after a pipe, which was flagged for replacement in 2007 but never fixed, burst. Multiple pipes in the Hastings area have previously been listed by the company as “aged assets prone to failure”.Helena Dollimore, the Labour MP for Hastings, Rye and the Villages, said: “I’m deeply frustrated that Hastings is once again paying the price for Southern Water’s failures. A burst pipe has left our town with a limited water supply and this means there could be an outage tomorrow. My immediate priority is protecting residents, particularly the most vulnerable, and supporting local businesses at this critical time.“I’ve pressed Southern Water to act fast to open as many water stations as possible, deliver directly to those on the priority services list, and provide extra water to pubs, restaurants and hotels. I will be holding Southern Water to account and asking the questions that need to be asked, but right now my focus is on ensuring everyone has access to the water they need and limiting the impact of this.”Dollimore haspreviously criticisedthe company for paying large dividends to its shareholders rather than investing in its crumbling infrastructure.Southern Water recently came under fire after a failure at one of its treatment centres caused a spill ofhundreds of millions of tiny plastic beadson Camber Sands and Hastings beaches.Its managing director for water, Tim McMahon, said: “We are taking these measures as a precaution against a worst case scenario and impact on supply tomorrow evening. Our teams will fix the burst main as quickly as possible.“While we work to protect supply to homes and businesses in Hastings, we would ask customers please not to use more water than usual, and not to stockpile mains water, as this will make the situation worse. Thank you for your understanding as we fix the issue.”Explore more on these topicsEast SussexWater industrynewsShareReuse this content"

There have been sustained protests outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Broadview, on the outskirts of Chicago, withaggressive tacticsused against the resistance by the authorities.Last week, authorities arrested 21 protesters and said four officers were injured outside the Broadview facility. Local authorities made the arrests.The justices decided on a 6-3 vote on Tuesday to back a lower court and rule that theTrump administrationhad not met the legal burden needed to show that it was not able to execute the laws of the land without federal military intervention.The three justices leaning furthest to the right on the bench, Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, dissented on Tuesday.The decision was a significant defeat for Trump’s efforts to send troops to US cities as part of his immigration crackdown and arguments that some cities and states are doing a bad job of fighting crime.The justices declined the Republican administration’s emergency request to overturn a ruling by US district judge April Perry that had blocked the deployment of troops. An appeals court also had refused to step in. The supreme court took more than two months to act.The high court order is not a final ruling but it could affect other lawsuits challenging Trump’s attempts to deploy the military in other Democratic-led cities.“At this preliminary stage, the government has failed to identify a source of authority that would allow the military to execute the laws inIllinois,” the majority on the bench wrote.Justice Brett Kavanaugh said he agreed with the decision to block theChicagodeployment, but would have left the president more latitude to deploy troops in possible future scenarios.The White House did not immediately respond to an email message seeking comment.In a dissent, Alito and Thomas said the court had no basis to reject Trump’s contention that the administration was unable to enforce immigration laws without troops. Gorsuch said he would have narrowly sided with the government based on the declarations of federal law enforcement officials.The administration had initially sought the order to allow the deployment of troops from Illinois and Texas, but the Texas contingent of about 200 national guard troops was later sent home from Chicago.The Trump administration has argued that the troops are needed “to protect federal personnel and property from violent resistance against the enforcement of federal immigration laws”.But Perry wrote that she found no substantial evidence that a “danger of rebellion” is brewing in Illinois and no reason to believe the protests there had gotten in the way of Trump’s immigration crackdown.Perry had initially blocked the deployment for two weeks. But in October, she extended the order indefinitely while the supreme court reviewed the case.The Illinois case is just one of several legal battles over national guard deployments.District of Columbia attorney general Brian Schwalb is suing to halt the deployments of more than 2,000 guard troops in the nation’s capital. Forty-five states have entered filings in federal court in that case, with 23 supporting the administration’s actions and 22 supporting the attorney general’s lawsuit.More than 2,200 troops from several Republican-led states remain in Washington DC.A federal judge in Oregon has permanently blocked the deployment of national guard troops there, and all 200 troops from California were being sent home from Oregon, an official said.A state court in Tennessee ruled in favor of Democratic officials who sued to stop the ongoing national guard deployment in Memphis, which Trump has called a replica of his crackdown on DC.In California, a judge in September said deployment in the Los Angeles area was illegal. By that point, just 300 of the thousands of troops sent there remained, and the judge did not order them to leave.The Trump administration has appealed against the California and Oregon rulings.Reuters and the Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS supreme courtChicagoIllinoisTrump administrationUS politicsUS policingUS militarynewsShareReuse this content"

The files include more references to Trump, but also more details about Epstein’s relationship with economist Larry Summers. Bizarrely, the Tuesday release includes a letter purported to be from Epstein to the convicted sexual abuser and former Olympics gymnastics coach Larry Nassar – which the DoJ later in the dayannounced was a fake.The numerous references to Trump include an email that suggests he travelled onboard Epstein’s private jet with women who would have been possible witnesses to the case against Epstein’s accomplice,Ghislaine Maxwell.The email – sent by the US attorney for the southern district of New York on 7 January 2020 – has the subject “Epstein flight records”.It reads: “For your situational awareness, wanted to let you know that the flight records we received yesterday reflect that Donald Trump travelled on Epstein’s private jet many more times than previously has been reported (or that we were aware), including during the period we would expect to charge in a Maxwell case.“In particular, he is listed as a passenger on at least eight flights between 1993 and 1996, including at least four flights on which Maxwell was also present. He is listed as having travelled with, among others and at various times, Marla Maples, his daughter Tiffany, and his son Eric.“On one flight in 1993, he and Epstein are the only two listed passengers; on another, the only three passengers are Epstein, Trump, and then-20-year-old REDACTED.“On two other flights, two of the passengers, respectively, were women who would be possible witnesses in a [Ghislaine] Maxwell case.”Throughout his most recent presidential campaign, Trump vowed to release Epstein-related files. This summer, his administration prompted backlash after the justice department announced it would not release any files related to the late financier, and said it had found “no incriminating client list” despite earlier claims from Pam Bondi, the attorney general, that such a document was sitting on her desk.The announcement sparked bipartisan outrage – including from some Trump supporters – and reignited scrutiny of Epstein’s past ties to Trump, with whom he was friendly for at least 15 years before falling out in 2004. The president has consistently denied any knowledge of or involvement in Epstein’s criminal activities and has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.On Tuesday, the justice departmentsaid in a statementthat it had released nearly 30,000 more pages of documents related to Epstein and that “some of these documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election”.“To be clear: the claims are unfounded and false, and if they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already,” the statement reads. “Nevertheless, out of our commitment to the law and transparency, the DoJ is releasing these documents with the legally required protections for Epstein’s victims.”Epstein was founddead in his cell on 10 August 2019while awaiting trial on federal sex crimes charges in New York. The death wasruled a suicide.In the newbatch of filesof files released by the justice department, there are alsonumerous referencesto Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew.The files also include a photo of an Austrian passport that bears Epstein’s photograph but the name listed is “Marius Fortelni” and the residency is listed as Saudi Arabia. There is also an email exchange from a prosecutor in 2019, which states that the real Fortelni is a real estate developer who, for a time, resided in Saudi Arabia. The email suggests contacting Fortelni.“Ask if he has any reason to know why a passport from his native country with his name on it would have Jeffrey Epstein’s photograph on it and be in a safe in Epstein’s mansion??” the prosecutor writes.In a response email, someone with the “NYPD/FBI Child Exploitation Human Trafficking Task Force” writes: “I will give him a call tomorrow.”Fortelni did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Guardian.Elsewhere in the tranche is extensive correspondence regarding Epstein’s controversial 2007 Florida plea deal to resolve a pending sex crimes prosecution under federal law and the government’s obligation to inform Epstein’s accusers of the deal before its completion.One email, subject titled “RE: Special Master’s Selection of Attorney Representative” and dated 19 October 2007, appears to refer to rape claims lodged by a woman against the magician David Copperfield. The Guardian has previously identified the alleged victim asLacey Carroll. Copperfield claimed in an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2012 that he had been “exonerated” by federal authorities.The email refers to a raid by FBI Seattle and FBI Las Vegas “on a warehouse owned by Epstein’s favorite cohort, David Copperfield, in connection with allegations that Copperfield raped an adult female”.“Copperfield spoke with the girls at Epstein’s home on several occasions and tickets with ‘backstage passes’ were a favorite ‘birthday gift’ for Epstein to give the girls,” it says. The sender and recipient are redacted.Later on Tuesday, the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, released a statement demanding transparency from the justice department: “Buried in the Epstein files is an email disclosing the Department of Justice was looking into at least ten potential Jeffrey Epstein co-conspirators. The Department of Justice needs to shed more light on who was on the list, how they were involved, and why they chose not to prosecute. Protecting possible co-conspirators is not the transparency the American people and Congress are demanding.”Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinDonald TrumpGhislaine MaxwellUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

We shared one thing … our love & caring for young ladies and the hope they reach their full potential.”It continued: “Our president also shares our love of young, nubile girls. When a young beauty walked by he loved to ‘grab snatch’, whereas we ended up snatching grub in the mess halls of the system.”The letter was signed: “Life is unfair. Yours, J. Epstein.”On Tuesday afternoon the DoJposted on X: “The FBI has confirmed this alleged letter from Jeffrey Epstein to Larry Nassar is FAKE.”The post went on to list why the letter was not deemed genuine by the authorities and added: “This fake letter serves as a reminder that just because a document is released by the Department of Justice does not make the allegations or claims within the document factual. Nevertheless, the DOJ will continue to release all material required by law.”Donald Trump, who was president at the time the supposed letter from Epstein was apparently sent, has repeatedly denied any knowledge of or involvement in Epstein’s criminal activities and any wrongdoing.The existence of the letter was first reported in 2023 bythe Associated Pressafter it was discovered in the midst of more than 4,000 pages ofdocumentsheld by the Bureau of Prisons.The letter is postmarked 13 August 2019, notably three days after Epstein died in custody in what was ruled a suicide. It was found by investigators in the jail mail room weeks later after it was returned from a prison in Arizona and marked “no longer at this address”.“It appeared he mailed it out and it was returned back to him,” the investigator told a prison official in an email included in the documents. “I am not sure if I should open it or should we hand it over to anyone?It is unclear if Epstein and Nassar had any relationship.Nassar, the former doctor for the US gymnastics team and Michigan State University, is currently serving a 60-year federal sentence on charges of child sexual abuse images. He was also sentenced in 2018 to a 40-to-175 Michigan state sentence after pleading guilty to seven counts of criminal sexual conduct.At trial, more than 150 women – including Olympic gold medalists Aly Raisman and McKayla Maroney – saidhe sexually abused them.The document comes as questions continue to swirl around Epstein’s death in custody, with his brother, Mark Epstein, continuing to maintain that the sex offender was murdered in his cell.It has also been suggested that Epstein blamed his former friend Donald Trump for his 2019 arrest on sex-trafficking charges, which came more than a decade after he was granted immunity from prosecution under a 2007 Florida state plea deal where he pleaded guilty to solicitation of a minor.In a statement from the Department of Justice about the release of the latest tranche of Epstein-related documents, itsaid: “Some of these documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election. To be clear: the claims are unfounded and false, and if they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.

However, he appears as a full executor in later versions, dated 2013 and 2014. Summers is also named in the 2014 will as a successor executor, the filings show.Neither Summers nor Staley are in what appears to be the final version of Epstein’s will in 2019. The well-connected financierdied in prisonin August 2019 while awaiting trial over child sex trafficking charges.View image in fullscreenLarry Summers, left, and his wife, Elisa, in a recently released photo from the House oversight committee.Photograph: APThe newly released filings will raise further questions about the depth of the two men’s relationships with Epstein, with Staley having already been banned from the UK banking sector for playing down his relationship with the convicted child sex offender.Summers, an economist and former US Treasury secretary, stepped down from ateaching role at Harvardin November after a previous tranche of documents suggested he stayed in contact with Epstein well into 2019 and ceased shortly before Epstein was arrested in July of that year.During a tribunal hearing in the spring in which Staley attempted to overturn his ban from the UK financial sector, he was asked whether he was a “trustee” of Epstein’s estate and said he “declined it and refused to be a trustee”.He later also told the tribunal “I refused to be executor to his estate”, according to court transcripts. While an executor is responsible for executing a plan laid out in a will, a trustee is responsible for managing and distributing assets.The Financial Conduct Authority’s original investigation, triggered by a cache of more than 1,200 emails between Staley and Epstein, concluded that the pair were“indeed close”and had a relationship that “went beyond one that was professional in nature”.Staleystepped downas Barclays chief executive in 2021 after the FCA’s investigation became public and he was banned from the UK financial sector in 2023.A spokesperson for Summers said: “Mr Summers had absolutely no knowledge that he was included in an early version of Epstein’s will and had no involvement in his financial matters or the administration of his estate.”The Guardian approached representatives for Staley for comment.Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinJes StaleyLarry SummersBarclaysnewsShareReuse this content"

The supreme court is currently weighing legal challenges to those levies.“The TARIFFS are responsible for the GREAT USA Economic Numbers JUST ANNOUNCED…AND THEY WILL ONLY GET BETTER! Also, NO INFLATION & GREAT NATIONAL SECURITY. Pray for the US Supreme Court!!! President DJT,”Trump wroteon Truth Social.The summer surge was offset by more bad news on consumer confidence. The Conference Board’s closely watched gauge of consumersentiment fellin December for the fifth month in a row, the longest consecutive fall since 2008.The GDP figures will further complicate the decision-making of the Federal Reserve. The Fed announced its third interest rate cut of the year earlier this month amid signs of a weakening jobs market but isdividedabout how it should proceed.The Fed’s dual mandate is to maintain price stability while maximising employment. Inflation remains stubbornly above its 2% yearly target – supporting the argument that rates should stay high to bring down prices – but the cracks in the job market suggest lower rates might help keep unemployment from rising.The Fed’s decisions is also clouded by a lack of data. As has been the case with other key economic reports, the latest GDP figures had been held back by the government shutdown, which lasted from 1 October to 12 November and furloughed government workers, including those responsible for collecting economic data.chartThe US economy has demonstrated resilience in a year of extraordinary challenges. Trump announced sweeping tariffs in April on the US’s major trading partners and while he has watered down or rolled back many of the levies, the uncertainty they have caused has rattled businesses and consumers.The US economycontractedin the first quarter of 2025 as businesses tried to get ahead of Trump’s threatened tariffs with an unprecedented surge in imports. But GDP growth soon recovered, spurred on by massive investment in artificial intelligence and robust consumer spending.In a note to investors, Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at CapitalEconomics, wrote: “The economy maintains considerable momentum. That said, the shutdown could trigger a slowdown in the fourth quarter to nearer 2% annualised.”Explore more on these topicsUS economyEconomicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

But now, when it comes to Bari Weiss as the editor in chief ofCBSNews, there is no longer any doubt.A broadcast-news neophyte, Weiss has no business in that exalted role. She proved that beyond any remaining doubt last weekend, pulling a powerful and important piece of journalism just days before it was due to air, charging that it wasn’t ready. Whatever her claims about the story’s supposed flaws, this looks like a clear case of censorship-by-editor to protect the interests of powerful, rich and influential people.The tug-of-war over CNN shows how dysfunctional US media has become | Margaret SullivanRead moreThe 60 Minutes piece – about the brutal conditions at an El Salvador prison where theTrump administrationhas sent Venezuelan migrants without due process – had already been thoroughly edited, fact-checked and sent through the network’s standards desk and its legal department. The story was promoted and scheduled, and trailers for it were getting millions of views.I’m less bothered by the screw-ups in this situation – for example, the segment is already all over the internet as, essentially, a Canadian bootleg – than I am by her apparent willingness to use her position to protect the powerful and take care of business for the oligarchy. Which appears to be precisely what she was hired to do.Journalism is supposed to “afflict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted”, but Weiss seems to have it backwards.I can’t know what’s in her mind, of course, but I know her actions – her gaslighting about how it would be such a disservice to the public to publish this supposedly incomplete piece, and her ridiculous offer to provide a storied reporting staff with a couple of phone numbers of highly placed Trump officials.Weiss insists that the story needs Trump administration comment before it can run.But correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi has argued – eloquently and persuasively – that 60 Minutes repeatedly sought substantive comment and was turned down. In a memorable phrase, Alfonsi charges that if that’s an acceptable reason for spiking a story, it’s tantamount to giving the government a “kill switch” for any story they don’t like. Just refuse to comment, and it dies on the vine.It is also nonsensical of Weiss to suggest – again, gaslighting – that the piece somehow lacked sufficient newsworthiness because other news organizations had reported on the prison earlier.As if to counter this specious claim, a federal judge this week ordered the Trump administration to submit plans to return the migrants to the US or give them a hearing. This story is hardly old news.What’s more, hearing directly from an abused migrant on camera, getting his description of the torture and seeing the images of inhumane treatment is striking and newsworthy. TV brings it home, quite literally.Again, I don’t know what’s inside Weiss’s head – but I do know the context. In an unusual chain of command, Weiss reports directly to David Ellison, the son of Larry Ellison, a Trump buddy and one of the world’s richest people.The Ellisons control CBS’s parent company, Paramount Skydance, which is making an aggressive effort to buy Warner Brothers Discovery. They would have to overcome an offer from Netflix that has already been accepted.How? Well, federal regulators (and therefore Trump, who has expressed his interest) would, naturally, have some sway over who succeeds.The Ellisons surely wouldn’t want to antagonize anyone at this critical moment. And notably, if Paramount prevails, they would control CNN, and could do there what they’re doing at CBS News – they could install new editorial leadership that’s more agreeable. Trump has complained bitterly for years about CNN; this matters to him.Conveniently, there’s a blueprint available for how to cozy up to Trump by buckling. A few months ago, as an earlier Paramount merger was on the line, the company chose to settle a frivolous legal claim by Trump over 60 Minutes’ routine editing of a pre-election interview with Kamala Harris.Stephen Colbert, you might recall, termed this a “big, fat bribe”. Then his late-night show was canceled, effective next spring. Ratings, don’t you know?Bari Weiss is a weird and worrisome choice as top editor for CBS News | Margaret SullivanRead moreTrump received his settlement along with a side order of bragging rights, and a few weeks later, the Paramount merger went through. Yes, everybody got theirs – except the public and the CBS News staff.As editor in chief, of course, Weiss has the power to make the decision she did. That comes with the job.But it doesn’t make her decision right. It wasn’t. She’s damaged the institution she’s supposed to be the steward of and, far less importantly, hurt her own reputation. Inadvertently, she has also made sure that far more people are aware of this story, and the horrible underlying situation, than if the story had simply run as planned.At this point, Weiss ought to cut her losses, green-light the piece, and try to start acting like an editor – not like a cog in the machine of authoritarian politics and oligarchy.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsCBSOpinionTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

The Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) has estimated that it costs the sector £4m a week.The shake-up has forced some of the biggest manufacturers to freeze or scale back production. Diageo, the FTSE 100 drinks group behind a number of whiskies such as Johnnie Walker, Talisker and Lagavulin, has reduced production at some of its malt distilleries to “balance capacity against current demand”.The company has scaled back production at some distilleries from seven days a week to five, with operations paused at Teaninich Distillery in the Scottish Highlands. It has also halted production at its Roseisle Maltings site in north-eastScotlanduntil at least June 2026, with future production under review.Diageo’s proposed redevelopment of its Talisker distillery on the Isle of Skye is also uncertain. Its full planning application is awaiting permission from the local council, although it is understood the company does not currently have definitive investment plans for the area.A spokesperson for Diageo said it remained “confident and committed to the long-term growth of scotch whisky” but was managing capacity after a period of sustained investment and stock buildup.This year the SWA warned that US tariffs are costing the sector almost £20m a month in lost sales, and more than 1,000 jobs.Overall scotch sales in the US, the biggest market for the drink, fell 6% in the first nine months of 2025, according to IWSR. That was an improvement on a 9% fall in 2024, but well below growth rates in 2020, when sales rose by 4%.Luke Tegner, of IWSR, added that a broader decline in alcohol consumption was also feeding the slump.“Scotch has had a boom in the last 35 years,” he said. “But more recently it has been hit by tariffs, by affordability and by people moderating how much they drink.”In August, a poll by Gallup found the share of Americans who say they consumealcohol was at its lowestin nearly 90 years, at 54%.“But the scotch industry is very creative – it will find a way out of it,” Tegner added. “We are still forecasting growth by the end of the decade.”In the meantime, some producers are investing in extra storage space to house unsold stock. International Beverage, which owns scotch brands Old Pulteney, Speyburn and Balblair, spent £7m this year on six new warehouses, adding capacity for 60,000 casks.In the US, other distilleries have cut back on production: the bourbon brand Jim Beam, which is owned by the Japanese drinks company Suntory Group, has said it willshut down production at its main site in Kentucky for all of 2026.While the market for scotch has been weaker this year, the broader whisky market has been more resilient, with volumes up 3% in the first half, according to IWSR.Explore more on these topicsWhiskyAlcoholScotlandTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

It said Ryanair had prevented online travel agents from selling tickets on its flights in combination with other airlines and services, weakening competition.Ryanair said it would immediately appeal against the “legally flawed” ruling.The Ryanair chief executive,Michael O’Leary, had decided to wage war on what hedescribed as “pirate” travel agents, such as Booking.com, Kiwi and Kayak. O’Leary accused the travel agent industry of scamming and ripping off unsuspecting consumers by charging extra fees and markups on ticket prices.O’Leary was prepared to accept lower ticket sales as he tried to prevent travel agents from selling tickets, forcing their passengers to fill out extra forms supposedly as a security measure. The abrupt removal of Ryanair flights from agents’ websites in late 2023caused a drop in sales for the airline.The lower salesdented Ryanair’s profits, although they have not prevented the Irish airline from rising to a record valuation of €31bn (£27bn). That has made it the world’s second most valuable airline, behind only the US’s Delta Air Lines.O’Leary – who is known for his combative and often sweary criticisms of airports, rivals and regulators – is planning to hand over control of the business to a successor within the next five to 10 years. He will begiven shares worth €111m(£97m) if he stays at the airline until the end of July 2028. He was already a billionaire on paper because of his shareholding.Responding to the ruling, O’Leary said it was “an affront to consumer protection and competition law”.He added: “The internet and the ryanair.com website have enabled Ryanair to distribute directly to consumers, and Ryanair has passed on these 20% cost savings in the form of the lowest air fares inItalyand Europe.“Ryanair looks forward to successfully overturning this legally flawed ruling and its absurd €256m fine in the courts.”The vast majority of Ryanair’s sales took place through its website even before the battle against online travel agents. However, the Italian authority said Ryanair had been guilty of “abuse of a dominant position” and using its “significant market power” in trying to stamp out the business.Ryanair’s tactics included rolling out facial recognition procedures for people who bought tickets via a third party, claiming that was necessary for security. It then “totally or intermittently blocked booking attempts by travel agencies”, including by blocking payment methods and mass-deleting accounts.The airline then “imposed partnership agreements” on agencies that banned sales of Ryanair flights in combinations with other carriers, and blocked bookings to force them to sign up. Only in April this year did it allow agencies’ websites to link up with its own services, allowing effective competition.The competition authority said Ryanair’s actions had “blocked, hindered or made such purchases more difficult and/or economically or technically burdensome when combined with flights operated by other carriers and/or other tourism and insurance services”.Explore more on these topicsRyanairMichael O'LearyAirline industryIrelandItalyEuropeRegulatorsnewsShareReuse this content"

But Marc Guéhi had other ideas and his goal in the fifth minute of stoppage time took this rematch of last year’s quarter-final to penalties. The first 15 were all successful before the unfortunate Lacroix saw his spot kick saved by Kepa Arrizabalaga to sendArsenalthrough by the skin of their teeth.“We conceded the goal and it was emotionally tough to accept after the way the game went,” said a relieved Arteta. “But I think the margin should have been much bigger. That should have been three or four and then you’re not worried about what happens in the last minute.”Of the two sides it was Arsenal who had fared better from Palace’s request to reschedule this game because of their European commitments, with Arteta able to make eight changes to the team who held their nerve in the win away at Everton on Saturday night. But just like last year at this stage against Palace, it needed the arrival of big guns Martin Ødegaard and Bukayo Saka after half-time to finally find the breakthrough before Guéhi’s late equaliser.“I’m delighted with the second-half performance today, especially after the first-half performance, it was really bad,” said Glasner. “For us it’s important to build on the second-half performance and also show great character again.”View image in fullscreenMarc Guéhi slides home an equaliser in the 95th minute to take the quarter-final to penalties.Photograph: Alex Pantling/Getty ImagesThe Palace manager admitted in the buildup that he had no choice but to select virtually an identical side to the one who were hammered by Leeds on Saturday night, although teenager Jaydee Canvot started in an unfamiliar role at right wingback and was given a torrid time by Gabriel Martinelli. To underline just how hectic things have been for Palace, this was Guéhi’s 31st start of the campaign already for club and country. By contrast, Gabriel Jesus has had to wait 345 days for his first since suffering an ACL injury against Manchester United in January. The timing of that was particularly cruel given that the Brazil striker had been on a hot run of form that was kickstarted by his hat-trick against Palace in this competition. It was apt that he should bring up a century of appearances for Arsenal against the same opponents.The jury is still very much out on Arsenal’s £64m signing Viktor Gyökeres so Jesus must have sensed an opportunity to impress and would have capped his performance with a goal had it not been for Benítez.A free signing from PSV Eindhoven in the summer, the Argentine has had to play second fiddle to Dean Henderson but he showed he is a more than able deputy. He was called into action in the third minute when Martinelli set up Noni Madueke, although the England forward could only shoot weakly. Tyrick Mitchell fired over after a brilliant pass around the corner from Jean-Philippe Mateta but that was as close as Palace would come in the first half as Arsenal cranked up the pressure.Martinelli was off target when they failed to clear a corner before Madueke forced Benítez into another save. Not for the last time, Canvot was left for dead by Martinelli when he delivered a cross on to the forehead of Jesus but again the Palace goalkeeper was up to the task. Only a last-ditch clearance from Richards denied Jesus another sight of goal as Arsenal kept knocking on the door with an onslaught of long throws and set pieces.View image in fullscreenWalter Benítez concedes an own goal scored by Crystal Palace’s Maxence Lacroix.Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty ImagesPalace conceded four against Leeds but were somehow able to stand firm until half-time thanks to some heroic defending and Arsenal’s wastefulness. It was no surprise to see Canvot hooked for the vastly more experienced Nathaniel Clyne. Palace immediately looked more competitive and began the second half with renewed belief. There was a long delay when Richards was carried off after trying to challenge Jesus for a header that went inches wide, which will be of major concern for Palace given their busy schedule. He ended up watching the penalty shootout on crutches but the American’s departure was the precursor to a dramatic finale.Arsenal needed William Saliba to slide in and take the ball off Mateta’s toe before the resulting corner was blocked on the line. At the other end, Benítez saved yet again from Jesus and the ball was eventually deflected past the despairing goalkeeper off Lacroix’s toe after more pinball in the box. Palace looked totally deflated but somehow found a way back when Guéhi tapped in after Jefferson Lerma won a header from Adam Wharton’s free-kick. Declan Rice could have won it even later but was once again denied by Benítez, with even more drama reserved for an epic shootout.Explore more on these topicsCarabao CupArsenalCrystal Palacematch reportsShareReuse this content"

The rule goes into effect on 1 July 2026.One of the first players who could potentially benefit from the new rule is Washington Spirit forward Trinity Rodman, who reportedlyhas received lucrative offers from teams in Europe.“Ensuring our teams can compete for the best players in the world is critical to the continued growth of our league,” NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman said. “The High Impact Player Rule allows teams to invest strategically in top talent, strengthens our ability to retain star players, and demonstrates our commitment to building world-class rosters for fans across the league.”Trinity Rodman: why US soccer could lose its most compelling star to EuropeRead moreThe rule increases league-wide spending by up to $16m in 2026 and up to $115m over the term of the current collective bargaining agreement.“These investments represent intentional, deliberate action to address an increasingly competitive global market for top players, while expanding clubs’ overall capacity to invest across their rosters,” the NWSL said in a news release.However, the proposal has received pushback from the NWSL Players Association, who said it will take action “to enforce the rights of the players we represent.”In a statement, the union said: “Under federal labor law, changes to compensation under the salary cap are a mandatory subject of bargaining – not a matter of unilateral discretion. Fair pay is realized through fair, collectively bargained compensation systems, not arbitrary classifications.“A league that truly believes in the value of its Players would not be afraid to bargain over it.“The NWSLPA has put forward a clear, lawful alternative: raising the Team Salary Cap to compete in a global labor market.“Additionally, we have proposed that through collective bargaining, we work together to create a system for projecting revenue sharing numbers in future years so that Teams and Players can negotiate multi-year deals with certainty. The Union remains ready and willing to engage in good-faith bargaining.”Under the league’s new proposal, players must meet at least one of the following sporting or commercial criteria in order to meet the definition of a “high-impact player”:– Player is selected in the Top 40 ofthe Guardian Top 100 football players in the worldin the two years prior.– Player is on SportsPro Media’s Top 150 most marketable athletes within one year prior to the current league season.– Player is selected in the Top 30 in Ballon d’Or voting in the two years prior to the current league season.– Player is selected in the Top 40 of ESPN FC Top 50 football players in the world in the two years prior.– Player is in the top 11 in minutes played for the US women’s national team in the prior two calendar years for field players for all competition types.– Player ranks first in minutes played for USWNT in the prior two calendar years for goalkeepers for all competition types.– Player selected as NWSL MVP finalist within the previous two league seasons.– Player selected to the end-of-year NWSL Best XI first team within the previous two league seasons.The $1m threshold will increase year-over-year at the same base rate as the league’s salary cap. The additional allotment can be applied to a single player or distributed among multiple players. The cap charge of the high-impact player(s) must be a minimum of 12% of the base salary cap.The NWSL salary cap in 2025 was $3.5 million following adjustments for revenue sharing.Explore more on these topicsNWSLUSA women's football teamWomen's footballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Everything is private. I’ve got nothing further to add.”NBA moves closer to launching European men’s league with FibaRead moreThe incident came days after Green was ejected in Saturday’s game against Phoenix for consecutive technicals.“Tempers spilled over and I just thought it was best that I get out of there,” Green said after Monday’s game. “I don’t think there was a situation where it was going to get better so it was just best to remove myself. That’s it.”Green said he would have been happy to reenter the game after his break in the locker room but Kerr chose not to send him back on to court.“I thought I owed it to my teammates to be there. I’m not going to quit on my teammates,” he said.Golden State’s 15-15 record is hardly what this group expected at this stage of the season, and Green noted “that’s probably why tempers are flaring.”“Basketball, it’s what we do,” he said of what caused the frustration. “We play basketball, it’s an emotional game. People lose their emotions sometimes, it happens … I just thought that was best for me [to go to the locker room]”.Stephen Curry said he believed Kerr and Green were “just having a good conversation” before the forward left for the locker room. Curry added: “That’s kind of for them to talk about, not me … I’m pretty sure we know how to be professional.”Warriors guard Brandin Podziemski said Green “was a great teammate on the bench” after coming back.Asked if he thinks the issue will linger, Kerr said: “No.”“The group’s ready to go, you could see in the game tonight,” Kerr said. “We need Draymond. He’s a champion. We’ve been together for a long time. All we can do is the rest of the group keep pushing, keep getting better. I thought this was one of our better games. I thought the first half was brilliant – we just didn’t make shots. I thought Draymond played great.”Green has been with the Warriors for his entire career, since the team drafted him in 2012. Kerr has been his head coach since 2014, and they have won fourNBAchampionships together.“We’ve been at this now for a long time,” Green said. “Sometimes you’re with people for a long time and there’s a level of comfort and shit happens.

He joinedthe rival tour in 2022and won five events over four seasons – he was also the first LIV player to win a major atthe 2023 PGA Championship.LIVGolfposted an announcement to its website under a statement that Talor Gooch is the new captain of the Smash team that Koepka had led. Scott O’Neil, the new CEO of LIV, said Koepka and LIV “amicably and mutually agreed” that Koepka will no longer compete after the 2025 season.“Brooks is prioritising the needs of his family and staying closer to home,” O’Neil said. “We appreciate the significant impact he has had on the game and wish him continued success, both on and off the course.”ThePGA Tourpolicy banning players who have joined the rival league requires them to sit out for one year from their last participation. Koepka began his career on the European tour and would have access to play there. LIV ended its season on 24 August.The PGA Tour, while not offering any substance, took the rare step of acknowledging the move involving a player no longer a member. “Brooks Koepka is a highly accomplished professional, and we wish him and his family continued success,” the tour said in a statement. “The PGA Tour continues to offer the best professional golfers the most competitive, challenging and lucrative environment in which to pursue greatness.”“Brooks Koepka will be stepping away from LIV Golf,” read a statement from Koepka’s representatives. “Family has always guided Brooks’ decisions, and he feels this is the right moment to spend more time at home.“Brooks remains passionate about the game of golf and will keep fans updated on what’s ahead,” the statement concluded.Explore more on these topicsBrooks KoepkaLIV Golf SeriesGolfPGA TournewsShareReuse this content"

In a building across the way, Zvonimir Boban is explaining what brought him back. We are eating squid ink risotto in one corner of a room now configured as Dinamo Zagreb’s canteen; diagonally opposite is the spot where, fighting through the club’s youth system, a young arrival from Dalmatia used to sleep. “Emotionally it’s the biggest story of my life, this one,” Boban says, memories of this former dormitory leaping into his mind’s eye. “Where, if not here?”He has, in some shape or form, been almost everywhere else. Boban has burned brightly but briefly in each of his various lives as a football administrator. The sport would look different were it not for his influence in senior roles at Fifa and Uefa across the past decade. Almost two years have passed since his high-profile resignation from the latter and there was always the sense Boban, opinionated and deeply principled, had further rungs to climb.Instead his world has, in contrasting ways, both shrunk and grown. The policymaking clout he held in Zurich and Nyon is no more; neither of those posts, though, came with the persistent public gaze and criticism that are part of the package as Dinamo president. The day’s newspapers pay testament to that with some scathing commentaries after a 3-1 Europa League defeat by Real Betis here the previous evening. “They say Jesus was a good man,” he says. “Better than any of us, that’s clear, no? They crucified him, so who are we not to be crucified in our everyday life?”View image in fullscreenZvonimir Boban describes the award of the Fifa ‘peace prize’ to Donald Trump as ‘disrespectful and irresponsible’.Photograph: Borut Peterlin/Panos/The GuardianThe sentence is typical Boban: a rhetorical force who swept back in six months ago, initially as CEO before becoming president via Dinamo’s first fully democratic election in September, to reshape the club he captained at 19 before leaving for Milan 34 years ago. The plan is to galvanise an institution still tarred and scarred by the scandal-hit reign of the former chief executive Zdravko Mamic. He is undertaking the challenge without receiving a salary.“All my life I was proclaiming love for Dinamo, for these people, for this city, for my country,” he says. “Then, at the moment when they are giving you the opportunity, will you say: ‘No, I’m 57, actually I’ll sit and rest on an island watching the sea and fishing’? If I didn’t do this it would be a betrayal of every value I have lived for.”During three hours spent around Maksimir he will outline his vision but there are elephants to clear from the room, too. The most obvious isthat stormy departure from Uefa, where he had been chief of football for almost three years, in January 2024. Boban felt Aleksander Ceferin had been out of line in proposing statute changes, subsequently passed, that would allow Ceferin to run for a fourth term of presidency. At the time he criticised Ceferin’s “personal aspirations”; in response, Ceferin told the Guardian that Boban “does not deserve my comment”.Boban, winner of four Serie A titles and the 1994 Champions League with Milan, had been an influential, if sometimes frustrated, ex-player’s voice among the bureaucrats. So, any regrets? “I’m just sorry for the personal relationship with Aleksander, I’m sorry that this is what happened.” They have not spoken since. “We had a very nice relationship in these few years, and with the family as well. But I did what I had to do and I explained it very well. He chose his way, that’s it, and I wish him only the best.“But I’m not regretting anything, not at all. I thought for two months before doing that. I didn’t react like a kid, like a spoiled child. I thought a lot. I took my time and left time for others to think as well. Everyone will live with their own decisions and their own consequences: myself, and others as well.”View image in fullscreenZvonimir Boban in action for Milan in October 2000.Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Allsport/Getty ImagesHe believes he would still be at Uefa had that rift not opened up. But it would have felt inauthentic to bottle up his grievances, just as it would when in March 2020, nine months into a spell as Milan’s chief football officer, he criticised their ownership in an interview that effectively forced his dismissal.It begs the question of how he would have reacted if still in situ at Fifa, where he was deputy secretary general between 2016 and 2019 before joining Milan. Boban operated alongside Gianni Infantino to transform what, during that tenure, he said had previously been a “scared and lost organisation”. He stands firmly by their body of work, launching into a sprawling defence of the video assistant refereeing project to which he was fundamental. Lots of analysis, he thinks, neglects to point out the role VAR has in making it harder to corrupt the outcome of a game.“The integrity and transparency of football are now completely different,” he says. A rapid-fire recital of figures and statistics follows, contrasting the time lost through VAR interventions with the seven and a half minutes per game occupied by throw-ins.Surely he would have walked, back then, in the event Infantino had pulled any of the stunts that have defined recent years at Fifa. Boban pulls few punches when addressingthe “peace prize” for Donald Trumpwith which Infantino hijacked the 2026 World Cup finals draw.“Disrespectful and irresponsible,” he says of his former boss’s actions. “I couldn’t watch it. I was surprised he started to think in this way, too political, obsessed with the politicians and all those stories.“At the beginning it wasn’t like this. Everything was about football and footballers. We had to bring Fifa back in that direction and were doing it. Later, it has started to go in a different way. Gianni has always been accountable and very responsible, but he isn’t aware of what he is doing to himself and Fifa now. Thinking to do the best, but doing completely the opposite. It shouldn’t be a political organisation but now you’re doing this, it’s shameful.“None of this can deny all the good things he’s done, and not because I was there. But on the other hand it shows that the way is lost. At least that’s how everything has been presented with this ridiculous piece of work. And I’m sorry for that. Sorry for Fifa, sorry for him, sorry for football.”We have gone back over to Boban’s office and in walks Albert Capellas, appointed by him to head up Dinamo’s academy in June, for a brief introduction. Capellas spent more than a decade working with Barcelona’s youth and B sides. Boban’s plan is to blend a La Masia-style methodology with the heart that has helped launch scores of Croatian footballers to greatness.View image in fullscreenZvonimir Boban next to a tactics board at the Maksimir Stadion: ‘Emotionally it’s the biggest story of my life, this one.’Photograph: Borut Peterlin/Panos/The Guardian“We would like to have one of the best football schools in Europe and I believe that, in a few years’ time, we will have it,” Boban says. “So that everyone knows that, if they are thinking about taking a player from Dinamo, it is an educated player.”He thinks Dinamo can become a credible stop for youngsters from bigger leagues who need to refine their competitive edge. The 20-year-old Sergi Domínguez – “one of the best young defenders in the world, if not the best” – arrived from Barcelona during pre-season in a notable yield from the relationship. Dani Olmo once beat a similar path. Cardoso Varela, a former Porto winger who has just turned 17, is widely expected to swap Zagreb for the Camp Nou next.Boban’s conviction is hypnotic. But can such methods be enough to make teams such as Dinamo competitive in a sport whose elite are unmoored and disappearing over the horizon? “I believe in time we can do it,” he says, citing Atalanta as the model of a club driven by smart decisions.He will not broach criticism of the swollen new European competition formats, which he believes Uefa has executed well. Many inside the corridors of power would acknowledge it was Boban, in one of his most persistent set-tos with the executive committee, who talked the new Champions League down from a 10-game group format to its current eight. Similarly, Boban was one of the Club World Cup’s chief proponents while at Fifa but had pushed for a tournament limited to 24 entrants played over 18 days, with three-team groups and knockout games going straight to penalties if drawn. He embarks upon a long denunciation of its present form. “Thirty-two teams and 30 days, you are killing the players,” he says.Boban warms to his themes, among them what he sees as “another killer element” in the form of extra time, while puffing on a cigar. It is impossible not to fear he has been lost too soon to those guiding the game’s direction. Ceferin may well run unopposed for his next Uefa term in 2027 and, even in a largely sewn-up political climate, Boban would have backers. Wouldn’t he be tempted to give it a crack?View image in fullscreenZvonimir Boban holds off Gheorghe Hagi during Croatia’s win over Romania at the 1998 World Cup.Photograph: Lionel Cironneau/AP“No, no. I know, I know. There are people, a lot of them, they call me often. But this was the first real station of my football life and it will be the last. And it’s the one I love most, respect most. It’s an emotion that I can’t bring anywhere else. So what else can there be? What more?”By now the Maksimir pitch is obscured by fog. Somewhere out there, in May 1990, Boban became a national hero when he launched a flying kick at a policeman as violence erupted during a match between Dinamo and Red Star Belgrade. Contrary to some interpretations it did not, by a long chalk, spark the bloody Yugoslav wars but overnight he became a towering icon of Croatian resistance. Croatia declared independence the following year.“It was a collective moment, not mine. A collective moment of the Croatian youth who had never felt so much injustice and were rallying towards a Croatian cause. We were rebels, a resistance, but the real heroes are the guys who fought in the war for our freedom. It is much, much bigger than me.You can read a million books or get a million diplomas but I’m a football player in my soul“I was proud of us that day, proud of the young people and how we reacted. What were we looking for? Freedom. We did the right thing. It was nothing about nationalism, nothing about hatred between Croatia and Serbia, simply justice and freedom.”Long before Fifa called Boban had completed a history degree, become a journalist, developed business interests. “Maybe the events at the time in former Yugoslavia pushed me towards studying,” he says. What did he learn? “That people don’t change a lot. What’s changing is our surroundings, the forms and materials. Ancient Greeks lived the same doubts, problems and fears as we do today.”And nothing could ever change Boban. “You can read a million books or get a million diplomas but I’m a football player in my soul,” he says.Sometimes he grabs a pair of boots and travels to the academy pitches with Capellas. There is not much cartilage in the knees but he will join in with the under-14s or under-15s; an attempt to live with the under-17s proved a step too far.“What they see now can’t inspire them too much,” he says. “I never defend, always the joker. But since I was four or five, I thought if I had one mission in this world it was to play football. And with the best part of my heart, I’m still that kid.”Explore more on these topicsDinamo ZagrebEuropean club footballCroatiainterviewsShareReuse this content"

The clause is made up of a £60m fixed fee and £5m in add-ons. Nothing has been agreed yet.João Pedro rescues Chelsea draw as Newcastle squander two-goal leadRead moreChelsea explored the conditions of a deal on Tuesday and sought information on the Ghanaian’s wage demands. They quickly withdrew their interest, having decided they are content with their current attacking options, and have left it to rival clubs to agree terms with Semenyo.Liverpool have tracked Semenyo for a while and could try to sign a forward afterlosing Alexander Isak to a broken leg. United have long held an interest in the 25-year-old and have made an attempt to lure him. As it stands, though, City appear the likeliest to win the race. Rival clubs believe that Semenyo, who has eight goals and three assists in the Premier League this season, will join Pep Guardiola’s side and boost their title chances. Semenyo has already rebuffed interest from Tottenham.Bournemouth signed Semenyo from Bristol City two years ago and have seen him develop into one of the best players in England. Andoni Iraola hopes to keep Semenyo for the rest of the season but Bournemouth have show they arenot averse to selling their best players.“I understand that there is a lot of noise around Antoine,” Iraola, said. “If you ask me, I don’t want to lose him, definitely don’t want to lose him. But like we always say, every time the market opens, you never know what’s going to happen.“He has had moments where he hasn’t scored and has still been very valuable for us. At the end, we demand not only the numbers, but he gives us a lot of things.

The confidence that he has in that huddle ... from A to Z, he does it at a really high level. I say it all the time. He’s a godsend.”The Jacksonville Jaguars aren’t a punchline any more – they’re a problemRead moreThe 49ers (11-4) won their fifth straight to stay in the chase for the NFC’s top seed, one day after clinching a playoff spot by virtue of Detroit’s loss to Pittsburgh. San Francisco also snapped a five-game losing streak in the series, beating Indy for the first time sinceJim Mora’s infamous “playoffs” rantin November 2001.But 44-year-old Rivers sure didn’t make it easy on San Francisco in his second game back after a five-year layoff. He was 23 of 35 for 277 yards, two TDs and the one interception. The Colts (8-7) have lost five straight overall and six of their last seven as their playoff hopes continue to fade.“I’m torn on how to express it, because it’s been a blast,” Rivers said as he contemplated Monday’s loss. “It’s been a blast to prepare and to … get ready and go out there and warm up and do all that with these guys again. But, again, the name of the game is not go have a good time. It’s help find a way to lead your team to a win. And we’ve come up short.”The Colts’ loss clinched playoff spots for Buffalo, Jacksonville and the Chargers.Rivers opened the scoring with a 20-yard TD pass to Alec Pierce, who had four receptions for 86 yards and two scores. Purdy countered with a 22-yard scoring pass to Demarcus Robinson.After the Colts fumbled away the ensuing kickoff, Purdy hooked up with McCaffrey for a two-yard TD pass to make it 14-7 late in the first quarter. Rivers tied the score early in the second by neatly fitting a 16-yard throw to Pierce in a tight window. Purdy broke the tie with an 11-yard touchdown pass to Kittle, who played through an ankle injury.“I don’t think it’s a high ankle sprain,” Kittle, who is set to undergo tests on the injury, said after the game. “We’ll take it one day at a time, and we’ll go from there.”Indy and San Francisco then traded late field goals and Eddie Pineiro’s 64-yard attempt hit the crossbar as time expired.The track meet continued in the second half as Purdy capped the first possession with a 15-yard TD pass to Jauan Jennings, making it 31-17.Jonathan Taylor’s one-yard TD run early in the fourth quarter cut Indy’s deficit to 34-27, but the 49ers sealed it with a nine-yard touchdown pass to McCaffrey with 7:37 to play and Winters’ interception return with 3:26 to play.Explore more on these topicsNFLSan Francisco 49ersIndianapolis ColtsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The Everton manager said he was left “half-choking” when Fulham were awarded what proved to bea match-winning penaltyagainst Nottingham Forest on Monday for Douglas Luiz’s touch on Fulham’s Kevin.Everton were denied a penalty on Saturday for a similar offence by William Saliba on Thierno Barry duringtheir home defeat by Arsenal. Moyes did not criticise the decision at the time but in light of Fulham’s penalty feels the inconsistency of referees can not be ignored.Fulham fell Forest and who’s top of the tree around Europe? – Football WeeklyRead more“I was half-choking last night when I saw the decision given and ours wasn’t,” said theEvertonmanager. “It feels as though certain clubs get those decisions and other clubs don’t. We seem to be on the latter side of that.“There was one earlier in the season at Brentford with [Virgil] van Dijk which was quite similar and I think eventually it was given. We are disappointed it wasn’t given on the night and we are looking at others which have been.”Asked whether he intended to present his case to referee chiefs, Moyes said: “I don’t really know. They don’t make it easy whatever you want. They don’t want to have a conversation about it really. They will have [one], but they don’t want to because they’re finding it probably very difficult to explain things.”Moyes’s concerns are not limited to decisions against his team. He said “the more worrying thing” about Arsenal’s win on Saturday was Sam Barrott, missing the clear handball by Jake O’Brien that produced the decisive penalty, until the video assistant referee recommended a review.View image in fullscreenEverton’s Jake O’Brien gives away a penalty at Arsenal.Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images“Surely the on-field referee didn’t need VAR to decide that Jake had his two hands up in the air?” Moyes said. “And that’s me going against my own team. Why did he need to wait on VAR to make that decision? He had to go to the pitchside monitor. What was the linesman doing on the side? The linesman was behind it where he must have seen his arms going up, but he didn’t make the call.“The point I’m making is that surely they should be making the call. Maybe he didn’t see [William] Saliba kicking, but the consistency comes from those sort of actions – have you seen if he kicked through the back of someone’s leg or he gets there first?“I don’t want to see soft ­penalty kicks. I’m not a believer of soft penalty kicks, maybe that was my ­thinking after the [Arsenal] game, but after what I saw last night, I’m saying: ‘Well, if that’s the way it’s going to be, why are we not getting the same decisions?’”Explore more on these topicsEvertonDavid MoyesRefereesVideo assistant referees (VARs)Laws of footballnewsShareReuse this content"

Tottenham’s head coach said Van de Ven’s attempt to prevent Isak from scoring in Liverpool’s2-1 win at Spurswas the “natural reaction” of a true defender and that his player had spoken to the Sweden international to apologise.Liverpool will be without their record £125m signing “for a couple of months”, Slot confirmed on Tuesday. Isak had surgery on Monday to repair an ankle injury that includes a fractured fibula.Mohamed Salah hits late Afcon winner for Egypt to break brave Zimbabwe at the lastRead moreThe operation went well but Slot remains angry over the challenge that trapped Isak’s left leg and caused the fracture. There is also bewilderment at Liverpool that the tackle went unpunished by the referee, John Brooks, and the video assistant referee, Stuart Attwell, in a game in which Spurs had Xavi Simons and Cristian Romero sent off.“It was a reckless challenge,” Slot said. “I’ve said a lot about the tackle of Xavi Simons, which for me was completely unintentional. I don’t think you will ever get an injury out of a tackle like that. But the tackle of Van de Ven, if you make a tackle like that 10 times, 10 times there is a ­serious chance the player gets a ­serious injury.”In response, Frank strongly defended Van de Ven. “I’m obviously disagreeing in many ways,” the Spurs head coach said. “We are talking about a defender in Micky van de Ven that will do everything he can to avoid the goal.“So it’s a transition. So he’s sprinting back in. There’s a ball slid down the side and he does everything he can to see if he can block that shot. So he’s sliding. Unfortunately, Isak plants his foot straight there and that makes it look worse than it is. I think that would be a natural reaction for any defender.“I’ll put it this way: if my defenders don’t do that, then I don’t think they are true defenders. So I don’t see that at all. Normally, you haven’t seen any reckless challenges from Micky. As I remember it, he’s a very fair and competitive player.“So that’s one thing. The other thing, you also know that the two players have sorted it out. They have spoken. So that’s a good sign of how they sorted it out.”View image in fullscreenArne Slot (left) and Thomas Frank strongly disagreed over the tackle that injured Liverpool’s Alexander Isak.Photograph: Dylan Martinez/ReutersSlot expects Isak to feature before the end of the season but said the injury is a major setback for a player who has endured a difficult start to his Liverpool career. The 26-year-old’s opener against Spurs was only his third goal for the club and his impact has been hindered by fitness problems.Slot said: “I am confident he can play a part in the season. It has been a really challenging and difficult period for him. He joined a new club, he was very excited and you want to show immediately all the qualities that you have. But that was simply impossible.“Maybe no one understands but if you have not trained for three or four months on a serious level with the team and you are playing in this league you need to be on top of your game to impact a game. That took, as we all knew, months before we could bring him there because there was no pre-season, just games, games, games and no time to train.“We always knew it would take him time and that is why he is so unlucky that he is now injured because we all saw with his goal at West Ham, with this goal [against Spurs], that he got closer and closer to the player he was last season at Newcastle.”Conor Bradley was also injured in the win at Spurs and is rated 50-50 by Slot to return against Wolves on Saturday. Cody Gakpo may be involved against the Premier League’s bottom club, having missed the past three games with a muscle problem, but Joe Gomez and Wataru Endo remain on the sidelines.Frank did not want to be drawn on the subject of Fabio Paratici’s future. The Spurs co-sporting director is a target for Fiorentina, who want him to bolster their operation as they languish bottom of Serie A. Paratici returned to Tottenham in October after working as a consultant for the club and has been sharing the sporting director duties with Johan Lange. The Italian is giving serious consideration to Fiorentina.Spurs have announced the departure of one of Frank’s assistant coaches, Matt Wells, who has left to become the head coach of the Colorado Rapids in Major League Soccer. Frank will replace him, although not straight away, and said that in the short term it would be up to his other assistants, Justin Cochrane, Andreas Georgson and Cameron Campbell, to step up.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolArne SlotTottenham HotspurThomas FranknewsShareReuse this content"

It’s also home to Evangelista Sports, a shop that has doubled as a shrine to the city’s soccer-obsessed for more than 40 years and is every bit a part of Montréal’s cultural fabric as poutine or lamenting the cold.It’s also where FC Supra du Québec opted to announce their first-ever signings last week. The Canadian Premier League (CPL) expansion team is looking to become part of the city and province’s cultural identity, hoping their commitment to recruiting a full roster of Québec-born or raised players, inspired by European clubs like Athletic Bilbao, will go a long way in helping to build a pathway which has so often seen talent slip through the cracks.“We needed it, the players needed it, the youth in this province needed it,” says club president and co-founder Rocco Placentino. “We needed to have a CPL team. I know I sound biased because I’m from here but we have a lot of talent in Québec, a lot of talent.”Québec is Canada’s second largest province in terms of population, home to around nine million people. Both the Canadian men’s and women’s national teams are loaded with Québec-born players and many – be it Moïse Bombito, Ismaël Koné, Nathan Saliba, Maxime Crépeau or Mathieu Choinière – will probably be in head coach Jesse Marsch’s squad for the Fifa World Cup this coming summer.Canada’s World Cup draw provides plenty of possibility, but also pitfallsRead moreBut there hasn’t always been a clear pathway for that talent as CF Montréal, now ofMLS, were long the only professional club in the province. Bombito, who Marsch categorized as emblematic of the country’s development system, struggled to find a way to make the jump from the amateur ranks until getting his break outside Québec, with the Colorado Rapids.Placentino says FC Supra will help bridge that gap by providing opportunities for players between Ligue1 Québec, the province’s pro-am league, and MLS. The CPL is also a division one league.“Who’s the next Moïse Bombito? Who’s the next Ismaël Koné? Now, we have a real platform for them,” he says. “We want people to come and watch players born in clubs here that played in Québec or that moved from a different country and played amateur soccer here and now they’re playing pro.”Sean Rea is one of FC Supra’s first signings, announced alongside fellow CPL veterans David Choinière (brother to Los Angeles FC’s Mathieu) and Loïc Kwemi last week. Rea, 23, came up as part of CF Montréal’s academy but the club’s lack of a MLS Next Pro team meant he had to leave home to pursue professional minutes. He went on to spend two years in the CPL on loan before making his debut for Montréal. He then went on trial at the Portland Timbers before signing in Spain and then returning to Canada with the Halifax Wanderers. Now, he’s back home getting ready to play in front of friends and family for the first time since leaving MLS.FC Supra, he says, could provide opportunities he wished he had as a young player coming up in CF Montréal’s academy.View image in fullscreenSean Rea said that a team like FC Supra would have been welcome earlier in his career.Photograph: FC Supra du Quebec“Previously, there was only Montréal’s academy and to get there, you had to go to specific schools.” Rea says. “Talent fell through the cracks because they wouldn’t go to these schools so they couldn’t go to the academy but they’re such talented players you might only hear about them later on … With a team like Supra here, you sign at 18 years old [for CF Montréal] and you can go on loan here and get those minutes. It gives you the opportunity to play. I have no doubt that’s going to be the case going forward, they’re is going to be a lot of loaned players.”Placentino confirms there’s already a good relationship between CF Montréal and FC Supra, adding they’ll take players on loan that meet their criteria. But a larger aspect of their project is providing a platform for young players not in the academy to showcase themselves, with FC Supra having visited eight clubs across the province for open trials. He says there’s lots of room on the roster to give first-time professionals a chance they might not have gotten otherwise. Nearly 400 players have trialed in the last few weeks.“There are so many amazing clubs in our province and Supra wants to help them accomplish [their goals] and build up young stars,” says Placentino.FC Supra’s pre-season will begin in January with trialists buoyed by more experienced players like Rea and Choinière, a former CF Montréaler who filled a trophy cabinet as a member of the Hamilton-based Forge FC. Things will only ramp up as the club announces more signings, sponsorships and unveils their kits in the coming weeks leading up to kickoff.The Canadian Premier League crowns a champion in a blizzardRead moreThere’s already the feeling, Rea notes, that FC Supra are quickly ingraining themselves into the fabric of the city. Little things like honouring the legacy of the original Supra, who played in the former Canadian Professional Soccer League (CPSL) from 1988 to 1992, go a long way in creating a cultural connection.“Everybody knows about the club. Now, it’s our job as players to perform and get even more people on board. There’s people that want to watch soccer here. There’s a big hype in the city, we can already feel it,” says Rea.The hype shouldn’t be surprising given soccer is the sport of choice in the province, with about 170,000 people participating in Soccer Québec programs in 2023. Youth participation nearly doubled that of hockey (139,000 to 75,840) in the same year. And with the additions of the Northern Super League’s Montréal Roses, and now FC Supra, there’s never been more of an appetite – or opportunities – for professional soccer in the city.“When we say it’sun club d’ici, pour ici, it’s not only about soccer. It’s for everything around soccer,” says Placentino. “We can’t wait to start.”Josh Healey is a Canadian soccer journalist based in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia.

Saturday’s defeat at Charlton extended a lean run of one win in 10 matches.Oxford’s chairman, Grant Ferguson, told the club’s website: “Gary joined during a challenging period and deserves immense credit for the hard work and leadership that saw us retain ourChampionshipstatus last season. However, following a disappointing run of results, we have had to take this difficult decision in the best interests of the club.“On behalf of the board, I would like to place on record our thanks to Gary and Mark for their contribution to the football club and to wish them all the best for the future.”Craig Short has taken interim charge with Oxford next in action at home to Southampton on Boxing Day.

The Euros in 2022 saw the whole industry in England develop very exponentially and that’s why here we said on the cost side we would see that growth but the revenue streams have not been parallel, and it was not possible to keep up with the costs. We didn’t have our development in our own hands, it was with the DFB, but it is the clubs investing in the sport, which is why our first big step was to unite as clubs.”View image in fullscreenKatharina Kiel, the president of the new Women’s Bundesliga Association, says German players starting to look abroad was among the reasons for the change.Photograph: Alex Grimm/Getty ImagesBayern Munich have been pioneers in recent years, winning multiple Bundesliga titles and competing in the latter stages of the Champions League. Bianca Rech, a former Bayern player, has worked at the club for almost a decade in various roles, now as a director, and says commercial growth has been high on the agenda when looking at the WSL as an example.“We have clear ideas when it comes to the commercial side to make much more money when it comes to sponsorship,” she says. “The other part is the ability to make our own decisions. We are part of the DFB but don’t have any power, so if the DFB want to do something we have to say yes.“It’s important for us we set some new rules ourselves, around infrastructure, minimum salaries, etc. We did a lot of research and benchmarking against other leagues and we looked at the WSL as a good example of taking charge of itself. We actually worked with an agency in England to help provide examples of how we want it to look.”Rech, like Kiel, believes Germany missed out on capitalising on past successes, such as back-to-back World Cup wins or their multiple European Championship triumphs. That has meant falling behind England and Spain in recent years, with a disastrous 2023 World Cup ending in a group-stage exit.Rech says: “We missed out in 2011 to use the power compared to England in 2022, the celebrations, the fan growth, etc … But now with theEuros coming here in 2029, the development of the game, women’s football is one of the fastest-growing products and we have to make sure we don’t lose track.”Those Euros in 2029 offer a chance to commercialise the sport but Kiel says decisions will not be rushed.“You have to look at certain timelines and when is a good time to bring change into place?” says Kiel. “Our new media cycle begins in 2027-28, so to bring up change for next season would be very, very late for us now.“We’ll use next season to get things sorted, but also to form a group and an organisation which is capable of providing commercially and economically for the clubs and for the league. We have started this month with the foundation but we are in the process of getting everything done and creating the criteria every club can commit to for 2027-28.”On keeping up with the WSL, Kiel says: “We have fallen behind – it is the reality. People try and differentiate between the Bundesliga and Premier League in the men’s game, but the Premier League is so far away. But for us the WSL hasn’t pulled so far away yet.”View image in fullscreenKatharina Kiel, her vice-presidents and delegates of the 14 top-flight clubs after the agreement to split from the DFB was reached.Photograph: Alex Grimm/Getty ImagesThere is belief and excitement that this can spark a new era of success in Germany, with many of the country’s biggest clubs either in the Bundesliga or closing in on it, and the national team still developing top young players who can compete on an international stage.“There’s a huge opportunity in Germany right now,” Rech says. “You look at the league, teams on the way up, Stuttgart, Dortmund, the league will look different, maybe more compatible with the men’s league.”Kiel says: “Most important is the product you see on the field, and everything around that has to be aligned. We want an attractive game, that’s important for us, and from that we will look at all the consequences that are needed.”On whether that could include involvement from the DFB, Kiel says: “We cannot not talk with them because they are running the league now, so there are some negotiations on certain topics, and topics regarding future collaboration are still open.”Get in touchIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please emailmoving.goalposts@theguardian.com.This is an extract from our free email about women’s football, Moving the Goalposts.

Wright had claimed he was definitely going to win this tournament but was left red-faced with Merk, on debut, full value for the win, which denied the possibility of a third-round match between Wright and Van Gerwen – a repeat of the 2020 final.View image in fullscreenArno Merk (left) and Peter Wright after their second-round match of the PDC world championship at the Alexandra Palace.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAVan Gerwen remains at the top of the sport – and is a contender for the title – but Wright’s name is no longer in that conversation after a dreadful performance where he averaged just 79.20.“I am stunned, I can’t believe it, I just beat a legend, I am so happy,” Merk said. “I am early in my work, so I am really happy.”Gary Anderson rolled back the years with a vintage display to oust Connor Scutt. The Scot is the last man to defend the title with back-to-back wins in 2015 and 2016 and he showed a similar level of form. He averaged 105.41 and threw nine 180s in an excellent showing.Quick GuidePDC World Championship: third-round drawShow[1] Luke Littler (Eng) v Mensur Suljovic (Aut)[16] Damon Heta (Aus) v Rob Cross (Eng) [17]Andrew Gilding (Eng) v Luke Woodhouse (Eng) [25]Wesley Plaisier (Neth) v Krzysztof Ratajski (Pol)[4] Stephen Bunting (Eng) v James Hurrell (Eng)[13] Martin Schindler (Ger) v Ryan Searle (Eng) [20][5] Jonny Clayton (Wal) v Niels Zonneveld (Neth)Andreas Harrysson (Swe) v Ricardo Pietreczko (Ger)[2] Luke Humphries (Eng) v Gabriel Clemens (Ger)[15] Nathan Aspinall (Eng) v Kevin Doets (Neth)Ricky Evans (Eng) v Charlie Manby (Eng)[10] Gian van Veen (Neth) v Madars Razma (Lat)[3] Michael van Gerwen (Neth) v Arno Merk (Ger)[14] Gary Anderson (Sco) v Jermaine Wattimena (Neth) [19]Justin Hood (Eng) v Ryan Meikle (Eng)[11] Josh Rock (NI) v Callan Rydz (Eng)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Danny Noppert became the biggest casualty of the tournament so far as he lost to Justin Hood in a classic.

The inevitable correction must prompt a global conversation about intelligent machines, regulation and riskTue 23 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 23 Dec 2025 12.05 ESTShareIf AI did not change your life in 2025, next year it will. That is one of few forecasts that can be made with confidence in unpredictable times. This is not an invitation to believe the hype about what the technology can do today, or may one day achieve. The hype doesn’t need your credence. It ispuffed up enoughon Silicon Valley finance to distort the global economy and fuel geopolitical rivalries, shaping your world regardless of whether the most fanciful claims about AI capability are ever realised.ChatGPTwas launchedjust over three years ago and became the fastest-growing consumer app in history. Now it has about 800m weekly users. Its parent company, OpenAI, is valued atabout $500bn. Sam Altman, OpenAI CEO, has negotiated an intricate and, to some eyes, suspiciously opaque network of deals with other players in the sector to build the infrastructure required for the US’s AI-powered future. The value of these commitments isabout $1.5tn. This is not real cash, but bear in mind that a person spending $1 everysecondwould need 31,700 years to get through a trillion-dollar stash.Alphabet (Google’s parent company), Amazon, Apple, Meta (formerly Facebook) and Microsoft, which has a $135bn stake in OpenAI, are all piling hundreds of billions of dollars on the same bet. Without all these investments, the US economy would be flatlining.Economic analysts and historians of previous industrial frenzies, from the 19th-century railroads to thedotcom boom-and-bustat the turn of the millennium, are calling AI a bubble.Altman has said: “There are many parts of AI that I think arekind of bubblyright now.” Not his part, naturally. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder, has called it a bubble, but the“good” kindthat accelerates economic progress. A good bubble, in this analysis, finances infrastructure and expands the boundaries of human knowledge. These benefits endure after the bubble bursts and justify the ruin of people (little people, not Bezos people) who get hurt along the way.The bullishness of the tech fraternity is a heady mix of old-fashioned hucksterism, plutocratic megalomania and utopian ideology.At its core is a marketing pitch: current AI models already out-perform people at many tasks. Soon, it is supposed, the machines will achieve “general intelligence” – cognitive versatility like ours – leading to emancipation from the need for any human input. Generally intelligent AI can teach itself and design its successors, advancing through mind-boggling exponents of capability towards higher dimensions of super-intelligence.The company that crosses that threshold will have no trouble covering its debts. The men who realise this vision – and the dominant evangelists are all men – will be to omniscient AI what ancient prophets were to their gods. That’s a good gig for them. What happens to the rest of us in this post-sapiens order is a bit hazier.The US isn’t the only superpower to have an interest in AI, so the Silicon Valley dash for maximum awesomeness has geopolitical implications. China has taken a different approach, dictated in part by the Communist party tradition of centralised industrial planning, but also by the simple fact of running second in the race to innovate. Beijing is pushing for a faster, wider implementation of lower-spec (but still powerful) AI at every level of the economy and society. China is betting on ageneral boostfrom ordinary AI. The US is gunning for an extraordinary leap in general AI.Since the prize in that race is global supremacy, there are few incentives for either side to fret about risks, or sign up to international protocols restricting the uses of AI and mandating transparency in its development. Neither the US nor China is interested in submitting a strategically vital industry to standards co-written with foreigners.In the absence of global governance, we will depend on the integrity of robber barons and authoritarian apparatchiks to build ethical guardrails around systems already being embedded in tools we use for work, play and education.Earlier this year, Elon Musk announced that his company was developing Baby Grok, an AI chatbot aimed at children as young as three. The adult version has voiced white supremacist views and proudly self-identified as “MechaHitler”. That flagrancy has at least the virtue of candour. It is easier to spot than the subtler encodings of prejudice in bots that haven’t been given the kind ofhard ideological steersthat Musk gives his algorithms.George Osborne has a new job in tech, and it doesn’t bode well for Britain | Chris Stokel-WalkerRead moreNot all AI systems are large language models (LLMs) like Grok. But all LLMs are vulnerable to hallucinations and delusions gleaned from the material on which they are trained. They don’t “understand” a question and “think” about it like a conscious mind. They take a prompt, test the probability of its key terms occurring frequently together in their training data and assemble a plausible-sounding answer. Often the result is accurate. Usually it is convincing. It can also be garbage. As the volume of AI-generated content grows online, the ratio of slop to quality in the LLMs’ diets shifts accordingly. Fed on junk, they cannot be trusted to disgorge nutritious information.On this trajectory a bleak destination comes into view: a synthetic pseudo-reality mediated by the sycophantic mechanical offspring of narcissist Silicon Valley oligarchs. But that isn’t the only available path. Nor is it necessarily the likeliest one. The irrational exuberance of the AI boosters and theircynical coupling with the Trump administrationis a familiar story of human greed and myopia, not a new stage in evolution. The product is truly phenomenal but flawed in ways that encode the deformed character of its progenitors, whose talents are salesmanship and financial engineering. They have built spectacular engines that prioritise a brilliant performance of intelligence over the real thing.The real bubble is not stock valuations but the inflated ego of an industry that thinks it is just one more datacentre away from computational divinity. When the correction comes, when the US’s Icarus economy hits the cold sea, there will be a chance for other voices to be heard on the subject of risk and regulation. It may not come in 2026, but the moment is nearing when the starkness of the choice on offer and the need to confront it becomes unavoidable. Should we build a world where AI is put to the service of humanity, or will it be the other way round? We won’t need ChatGPT to tell us the answer.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionSilicon ValleyMetaOpenAIAlphabetAmazonXcommentShareReuse this content"

I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, wishing you a happy and healthy end of the year. I myself have a cold.Today, we are looking back at the biggest stories in tech of 2025 – Elon Musk’s political rise, burst and fall; artificial intelligence’s subsumption of the global economy, all other technology, and even the Earth’s topography; Australia’s remarkable social media ban; the tech industry’s new Trumpian politics; and, as a treat, a glimpse of the apocalypse offered by one of Silicon Valley’s savviest and strangest billionaires.Elon Musk, a one-man hurricaneView image in fullscreenTesla CEO Elon Musk attends a memorial service for slain far-right commentator Charlie Kirk at State Farm Stadium, in Glendale, Arizona, on 21 September 2025.Photograph: Daniel Cole/ReutersAt the close of 2024, I wrote that Elon Musk’s support of Donald Trump had made him theworld’s most powerful unelected man. In 2025, his reign turned out to be short-lived. He rose fast and haphazardly, like a whizzing firework, only to explode spectacularly in June when he claimed in a post on X that the president of the United States was named in the government’s files on the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Even in that short period of less than six months, Musk made a tremendous impact. He tore up wide swaths of the US government – tens of thousands of jobs, the security of extremely sensitive data, and entire agencies like USAid – that may never be stitched back together.After Doge imploded, Musk promised to turn back to his business empire, which saw great success and great failures alike in 2025. His rocket company SpaceX saw continued growth and is poised to conduct an initial public offering next year, perhaps as the most valuable private company in the world. Electric carmakerTesla, by contrast, faced violent backlash and major competition from its Chinese counterparts, which produced cheaper and more advanced vehicles while Tesla’s innovation and inventory stagnated. These headwinds caused a global sales slump for Musk’s carmaker.Look back at our reporting on Doge, Tesla, SpaceX, Musk himself:The‘department ofgovernmentefficiency’How an obscure US government office has become a target of Elon MuskHow Elon Musk’s billionaire Doge lieutenant took over the US’s biggest MDMA company | Technology | The GuardianThe chaos Elon Musk and Doge are leaving behind in WashingtonTesla faces backlash over Musk’s politicsEggings, swastikas and dog poop: Tesla bears brunt of people’s ire against Musk‘I’m selling the Nazi mobile’: Tesla owners offload cars after Musk’s fascist-style salutesLook ahead: SpaceX expands in preparation for 2026 IPOInside Elon Musk’s plan to rain SpaceX’s rocket debris over Hawaii’s pristine watersElon Musk’s SpaceX ‘preparing for flotation that could value it at over $1tn’Artificial intelligence blankets the worldView image in fullscreenA pipe lays along a fence line near construction at the Tahoe‑Reno Industrial Center in Storey county, Nevada, on 28 October 2025.Photograph: Bridget Bennett/The GuardianArtificial intelligence has gone from a niche within tech to the industry’s most prominent focus. The Magnificent Seven – Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla – are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into new software that they hope will do the bulk of humanity’s work before too long. The investment is driving the bulk of the growth of the US’s economy, giving rise to fears of a financial bubble and its popping. The US and China are locked in a cold war-esque race against each other, with startups in each country vying for cutting-edge breakthroughs, as governments around the world are forced to decide how they will regulate a new technological force.Before AI can arrive at that future, though, it needs brains a la the Tin Man of The Wizard of Oz. Those brains come in the form of datacenters. These massive buildings, which house the millions and millions of semiconductor chips booming AI development, have cropped up around the world, met with enthusiasm from leaders eager for tax revenue and deep concern from environmental advocates and, increasingly, local community members. The investment in and construction of datacenters wrought huge change in the physical landscape of the Earth in 2025 as tens of billions of dollars chased any available land, electricity, water and semiconductor chips.More from our reporting in the last year:DatacentersThe AI boom is heralding a new gold rush in the American westRevealed: Big tech’s new datacentres will take water from the world’s driest areasThe future of AIWhat will your life look like in 2035?‘It’s going much too fast’: the inside story of the race to create the ultimate AIMultitrillion-dollar valuationsIs AI a bubble that’s about to pop? – podcastWhat is new in UK-US tech deal and what will it mean for the British economy?But does it work?Meet the AI workers who tell their friends and family to stay away from AITech gets in bed with Trump 2.0View image in fullscreenMark Zuckerberg, Lauren Sanchez, Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai and Elon Musk attend the inauguration of Donald Trump in the Rotunda of the US Capitol on 20 January 2025 in Washington DC.Photograph: Abaca/Rex/ShutterstockElon Musk made a full-throated and whole-hearted embrace of Donald Trump in 2024 and 2025. He was not alone. Many of his fellows in Silicon Valley did the same, sitting beside the Trump family at the president’s inauguration after donating millions to his inaugural committee. The tech giants continued their embrace of Trump and his policies by scuttling their diversity, equity and inclusion programs, which they championed during Barack Obama’s presidency, and by cooperating with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Trump’s harsh immigration crackdown.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Aside from hugging a fluffy hot-water bottle, sipping theChristmas whiskyand ramping up the thermostat, an electric blanket or heated throw is the best way to ward off the winter chill. When you consider that more than half of a typical household’s fuel bills goeson heating and hot water, findingalternative ways to keep warm– and heating the person, rather than the whole home – seems like a good idea.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Many of the best electric blankets and heated throws cost about 2p to 4p an hour to run, so it’s hard to ignore their potential energy- and money-saving benefits.Electric blankets are ideal for using on your mattress, with the most convenient examples arriving with timers and auto-shut-off features for peace of mind, and dual control panels to keep both sides of the bed happy. Heated throws are better for snuggling on the sofa – they’re practical but also look good, with tactile finishes in materials such as bamboo and pure cotton.I was tasked with sleeping on the job to discover the best of both, testing the most popular electric blankets and heated throws from well-known homeware brands such as Silentnight, Slumberdown and Dreamland. Here are my top picks.At a glanceBestelectric blanket overall:Carmen C81190 fitted electric blanket (double)£44 at AOBest budget electric blanket:Slumberdown Sleepy Nights (super king)£25 at AsdaBest quilted electric blanket:Dreamland Pure Comfort bamboo underblanket (king size)£139.99 at BootsBestheated throw overall:Beurer heated snuggle blanket£79.99 at AmazonBest budget heated throw:Dunelm fleece electric throw£32 at DunelmBest heated fleece throw:Russell Hobbs microfleece heated throw£38.99 at AmazonBest heated duvet:Dreamland Love Mornings heated duvet (king size)£199.99 at DreamlandWhy you should trust meI’ve been a lifestyle journalist for more than two decades. Over the years, I’ve tested everything from breadmakers and bedding to beehives and biscuits – thankfully, not all at the same time.Lately, my focus has been bedding, testing numerous mattresses, pillows, weighted blankets and bed linen – so I know what makes for a decent night’s sleep. Testing electric blankets was the logical next step.Whatever I’m testing, I’ll find practical and useful ways to rigorously measure the value of the product and dig deep to go beyond the marketing jargon.How I testedView image in fullscreenI used an infrared thermometer to determine how fast the blankets warmed up – and how evenly.Photograph: Emily Peck/The GuardianWithout a Cern-grade laboratory at my disposal, I tested 20 of the most popular electric blankets and throws at home. In bed. In my pyjamas. I wanted to assess how each blanket and throw felt while sleeping or resting, and judge its quality and durability.Alongside measuring the max temperature each blanket hit, I timed how long it took to get there – I have zero patience when cold, so quick and efficient heating is crucial. Using an infrared thermometer, I measured the temperatures on the highest settings at 10 minutes, 30 minutes and an hour after being switched on. Since the weight of your duvet and room temperature can affect the temperature of electric blankets, I kept things fair by using all the electric blankets on the same bed, and all the heated throws on the same sofa, with a consistent room temperature of 18C.No one wants a hot back and frosty feet, so I considered how evenly each blanket heated up by taking temperature readings at three different points after an hour on full power. I also used a plug-in power consumption meter to determine each blanket’s hourly running cost based on theOfgem price capas of 1 January 2026, which is 27.69p a kWh.Below you’ll find the 13best of the 20 models I tested.

It comes in both double and king-size versions, and is made from polyester with a cosy fleece finish.Why we love itThe Carmen feels great, heats up effectively and is great value. It’s one of the easiest blankets to fit on to your bed, with a generous elastic skirt sewn on to it rather than the usual, clumsier straps. The skirt ensures the blanket secures neatly under each side of themattressand stays in place.It heats up quickly, reaching an impressive 28.1C in its centre after just 10 minutes – and this was without a duvet on top. I measured the heat at the sides a little cooler, but the temperature increased steadily over an hour, reaching 30.2C in its centre after 30 minutes and up to 33C after an hour. As soon as a duvet was placed on top, it got even warmer and retained its heat effectively long after I had turned off the blanket.While it’s machine washable, the manufacturer recommends you only do this a total of three times in its lifespan, so it will mostly be a spot clean.It’s a shame that …there’s no timer. But for peace of mind, it does have overheat protection that will automatically shut it down if the built-in thermal fuse detects a hotspot or fault in the heated cables.Sizes available:double,king sizeDimensions (double):L193 x W137cmNumber of heat settings:threeTimer included:no, but it does have auto-shut offRunning cost on maximum:4p/hour (0.078kWh each side)Temperature after an hour:33.2CGuarantee:three yearsMachine washable:yesCarmenC81190 fitted electric blanket£44£44 at AOWhat we loveIt’s easy to fit on to the bed and heats quicklyWhat we don’t loveIt doesn’t have a timerBest budget electric blanket:Slumberdown Sleepy NightsSlumberdownSleepy Nights£25£25 at AsdaWhat we loveGenerous straps make it easy to fit on the bedWhat we don’t loveIt doesn’t include a timerNote: stock is running low in double and king size.Toasty Nightsis a similar blanket with quiltingSuper king, £25 at AsdaSmall double, £27 at AmazonGenerous straps for easy positioning and three adjustable heat settings make this electric blanket a good budget buy. It comes in six sizes, can be machine washed for easy maintenance, and arrives with a two-year guarantee.Why we love itFeeling super soft against the skin, this microfibre blanket was simple to set up, with bonus points awarded for the long cord.The lengthy, elasticated straps meant I didn’t have to wrestle too much with the corners of my thick Sealy mattress to position the blanket securely, plus it stayed in place nicely.The blanket heated up to 22.1C in just 10 minutes and 25C in 30 minutes. After an hour on its highest setting, it reached a comfortable 29.5C – more than enough heat for me.When I measured the temperature across the blanket, I found it was hotter in the middle than on the sides. However, I didn’t notice any cold spots when my duvet was on top, trapping in the heat.It’s a shame that …it doesn’t have a timer. The manufacturer suggests leaving this blanket on its lowest setting if you want to keep it on all night.Sizes available:small single,single,small double, double (currently out of stock), king (currently out of stock),super kingDimensions (king size):L150 x W142cmNumber of heat settings:threeTimer included:noRunning coston maximum:3p/hour (0.094kWh)Temperature after an hour:29.5CGuarantee:two yearsMachine washable:yesSlumberdownSleepy Nights£25£25 at AsdaWhat we loveGenerous straps make it easy to fit on the bedWhat we don’t loveIt doesn’t include a timerBest quilted electric blanket:Dreamland Pure Comfort bamboo underblanketDreamlandPure Comfort bamboo underblanketfrom£99.99£139.99 at Boots£99.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIt includes breathable bamboo materialWhat we don’t loveIt costs more than your average blanketKing, £139.99 at BootsKing, £99.99 at AmazonThe king-size version of this underblanket has dual control panels for operating each side independently. There are six heat settings to choose from, and three timer options for one, three or nine hours.Why we love itThis blanket reached 22C at its centre after just 10 minutes, and within an hour, temperatures had risen to a snuggly 32C. I found that the middle and end of the blanket heated well, but the top section remained cool to the touch, working well for under your head.It costs more than your average electric blanket, but is worth it for the quilted, breathable bamboo finish. The filling, like many other electric blankets, is polyester. The control panels on either side were easy to navigate, even when I was sleepy-eyed.It’s a shame that …there are no timer options between three and nine hours.Sizes available:single,double, king,super kingDimensions (king size):L200 x W150cmNumber of heat settings:sixTimer included:yes, one, three or nine hoursRunning coston maximum:4p/hour (0.129kWh)Temperature after an hour:32.2CGuarantee:three yearsMachine washable:yesDreamlandPure Comfort bamboo underblanketfrom£99.99£139.99 at Boots£99.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIt includes breathable bamboo materialWhat we don’t loveIt costs more than your average blanketBest heated throw overall:Beurer HD150 heated snuggle blanketBeurerHD150 heated snuggle blanketfrom£79.99£89.99 at Simply Be£79.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIt feels very smooth and snuggly against your skinWhat we don’t loveIt can be awkward to fold and a little cumbersome to storePhotograph: Emily Peck/The Guardian£89.99 at Simply Be£79.99 at AmazonIdeal for the sofa, this Beurer blanket has averysoft and sumptuous fleece finish. Its six heat settings are all adjustable via the central control panel. I tried the XXL design – a little oversized on my three-seater sofa, but ideal for sharing comfortably with another person. It also comes in asmaller 180 x 130cm size.Why we love itThe soft-to-touch surface of this heated blanket proved just the right level of cosy for a night on the sofa watchingStrictly. Plus, it feels padded enough to disguise the heating elements inside the blanket – not something that can be said of all heated blankets.It heated up fast – reaching temperatures in the low 20s in just 10 minutes – yet it used surprisingly little energy. After an hour, it felt very hot, so I turned it down to setting two, which was more comfortable. Its three-hour automatic switch-off timer means that you can just set and forget about it.It’s a shame that …it didn’t heat up evenly. While the middle was warm, sections around the edges didn’t feel it at all – which might be a problem if you’re sharing it with a blanket hog.Sizes available:small, largeDimensions (large):L200 x W150cmNumber of heat settings:sixTimer included:three-hour automatic switch-offRunning coston maximum:2p/hour (0.055kWh)Temperature after an hour:32.2CGuarantee:three yearsMachine washable:yesBeurerHD150 heated snuggle blanketfrom£79.99£89.99 at Simply Be£79.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIt feels very smooth and snuggly against your skinWhat we don’t loveIt can be awkward to fold and a little cumbersome to storeBest budget heated throw:Dunelm fleece electric throwDunelmFleece electric throw£32£32 at DunelmWhat we loveIt heats evenly and feels a manageable thicknessWhat we don’t loveThere’s no timerPhotograph: Emily Peck/The Guardian£32 at DunelmThis smooth fleece blanket comes in three attractive colours – taupe, charcoal and navy – to match most neutral decor schemes. A handheld digital LED controller allows you to flick between its six heat levels.Why we love itFor less than £35, this heated throw is good value – and at this price, you could even buy it as a gift. The deep navy colour looked great on my sofa, and while it’s not the fluffiest heated throw I’ve tested, it felt lovely to touch – neither too thick nor too heavy. It was the perfect size for one person – and will just about cater for two, if you’re willing to snuggle up close.The blanket warmed up steadily, reaching a comfortable temperature at its max. After 10 minutes on its full heat setting, it measured 19.7C at the centre. An hour in on full power, this rose to 40.3C. While heat wasn’t evenly distributed, this didn’t make much difference to the overall feeling of warmth.It’s a shame that …it doesn’t have a timer, other than a four-hour automatic shut-off, but you’ll need to make sure you switch it off using the controller and at the plug after use.Sizes available:oneDimensions:L130 x W160cmNumber of heat settings:sixTimer included:no, but automatic shut-off after four hoursRunning cost on maximum:3p/hour (0.1kWh)Temperature after an hour:40.3CGuarantee:one yearMachine washable:yesDunelmFleece electric throw£32£32 at DunelmWhat we loveIt heats evenly and feels a manageable thicknessWhat we don’t loveThere’s no timerBest heated fleece throw:Russell Hobbs microfleece heated throwRussell HobbsMicrofleece heated throwfrom£39.99£39.99 at Currys£39.99 at DebenhamsWhat we loveThe microfleece finish feels so softWhat we don’t loveIts darker shades might look harsh in some colour schemesPhotograph: Emily Peck/The Guardian£39.99 at Currys£39.99 at DebenhamsWith its soft microfleece finish, this heated blanket is large enough to cover one person comfortably and also works well for two. It features one digital control panel with multiple heat and timer functions, and an automatic switch-off function for peace of mind. If you intend to sleep with it, Russell Hobbs recommends using it on a lower heat mode, up to setting three.Why we love itThe first thing I noticed about this heated blanket, aside from its soft feel, was its generous 250cm cable. It meant I could drape the blanket over me comfortably on the sofa without accidentally tugging the plug out of the wall socket.The blanket’s microfleece finish felt tactile and comforting, and it was thicker than some of the standard fleece throws I tested, such as the Dunelm fleece electric throw (above). While I could feel the wiring lines inside this blanket, they’re well hidden in the blanket’s sumptuous design.The white digital control panel here is a little bulkier than some others on test, and stands out against the jet-black finish of the blanket I tested. Nevertheless, it was easy to use, with heat settings ranging from one to nine. If you want to use the blanket for more than an hour, the timer function lets you go up in one-hour increments up to nine hours and then jumps to a single 12-hour setting. On its highest heat setting it reached 29C in 30 minutes and a toasty 41.9C after an hour. In addition, the heat seemed to distribute well across the blanket’s surface.It’s a shame that …the throw doesn’t come in pastel colours; the darker shades (such as the black I tested) could look harsh against some softer interior schemes.Sizes available:one sizeDimensions:L180 x W130cmNumber of heat settings:nineTimer included:yes, one-nine or 12 hoursRunning cost on maximum:4p/hour (0.134kWh)Temperature after an hour:41.9CGuarantee:two yearsMachine washable:yes, under 40CRussell HobbsMicrofleece heated throwfrom£39.99£39.99 at Currys£39.99 at DebenhamsWhat we loveThe microfleece finish feels so softWhat we don’t loveIts darker shades might look harsh in some colour schemesBest fluffy heated throw:Glamhaus heated throwGlamhausHeated throwfrom£35.99£35.99 at Robert Dyas£37.50 at AmazonWhat we loveIt heats up quickly and feels great against skinWhat we don’t loveNo storage bag includedPhotograph: Emily Peck/The Guardian£35.99 at Robert Dyas£37.50 at AmazonAvailable in a choice of jewel-like colours, including deep pink, “scuba” blue and green, this electric over-blanket is reasonably priced at less than £50 (£35.99 at the time of writing). The blanket is made from polyester and has a white fluffy trim that contrasts nicely against the vibrant hue of its main body.Why we love itIt may be standard polyester, but the velvety fleece-like finish of this blanket feels luxurious to touch. Its white trim instantly made my sofa look festive, but it will look great throughout spring, too, adding an extra layer of cosiness to your living room.It’s thick and feels more substantial than some other budget heated blankets I’ve tried, so it feels warming even when it’s not switched on. It heated up quickly, too, and within a minute there was a satisfying amount of heat from its centre. The heat felt comfortable rather than scorching, with the heated wires nicely disguised within the throw. The heat also radiates out to the sides effectively, providing an even warmth across the surface. After 10 minutes, I measured the centre of the blanket at 27.2C on its highest setting, and it reached 34.2C after 30 minutes and a sleep-inducing 40.3C after an hour.The control panel is easy to use and doesn’t give you a bewildering number of heat and timer options – there are six heat settings and a three-hour timer, which feels plenty. It comes with the safety of an auto-shut-off feature and can be conveniently machine-washed at 30C too – both features I’d expect to find in a good-quality heated blanket.It’s a shame that …it doesn’t come with a storage bag, which would make it neater to store while not in use. It’s hard to fault this blanket, though, as it’s such good value.Sizes available:one sizeDimensions:L160 x W130cmNumber of heat settings:sixTimer included:yes, three hoursRunning cost on maximum:3p/hour (0.096kWh)Temperature after an hour:40.3CGuarantee:one yearMachine washable:yes, at 30CGlamhausHeated throwfrom£35.99£35.99 at Robert Dyas£37.50 at AmazonWhat we loveIt heats up quickly and feels great against skinWhat we don’t loveNo storage bag includedBest heated duvet:Dreamland Love Mornings heated duvetDreamlandHeated duvetfrom£199.99£199.99 at Dreamland£199.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIt offers soothing heat from above, which works wellWhat we don’t loveCables will hang out of the end of the duvet coverKing, £199.99 at DreamlandKing, £199.99 at AmazonDreamland offers a wide range of heated bedding products – I also have my eye on the brand’selectric heat padsfor specific areas, including your feet, neck, back and hands.Having tried the underblanket (reviewed above), I was keen to see how this heated duvet would compare. Like the underblanket, the duvet is machine washable with the controller removed, and can be tumble-dried, too.Why we love itI was instantly impressed by the tidy stitching and smooth finish of this heated duvet, which is filled with polyester and has a 100% cotton cover. With an October chill in the air, I set up the duvet on my bed, under a breathable cottonNectar duvet cover.The dual controls lead out at the end of the duvet, so you can run them up the side of the bed to plug it in. This means you’ll be able to use it with a buttoned cover, but not one that has a zip.Dreamland states the heat-up time as five minutes, and while it was slightly warm after a few minutes, I did have to go hunting for the warmer spots during my tests. After 10 minutes on the highest setting, I measured the temperature at 26.6C at the centre, and after an hour it was 36.3C, which felt comfortable – although this probably isn’t a heat level I’d like to sleep in all night.The duvet’s dual controls worked well for my partner and me: I could blast the heat on my side while he, who prefers cooler climes, didn’t need to have it on at all.It’s a shame that …it doesn’t come with a cover. Also, while having the heat filter down from the duvet above me felt cosy on a really cold night, I prefer the heat from an electric blanket underneath.Sizes available:single,double, king sizeDimensions (king size):L225 x W220cmNumber of heat settings:sixTimer included:yes, one, three and nine hoursRunning cost on maximum:3p/hour (0.101kWh a side)Temperature after an hour:36.3CGuarantee:two yearsMachine washable:yesDreamlandHeated duvetfrom£199.99£199.99 at Dreamland£199.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIt offers soothing heat from above, which works wellWhat we don’t loveCables will hang out of the end of the duvet coverBest heated throw for one person:VonHaus pink heated throw blanketVonHausPink heated throw blanketfrom£37.99£37.99 at VonHaus£37.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIts silky finish and pretty pink hueWhat we don’t loveIt could be thickerPhotograph: Emily Peck/The Guardian£37.99 at VonHaus£37.99 at AmazonWith nine temperature settings, this soft and silky pink blanket offers a good range of heat options up to a maximum of 43C. It has a one-hour default timer, plus one that can be set for up to nine hours in total. If you’re going to sleep with it or are using it for extended periods, VonHaus recommends setting the heat to level one for the duration.Why we love itMeasuring 160 x 130cm, I found this heated blanket just the right size for one. While its vibrant pink finish might not go down so well with some, personally, I didn’t mind it. It’s machine washable at 30C (with the control panel removed) on a gentle cycle and low spin, and the 2.15m cord length should be long enough to reach a nearby socket.The blanket felt smooth underhand with an almost silk-like finish, but I could feel the wiring inside. Nevertheless, it was subtle, and the blanket’s layers of fabric are well structured to make it easy to fold or lay flat on the sofa or bed. It heated up evenly, but not as quickly or as hot as others on test, reaching 25.5C within 30 minutes and 34C after an hour.It’s a shame that …the pink colourway may not to be everyone’s taste.Sizes available:oneDimensions:L160 x W130cmNumber of heat settings:nineTimer included:yes, up to nine hoursRunning cost on maximum:4p/hour (0.156kWh)Temperature after an hour:34CGuarantee:two yearsMachine washable:yes, up to 30CVonHausPink heated throw blanketfrom£37.99£37.99 at VonHaus£37.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIts silky finish and pretty pink hueWhat we don’t loveIt could be thickerBest heated cushion:Beurer HK48 cosy heated cushionBeurerHK48 cosy heated cushionfrom£34.99£42.39 at Lakeland£34.99 at AmazonWhat we loveThe fact that it both props you up and heats you upWhat we don’t loveThe control panel is very basicPhotograph: Emily Peck/The Guardian£42.39 at Lakeland£34.99 at AmazonThis heated cushion, made by German brand Beurer, would make an excellent gift.Of its two sides, it’s the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 fleecy fabric that warms up for a soothing effect; the other side is a breathable cotton with a removable pad inside. The cover is removable and machine washable on a gentle wool cycle at 30C, but it can only be cleaned up to 10 times in its lifespan. For an extra £9.99,replacement covers are availablein five attractive colours, including green, red and orange.Why we love itAn alternative option to your standard heated throw, this cushion provides a more targeted approach to warming and could work well for general pain relief. It comes with three heat settings, and felt great positioned near the lower back and under the neck, upper legs, knees and ankles.The cushion was super-quick to heat, reaching 34C in 10 minutes, and a very warm 43.4C after an hour. It never really felt too hot, and the heat seemed to radiate to the sides nicely. The three heat settings are useful, but a timer alongside would have enhanced the design. That said, it does come with a 90-minute auto-shut-off feature.It’s a shame that …the control panel isn’t a little more hi-tech, but it does the job effectively.Sizes available:oneDimensions:H40 x W30cmNumber of heat settings:threeTimer included:no, but it has 90-minute auto-switch offRunning cost on maximum: 0.6p/hour – less than 1p (0.023kWh)Temperature after an hour:43.4CGuarantee:three yearsMachine washable:the cover is machine washable at 30C wool cycle; the inner pad is not washableBeurerHK48 cosy heated cushionfrom£34.99£42.39 at Lakeland£34.99 at AmazonWhat we loveThe fact that it both props you up and heats you upWhat we don’t loveThe control panel is very basicThe best of the restView image in fullscreen‘Good for transitional seasons when you don’t want anything too heavy’: the Silentnight luxury heated throw.Photograph: Emily Peck/The GuardianSlumberdown Elegantly Warm luxury heated throwSlumberdownElegantly Warm luxury heated throwfrom£48£60 at Argos£48 at AmazonWhat we loveIt gets satisfyingly hotWhat we don’t loveIts heat settings aren’t as intuitive as we’d likePhotograph: Emily Peck/The Guardian£60 at Argos£48 at AmazonBest for:those looking for a stylish, neutral colourThis heated throw looks elegant and feels luxurious – just as the name suggests. My review sample arrived in the Mole colourway, which will suit both modern and traditional interiors.The blanket’s 10 heat settings allow for good control, although I found it difficult to “feel” a difference past heat setting six. The blanket reached a hot 31.9C after 10 minutes of being turned on; and while the borders didn’t get as warm, the heat did seem evenly distributed across the surface.Made from polyester, the blanket is washable at 40C on a wool cycle, but it can only be air-dried.It didn’t make the final cut because …when you turn it on, it starts at setting five. It would make more sense if it started at setting one.Sizes available:one;dimensions:L160 x W130cm;number of heat settings:10;timer included:yes, up to ten hours;running cost on maximum:3p/hour (0.104kWh);temperature after an hour:42.5C;guarantee:two years;machine washable:yes, up to 40CSlumberdownElegantly Warm luxury heated throwfrom£48£60 at Argos£48 at AmazonWhat we loveIt gets satisfyingly hotWhat we don’t loveIts heat settings aren’t as intuitive as we’d likeSnuggledown Intelligent WarmthSnuggledownIntelligent Warmthfrom£100£100 at Argos£125 at John LewisWhat we loveEach side can be controlled independentlyWhat we don’t loveIts filling is polyester, which is less breathableKing, £100 at ArgosKing, £125 at John LewisBest for:couples who share a bed and can’t agree on temperatureWith a sustainable 180-thread-count pure cotton cover, the surface of this electric blanket is luxuriously soft and breathable, while the quilted finish adds extra padding and warmth to the mattress before the blanket is even turned on. The fastening straps for the corners and the blanket’s base material ensure a secure fit to the mattress.There are two control panels that let you tailor each quarter of the mattress to suit your upper and lower body, so it’s a great option for bed sharers or those who like to keep their feet at a different temperature from the top half of their body. On the highest setting, the blanket radiated an even temperature that felt even warmer once I added my duvet.It didn’t make the final cut because …it may have a pure cotton cover, but its filling is made from polyester.Sizes available:single,double, king,super king;dimensions (king size):L200 x W150cm;number of heat settings:nine;timer included:yes, up to nine hours;running coston maximum:2p/hour (0.062kWh);temperature after an hour:27.6C;guarantee:two years;machine washable:yesSnuggledownIntelligent Warmthfrom£100£100 at Argos£125 at John LewisWhat we loveEach side can be controlled independentlyWhat we don’t loveIts filling is polyester, which is less breathableSilentnight luxury heated throwSilentnightLuxury heated throwfrom£39.99£41 at Silentnight£39.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIt’s lightweight and heats evenlyWhat we don’t loveIt’s not as thick as some of the throws we’ve tried£41 at SilentnightFrom £39.99 at AmazonBest for:smaller sofas and people who don’t want to shareA simple control panel with nine heat settings adjust the temperature of this heated throw, which reached just over 33C after an hour of being plugged in. There’s no timer, but it turns off automatically after two hours, which should be more than long enough to warm you up.The throw is thin and light, so it would be good for transitional seasons when the weather is a little warmer and you don’t want anything too heavy. The box says it costs 1p an hour to run on the lowest setting, which sounds about right – I measured it as 3p an hour on maximum.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s quite thin, meaning you can feel the wiring inside.Sizes available:one;dimensions:L160 x W120cm;number of heat settings:nine;timer included:no, but two-hour automatic shut-off;running coston maximum:3p/hour (0.102kWh);temperature after an hour:33.6C;guarantee:three years;machine washable:yesSilentnightLuxury heated throwfrom£39.99£41 at Silentnight£39.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIt’s lightweight and heats evenlyWhat we don’t loveIt’s not as thick as some of the throws we’ve triedWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenHow much do electric blankets cost to run?In my tests, the average king-size electric blanket costs 3p an hour to run. This shows that even if used for a few hours a day, it could cut down on your heating use and save you money over the year – depending on how much you spend on the blanket in the first place, of course.“There are factors to consider when calculating the costs, as not all electric blankets are the same,” says John-Paul Drake, energy expert atLove Energy Savings. “Some come with timers, different heat settings and various efficiency ratings. But it could be wise to take advantage of both an electric blanket and a lower thermostat setting as an optimal way to save money on energy bills this winter.”How much should you spend on an electric blanket?Prices for an electric blanket range from about £30 to £140, depending on the size. Expect to pay anything from £20 to £150 for a heated throw.Are electric blankets safe?Electric blankets should be used with caution, and never by young babies and toddlers. Most manufacturers do not recommend use by young children, unless they’re supervised by an adult and have a clear understanding of how to use them safely. Always check the manufacturer’s guidelines for safe use. Not always obvious on the box, but the latest electric blankets should have passed electrical safety checks. Look for safety marks such as “BEAB approved” (British Electrotechnical Approvals Board) or “KEMA-KEURsafety tested” for peace of mind. For more advice on electric blanket safety,read this advice from London Fire Brigade.Consider safety features such as an automatic switch-off timer that will turn off the blanket after a set time, or overheat protection, which switches off the device if it senses it’s getting too hot.An electric blanket should fit securely on your mattress, starting just below the area beneath your pillow to stop your head from overheating. It shouldn’t be folded or creased, as this can damage the wiring inside. The safest place to leave your blanket when it’s not needed is flat on your bed.Is my electric blanket compatible with my mattress?Electric blankets are compatible with most mattresses, but can potentially cause damage to some mattresses made from memory foam or latex. “Memory foam mattresses are heat-sensitive, and there has been a concern in the past that they could soften too much when heated by an electric blanket, damaging the foam’s structure and reducing support,” says Chelsea Brown, lead product adviser atOpera Beds.“Most modern electric blankets shouldn’t reach high enough temperatures for this to be an issue, but you should use them with caution. Memory foam is designed to mould to your body, so directly placing an electric blanket on top can also prevent the mattress from fitting your body snugly. Consider using a mattress topper under the electric blanket or keeping it on a low heat to prevent damage to your mattress.”Emily Peck is alifestyle journalist who’s been writing and editing for more than twodecades.

Whether your priority is the longest battery life, the best camera, the biggest screen or simply the optimal balance of features and price, there’s more to choose from in the Apple ecosystem than you may expect, especially after the release ofthe cheaper iPhone 16eand super-thiniPhone Air.How I testedQuick GuideHow I testedShowWe combine real-world testing with various tools, such as benchmarking systems that perform standardised tasks. These help us  evaluate a phone,  measure its performance, confirm that it works as expected and compare it with its competition and predecessors.We use the phones at different times and in various environments, from firing off emails on packed commuter trains to weekends spent shooting photos in national parks, and everything in between. We do everything a typical smartphone user would, such as messaging, browsing, using apps, listening to music, watching videos, playing games and navigating the real world. That gives us a good impression of how a smartphone handles the rigours of day-to-day life – plus, it shows us how long the battery lasts and the strength of its wireless performance.The findings from our general use of the phones are combined with the results from specific tests for things such as the camera zoom, video playback and charging, to inform the reviews and help us rank the devices.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Why should you trust me?I have been reviewing consumer electronics for 18 years, with more than a decade spent as the Guardian’s gadget expert. In that time I’ve seen all manner of tech fads come and go, smartphone giants rise and fall, the cutting edge morph into the mainstream, and have poked, prodded and evaluated more than 1,000 devices –sometimes to destruction.At a glanceBest iPhone for most people:iPhone 17£799 at John LewisBest iPhone for camera:iPhone 17 Pro£1,099 at ArgosBest iPhone for battery:iPhone 17 Pro Max£1,199 at ArgosBest thin and light iPhone:iPhone Air£999 at AppleCheapest new iPhone:iPhone 16e£549 at John LewisThe best iPhones you can buy in 2025View image in fullscreen‘Great for games and other intensive tasks’: the iPhone 17 Pro.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianBest iPhone for most people:iPhone 17AppleiPhone 17from£799£799 at John Lewis£799 at ApplePhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian£799 at John Lewis£799 at AppleThe base-model iPhone has been the best for most people for years, but this year the iPhone 17 is closer to the Pro models in features than ever before, making it an instant recommendation.While it may not look that different from last year’s iPhone 16, the screen has finally been upgraded to bring it up to par with the Pro iPhones. It is a 6.3in super-bright OLED with a 120Hz refresh rate – double previous standard iPhones – and ensures day-to-day scrolling and animations are smoother and more fluid than ever before. The screen’s glass is stated as being three times tougher than previous models, while the always-on display mode shows the time, notifications and music when idle – another feature that was Pro-only until now.The rest of the iPhone 17 is fairly standard. It has the latest rapid A19 chip, but with twice the starting storage at 256GB of its predecessor – which should be more than enough for most people. The battery lasts just shy of two days between charges, and it fast-charges via USB-C or MagSafe/Qi2 wireless charging.The phone is still relatively light and compact for a modern smartphone, with aluminium sides and a glass front and back, and it arrives with an IP68 water-resistance rating (down to depths of six metres for up to 30 minutes). Along the edge of the device you’ll find the recently added action and camera control buttons, as well as the standard power and volume buttons.Sporting main and ultra-wide options, the iPhone 17’s dual 48MP rear camera shoots great photos and videos across a range of lighting conditions, including automatic portrait capture and a fun macrophotography mode for closeups. It lacks a telephoto camera, however, limited to a 2x crop zoom on the main camera with digital zoom on top.A new 18MP Centre Stage selfie camera on the front has some fancy tricks. It can automatically pan and zoom to fit in everyone for group shots, and can shoot landscape selfies while being held in portrait orientation.The iPhone 17 runs thesame iOS 26as the rest of the iPhone family, which introduces Apple’s new glass-like design, improved spam filters and several other features. It also has Apple’s AI tools, which still lag behind the competition.The biggest downside is that in a year where every other iPhone has had a redesign, the iPhone 17 looks the same as last year’s model.Why should you buy it?The iPhone 17 offers almost everything that’s great about Apple’s Pro phones, including 256GB of storage, solid battery life, a fancy new screen and rapid performance, but in a lighter, cheaper package.Buy if:you want a great iPhone experienceDon’t buy if:you want optical zoom on your camera or a new designRead ourfulliPhone 17 review: the Apple smartphone to get this yearScreen:6.3in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED)Processor:Apple A19Storage:256 or 512GBCamera:48MP main+UW; 18MP front-facingDimensions:71.5 x 7.95 x 149.6mm (WDH)AppleiPhone 17from£799£799 at John Lewis£799 at AppleBest iPhone for camera:iPhone 17 ProAppleiPhone 17 Profrom£1,099£1,099 at Argos£1,099 at CurrysPhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian£1,099 at Argos£1,099 at CurrysThe iPhone 17 Pro takes all the good bits from the standard iPhone 17 and slaps them into a new design that stands out over years of similar-looking models from Apple.It shares the same super-bright, 120Hz 6.3in OLED screen as the iPhone 17, but in a new aluminium unibody with smoother edges. A new camera “plateau” covers the full width of the top quarter of the phone’s rear, with a glass panel inlaid below it for wireless charging and magnetic accessories. New dark blue and bright orange colour options help it stand out, and despite its 204g weight, the 17 Pro remains pretty compact for a phone this capable.Housing Apple’s fastest A19 Pro chip with a cooling system to allow it to run at peak performance for longer, the new Pro is great for games and other intensive tasks. Basic storage starts at 256GB, and the battery lasts about 42 hours between charges with general use. It fast-charges to 70% in 30 minutes via USB-C and supports 25W Qi2 wireless charging.The biggest feature upgrade over the regular iPhone 17 is the Pro’s camera system. It’s made up of three 48MP sensors, including a larger main camera and a new 4x telephoto camera, which offers a 2x crop zoom to hit an effective 8x optical zoom to close the distance to objects. Combined, they capture excellent photos across a range of lighting conditions and environments. On the front, you’ll find the 18MP Centre Stage selfie camera for easy group shots.Why should you buy it?This is Apple’s best phone, with a new aluminium unibody design, its most powerful camera and top performance, all in a device that’s still easy to fit in a pocket.Buy if:you want a new design and the best camera in an iPhone but don’t want a huge displayDon’t buy if:you want the longest battery life or biggest display on an iPhoneRead our fulliPhone 17 Pro review: different looks but still all about the zoomScreen:6.3in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED)Processor:Apple A19 ProStorage:256, 512GB or 1TBCamera:48MP main + 48MP UW + 48MP 5x; 18MP front-facingDimensions:71.9 x 8.75 x 150mm (WDH)Weight:204gAppleiPhone 17 Profrom£1,099£1,099 at Argos£1,099 at CurrysBest iPhone for battery:iPhone 17 Pro MaxAppleiPhone 17 Pro Maxfrom£1,199£1,199 at Argos£1,199 at CurrysPhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian£1,199 at Argos£1,199 at CurrysThe iPhone 17 Pro Max is Apple’s biggest and most expensive model this year. Super-sizing the regular 17 Pro, it has a massive 6.9in OLED screen on the front and a huge battery in the back.Design-wise, it sports the same new aluminium unibody and top-performing A19 Pro chip of the new models, and a glorious screen that makes it excellent for gaming. It comes with at least 256GB of storage with options up to 2TB, great for those who want to use its triple rear camera for movie-making.Standout, though, is the Pro Max’s battery life, which at about 55 hours of general use will see the phone last well into a third day without needing a top-up.The result of that extra capacity is that the 17 Pro Max is both huge and heavy. It would definitely benefit from using aPopsocket, handle, lanyard or other strapto help keep hold of it.Why should you buy it?Apple’s longest-lasting, largest phone comes packing a powerful camera, top performance and everything good from the regular-sized 17 Pro.Buy if:you want super-long battery life and a massive screenDon’t buy if:you want a smaller, lighter or cheaper deviceScreen:6.9in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED)Processor:Apple A19 ProStorage:256, 512GB, 1TB or 2TBCamera:48MP main + 48MP UW + 48MP 5x; 18MP front-facingDimensions:78 x 8.75 x. 163.4mm (WDH)Weight:231gAppleiPhone 17 Pro Maxfrom£1,199£1,199 at Argos£1,199 at CurrysBest thin and light iPhone:iPhone AirAppleiPhone Airfrom£999£999 at Apple£999 at ArgosPhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian£999 at Apple£999 at ArgosThe iPhone Air is a bit of a wildcard in the current Apple phone lineup. It is an entirely new model built to be the thinnest and lightest iPhone ever made. The bulk of the body is just 5.64mm thick, although it feels even thinner thanks to its rounded titanium sides.It weighs only 165g – 12g lighter than the already light iPhone 17 – but it also has a large, bright and 120Hz-smooth 6.5in OLED screen. It’s the kind of device that deserves to be used without a case, immediately feeling special the moment you pick it up.On the rear, the camera plateau that stretches across the top of the device is also home to the phone’s components, with the rest of the body dedicated to the battery. It still has a version of Apple’s fastest A19 Pro chip, at least 256GB of storage, and runs iOS 26 with all the features.The super-slender frame creates three downsides for the Air. First, its battery lasts about 40 hours of general use, which isn’t terrible, but it’s shorter than other iPhones.Second, it doesn’t have a nano Sim slot, relying entirely on downloadable eSims for connection to a phone provider. While most of the major networks support eSims, not all in the UK do, especially the more budget-friendly providers.However, the biggest compromise is that it only has a single 48MP camera on the rear, with no ultra-wide or telephoto options. While it still takes excellent photos, if you can’t walk back and forth to zoom in or out from your subject, you won’t be able to get the shot. You still get the new 18MP Centre Stage selfie camera as the rest of the iPhone 17 line, though.Why should you buy it?The iPhone Air is an exquisite piece of hardware that offers a big screen without the bulk or weight.Buy if:you want thinness above all elseDon’t buy if:you want long battery life, multiple cameras or you can’t get an eSimRead our fulliPhone Air review: Apple’s pursuit of absolute thinnessScreen:6.5in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED)Processor:Apple A19 Pro (5-core GPU)Storage:256, 512GB or 1TBCamera:48MP rear; 18MP front-facingDimensions:74.7 x 5.64 x 156.2mm (WDH)Weight:165gAppleiPhone Airfrom£999£999 at Apple£999 at ArgosCheapest new iPhone:iPhone 16eAppleiPhone 16efrom£549£549 at John Lewis£599 at ApplePhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian£549 at John Lewis£599 at AppleThe cheapest new phone sold by Apple is the iPhone 16e, the spiritual successor to theiPhone SE, but with a more modern design and chip.It has an aluminium body, glass front and back, and a decent 6.1in OLED screen with the older-style notch from2022’s iPhone 14. It’s thin, light and pretty compact for a modern phone, and is water-resistant like the rest of Apple’s iPhones.Inside sits 2024’s A18 chip, paired with at least 128GB of storage. This hardware enables the Apple Intelligence features found across the rest of the iPhone 16 lineup – capabilities that won’t run on the iPhone 15 and older models – although none have as yet emerged as true killer features.The iPhone 16e will last up to two days of general use and charges via USB-C. However, it lacks a few features common to other iPhones, including the Camera Control button, MagSafe on the back for accessories and charging, Wifi 7, and a handful of other specs. A bigger deal-breaker might be the single camera on the back, which is decent but lacks any ultra-wide or telephoto options.Despite costing about 25% less than the regular iPhone 17, the 16e still isn’t cheap, so better options can be found refurbished for similar or less money.Why should you buy it?The 16e offers the modern iPhone experience with a fast chip and AI, but with features such as a dual camera and MagSafe missing to hit a lower price.Buy if:you want the cheapest new iPhone from AppleDon’t buy if:you are at all into photography or have MagSafe accessoriesRead our fulliPhone 16e review: Apple’s cheapest new phoneScreen:6.1in Super Retina XDR (OLED)Processor:Apple A18Storage:128, 256 or 512GBCamera:48MP rear; 12MP front-facingDimensions:71.5 x 7.8 x 146.7mm (WDH)Weight:167gAppleiPhone 16efrom£549£549 at John Lewis£599 at AppleOther iPhones still on sale at AppleView image in fullscreenThe iPhone 16 will continue to receive about five to six years of software support.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe iPhone 16, released in 2024, sports the same design as the current iPhone 17, but misses the new Pro-grade screen and Centre Stage selfie camera.

To speed things up, check you have enough free storage and clear out any unused apps or content, off-loading photos and videos to the cloud and deleting music. Aim for at least 2GB of free space.If your phone is worn out, broken beyond repair or no longer receives crucial security updates, it’s time to upgrade. The latest software, version iOS 18, supports devices back to 2018’siPhone XS/XR, so anything older should be replaced soon – though some older models may still receiveoccasional security updatesfrom Apple.What to look out for in a refurbBuying refurbished phonesis better for the planet and your wallet. The iPhone makes for an excellent refurbished phone, typically staying responsive for years and being supported with software updates for about seven years from release, or longer in some circumstances. That means you can use an older model for several years before it will need replacing.There are broadly two types of refurbished iPhone available: those refurbished andsold directly by Applethat come, essentially, as new, and those refurbished by third parties that come in various grades or condition – but cost less.Quick GuideA buyer’s guide to refurbished phonesShowSeveral third-party retailers offer refurbished phones, including the UK high street chainsCeXandGameand online stores such asmusicMagpieandEnvirofone. Marketplaces likeAmazonandeBayand refurb specialistBack Marketalso have a wide range. And some phone operators, includingO2,giffgaff,EEandVodafone, sell refurbished iPhones.The condition of the phone is among the most important things to consider before parting with any cash. This is graded as follows:Grade A– virtually identical to a new phone on the outside, usually with the original box and accessories. These are often customer returns rather than trade-ins and are the most expensive.Grade B– in full working order but typically with light scratches, dents or nicks, and may come with original accessories.Grade C– in full working order but visibly worn and typically sold without original accessories.Grade D– also known as “for spares and repairs” or similar. These are broken devices sold for people to fix or gut for parts.Once you’re satisfied with the condition of the phone, be sure to also size up the device’s:Battery health– batteries wear out, typically only maintaining up to 80% of their original capacity after 500 full-charge cycles (about two to three years of nightly charging). Has it been replaced?Charging port– check for signs of damage, as these are among the first parts to break.Buttons– do they all work without pressing too hard? Broken buttons make phones difficult to use and can be expensive to fix.Fingerprint scanner– is the fingerprint reader functioning as it should? Scratches or repairs can cause them to be faulty.Network locks– check the phone works with the provider of your choice, as some are originally sold locked to certain networks and must be unlocked before being used on another.Unauthorised parts– not all repairs are done by the manufacturer or using certified parts, which can affect performance.Check it isn’t stolen– check the phone’s 15-digit IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number against adatabase of stolen devicesthrough a service such asCheckMENDor similar.Warranty– what kind of warranty does the retailer offer on its refurbished phones?Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Do not buyAny model older than an iPhone 13, because you won’t get many years of software support before you’ll have to replace it.An iPhone 13 mini, unless it has a new battery. It had a relatively short battery life to start with and needed more frequent charging than larger iPhones, so its battery wears out faster.For more, readhow to make your smartphone last longerand thebest phone strapsSamuel Gibbs is the Guardian’s consumer technology editorThis article was originally published on 4 October 2024.

These are just some of the labels admirers and critics have attached toPavel Durovover the past decade.The Russian-born tech entrepreneur founded Russia’s version of Facebook before going on to create the messaging appTelegram, launch a cryptocurrency ecosystem and amass a multibillion-dollar fortune, all while clashing repeatedly with authorities in Russia and beyond.But much of Durov’s real story – and the logic that drives him – remains obscured.A new biography aims to change that.The Populist, by the independent Russian writer Nikolay Kononov, traces the 41-year-old’s rise from a St Petersburg schoolboy science prodigy to the founder of Telegram, one of the world’s most influential communications platforms, which has more than a billion users.Kononov describes thebookas the product of a 14-year attempt to map Durov’s strategy and mindset, drawing on conversations with Durov himself and people who worked with him, as well as rivals and critics.The book’s title, he said, refers to a thread running through Durov’s life: his desire to address Telegram’s millions of users directly, allowing him to bypass institutions, the press and any system of representation.“Durov is one of the first digital populists,” Kononov said in an interview, explaining that “from the very beginning, as soon as he started making his digital products, he programmed into them the ability to write and communicate his ideas directly to his audience.”.View image in fullscreenDurov delivering a keynote speech during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in 2016.Photograph: Albert Gea/ReutersBoth VKontakte, Durov’s first venture, and Telegram have at times pushed messages from Durov directly to all users, including users who had not opted in, outlining his libertarian worldview.“He sees himself as a visionary. And obviously wants to be heard,” the author said.That strategy has helped promote Durov’s central promise – almost absolute freedom of expression – even as Telegram has become a go-to tool for dissidents, extremists, scammers and war propagandists.If Durov’s public brand is built on libertarianism, Kononov says his private management style points in the opposite direction: power concentrated in one man’s hands, with few visible checks.“He is essentially the only one making all the product decisions at Telegram,” Kononov said. “Marketing, PR – it’s a one-man show.”The portrait he draws is of a tech founder whose worldview has not wavered over the years, remaining most comfortable within an ultra-libertarian, anti-institutional strand of the right that is often misogynistic and, at times, conspiratorial.“What surprised me most is that Durov hasn’t changed or evolved in all the years that I have interviewed him,” Kononov said.Durov is not an outlier, Kononov writes, but part of a broader new wave of moguls – most visibly in the US – who pair technological dominance with an outsized sense of personal mythology and a deep suspicion of government constraint.Like Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and Jeff Bezos, he has shown a strong interest inlongevityscience as well aspronatalism, the belief that having as many children as possible is a social or civilisational duty.Durov does not drink or use drugs, Kononov says, regularly dispenses spartan health advice – often alongside photos of him shirtless – and has said he hasfathereddozens of children through sperm donation.View image in fullscreenDemonstrators with an icon-stylised painting of Durov protest against the blocking of Telegram in Russia during a May Day rally in Saint Petersburg in 2018.Photograph: Olga Maltseva/AFP/Getty ImagesOne of the book’s most striking sections tells for the first time of Durov’s tense early meeting with President Vladimir Putin in 2013, held behind closed doors.Kononov writes that Durov described the encounter as a one-way conversation, in which the Kremlin leader reprimanded him over illegal content on Vkontakte and suggested that Durov leave the country.Under pressure from the authorities, Durov sold his stake in Vkontakte,left Russiaand eventually settled in Dubai, where he founded Telegram.But the clearest mark on Durov in recent years, Kononov suggests, came not from Russia but from France.Durov, who also holds French citizenship, wasdetainedand held for three days in France in August last year as part of an investigation into crimes linked to Telegram, including the circulation of child sexual abuse images, drug trafficking and fraudulent transactions.His detention came as a shock to the tech mogul. In interviews conducted in Paris after his arrest, Durov described to Kononov a harsh, disorienting ordeal – a permanently lit cell and little sleep – that rattled a man who had spent years insulating himself from the reach of the state.It also appears to have sharpened his hostility towards the west. Kononov says Durov now framesEuropeas sliding toward “total digital control”, and increasingly conspiratorial rhetoric.Most recently, Durov appeared to endorse a conspiracy theory promoted by the far-right blogger Candace Owens, suggesting that Paris was behind the killing of Charlie Kirk.“What interests me about Durov is that, on the one hand, he clearly has a very high IQ,” Kononov said. “But at the same time, he is prone to conspiracy theories.”Kononov is adamant, however, that Durov’s views should not be conflated with formal political allegiances.One of the most persistent claims surrounding Durov is that he is secretly aligned with Russian security services.But Kononov said that in the course of his research, he found no evidence that Durov has worked with, or on behalf of, the Russian state. “He has a huge number of flaws – but not the sin of Telegram acting as a backdoor for the FSB,” Kononov said.Kononov argues that what Durov has ultimately learned is the need to compromise – with both Russian and western authorities – when it serves his interests and allows Telegram to continue operating.Kononov recalls Durov once telling him: “I never waste time on things that are unnecessary or that cannot be useful to me personally.” That self-serving mindset, Kononov said, ultimately ended their personal relationship.About a year ago, the writer asked Durov whether he saw a contradiction between Telegram’s highly centralised, almost authoritarian internal structure and his professed devotion to freedom of expression. After that, Durov stopped responding.“He quickly realised it wasn’t going to be a book to his liking,” Kononov said.Explore more on these topicsRussiaEuropeBiography booksTelegramnewsShareReuse this content"

Though best known for that series of blockbuster military shooters, Zampella touched a huge number of lives – not only the hundreds of people who worked at the game development studios he led under Activision and EA, but the millions of people who played the games that bore his imprint.A lifelong gamer, Zampella had a Pong console as a child, then an Atari 2600 and a Commodore 64. Hetold IGNin 2016 that his favourite game from childhood was Donkey Kong: “I would spend hours at the arcade playing it.” Zampella’s first job in the industry was at GameTek in Miami, which specialised in video-game versions of popular US quizshows. He described his role on the small team as: “producer slash customer services slash tester – whatever needed to be done.”It was at a developer called 2015, Inc in Tulsa that Zampella had his first smash hit as lead designer. Medal of Honor: Allied Assault was the third title in the acclaimed series of second world war shooters, which had been inspired by Saving Private Ryan and written in conjunction with Steven Spielberg. Zampella had envisioned a new type of shooter with an epic, cinematic sense of immersion. The game was a bestseller, acclaimed for its globetrotting narrative and taut, tense action – especially during its thrilling depiction of the Omaha beach landing.He will be remembered as one of the most influential game designers of his eraWhen publisher Electronic Arts made the decision to take the development of Medal of Honour in-house, Zampella and his colleague Jason West left, together with Grant Collier, and set up Infinity Ward in Los Angeles. There they created Call of Duty, a second world war shooter designed to exceed Medal of Honor’s sense of epic drama – indeed, its original development title had been Medal of Honor Killer. Critically, the game featured a range of lead characters including US, British and Russian fighters rather than giving players control of a single “super soldier”. “It’s meant to show you that no one side won the war – it was an allied effort,” Zampella saidat the time.Once again, the emphasis was on dramatic set-piece battles on a vast scale, with the player surrounded by computer-controlled allies giving the impression of being a small part of a wider campaign. “We’re all about authenticity and intensity,” Zampella said. “We’ve strived to put as many guys on screen as possible. It’s about your squad, not you as a lone gunman.”View image in fullscreenCinematic intensity … Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2009).This emphasis on teamwork and cinematic intensity would become emblematic of Call of Duty. While two sequels remained in the theatre of the second world war, for the fourth title, released in 2007, Zampella and West decided to move into the modern era. The result, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, is one of the most important and influential first-person shooters ever made.Its campaign features a group of special forces operatives, including newcomer John “Soap” MacTavish and grizzled SAS captain John Price, taking on Russian ultra-nationalists and a Middle Eastern warlord. It had imaginative and exciting missions, including All Ghillied Up, a sniper mission in the wake of the Chornobyl disaster, and the eerie Death From Above, in which players control the various weapons of a C-130 aircraft, taking out enemies on the ground who appear merely as dots on an infrared screen. Meanwhile, the game’s online multiplayer mode brought new innovations including kill-streaks, which allowed players on a winning run to call in special attacks such as airstrikes. Infinity Ward created the template for multiplayer shooters that is still used today. Call of Duty’s DNA is present in every modern hit of the genre.I always felt he still had his greatest game ahead of him. It’s heartbreaking that we’ll never get to play itIn 2010, Zampella and West were fired from Infinity Ward by publisher Activision, and went on to form Respawn Entertainment, taking more than 30 Call of Duty staff with them. Under new publisher Electronic Arts, the company released Titanfall in 2014, a multiplayer-focused sci-fi shooter intended to innovate within the genre. The game emphasised the player’s freedom of movement, allowing for smooth, parkour-style navigation of obstacles and structures. Players were also able to call in and pilot giant, heavily armed mechs. As Zampella explainedat the time: “It’s taking the old paradigm of these shooter games being very grounded and two-dimensional and now adding this verticality to it and making it something that’s a new experience; something that people haven’t seen before.”View image in fullscreen‘It was an allied effort’ … Call of Duty: WWII (2017).Photograph: Rich Stanton/Call of DutyAfter splitting with Activision, Zampella advised several other game creatives who found themselves at odds with their publishers and were considering striking out on their own. One of them was Hideo Kojima, creator of Metal Gear Solid and, at his own studio Kojima Productions, the Death Stranding series. “When I was preparing to go independent myself, and maybe because he felt we were in similar situations, he took the time to listen to me, offered advice, and supported me in many ways,” wrote a “heartbroken” Kojima on X after Zampella’s death. “He even showed me around the studio. Even after he moved to DICE, whenever I went to Los Angeles, we would have meals together and talk about our respective futures”Titanfall’s sequel added an extraordinary single-player story to the original’s fluid online play – it is still one of the best shooter campaigns around. That series’ emphasis on smooth, seamless movement would also characterise Respawn’s entry into the battle royale genre: Apex Legends. Released with almost no pre-publicity in 2019, it would attract 10m players in its opening 72 hours and still maintains a place in the pantheon alongside Fortnite and Call of Duty: Warzone.Respawn next made two excellent single-player Star Wars games, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Survivor. Zampella’s peers have noted that working on the Star Wars franchise brought him and his colleagues at Respawn great joy.In 2020, Electronic Arts put Zampella in charge of the Battlefield franchise, with a remit to recharge the series after the disappointing performance of Battlefield V and Battlefield 2042. Released in October, Battlefield 6 was widely praised as a return to form, especially the online multiplayer modes. It sold 7m copies in three days, the best ever opening for the series.View image in fullscreenWorking on the Star Wars games brought Zampella great joy … Star Wars Jedi: Survivor (2023).Photograph: Electronic ArtsZampella will be remembered as one of the most influential game designers of his era and a ceaseless innovator in the first-person shooter genre – and with the Star Wars Jedi series, outside it. He was someone whom you always looked forward to encountering or interviewing at games industry events, an outspoken creative who cared deeply about video games and the player’s experience.“Vince was an extraordinary person – a gamer at heart, but also a visionary executive with a rare ability to recognise talent and give people the freedom and confidence to create something truly great,” wrote Geoff Keighley on X, who runs the Game Awards and, as a former games journalist, worked on a documentary about Titanfall with Zampella. “Even when it was difficult or uncomfortable, Vince never wavered in his commitment to honesty and transparency. He believed that the truth mattered, and he was willing to share it with the world. Vince cared deeply about doing the right thing. And even while working inside large organisations, he consistently pushed to put players first – to prioritise the experience, the craft and the people who played the games. He leaves behind an incredible legacy of work … I always felt he still had his greatest one ahead of him. It’s heartbreaking that we’ll never get to play it.”Explore more on these topicsGamesCall of DutyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But Terminator 2D is at its strongest when colouring outside the director’s linesRick LaneTue 23 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 23 Dec 2025 05.01 ESTShareLike Arnie’s pulverised cyborg at the end of T2, the Terminator franchise has lumbered on long past the point of being properly functional. Every film since Judgment Day has been a disappointment or an outright disaster, and its video game spinoffs haven’t fared much better. While some half-decent ones have emerged, such as 2019’s Terminator: Resistance, there hasn’t been a great Terminator game in about 30 years.So it makes perfect sense for Terminator 2D: No Fate to attempt to fix our broken future by travelling back to the past. Developer Bitmap Bureau appeals to the series’ heyday by retelling the story of Judgment Day through a medley of retro 80s and 90s playstyles. The result is a charming and frequently thrilling action throwback, though ironically it is at its strongest when it strays furthest from James Cameron’s film.Terminator 2D begins several years before the events of the film, charting Sarah Connor’s doomed attempt to sabotage Cyberdyne systems before her incarceration at Pescadero Hospital. These early levels, which see Sarah running and gunning her way through a gang of outlaws, police, and hazmat-wearing researchers, are among the game’s best. Bitmap Bureau does a remarkable job capturing Linda Hamilton’s gritty performance in a handful of pixels, while the scenarios eke impressive variety from simple arcade fundamentals.View image in fullscreenGaming greatness … Terminator 2D: No Fate.Photograph: Bitmap Bureau/ Reef EntertainmentThe momentum carries on into the future, where you spend a couple of levels fighting the armies of Skynet as adult John Connor in nuclear-blasted LA. Terminator 2D ramps up the spectacle here, with laser weapons and incendiary grenades deployed against Chrome-plated T-800s and several enormous mini-bosses. The section culminates in a thrilling boss fight against a flying Hunter-Killer drone, at which Bitmap Bureau throws all the fireworks its 16-bit aesthetic allows.No Fate loses some of its thrust once it catches up with Judgment Day. The midsection replicates key scenes from the film in playable form, such as the chase sequences that bookend the story. But these feel overly constrained by the game’s self-imposed limitations and aren’t very exciting to play. Better served are Arnie’s bar-fight scene and Sarah Connor’s escape from Pescadero, which employ beat ’em up principles and stealth respectively. While stylish and capably designed, these ideas deserve more room to breathe.T2D regains its earlier verve in its concluding levels, though the story reaches its denouement quicker than the actual film. Fortunately, as is always the case in Terminator, the end is not really the end. Like its arcade forebears, No Fate places heavy emphasis on replay value. Not only do its harder modes challenge you with adjusted enemy placements, completing the story mode unlocks new pathways that explore alternate futures hinging on Sarah’s choices.While No Fate doesn’t move the needle for Terminator games as much as I’d like, it succeeds in resetting the clock for the series’ interactive arm. It’s a pointed reminder that Terminator has gaming greatness within it.Terminator 2D: No Fate is out now; £24.99Explore more on these topicsGamesPlayStation 4PlayStation 5XboxPCNintendo SwitchNintendo Switch 2reviewsShareReuse this content"

But now, when it comes to Bari Weiss as the editor in chief ofCBSNews, there is no longer any doubt.A broadcast-news neophyte, Weiss has no business in that exalted role. She proved that beyond any remaining doubt last weekend, pulling a powerful and important piece of journalism just days before it was due to air, charging that it wasn’t ready. Whatever her claims about the story’s supposed flaws, this looks like a clear case of censorship-by-editor to protect the interests of powerful, rich and influential people.The tug-of-war over CNN shows how dysfunctional US media has become | Margaret SullivanRead moreThe 60 Minutes piece – about the brutal conditions at an El Salvador prison where theTrump administrationhas sent Venezuelan migrants without due process – had already been thoroughly edited, fact-checked and sent through the network’s standards desk and its legal department. The story was promoted and scheduled, and trailers for it were getting millions of views.I’m less bothered by the screw-ups in this situation – for example, the segment is already all over the internet as, essentially, a Canadian bootleg – than I am by her apparent willingness to use her position to protect the powerful and take care of business for the oligarchy. Which appears to be precisely what she was hired to do.Journalism is supposed to “afflict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted”, but Weiss seems to have it backwards.I can’t know what’s in her mind, of course, but I know her actions – her gaslighting about how it would be such a disservice to the public to publish this supposedly incomplete piece, and her ridiculous offer to provide a storied reporting staff with a couple of phone numbers of highly placed Trump officials.Weiss insists that the story needs Trump administration comment before it can run.But correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi has argued – eloquently and persuasively – that 60 Minutes repeatedly sought substantive comment and was turned down. In a memorable phrase, Alfonsi charges that if that’s an acceptable reason for spiking a story, it’s tantamount to giving the government a “kill switch” for any story they don’t like. Just refuse to comment, and it dies on the vine.It is also nonsensical of Weiss to suggest – again, gaslighting – that the piece somehow lacked sufficient newsworthiness because other news organizations had reported on the prison earlier.As if to counter this specious claim, a federal judge this week ordered the Trump administration to submit plans to return the migrants to the US or give them a hearing. This story is hardly old news.What’s more, hearing directly from an abused migrant on camera, getting his description of the torture and seeing the images of inhumane treatment is striking and newsworthy. TV brings it home, quite literally.Again, I don’t know what’s inside Weiss’s head – but I do know the context. In an unusual chain of command, Weiss reports directly to David Ellison, the son of Larry Ellison, a Trump buddy and one of the world’s richest people.The Ellisons control CBS’s parent company, Paramount Skydance, which is making an aggressive effort to buy Warner Brothers Discovery. They would have to overcome an offer from Netflix that has already been accepted.How? Well, federal regulators (and therefore Trump, who has expressed his interest) would, naturally, have some sway over who succeeds.The Ellisons surely wouldn’t want to antagonize anyone at this critical moment. And notably, if Paramount prevails, they would control CNN, and could do there what they’re doing at CBS News – they could install new editorial leadership that’s more agreeable. Trump has complained bitterly for years about CNN; this matters to him.Conveniently, there’s a blueprint available for how to cozy up to Trump by buckling. A few months ago, as an earlier Paramount merger was on the line, the company chose to settle a frivolous legal claim by Trump over 60 Minutes’ routine editing of a pre-election interview with Kamala Harris.Stephen Colbert, you might recall, termed this a “big, fat bribe”. Then his late-night show was canceled, effective next spring. Ratings, don’t you know?Bari Weiss is a weird and worrisome choice as top editor for CBS News | Margaret SullivanRead moreTrump received his settlement along with a side order of bragging rights, and a few weeks later, the Paramount merger went through. Yes, everybody got theirs – except the public and the CBS News staff.As editor in chief, of course, Weiss has the power to make the decision she did. That comes with the job.But it doesn’t make her decision right. It wasn’t. She’s damaged the institution she’s supposed to be the steward of and, far less importantly, hurt her own reputation. Inadvertently, she has also made sure that far more people are aware of this story, and the horrible underlying situation, than if the story had simply run as planned.At this point, Weiss ought to cut her losses, green-light the piece, and try to start acting like an editor – not like a cog in the machine of authoritarian politics and oligarchy.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsCBSOpinionTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

She is always on edge, vigilant to the slightest movement, fearful of sudden danger, and has learned to withdraw herself from the chaos in order to survive. She is keenly observant, sees through people around her who are not drinkers to decipher their underlying motives that might flare into unexpected menace, and practiced in passive aggression of which her interview with Vanity Fair is a classic case study.Wiles defines herself as the child of a raging drunk and it is through that singular lens of her formative experience that she defines her current boss. “I make a specialty of it,” she told the writer Christopher Whipple for hisVanity Fairprofile of the Trump White House chief of staff in one of the eleven interviews she granted him. Donald Trump, she stated, “has an alcoholic’s personality,” though he does not drink. She didn’t stop there, but elaborated that “high-functioning alcoholics or alcoholics in general, their personalities are exaggerated when they drink. And so I’m a little bit of an expert in big personalities.” Trump, she said, “operates [with] a view that there’s nothing he can’t do. Nothing, zero, nothing.”Saying Trump has an “alcoholic’s personality” reveals Wiles’ personal understanding about a megalomaniacal celebrity who fosters pandemonium around himself without any care for others. Her father, Pat Summerall, the great football placekicker and the play-by-play broadcaster of National Football League games on CBS for 40 years, was the original bad daddy. “Alcoholism does bad things to relationships, and so it was with my dad and me,” shesaid. She remembered him as a mostly absentee father and so drunk he “wouldn’t recognize” his granddaughter, which Wiles thought “horrifying.” Alcoholism, she said, is a “disease that clouds your judgment,” and no one, however smart they think they are can “out think addiction.” In 1992, Wiles and her mother staged an intervention to take him to the Betty Ford Drug Rehab Center. She gave him a letterreading, “Dad, the few times we’ve been out in public together recently, I’ve been ashamed we shared the same last name.” That is what she means when she says someone has an “alcoholic’s personality.”Wiles’ descriptions of several of the prominent figures of the Trump second term are cast as pathologies. “Vance’s conversion from Never Trumper to MAGA acolyte, she said, has been ‘sort of political.’ The vice president, she added, has been ‘a conspiracy theorist for a decade.’” Vancerespondedto her comment, “Sometimes I am a conspiracy theorist, but I only believe in the conspiracy theories that are true.” During the 2024 campaign, Vance was the chief proponent of the myth that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio were eating pet cats and dogs. Hejustifiedhis falsehood at the time: “The American media totally ignored this stuff until Donald Trump and I started talking about cat memes. If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that’s what I’m going to do.”Russell Vought, the planner of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 and head of the Office of Management and Budget, Wiles told Whipple, is “a right-wing absolute zealot.” And, he wrote, “When I asked her what she thought of [Elon] Musk reposting a tweet about public sector workers killing millions under Hitler, Stalin, and Mao, she replied: “I think that’s when he’s microdosing”. She claims Musk is “an avowed ketamine [user]”—an “odd, odd duck” and genius megalomaniac—“a complete solo actor”—another addict. (She latertoldthe New York Times that she didn’t have first hand knowledge of his Ketamine use, although Musk has previouslytoldCNN about his medical Ketamine use for depression).Wiles became Trump’s 2024 campaign manager out for blood. She wanted the head of Ron DeSantis. Wiles, a longtime political consultant in Florida, instrumental in the campaigns of Marco Rubio and Rick Scott, was hired in 2019 to right DeSantis’ floundering campaign for governor. Once he won, DiSantis’ wife, Casey, who saw her as a personal threat to her own influence, wanted her cut out, as a close associate of Wiles told me. DeSantis told the Ballard Partners lobbying firm, the largest in Florida, where she worked, to fire her or it would lose its access. She came aboard as chief of Trump’s campaign toeven the score. The campaign against DeSantis was intended not only to defeat him, but exact humiliation. He was depicted in TV ads eating chocolate pudding with his fingers. When he dropped out of the 2024 primaries, Wileswrotehim, “Bye-bye.” Trump promised, “I will be your retribution,” and he was for her.Appointed Trump’s chief of staff, she was hailed as his “Ice Maiden.” She would be a tough taskmaster to control the impulses and whims of a Trump White House who would brook no nonsense. But as she portrays herself in the Whipple interviews, she is invariably the innocent bystander at the circus presiding as an enabler.When she learns that Trump will pardon all the January 6th convicts on Day One, she tries to temper him. “I said, ‘I am on board with the people that were happenstancers or didn’t do anything violent.” “But Trump argued that even the violent offenders had been unfairly treated,” Whipple wrote. Wiles shrugs: “…I sort of got on board.”Wiles’ deputy, James Blair, acknowledges, “There’s so much ego and testosterone around her, there wouldn’t be any room for hers anyway.” She encounters Elon Musk, discovers his drug use and is surprised when he destroys USAID. “I was initially aghast,” she tells Whipple. Trump, she says, is ignorant of the workings of the government. “He doesn’t know the details of these smallish agencies.” She admonishes Musk, “You can’t just lock people out of their offices.” But she is run over. “And so with that attitude, you’re going to break some china,” she says. “But no rational person could think the USAID process was a good one. Nobody.” She does nothing.Then she concedes everything to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr.’s evisceration of public health and science. To Wiles, he’s another pathological case, “quirky Bobby.” But she develops rationales: “He pushes the envelope—some would say too far. But I say in order to get back to the middle, you have to push it too far.”Then she is overwhelmed by Stephen Miller’s crusade for mass deportations and ICE roundups, about whose cruelty she has quiet qualms. “I will concede that we’ve got to look harder at our process for deportation,” she says. She offers excuses about children with cancer and mothers being arrested at immigration courts: “I can’t understand how you make that mistake, but somebody did.” Who is “somebody?” Not the chief of staff.Trump orders the National Guard into cities across the country, prompting cities and states to file lawsuits that claim his actions are unconstitutional. But Wiles complacently suggests that it’s all for the best and will work out in the end. Again, she imagines a happy ending as she helps Trump. “And the idea was to right the ship and then slowly back off. And that’s what we’re doing.” But Trump is not backing off at all and the ship is listing badly.WilesblamesAttorney General Pam Bondi for the attention paid to the Epstein files. “First she gave them binders full of nothingness. And then she said that the witness list, or the client list, was on her desk. There is no client list, and it sure as hell wasn’t on her desk.” Wiles admits that she has read “the Epstein file.” “[Trump] is in the file. And we know he’s in the file. And he’s not in the file doing anything awful.” Trump “was on [Epstein’s] plane…he’s on the manifest. They were, you know, sort of young, single, whatever—I know it’s a passé word but sort of young, single playboys together.” Boys will be boys, even if they are in the 40s and 50s. She admits that Trump has lied about former President Bill Clinton being on Epstein’s infamous island, Little St. James, and any wrongdoing. “The president was wrong about that.” Oh, well.Wiles blames FBI director Kash Patel and his deputy Dan Bongino for the pathological obsession with the Epstein files—and JD Vance. “Because they lived in that world. And the vice president, who’s been a conspiracy theorist for a decade.” She blames deputy attorney general Todd Blanche for interviewing Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s convicted procurer, and transferring her to a lenient federal prison. “It was [Blanche’s] suggestion.” She adds about the transfer: “I don’t know why they moved her. Neither does the president.” The chief of staff is clueless.Wiles’ indiscretion by acknowledging that she has read the Epstein files and concluding Trump and Epstein were “young, single playboys together” may have potentially opened her to become a witness subject to subpoena by Epstein’s victims in their many ongoing lawsuits including against the FBI about any redactions in those files. Wiles may have waived whatever executive privilege she has by speaking on the record on the matter, which in any case is not about her internal communications with the president. She may be asked what she learned about what Epstein and Trump did together as “playboys,” whether the files contain evidence of a financial relationship, and whether Melania is named or depicted. Wiles could also be asked if she spoke about what she saw in the files to any other reporters or writers. She has potentially opened a world of trouble for herself.Wiles opened another can of worms for herself in the interviews when she was asked about Trump’s pattern of retribution in prosecuting his designated enemies. Wiles said in March to Whipple, “We have a loose agreement that the score settling will end before the first 90 days are over.” Whipple returned to ask her in August: “Remember when you said to me months ago that Trump promised to end the revenge and retribution tour after 90 days?” “I don’t think he’s on a retribution tour,” she replied. And then she conceded, “In some cases, it may look like retribution. And there may be an element of that from time to time. Who would blame him? Not me.” Certainly not her. But what about the prosecution of former FBI director James Comey without any evidence in a case that would be eventually thrown out of court? “I mean, people could think itdoeslook vindictive. I can’t tell you why you shouldn’t think that.” So, who is to blame after all if not Trump?Conducting her interviews with Whipple, she misled Trump. She walked out of a meeting with him at one point to see the Vanity Fair writer. “Is this an emergency, that you have to leave?” Trump asked her. “It’s an emergency,” she lied. “It doesn’t involve you.” If Trump didn’t think it was about him, she knew he would not care. He has an “alcoholic’s personality.” She has had a lifetime of tip-toeing around and hiding things from people like him.If any White House aide had behaved as Wiles did with Whipple, that staffer would be either severely admonished or dismissed by the chief of staff. But James Baker doesn’t live there anymore. As the chief of staff to the worst president in American history, Wiles ends her interviews concerned with distancing herself. “So no, I’m not an enabler,” she says. “I’m also not a bitch. I try to be thoughtful about what I even engage in. I guess time will tell whether I’ve been effective.”Wiles herself introduces the therapeutic notion of the “enabler.” The role is that of someone who does not intervene to curb an “alcoholic’s personality,” unlike as she ultimately did to stop her father’s self-destructive spiral. She still thinks of herself as the alcoholic’s daughter, who has the choices of acquiescing, enabling or intervening.As chief of staff, she has stifled her temptation to intervene. She knows it would be in vain and endanger her. In her interviews with Whipple, she presents herself as a manifestation of learned helplessness. But she may know instinctively that Trump, humiliated by her disclosures, might find a way slowly to humiliate her until she resigns. Or were the interviews themselves her retribution for the ineffectiveness he imposes on her?Sidney Blumenthal, former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln:A Self-Made Man,Wrestling With His AngelandAll the Powers of Earth.

That’s why they both want to destroy EuropeHenry FarrellandSergey RadchenkoLiberal democracies view Putin’s Russia as a bully – and Trump’s US as an angry drunk with a bazooka. The response is pure venomTue 23 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 23 Dec 2025 10.26 ESTShareThere are people who argue that Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine is not motivated by fears or imperial ambitions, but by other countries’ disrespect. Russia once commanded authority as one of the world’s two superpowers, but it has since forfeited that status. It knows it has lost the respect of other countries (Barack Obama famously dismissed Russia as just a “regional power”), and the Ukraine war is its way of winning it back.What is perhaps surprising is that Donald Trump’s turn against Europe has similar motivations. Putin knows his aggressive revanchism won’t win Russia any love among countries whose respect he craves. But if he can’t be loved, he hopes at least to be feared. If you are in a social order that regards you as inferior, you have every incentive to turn spoiler.So, too, Trump wants to disrupt a social order that regards him and his worldview with contempt. The US president and his officials get respect from dictators and kings (although perhaps not from the ones whose respect they most want – Putin andXi Jinping), but they know that the leaders of many other democratic countries look down their noses at them.Now it is America that wants to act as spoiler,smashing the existing hierarchyof respect to replace it with a world where Trump will get unqualified obeisance. Europe, with its emphasis on the rule of law and multilateralism, is the strongest remaining example of an entire system of prestige and values that the Trump administration wants to destroy.The irony is it was the US that built the world Trump is setting out to demolish. After the second world war, Washington developed a new global ambition. Republicans and Democrats shared a faith that a world built on American values would be better for America. It proclaimed that democracy and the rule of law were the ideals by which countries should be evaluated.Despite the obvious hypocrisy (the US itself regularly acted in illiberal, undemocratic ways and preferred to judge than to be judged), this was the cornerstone of American “soft power”; its ability to influence the world indirectly through culture and values. Other countries looked up to the US as a model to be emulated.ModernEuropewas the greatest creation of the old order. After the second world war, the US helped rebuild the economies of western Europe, fostering the success of liberal parties and often quietly undermining those it thought too far to the left or right.The European Union has historical roots in an arrangement created to coordinate US aid disbursed through theMarshall plan. As it grew, it built a new regime for Europe, based around cooperation between nations, the importance of law and liberal democracy. After Soviet domination of eastern Europe collapsed, the EU expanded to bring in countries to its south and east, on the condition that they internalised democratic principles. In many ways, the EU embodied the values of the US-created liberal order more than America itself.Now the Trump administration wants to break up the old order, replacing it with one founded on power and national self-interest. Its newnational security strategyproclaims it wants to “maintain the United States’ unrivaled ‘soft power’”, but that the path to doing it is through recognising “America’s inherent greatness and decency”. Trump boasts in his foreword to the strategy that, at last, ‘America is strong and respected again”.The problem is that this obviously isn’t true. Countries that still hold to liberal values absolutely do not respect Trump’s US. They treat it like an angry, incoherent drunk with a bazooka. You say whatever you hope might calm them down, but you certainly don’t respect them. American soft power and indirect influence over other democracies is shrivelling away.That explains why Trump’s national security strategy spends so much energy and venomdenouncing Europe. Even while the US ostentatiously renounces the ambition to change the world, it says it wants to intervene in Europe and transform it.Maga America wants to help European parties that it favours – but this time they are on the far right. Instead of promoting European cooperation, as the US did after the second world war, the Trump administration now hopes to turn discontent in the newer EU member states into a wedge against the liberal democratic values of the EU, turning Europe into a collection of sovereign nations, all strongly nationalist andculturally “white”.In this world, Europe would no longer be a barrier to Maga ideology. The challenge theTrump administrationfaces is that it simply does not have the capacity or global ambition to bring this transformation about.LikeRussia, the administration wants respect, but it doesn’t have the power to do much more than act as a spoiler. It wants to shape Europe more at the same time as it wants to engage with Europe less, retreating from its role as guarantor of Nato.The Trump strategy denounces the “massive military, diplomatic, intelligence and foreign aid complex” that has underpinned US global ambitions, and is doing everything it can to hollow it out. But without that complex, it isn’t going to be capable of reshaping Europe in its image.For sure, the Trump administration can use scattershot interventions to punish the European Union, while trying to help far-right parties to power. It is alreadydenying visasto people who have acted as factcheckers and social-media moderators, whom it accuses of censoring rightwing views, and threatening the EU for its temerity in regulating services such as X. But as the example of Brazil – where efforts topunish officialsand help Jair Bolsonaro have badly backfired – shows, that is as likely to hurt its ideological allies as to help them.The Trump administration wants the benefits of respect and global soft power, which is why it is going after Europe. But it also wants to retrench, cutting down its global capacities and remaking the US into a regional power like Russia which invests its strengths in bullying the countries in its neighbourhood. It can’t have both.Henry Farrell is the Stavros Niarchos Foundation professor of international affairs at Johns Hopkins University.

In 2021,Telstra, the now-privatised national telco, made all local and national calls from public phones free – as well as calls to Santa, which I guess count as “international”.Who had the trickiest job this year? The makers of joyful, uplifting Christmas ads | Zoe WilliamsRead moreTo many of the country’s mobile-absorbed population, it may have appeared an irrelevant nod to a fading technology, like being given a typewriter or top hat. But this overlooks what an important public good communication infrastructure like this is.Telecommunication devices enable social connection, they give us access to services, and they provide us with safety and security. This is something we often take for granted, but when refugees are forced to leave areas of conflict and often leave all their belongings behind, what they do hold on to is their phones. These are lifelines to keep them connected with families, and to enable them to find help when needed. The public good that phones provide is no doubt why, when Telstra was privatised, it was legally required to keep them operating as part of a universal service obligation.While mobile phones are ubiquitous in Australia, public phones are essential for some vulnerable groups like those experiencing homelessness, or for people whose devices are being used as weapons of coercive control. Beyond that, the ability to make calls without a mobile serves us all, as our communication safety net. There are recent, literally fatal examples of the failure of mobile networks in the direst of emergencies. Has your mobile ever run out of batteries or been lost or stolen? Do you have kids who do not have their own phones? What can you, or they do in an emergency?All in all, nice work, Telstra. But here is a bit of the story that often gets overlooked. Collecting and processing coins is expensive work. It had been costing Telstra around $6m to process the $5m slotted into their payphones. Making calls free just made economic sense.If you look around, there are plenty of other cases where the cost of making a public good free and/or universal is marginal, while the benefits are immense.Several cities around the world have been making public transport free or very low cost. They do this in part because the cost of collecting and policing fares eats up most – if not all – of the revenue collected. When free buses were introduced in Richmond, Virginia, it helped them stay on schedule (no more waiting to collect fares), and reduced law enforcement costs because there was no longer such a thing as fare evasion.Costs are not the only thing to consider, of course. Free or very low-cost public transport improves access and equity, and, as anyone in Queensland (where all rides cost 50c) will tell you, is really popular. They have even found that evasion has reduced significantly since fares were lowered.Social media makes many Australian teens feel worse about their bodies. Platforms must take responsibility | Zoe DanielRead moreExamples aren’t confined to transport. Around the world, jurisdictions have found offering free smoke alarms to be cheaper and more effective than broad campaigns. Many libraries stopped imposing late fines because fine collection was not only expensive, but it rarely encouraged people to return books (they would just stop showing up). San Diego Public Library was collecting US$675,000 in fees each year but had been spending nearly US$1m to collect them. Wales made all medical prescriptions free, and while the main aim was social equity and access, it was also argued it would significantly reduce administrative costs compared to the means-tested system. After the program proved a success, Scotland and Northern Ireland followed suit.Of course, many free or very low-fee public goods aren’t about being revenue neutral. That can be a great perk, but it isn’t what makes them “good”.This summer, Australians will swim at any beach in the country for free, go to free galleries and museums, use free or heavily subsidised sports facilities (including $2 swimming pool entry for those lucky Queenslanders), and cook up some dinner for family and friends on a free barbecue in the park.And then, call Santa to tell him all about it.Dr Cressida Gaukroger is an ethicist, public policy consultant and writer.Explore more on these topicsTelstraOpinionTelecommunications industrycommentShareReuse this content"

Why is Westminster derailing our plans in Leeds?Thomas ForthA long-promised tram network has been pushed back to the late 2030s – unless we build local, northern growth will be snuffed outTue 23 Dec 2025 11.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 23 Dec 2025 11.52 ESTShare‘As an unabashed socialist, I am concerned with the distribution of wealth, but if you don’t create any in the first place it is a bit of an empty discussion.” For a decade I’ve repeated those words of Richard Leese, who was for 25 years the leader of Manchester city council, in policy discussions across northern England. I have never slammed them down while shouting, “This is what we believe” as Margaret Thatcher did with Friedrich Hayek’s The Constitution of Liberty, but I might start.Greater Manchester, a city region with a population of nearly three million people, generates far too little wealth to make its redistribution a meaningful discussion. Unusually for a rich country, the taxes raised in Greater Manchester, just as in other city regions such asWest Yorkshire, Merseyside and the West Midlands, do not meet the cost of providing local public services. Taxes raised in the south-east of England cover the gap.The legacy of Leese, his chief executive, Howard Bernstein, and many thousands of people they worked with was to help Manchester work towards paying its way. Since 2004, as far back as the data goes, Greater Manchester has hadthe highest productivity growthof any other big city region in England.Transport has been a huge factor in that success. Metrolink trams started running in 1992 and the system has grown to become the most-used such network in Britain. The newly integrated and locally controlled buses and trams of the Bee Network are building upon this, by bringing people back to public transport after four decades of decline since Thatcher’s disastrous deregulation. There is still a long way to go: the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, is working to add some rail services to the Bee Network by the end of next year and has longer-term ambitions to build some form of metro – the city is the largest in Europe without any such system.In West Yorkshire, our mayor is also bringing buses back into local control, starting in 2027. But beyond that we have much less to celebrate. As Metrolink trams started running in Manchester we were deep into planning a three-linesupertram systemof our own. The UK government provisionally approved the scheme and funding for itin 2001.In 2004, Leeds Supertram was paused. Alistair Darling, then transport secretary, demanded a smaller and cheaper scheme and when amended plans were submitted a year later, he cancelled the project. His suggested alternative was a “state-of-the-art bus system”. A proposal was developed locally, committed to with national funding in 2012, and then cancelledin 2016.View image in fullscreenLeeds central bus station in March 2024.Photograph: Gary Calton/The ObserverOther investments in our region have met the same fate. Labour’s 2010 HS2 plans included Leeds. George Osbornebacked them in 2014and added plans for “Northern Powerhouse Rail” from Liverpool to Hull via Bradford on a new high-speed line. Those ambitions are long gone. HS2 to Leeds was first delayed and thencancelled in 2021along with a new railway through Bradford.The apology to our two cities was a promise to build West Yorkshire mass transit, a tram system linking Leeds and Bradford. Now, after four years of studies and consultations, that scheme was this weekdelayed by at least three years. Trams will not run in Leeds or Bradford before the late 2030s. We are promised that this remains a delay and not a cancellation, but we have heard that many times before.Poor connectivity is holding back our cities and our region. Opportunities in fast-growing sectors of theLeedseconomy – such as financial and legal services, health technologies and data processing – are accessible to too few people, especially at the start of their careers when in-person interactions matter most. Businesses grow less quickly, create fewer great jobs and leave too many talented people underemployed.Cultural venues such as the Halifax Piece Hall and the magnificently refurbished Bradford Live struggle to attract big enough audiences to cover their costs, and spread less joy as a result.As a result of delays such as this week’s, every big city region in Britain except London is in thebottom third of European cities for productivity. If we cannot fix how we build, we have little hope of turning that around.To fix this, we must fix how Britain builds. The details will be complicated, but the guiding principle of the solution is stunningly simple. We need the British government, its experts, and our national institutions, overwhelmingly in London, to get out of the way.We have seen this work in Britain. Manchester’s Metrolink extension to its airport was delivered on budget and a year early because Whitehall handed over the cash and let the local team build. In France, where such schemes are funded through local taxes and national legal barriers to building are much lower, things work even better. French cities build transport schemes, with their own money raised through higher local taxes, overtwice as quickly and at below half the cost.We should all be concerned with the distribution of wealth, but we should be at least equally concerned with the infuriating and longstanding barriers to having more of it to distribute.Thomas Forth is a co-founder and the CTO of The Data City, a 35 person tech company in central LeedsExplore more on these topicsTransportOpinionWest YorkshireLeedsNorth of EnglandYorkshirecommentShareReuse this content"

Is this a good idea?Tue 23 Dec 2025 10.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 23 Dec 2025 10.12 ESTShareIwas flicking through a photo album at my grandma’s when I came across a picture of my mum as a child. I took a photo and sent it to her, but on my phone screen, it looked brighter and more vivid than the physical version in my hand.Adding an Instagram filter is something I would now only do ironically. But is my phone increasing the contrast or making other tweaks without my knowledge? To find out, I downloaded an app with a “zero-processing” feature that claimed to take photos without any software alterations. When comparing the photos my camera takes automatically to the photos taken with this app, the results were shocking. The so-called “raw” photos that lack processing had subtle, muted colours, softer edges – a little grainy – while the processed photos were gorgeous and crisp like the inside of a marble. Why were they so different?The answer to this, like everything else these days, is machine learning, used by virtually every major smartphone-maker to enhance the photos taken with their cameras. Professional photographers have been aware of it for years, as you can readily see on Reddit, YouTube or Facebook. On Aurora-Hunters UK, enthusiasts accuse one another of “cheating” by using phone cameras that “automatically brighten the picture”. But outside these niche circles, it’s rarely discussed. We communicate, build relationships, advertise ourselves through our pictures – and yet they are being heavily manipulated without our knowledge. I told my friend about this on a walk, showed them the two photos side by side, and on the train home they said they “couldn’t stop thinking about it”. Tech companies are making decisions on our behalf about what our photos, and therefore our lives, look like.View image in fullscreenA photograph taken without processing (left), alongside the same, processed image.Photograph: The GuardianWe’re used to being lied to, and for new technologies to encourage an increasingly smoothed andyassified reality. It’s a common experience, needing to actively go to our phone settings to turn off smoothing effects on our faces. My sister freaked out when her phone automatically tried out a “jawline enhancer” on her front-facing camera, that she had to turn off.And while the newest phones always come with boasts about improved cameras, this is somewhat deceptive: due to “thinnovation”, phones are physically too thin for the hardware to change dramatically, so instead, it is often computer software that is improving our photos.These decisions, made by expert teams who are designing and programming our phone software, are not taken because they have a specific “photo look” in mind that they want to impart on the rest of the world – in order to control us, leading to world domination etc – but because they are seriously, and religiously, studyingwhat consumers want. As I take photos without processing, I come to prefer them to the lurid, creepily vibrant photos created by my phone’s permanent settings. I am not alone – everyone I ask, amateur and professional photographer alike, prefers photos taken on a film camera, or even digital camera, to photos taken on our phones. But do these musings and taste preferences matter when I need to capture something quickly? No.Consumers apparently want these bright, lurid photos. They want to be able to capture quickly, and still get non-blurry images. Consumers want their faces to look nicer in the photos, because it will make them feel better about themselves – but not too nice, not too edited, because it will seem fake. Tech companies want us on our phones more, and so making our photos more appealing, in a magpie-shiny-objects-way, is going to do that. This is when it starts to feel like a trap.Even before this kind of automatic processing, the way our photos looked was somewhat pre-decided. Sensors pick up light and behave in certain ways to create certain images. Lenses with specific traits inherent in them determine how colourful the picture comes out, so photos are, to a certain extent, cooked eggs, with huge amounts of processing involved already. The “look” of photos, even in the 1970s with Fujifilm, wasn’t necessarily in the control of the photographer.But there are obvious flaws with tech companies deciding what the “majority” preference is – how do they even decide such things? Consumer research? Data collection? Letting consumer desire – or demand – become the be-all and end-all for our products isn’t ideal. The short-term satisfaction given to us by our tech products has tended to cause long-term problems.My mum has recently been going through boxes of old photos that she hadn’t looked at in decades. There are a few that my grandad took in the 1960s – including one of my mum as a toddler, holding a tennis racket that is bigger than her own body, watched over by my grandma. I showed it to my grandma, who was overwhelmed that she had produced such a little “dote”, and couldn’t believe the young woman’s body in the foreground was hers. She told me how photos such as this are rare because it was typical of my grandad to take shots of views, rather than of his family – which made us laugh.My grandad was putting his personality into his photos – even if most of them were bad, or blurry, or failed to get his own wife in, at least they revealed a crucial element of him, some enthusiasm and eccentricity. Looking through these prints can tell a story about what he was like as a person.Whoever designs the tech, designs the image. With higher levels of control from tech companies – including embedded auto-processing that we cannot turn off – we begin to get narrower limits for us to express ourselves through our photos. When I look at them side by side, it’s undeniable that the processed photos are closer to the vibrancy of what I perceive as real life. They add a light or a sharpness that feels like it reflects what I see in the world around me. But what if that’s not what I want from my photos? If my grandad had grown up with a smartphone, what a bounty of wonderful, ultra-HD, glowy, vibrant photos of birds and planes he would have been able to take – but still, I can’t help but feel that that would have been a shame.Isabel Brooks is a freelance writerExplore more on these topicsPhotographyOpinionSmartphonesMobile phonesDigital mediacommentShareReuse this content"

What do the experts say – are these nutrition powerhouses or just chips in different shapes?What is freeze-drying?Freeze-drying involves rapidly freezing foods and beverages before removing the ice crystals and making them very dry using a pressurisation and vacuum process, explains Dr Fiona Willer, a lecturer in nutrition and dietetics at Queensland University of Technology. “For high-moisture, structured foods like fruits and vegetables this leaves them with a crisp, crunchy texture and minimal loss of volume. They can be stored at room temperature as long as they’re in a dry, airtight container.”Are freeze-dried foods nutritious to eat?“Yes, they’re basically as nutritious as they are in their original form,” Willer says.Longevity supplements are sold as helping prevent ageing. But do they have any long-term benefits or increase lifespan? | AntiviralRead moreThat’s because the process of freeze-drying leaves the cell structure of fruits and vegetables largely intact, so they are able retain much of their original colour, flavour and nutritional value, says Dr Daisy Coyle, a senior research fellow at the George Institute for GlobalHealth.“While some nutrient loss can occur, which seems to largely depend on the drying time, freeze-drying generally preserves more vitamins and antioxidants, including vitamin C, than methods such as dehydration or canning. It’s one of the most effective preservation methods available,” Coyle says.What about flavoured varieties?Coyle says products like veggie chips can be made with a lot of oil, which increases the fat content. “This means they’re nutritionally quite different from fresh or minimally processed vegetables, and shouldn’t be treated as a direct substitute. The flavoured varieties also contain salt, and some contain added sugars, so they are best enjoyed occasionally as a treat, rather than every day.”What should I know before trying freeze-dried fruit?“It can also be pretty fun to have the experience of eating, for example, a dry, crunchy fruit salad – the mouthfeel is completely different and the flavours taste a little different too,” Willer says. However, like all types of food preservation, freeze-drying has its place in a varied, healthful eating pattern, she says.Coyle says the biggest difference compared with fresh fruit and vegetables is the water content. “Freeze-drying removes almost all of it, making fruit and vegetables easier to eat in large amounts. While the light and crunchy texture can be deceiving, freeze-dried fruit and vegetables pack more fruit or veg into the same volume than their fresh versions. That means the same volume contains more natural sugars and energy, which is why being mindful of portion size is important.”Willer says people eating these should “remember your body needs fluids to function so keep an eye on your water intake. If you eat a lot at once you may end up with diarrhoea.” She also says people need to “make sure you brush your teeth well, as the powder form of the food may also be tasty to the plaque-producing bacteria in our mouths”.“Freeze-dried fruit and vegetables are also more expensive than fresh, so they’re not a realistic option for most people to get the bulk of their daily intake,” Willer says. “However, they can be a convenient and enjoyable way to help people meet the daily recommendation of two serves of fruit and five serves of vegetables.”Natasha May is a health reporter for Guardian AustraliaAntiviralis a fortnightly column that interrogates the evidence behind the health headlines and factchecks popular wellness claimsShare your experienceShare your experienceWhat health trend do you want examined?Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

My boys will wake me up at the crack of dawn then tumble downstairs, falling over each other, to find presents under the tree. As the tearing of wrapping paper cross-fades into screams of excitement, for a moment, everything feels exactly as it should. Except for one subtle difference: my children have never believed in Santa.This isn’t the result of an “I don’t want to lie to my children” ideology or some Scroogist attempt to be different. It’s a deliberate choice I have made, one that is rooted in fear. Behind the fairy lights and goodwill of Christmas lurk financial demands that many families cannot meet. According to a YouGov poll for debt charityStep Changeearlier this month, about one in three adults with children will struggle to afford Christmas this year. For many, the festive season brings anxiety, overdrafts and guilt rather than joy.Fed up with Father Christmas getting all the credit? Join the club | Suzy PrinceRead moreThis is not an accidental or unfortunate side-effect of Christmas. It is what I call “the Santa debt trap”, whereby a cultural myth does not encourage generosity, it creates a moral economy in which parents feel judged by their ability to buy. Christmas becomes a test, and going into debt is how many people pass it.Christmas is a weird time for me, as I grew up in children’s homes. It left a particular stain that no amount of therapy will erase. The feeling that I could lose everything at any minute has never quite left me. Security never feels entirely secure. It feels borrowed. Every year so far, despite being financially stable, I have lived with the quiet dread that this will be the year a crisisdestroys everything.I know where this fear comes from. Being a care leaver means living with the knowledge that if it all went wrong, there would be nowhere to go. No door to knock on, no kitchen floor to collapse on, no bed to sleep in. I have no place of last resort.That fear sharpens the cruelty of the myth of Father Christmas. We all know the story: “He’s making a list, checking it twice; gonna find out who’s naughty or nice.” This isn’t harmless fun, this is moral messaging backed by money. It tells children that all they need do is be good and their every wish will be granted regardless of the cost, and it puts immense pressure on parents who feel that a failure to deliver will shatter their children’s self-esteem.I decided early on that my children wouldn’t believe in St Nick because I didn’t want to hurt them. If money runs out, if a crisis hits, if Christmas isn’t affordable one year, what exactly am I supposed to say? Santa judged them naughty because of my lack of disposable income? No matter what explanation I give, that is what they’re going to believe. So I don’t blame the families who go into debt to avoid it.So far, I’ve been lucky. I’ve made Christmas work. People tell me I shouldn’t let my insecurities shape my children’s lives. Maybe they’re right. What they’re really saying is that I should quietly participate so my children don’t ruin their children’s magic. But I’ve seen the devastation this kind of debt does to families. There is nothing magical about that.Don’t get me wrong, Father Christmas still exists in my children’s minds because he’s unavoidable. He’s in school, in shop windows and on the lips of every adult they come across at this time of year. But we are truthful about who he is: he is part of a story people act out, no different from Halloween or fairytales. My children still feel the excitement. They get presents, but not too many. And crucially they know the truth: that their gifts come from their family, not a mythical old guy in a red coat with unlimited resources.I work in recording studios, which means I’m sometimes away for long stretches. My children don’t fully understand why. But they need to know that my absence has value, that my labour matters and that sacrifice has meaning. If I hand the credit for that work to a fictional man with a white beard, what lesson does that teach? Not wonder, but entitlement. Not gratitude, but detachment from reality.Christmas doesn’t need Santa to be joyful. What it needs is honesty. If a myth requires families to bankrupt themselves to sustain it, then it isn’t magic. It’s exploitation wrapped up as tradition. At a time when millions are struggling to survive, perhaps the most radical thing we could do this Christmas would be to stop pretending that poverty is a personal failing – and stop teaching our children that money falls down the chimney.Matt Taylor is a writer, music producer and author of the Underclass Hero Substack newsletterExplore more on these topicsChristmasOpinionPovertySocial exclusioncommentShareReuse this content"

But here’s why it’s importantJason OkundayeIt’s celebrity catnip, but beyond the headlines this is also a tale of family dysfunction. At this time of year, so many people know about thatTue 23 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 23 Dec 2025 13.34 ESTShareThere is not one saga I have been more invested in this year than the Beckham family feud. In case you are not as shamelessly showbiz-pilled as I am, this is a drama that parses like something between the parable of the prodigal son andCatherine de Medici’s tension with her daughter-in-law Mary, Queen of Scots.It seems that, after years of a trying in-law dynamic, relations between the Beckham family and their first-born, Brooklyn, and his wife,the heiress Nicola Peltz, have soured. Brooklyn has been repeatedly and conspicuously absent from all the family group shots on Instagram and, most notably, mumVictoria’s Netflix documentary, and dad David’s 50th birthday celebrations and knighthood ceremony (and if you know how long Dave’s beenauditioning for that honour, you’ll know that this was the biggest indicator of catastrophe).The roots of the feud allegedly lie in Peltz notwearing a dressfrom Victoria’s eponymous fashion label for her wedding (and an indication that the Peltz-Beckhams hadn’t been happy with the whole affair came when they renewed their vows just three years later, with some reports claiming that the Beckham family found out about it when the rest of us did). Throw in other factors, such as the Peltz family patriarch being aTrump-supportingbillionaire, the perennially directionless Brooklyn having had morerandom jobsthan Homer Simpson, and anoverzealous friendwho spills too much in online comments sections, and this all has the ingredients of a full-blown soap opera. Though I’ve also found it strangely affecting; every time Victoria (whom I love) made an Instagram post without Brooklyn, I found myself thinking: “Please, Brooklyn, just come back home!”It’s now reached fever pitch with Brooklyn blocking his entire family on Instagram – as revealed by his brother,Cruz, who responded to a Daily Mail storythat wrongly claimed that his mother and father had unfollowed their son. No more rumours, speculation, shady comments – finally a member of the firm has spoken directly, and acknowledged the drama that brands as well cultivated as the Beckhams’ are meant to ignore.Following this latest development, I had two thoughts. One more audaciously gossipy: if Cruz has finally spoken, in support of his parents, might we get a “Megxit”-style tell-all sitdown where Brooklyn and Nicola dish dish dish to get the upper hand on the narrative? The other is more sympathetic: that this family drama has exploded around Christmastime gets to the heart of why it’s been so compelling.View image in fullscreenBrooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz at a basketball game between the Los Angeles Clippers and the Denver Nuggets, 24 April 2025 Inglewood, California.Photograph: Allen Berezovsky/Getty ImagesAccording to reports(not that we need them to form that conclusion), Brooklyn will be spending his Christmas with the Peltzes, shunning an olive branch extended by David and Victoria. Where a grown married man spends his yuletide should hardly cause a stir, yet it being such a patent mark of the breakdown of their relationship is upsetting, isn’t it? The family home is a more intimate and fragile setting than Windsor Castle orL’Ami Louis. And I think it speaks to the emotions of this season that often go unspoken: that beyond the postcard pictures of togetherness and board games, family breakdown, dysfunction and absence are thrown into sharp relief during the Christmas period.I know this well. I love my family very much. But since my fatherpassed away in 2016, Christmas has been a challenge, and something I’ve viewed as an inconvenience and a painful reminder of how our family dynamic has been irrevocably changed. I still don’t like to open Instagram on Christmas Day to see all the smiling families with a healthy, greying man at the head of the table. What has abillionaire v millionairefamilywargot to do with my dead dad? Nothing much. Yet I think anyone can relate to that feeling of things not quite being the same, grieving lost relationships, or wondering if you’ll ever be happy during this season again. No doubt the Beckhams will still have a Christmas as wonderful as money can buy – they’ve been all smiles at their milestone events – but the occasion will surely be tinged with sadness and regret because of Brooklyn’s estrangement.Every Christmas since its release in 2021, I’ve watched Spencer, Pablo Larraín’s historical psychodrama set during Christmas of 1991, in which Diana, Princess of Wales (Kristen Stewart), contemplates leaving Charles and liberating herself from the royal family. Christmas is ultimately a festival for families whose members like each other and have no problems. Larraín’s Diana is an avatar for those with more complex feelings, who have moments of wanting to abscond from the table.Viewing Spencer has joined another private tradition of mine, which is to watchThe Muppet Christmas Carol, so I have one as a reminder of happier moments of my childhood, and one to absorb the feelings of seasonal melancholy. I’m sure the Beckhams will have their own ways of coping and, before this inevitably gets nastier, maybe they’ll find some solace in reflecting on when their unit was more whole.Anyway, all of this is to say that beyond the tabloid gossip, this feud has engrossed me this year because it’s been a very human story. I can’t get on my soapbox since I am, and will continue to be, the audience for this, but I can’t help but feel for the pain of having your family fallouts publicly picked over, with the rest of us trying to determine who the real villain is, and projecting our own narratives. So I’m wishing a good Christmas to the Beckhams, and all of us who face heartbreak over and over again this season.Jason Okundaye is an assistant opinion editor at the Guardian and the author ofRevolutionary ActsDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

A couple of days later I’m watching Educating Yorkshire when it happens again: one of the teachers tells his pupils to tidy up, lest their classroom look like one of its stores.Quite frankly, I’m sick of the slander. Sure, I’ve been in some branches that do look like a tornado has just blown through them. But, these days, they’re few and far between. My local TK Maxx, in a nice enough London suburb, is tidy and organised – so much so that when I hid a pair ofGood Americanjeans the other day to “have a think” and then circled back for them, they had already been moved.As someone with hoarder genetics, I do have to be careful about stocking up on things I don’t need. It happens sometimes at TK Maxx. I went in that day for a pepper mill and emerged with the aforementioned jeans; a pack of drawing pins with smiley faces on; a heart-shaped bag charm; an iPhone charger; and a stack of plates designed to look like vintage camembert boxes for all the cheese-themed dinner parties that I’m not having. In any case, it all came to half the price of my previous pair of jeans, bought from another high street store. And at least I put down the dressing gown, slippers, tray and notebook that I wasn’t totally sold on.At a time when everything costs more and more, its eclectic mix of end-of-the-line goods offers quality, but also a little joy. Whenever I shop there I think of the late Dawn Foster, the great housing writer and my flatmate for two years. She would often come back from its Brixton outpost laden with Mac lipsticks, Ren skincare products and brightly coloured knitwear, as well as picking up knick-knacks for me “just because”. It’s sometimes said that “little treat culture” is out of control. But when the treats are an affordable pick-me-up for generation rent and beyond, I say: let them eat 750g of pistachio cream panettone cake for £8.99.Hannah J Davies is a freelance culture writer and editorExplore more on these topicsShoppingThe hill I will die onSkincareMakeupFoodRetail industrycommentShareReuse this content"

The inevitable correction must prompt a global conversation about intelligent machines, regulation and riskTue 23 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 23 Dec 2025 12.05 ESTShareIf AI did not change your life in 2025, next year it will. That is one of few forecasts that can be made with confidence in unpredictable times. This is not an invitation to believe the hype about what the technology can do today, or may one day achieve. The hype doesn’t need your credence. It ispuffed up enoughon Silicon Valley finance to distort the global economy and fuel geopolitical rivalries, shaping your world regardless of whether the most fanciful claims about AI capability are ever realised.ChatGPTwas launchedjust over three years ago and became the fastest-growing consumer app in history. Now it has about 800m weekly users. Its parent company, OpenAI, is valued atabout $500bn. Sam Altman, OpenAI CEO, has negotiated an intricate and, to some eyes, suspiciously opaque network of deals with other players in the sector to build the infrastructure required for the US’s AI-powered future. The value of these commitments isabout $1.5tn. This is not real cash, but bear in mind that a person spending $1 everysecondwould need 31,700 years to get through a trillion-dollar stash.Alphabet (Google’s parent company), Amazon, Apple, Meta (formerly Facebook) and Microsoft, which has a $135bn stake in OpenAI, are all piling hundreds of billions of dollars on the same bet. Without all these investments, the US economy would be flatlining.Economic analysts and historians of previous industrial frenzies, from the 19th-century railroads to thedotcom boom-and-bustat the turn of the millennium, are calling AI a bubble.Altman has said: “There are many parts of AI that I think arekind of bubblyright now.” Not his part, naturally. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder, has called it a bubble, but the“good” kindthat accelerates economic progress. A good bubble, in this analysis, finances infrastructure and expands the boundaries of human knowledge. These benefits endure after the bubble bursts and justify the ruin of people (little people, not Bezos people) who get hurt along the way.The bullishness of the tech fraternity is a heady mix of old-fashioned hucksterism, plutocratic megalomania and utopian ideology.At its core is a marketing pitch: current AI models already out-perform people at many tasks. Soon, it is supposed, the machines will achieve “general intelligence” – cognitive versatility like ours – leading to emancipation from the need for any human input. Generally intelligent AI can teach itself and design its successors, advancing through mind-boggling exponents of capability towards higher dimensions of super-intelligence.The company that crosses that threshold will have no trouble covering its debts. The men who realise this vision – and the dominant evangelists are all men – will be to omniscient AI what ancient prophets were to their gods. That’s a good gig for them. What happens to the rest of us in this post-sapiens order is a bit hazier.The US isn’t the only superpower to have an interest in AI, so the Silicon Valley dash for maximum awesomeness has geopolitical implications. China has taken a different approach, dictated in part by the Communist party tradition of centralised industrial planning, but also by the simple fact of running second in the race to innovate. Beijing is pushing for a faster, wider implementation of lower-spec (but still powerful) AI at every level of the economy and society. China is betting on ageneral boostfrom ordinary AI. The US is gunning for an extraordinary leap in general AI.Since the prize in that race is global supremacy, there are few incentives for either side to fret about risks, or sign up to international protocols restricting the uses of AI and mandating transparency in its development. Neither the US nor China is interested in submitting a strategically vital industry to standards co-written with foreigners.In the absence of global governance, we will depend on the integrity of robber barons and authoritarian apparatchiks to build ethical guardrails around systems already being embedded in tools we use for work, play and education.Earlier this year, Elon Musk announced that his company was developing Baby Grok, an AI chatbot aimed at children as young as three. The adult version has voiced white supremacist views and proudly self-identified as “MechaHitler”. That flagrancy has at least the virtue of candour. It is easier to spot than the subtler encodings of prejudice in bots that haven’t been given the kind ofhard ideological steersthat Musk gives his algorithms.George Osborne has a new job in tech, and it doesn’t bode well for Britain | Chris Stokel-WalkerRead moreNot all AI systems are large language models (LLMs) like Grok. But all LLMs are vulnerable to hallucinations and delusions gleaned from the material on which they are trained. They don’t “understand” a question and “think” about it like a conscious mind. They take a prompt, test the probability of its key terms occurring frequently together in their training data and assemble a plausible-sounding answer. Often the result is accurate. Usually it is convincing. It can also be garbage. As the volume of AI-generated content grows online, the ratio of slop to quality in the LLMs’ diets shifts accordingly. Fed on junk, they cannot be trusted to disgorge nutritious information.On this trajectory a bleak destination comes into view: a synthetic pseudo-reality mediated by the sycophantic mechanical offspring of narcissist Silicon Valley oligarchs. But that isn’t the only available path. Nor is it necessarily the likeliest one. The irrational exuberance of the AI boosters and theircynical coupling with the Trump administrationis a familiar story of human greed and myopia, not a new stage in evolution. The product is truly phenomenal but flawed in ways that encode the deformed character of its progenitors, whose talents are salesmanship and financial engineering. They have built spectacular engines that prioritise a brilliant performance of intelligence over the real thing.The real bubble is not stock valuations but the inflated ego of an industry that thinks it is just one more datacentre away from computational divinity. When the correction comes, when the US’s Icarus economy hits the cold sea, there will be a chance for other voices to be heard on the subject of risk and regulation. It may not come in 2026, but the moment is nearing when the starkness of the choice on offer and the need to confront it becomes unavoidable. Should we build a world where AI is put to the service of humanity, or will it be the other way round? We won’t need ChatGPT to tell us the answer.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionSilicon ValleyMetaOpenAIAlphabetAmazonXcommentShareReuse this content"

But acts of courage and solidarity can point the way to a better futureTue 23 Dec 2025 13.30 ESTLast modified on Tue 23 Dec 2025 13.56 ESTShareIn one of his lastsermons, the great Christian theologian and philosopher Paul Tillich asked: “Do we have a right to hope?” As an army chaplain to German forces during the first world war and a refugee from Nazi Germany, Tillich had witnessed first-hand some of the horrors of the 20th century. But his answer to the question he posed in 1965 was yes. Nobody could live without hope, Tillich told his Harvard audience, even if it led “through the narrows of a painful and courageous ‘in-spite-of’”.Sixty years on, a similar spirit of defiant optimism is needed to navigate our own era of conflict and anxiety. The fourth anniversary of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is approaching, and dark political forces menace the social fabric of western liberal democracies. More widely, a fracturing multilateral order is delivering a more unstable and threatening world.According to areportpublished in June by the Peace Research Institute Oslo, the number of state‑based conflicts in 2024 was higher than at any time since 1946. In Gaza, the declaration of a ceasefire in October has brought partial relief. But amid the ruins, a suffering populationremainsscandalously short of food and cruelly exposed to the ravages of winter. In Sudan, a relentless and brutal civil war continues to be stoked by outside powers in pursuit of their own interests. The shocking terror attacks atBondi beachand in Manchester, and amercifully foiledIslamist plot to launch another attack on British soil, confirm a global rise in antisemitism following the Hamas massacre of 7 October and Israel’s war in Gaza.Across Europe, fear of conflict is more acute than at any point since the cold war tensions of the 1980s. In her first major speech as the head of MI6, Blaise Metreweliannounceda new “age of uncertainty” as Russia and other hostile states refine techniques of hybrid warfare. An end-of-yearaddressby the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, in which he suggested that Russia could attack the west within five years, reflected the increasingly febrile mood of the times.Yet it remains possible to find reasons in the present to believe in better human futures. The selflessness and remarkable courage shown by Boris and Sofia Gurman, a Jewish couple, and Ahmed al-Ahmed, a Muslim, in confronting the Bondi beach gunmen, was inspiring. So too the resolve and endurance of Ukrainians who have livedunderRussian bombardment since February 2022.In Sudan, the resilience anddedicationof local volunteers has kept community kitchens going across the country, offering a lifeline amid a desperate hunger crisis. As Tillichobservedin a radio broadcast during the second world war: “Love breaks out of the prison of individualism and nationalist stupidity. Love goes to another person, even one with a different language or of a different race, and returns from him richer.”A sense of the power of collective human endeavour will be felt in quite another way on Wednesday as millions tune in to the Christmas Eveserviceat King’s College, Cambridge. The choral beauty of theFestival of Nine Lessons and Carolsmarks for many households the true beginning of the season of peace and goodwill. But it too was conceived against the terrible backdrop of war.Eric Milner-White, who planned the first service as the dean of King’s in 1918, served, like Tillich, as an army chaplain on the western front. Now, as then, the world needs a message of hope in the darkness.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

What The End of an Era really told us about Taylor SwiftSwift’s six-parter charting her Eras tour began with some riveting revelations – but the drama ebbed away, leaving another piece of mere product for fansSimran HansTue 23 Dec 2025 12.04 ESTLast modified on Tue 23 Dec 2025 12.06 ESTShareIn the behind-the-scenes documentary seriesTaylor Swift: The End of an Era, the singer Florence Welch ascends to the stage to perform their duet Florida!!! to a crowd of 90,000 people. Welch later reflects on their duet at Wembley Stadium with a mix of awe and bemusement. “Taylor is my friend,” she says. “I know her as this very cosy person, and I came out of that lift and I was like, ‘Oh my God, it’s fucking Taylor Swift.’”If Swift is a cosy person, The End of an Era – now complete, with its concluding episodes dropping today – is certainly a cosy watch; the sort of lighthearted, low-demand viewing that feels especially welcome in the lazy days leading up to Christmas and stretching towards the new year. Viewers will be familiar with the story. The Eras Tour was great, it tells us. It broke records, burst hearts and boosted the economy. We know she pulled it off. This is only a problem insofar as it means there is almost zero jeopardy in the series, which feels repetitive and thinly stretched over its six hour-long episodes.Only the first episode offered true revelations, dwelling on a genuine moment of peril: the aftermath of afoiled Islamic State plotto target her three concerts in Vienna in August 2024, just over a week after three little girls were murdered at a Swift-themed dance class in Southport. Swift is clearly and understandably shaken, but wills herself not to break down in front of the grieving parents she has invited to the show: she is graceful enough to know it’s not a good look to make their loss about her.Much less significant, although still a good titbit, was the revelation that it was Swift’s mother, Andrea, who suggested she try dating a fun-loving athlete instead of another tortured poet, namely NFL star Travis Kelce after he said on his podcast that he was “butt-hurt” he hadn’t been able to meet her at an Eras show. The pair are now engaged.The trailer for The End of an Era – videoOtherwise, the choice to focus on the tour’s final months – essentially its victory lap – doesn’t particularly make for dramatic storytelling. In this chapter of the tour, Swift is in a happy and secure relationship, and it’s no wonder she had perfected the show with military precision after an entire year of performing it. There are blatant attempts to engineer tension where there is none. We see male dancer Whyley Yoshimura plucking up the courage to ask Swift if he can perform Ready for It?, which is usually an all-female routine (she barely bats an eyelid). There is a plotline concerning a new bodysuit for the Reputation section not being ready in time (it is). One day, Swift has a cough.There is too little to root for, and too few moments of challenge beyond the sheer superhuman endurance required to deliver a three-and-a-half hour show for 18 months (Swift’s admittedly impressive gym routine montage notwithstanding). Considering the reams written about the tour –the most successful of all time– The End of an Era gives very little insight into the emotional and practical considerations of how they kept this show on the road.So if we learned little in the way of definitive new information, what story did The End of an Era tell us about the world’s biggest pop star? As with most contemporary music documentaries, it’s an act of brand consolidation. Her devoted dancers, backing singers and session musicians are presented as one big happy “family”, but of course they are her employees, too. “It’s more than a job … I never want this to end,” says one singer, while a dancer remarks that her boss “has made us feel seen, worthy and treated with the utmost respect”, as Swift’s song It’s Nice to Have a Friend plays in the background. Much is made of the diversity of the dancers. It is well documented that Swift gave out a reported $197m in bonuses to the Eras tour crew. Is it necessary to show her employees receiving their cheques as a scene here?In one perhaps unwittingly revealing part, Swift glancingly mentions the two breakups that took place during the tour’s first run, without naming the men – firstly her partner of six years, the actor Joe Alwyn, and then Matty Healy of the 1975, with whom she had a fling as the tour was underway in spring 2023. “I didn’t feel like a person, but like a large conglomerate that no one sees as human, especially the men I was dating,” says Swift. But each shrewd decision she is shown making seems to underline the fact that she is indeed a corporation, and one with corporate interests.In the fourth episode, she remarks that the presidential election is in five days but that “the one thing I can provide for people is an escape, like nothing ever could or should ever bother any of us, and nothing will for three-and-a-half hours. I’m glad that I will have given just 100% girlhood and hope and belief and sweat and effort because that’s the job”. She mentions neither Donald Trump nor Kamala Harris, which feels pointedly apolitical, particularly given that she hadformally endorsed Harris, the democratic candidate, two months earlier.View image in fullscreenTravis Kelce (right) onstage with Swift at Wembley, 22 June 2024.Photograph: Gareth Cattermole/TAS24/Getty Images for TAS Rights ManagementYou don’t doubt the sincerity of her relationship with Kelce, pictured sparingly, but it’s also clear how mutually beneficial it is. Swift points out that, once their relationship became public, every 12th person in her audience was wearing a football shirt like his. It’s fun to glimpse her creative process as she secretly recorded this year’s albumThe Life of a Showgirlwith co-producers Max Martin and Shellback in Sweden between Eras tour dates – especially how boozy they seemed, with glögg and sancerre flowing – but the doc glosses over the fact that she made another album on this tour,The Tortured Poets Department, in the wake of the Healy debacle: presumably a more fraught process than the album celebrating her new love. It’s completely understandable that Swift didn’t want the narrative of her failed romantic relationships to overshadow the success and achievement of the tour, but she has offered less and less of herself as she has sold her fans more and more product, including this series.It’s telling that the most electric moments of The End of an Era are of Swift working out her surprise song mashups for the show’s solo acoustic set, which changed for each performance. In a nondescript backstage dressing room for the final night in Toronto, Swift works out how she’ll transition in and out of Long Live, New Year’s Day and The Manuscript on the piano, three particularly devastating examples of her gift for eulogising her own life. I could have watched six episodes of that – of scenes detailing the ease of her musicianship, and her ability to craft an emotional moment.Taylor Swift: The End of an Era review – as she breaks down over the terror plot, it’s impossible not to feel her painRead more“I specifically created this tour on a molecular level to make people feel that sense of escape,” says Swift, and it’s true that the Eras tour offered fans a powerful sensation of belonging. But a question the documentary doesn’t ask is what this kind of undertaking – one whose scale is so big, and whose emotional scope is so reflective, surveying her entire catalogue – offers Swift herself. Archive footage of her as an ambitious and musically talented girl reminds us that she has realised her childhood dream. But it’s not clear what it all means to her as an adult – beyond, once again, the business practicalities. Before the credits roll, text appears on screen saying that the tour’s financial success in part allowed her to buy back her master recordings – her project for the best part of a decade. I can’t help but wonder if there’s more to say.While the series is called The End of an Era, it is careful not to position Eras as a career pinnacle. At the end of the film, we’re told that The Life of a Showgirl, released 10 months after the tour ended, is her “most successful album yet”. Swift may be breaking new ground commercially, but artistically she has been treading water. In an early episode, she says that her goal with this tour was to “overserve” the fans, which is perhaps the show’s sharpest insight. This series, like all her recent output, is for those who are already onside: a shrewd investment with a guaranteed return.Explore more on these topicsTaylor SwiftDisney+Pop and rockDocumentaryTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s barely aged a dayJamie TramTue 23 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 23 Dec 2025 17.03 ESTShareFor romantic comedies and Christmas movies alike, a little misery can go a long way. No one understood this balancing act more than Billy Wilder, whose films ran the gamut from bottomless cynicism (Ace in the Hole) to gender-bending farce (Some Like it Hot). His 1960 film, The Apartment,splits the difference.Like another yuletide classic,Carol, the film finds inspiration in David Lean’s Brief Encounter, which depicts an extramarital affair briefly consummated in the bed of a friend’s apartment. In an old interview, Wilder says he was compelled by a character “who comes back home and climbs into the warm bed the lovers just left”, and so The Apartment’s hero, CC “Bud” Baxter, was born.North by Northwest: Hitchcock’s funniest, most ambitious filmRead moreBaxter, played by Jack Lemmon (hired right off the back of Some Like it Hot), is an insurance worker who scales the corporate ladder by leasing his bedroom to a rotating cast of middle managers. The concept isn’t far removedfrom an Airbnb, though Baxter weathers the additional humiliations of accommodating his superiors’ sexual conquests outside work. On one sorry occasion, a late request sees him stranded in Central Park on a winter’s night.Wilder didn’t necessarily conceive of the film as a comedy (at times, Joseph LaShelle’s shadowy cinematography more readily evokes noir), but in his own words: “When they laugh, I don’t argue.” Wilder and co-writer IAL Diamond’s playful plotting and staccato repartee keep the film from sinking into the gutter, and Lemmon remains endlessly likable while channelling Baxter’s nervous energy into a spectacle of physical gestures. Each dramatic reveal is offset by a similarly unforgettable joke, whether it’s Lemmon fussing over the placement of a bowler hat or straining spaghetti through a tennis racket.When Baxter develops an innocent crush on Shirley MacLaine’s elevator operator, Fran Kubelik, he unknowingly finds himself in competition with Jeff Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray), the company’s personnel director. Kubelik has sworn off Sheldrake after a summer fling (one of many that this family man has conducted within the office), but he lures her back into his arms when he dishonestly vows to leave his marriage for her. The same day, he offers Baxter a promotion in return for exclusive usage of his Upper West Side abode.View image in fullscreen‘Wilder frames [Baxter’s] workplace as an unending procession of desks and bodies, with production designer Alexandre Trauner making clever use of forced perspective tricks.’Photograph: United Artists/AllstarSheldrake may be a philandering emotional terrorist – at the time, MacMurray had become a Disney icon, leaving some audiences scandalised – but Bud discovers the limits to his downtrodden “nice guy” exterior when he encounters a passed-out Kubelik in his apartment on Christmas Eve.As Baxter and Kubelik finally get to know each other, Wilder works through the self-loathing at each character’s core. Kubelik struggles to believe she’s worthy of anything greater than a tryst with a man who leaves her a $100 note before returning to his wife and children for the holidays. Baxter lacks the courage to stand up for himself and risks numbing himself entirely to the spiritual corruption he’s become immersed in. To illustrate the point, Wilder frames his workplace as an unending procession of desks and bodies, with production designer Alexandre Trauner making clever use of forced perspective tricks.The Apartment at 60: is this Billy Wilder’s finest film?Read moreWith the film being made in the twilight era of the Hays Code, MacLaine embodies a more candid, less inhibited form of female sexuality than had been typically portrayed on screen. It’sa sweet, unconventional performancethat’s subsequently informed any number of manic pixie dream girls and alt-heroines; her ecstatic, new year’s sprint through the streets of New York has become the template for the romcom’s climactic dash towards destiny.In romance and business, ethics are always optional; as Kubelik muses, “some people take, some people get took”. Six decades on, its depiction of atomisation and alienation has barely aged; ill-advised workplace affairs endure, forms of self-commodification have multiplied, and insurance companies remain deeply evil.For anyone who finds themselves lonely on Christmas – or any other day of the year – there are few films more comforting than The Apartment.The Apartment is streaming on MGM+ in Australia and the UK and Fubo in the US, as well as available to rent globally.

The actor opens up about a year of success, struggle – and how she nearly became a footballerEmine SanerTue 23 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 23 Dec 2025 11.04 ESTShareFor a while, Erin Doherty ignored Stephen Graham’s calls. Not deliberately, she stresses with a laugh. “I’m just really bad at my phone. I’m such a technophobe, and he knew that,” she says. They had made the Disney+ showA Thousand Blowstogether, in which Doherty plays an East End crime boss in Victorian London, and Graham had talked about an idea he wanted to dramatise, about a teenage boy who is catastrophically radicalised by online misogyny. A couple of months after they’d wrapped A Thousand Blows, Graham and his wife and producing partner, Hannah Walters, kept trying to get in touch. “I was getting voice notes from him and Hannah being like, ‘Erin, pick up your phone!’” Doherty’s girlfriend told her to ring him back and Graham offered her the role in Adolescence. She said yes on the spot, without reading the script.Since it was screened on Netflix in March,Adolescencehas had nearly 150m views. It sparked a huge cultural conversation; it was shown in secondary schools and its creators were invited to Downing Street. Did they have any idea it would become such a phenomenon? “No, and I’m not sure you’re supposed to,” says Doherty when we speak. She is chatty and down-to-earth, even in the year her career went stellar. As well as starring in A Thousand Blows, her role in Adolescence – as Briony Ariston, a psychologist – won her an Emmy for best supporting actress. “But you do know when you’re a part of something that’s good and deserves to be seen, and we knew that about it. I think because it came from such a genuine place, a place of real purity and rawness, it [fed into] the making of it. From day one, it had that electricity.”Doherty’s episode – like all of them, it was shot in one take – is the most tense and revealing of the four-part drama. Her character is interviewing Jamie, the 13-year-old accused of murder, in a detention centre, in order to prepare a report before his trial. Initially, she worried about who they could possibly cast as Jamie. “It was the biggest ask I’d ever read for a young person,” she says. “But the minute we got into the rehearsal room, Owen [Cooper] knew his lines, and he wasn’t daunted or fazed by any of it.”View image in fullscreen‘It had that electricity!’ … Doherty with Owen Cooper in Adolescence.Photograph: Ben Blackall/NetflixDespite the subject matter, it was a happy shoot. The writer, Jack Thorne (with whom Doherty had worked on one of her first jobs, the musical Junkyard), was “so collaborative, and very much: ‘This needs to feel as real and raw as possible, so if there’s anything that doesn’t sit right, let’s change it.’ He’s such an actor’s writer, which is just so freeing.”They rehearsed for two weeks, then filmed two takes a day over several days. There was some self-imposed pressure not to mess up a take, but Doherty’s theatre background proved to be ideal training. Two takes a day was enough, she says, “because of the nature of what [director] Philip Barantini wanted to capture. He wanted it to feel dangerous and organic. Any more than that, and you’d kill it.”Doherty called on her former therapist, whom she saw from around 2017 and only stopped seeing recently, to prepare for the role. “I’m such a big advocate for therapy. I’d had years of admiration for this way of communicating.” Often, she says, screen depictions of therapists are flat, simply there to further the plot and the main character. “I think there’s so much more to them. They’re so skilled to operate between these layers that are going on in any exchange. I wanted to bring that level of humanity to her.” Briony is professional, but she also wants Jamie to show some remorse, some sign that he isn’t irredeemable. “It was interesting to me to put that friction on screen, because otherwise, it’s just one kid in a room, up against this armoured being. Therapists have feelings, and they do battle with their own judgments, so I wanted her to be struggling with that and a genuine investment in this kid.”The 50 best TV shows of 2025: No 1 – AdolescenceRead moreThat Briony is disappointed by the end of their session is somewhat of an understatement, which brings us to the moment where Doherty is almost upstaged by a cheese and pickle sandwich. Earlier in their session, Briony gives Jamie half her sandwich; by the end, shaken, she is visibly repulsed by it, indented with his teeth marks. Her reaction wasn’t in the script, but on that final take, the tension had “built and built. It really did something to me.” Still, she says: “We didn’t place much importance on the sandwich.” She laughs, then in mock actorly reverence: “OK, this is The Sandwich Moment!” Once the show came out, she was intrigued there were so many theories. “I guess on any given interaction, there are many things at play, and it was lovely people were giving it that amount of time to go into the detail of what that represented.”Doherty grew up in Crawley, where her dad worked at Gatwick airport and her mum was a receptionist. Acting was all she ever wanted to do. “I didn’t want a plan B,” she says. “I was just: ‘I don’t know how I’m going to live my life without this thing.’” She was also a talented footballer, scouted to play for Chelsea before acting took over. When she watched England’s women’s team retain their European title, did she have a twinge of envy, and wish she’d chosen that other path? She laughs. “No, because I would be on the [subs] bench day in, day out. They are phenomenal. I just love that they’ve become such a part of our culture and ingrained in our world. That makes me so happy.” Anyway, at the age of 33, she would be eyeing retirement from football now, rather than her acting career moving into the premier league. “I know I made the right choice,” she says with a laugh. “I’d be knackered.”View image in fullscreenDoherty in A Thousand Blows.Photograph: Disney+Initially, Doherty was rejected from drama schools, but she persevered and got a place at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. Did she carry that sense of rejection – even impostor syndrome – into early jobs? “That was definitely a part of it,” she says. “But I think there’s something really helpful about rejection, and it is part of being an actor – you don’t get every job you want.” In the third and fourth seasons of The Crown, Doherty played Princess Anne – she was brilliant, easily as wonderful as Olivia Colman as the queen, and Helena Bonham Carter as Princess Margaret. “I spent so long just staring at these people being like, ‘Oh my God, you’re amazing’,” she says. This year, she says, has felt a bit more of a shift, with the success of Adolescence and A Thousand Blows. And next year, Doherty plays the lead in Hugo Blick’s BBC drama California Avenue, which also stars Bill Nighy and Bonham Carter again. “Maybe I do feel a little more settled. It’s been lovely going into jobs being more excited about collaborating and being creative, rather than, ‘Oh God, I really hope they don’t want to fire me’. That voice is getting quieter.”She says she has been “massively inspired” by Graham, as an actor and as a producer. “I think what he’s done with Hannah Walters is incredible, and also his relationship with Jack Thorne. If I could develop those relationships with writers and producers, and can be a part of making stories that [have been] under the radar, that would make me so happy.” She is, she says, “massively passionate about queer stories. That’s something that needs to be mined for more complexity. I also want to be led by what’s going on in the current culture and by what our reality is.”Doherty had experience of this before Adolescence, with last year’s playClosing Time, the final part of the Death of England trilogy (which began in 2014 as a Guardian-commissioned microplay), in which race, class and what it means to be British was explored, all performed on a stage resembling the St George’s cross. This was the summer that England flags appeared, amid a surge of rightwing support. “I wish we were doing [the play] now,” says Doherty. “I love period dramas, but there is something so necessary about putting on pieces of work that are culturally present.” It was an unnerving experience, she says of her role as Carly, “playing someone who didn’t think they were racist. I had to present as someone completely unaware of these things that they were saying, and my own true self was having to be squashed. I wasn’t in a great place after playing that character.” But it taught her, she says, that “you do have to get out of your own way and tell the stories that need to be told at that moment in time”.This was also the year Netflix’s “casual viewing” genre got more attention – the shows whose makers know audiences are only half-watching, their eyes also on their phone or something else, and so require simple plots and obvious exposition. Adolescence, with its real-time slowness, intense dialogue and brilliant performances, required concentration. As a huge hit, it shows audiences can be persuaded to put their phones away. Doherty hopes others will follow. “I hate the idea that [the distraction of phones] is going to be a component in a creative mind. That, to me, is like the death of art. So yes, I hope this flies the flag for having faith in our audiences. People don’t want to be spoon-fed and they don’t need to be. We’re way smarter than a lot of stuff out there thinks we are.”What does she hope is the lasting impact of Adolescence? “I hope that it continues to be talked about,” she says. “Without being a wanky actor, the dream is that you reach through the screen and you speak to people, and so I hope that people keep going back to it, and keep having those conversations.”A Thousand Blows is on Disney+ from 9 January.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He is able to show us beauty and despair, and the beauty in despair and the despair in beauty. The best track to me is Islands of Men, which builds over this hypnotic instrumental while Winter sings about isolation and self-illusion. Other highlights would be the title track and Half Real, which feels like a dizzy, intoxicated folk song. Geese are the next big thing.Freddie, 18, SurreyLily Allen – West End GirlI loved the wordplay, delivery and melody. The slightly detached layered vocals really sounded like a person in shock recounting what has happened to them. So good to hear an imperfect person tell their own stories. And I forgot how funny Lily Allen is! More imperfect women, please.Alison 37, IrelandPicture Parlour – The ParlourThe Liverpudlian rock outfit’s debut EP was worth the wait. Singer and front-woman Katherine Parlour has such a distinctive voice and guitarist Ella Risi leads the charge with infectious riffs and ripping solos. With an almost baroque and art-rock feel, the album is both uplifting and nostalgic, with plenty of reflection on the journey which has got this under-appreciated duo (and their backing band) to this point. Having seen them in the tiny Windmill in Brixton, I think it is only a matter of time before they are commanding far larger venues.Eddie, LondonSelf Esteem – A Complicated WomanView image in fullscreenHonesty … Self Esteem, AKA Rebecca Lucy Taylor.Photograph: Rosaline Shahnavaz/The GuardianThis album has been on constant rotation. Rebecca Lucy Taylor’s lyrics are full of honesty, humour, sincerity and despair, set to snarly synths, gorgeous choral arrangements and sing-along stadium belters. I was lucky enough to see Self Esteem in concert earlier this year and this album is made for live performances. The drama and emotion evoked from songs such as The Deep Blue Okay and Focus Is Power hits harder live, with a room full of people shouting along through smiles and tears. Rebecca and her incredible family – and they really do feel like they’re a family – of singers, dancers and musicians are so relatable, funny, raw and empowering. She deserves to rule the world.Jacqui Martin, 50, Exeter, DevonBrooke Combe – Dancing on the EdgeThis album has been on constant repeat since its release in January 2025. So much talent in the performing and songwriting. British soul has never sounded so good. The album has a brilliant 70s vibe throughout with no filler tracks. This Town and LMTFA are outstanding songs.James McElhoney, 65, HalifaxNinajirachi – I Love My ComputerNinajirachi started making music because of YouTube. Now she’s up for eight Aria awardsRead moreThis album is like a modern day Phil Spector Wall of Sound creation – except it’s mostly an Australian woman and her computer. She imagines what a computer would like and desire, and builds a sonic world around that – complete with throwback disk drive sounds. The listener comes to feel actual emotion and, at the same time, nostalgia, for the beeps and boops of the titular computer.Anthony D’Orazio, Pennsylvania, USADijon – BabyDijon is a truly unique artist who is stretching the boundaries of what maximalist R&B can be. He uses texture, imperfect samples, time changes and layering to brilliant effect on his second album. This is a sonically glitchy and cracked yet deeply melodic record that almost takes pleasure in trying to hide the hooks that are, in fact, everywhere on tracks such as Yamaha, Baby and Higher! Recent co-writes with Justin Bieber and Justin Vernon – and snagging bass legend Pino Palladino to help out on most of the tracks on Baby – shows just how high Dijon can go.Christian Gibson, South Coogee, AustraliaFlorence and the Machine – Everybody ScreamView image in fullscreenSoaring … Florence Welch.Photograph: Linda Brownlee/The GuardianI’ve played this almost obsessively since its release. Initially I was captured by Sympathy Magic, which channels Dead Can Dance’s Lisa Gerrard, and The Old Religion, featuring the kinds of soaring vocal hooks Florence Welch is known for. But on re-listens, I particularly like the storytelling around a couple revealed in Music by Men and One of the Greats with its angry take on the music industry. The album explores power, the supernatural and the concerns of people in relationships. One of her best creations.Sara, 43, Melbourne, AustraliaTaylor Swift – The Life of a ShowgirlI nearly chose Florence + the Machine’s Everybody Scream or Wolf Alice’s The Clearing (their best album yet). But who am I kidding? There is one album I have been obsessed with for the last two months and that is Taylor Swift’s The Life of a Showgirl. I wake up singing “Elizabeth Taylor!” I dance throughout the day to an ear worm of Opalite. I shed a tear to Ruin the Friendship whenever I think about it. The Fate of Ophelia has been the song of the year and a viral sensation – quite rightly.Anna Harries, OxfordClipse – Let God Sort Em OutThe album starts with an emotional, hard-hitting song about the recent deaths of their parents and the album continues to build from this, with excellent production by Pharrell and great bars from Malice and Pusha T. The album also has incredible features from artists such as John Legend, Tyler, the Creator and Nas. Overall, the album is one of the best rap albums of the decade, showing the immense talent of Clipse more than 15 years after their previous album.Lewis Johnstone, 22, ScotlandEl Michels Affair – 24 Hr SportsClairo producer Leon Michels’ diverse and genre-bending project blends soulful hip-hop beats and classic soul, with a dusty production that at times recalls the likes of MF Doom and J Dilla. Clairo returns the favour by providing guest vocals on one of the album’s highlights. A real gem.Sean, ManchesterLord Huron – The Cosmic Selector Vol 1I only discovered Lord Huron last year and quickly fell in love with their very unique style of music, which blends storytelling and atmosphere to create a true listening experience. Sometimes listening to their albums almost feels like a podcast considering how well they are constructed and how seamlessly each song transitions into another. The accompanying extra media also often hints at a greater story that weaves through every one of their albums. On listening to their previous albums, I also noticed recurring motifs, or little melodies that returned on this record, which gave me a whole new appreciation of music that I already thought was amazing to begin with.Juliet Gentle, 21, AldershotCMAT – Euro-CountryMy favourite was a vinyl copy of Euro-Country by CMAT. It is a lament of a time in Ireland when we thought there would be no end to the prosperity – the Celtic Tiger. How wrong we were and how well Ciara Mary-Alice Thompson captures the highs and lows of that era in a poppy, heartfelt non-nostalgic way. A pure joy.Ger Thunder, Dublin, IrelandLoyle Carner – Hopefully!The songwriting is certainly the gem of this project; parenting and its dynamic with being an artist are major themes, and Carner impresses yet again with the rawness of his words. There are highs and lows that show the beauty and joy of being a father, while also revealing the doubt and self-criticism that arise after we forget that this is our first time on this rodeo, too. The instrumentals complement the message beautifully, creating a rich and wonderful soundscape: smooth and soft breakbeats, hints of synths, and dreamy pianos chirping in at all the right moments. It’s quite pleasing to listen to.Akram, 23, Sunshine Coast, Queensland, AustraliaJerskin Fendrix – Once Upon a Time… in ShropshireView image in fullscreenMasterful … Jerskin Fendrix.Photograph: Tim GuttFor his second album, Joscelin Dent-Pooley crafted a beautifully emotional masterpiece that weaves nostalgia for simpler childhood times with current grief and future anxiety. The sound is both baroque and folksy, simple and complex, from the wonderful opening salvo of Beth’s Farm to the skronky skat of Jerskin Fendrix Freestyle, to the sadness-cracked baritone of Mum & Dad. It’s no wonder he is Yorgos Lanthimos’s go-to man for his soundtracks. That it all holds together as a cohesive and involving whole is a masterful tightrope walk. The emotional heft is deeply personal but also universal, celebrating family, friendship and the wonders of life should you take the time to look around.Tom Bristow, 49, Blandford Forum, DorsetBlack Country, New Road – Forever HowlongEvery time these guys have released an album it’s been my album of the year – which never happens: not even Björk managed that. I love that they’ve changed style again and now sound almost nothing like the band from For the First Time. I love the harmonies. I love how hard the songs hit once they hit. I love watching a band grow. I love how even now, I can hear new bits in the songs. I want to be friends with this band but I’m not cool enough.James, CroydonBig Thief – Double InfinityDouble Infinity cemented itself to my soul and became the soundtrack to my trip of a lifetime to Minneapolis. It slotted into a retro 70s houseboat on the Mississippi, it cheered along to No Kings day. Adrianne Lenker’s voice is treacle, reminding me of how precious love is. I felt loved by Minneapolis and I only need to hear the first few bars of this album to be immediately transported back there.Sue Cattanach, 65, BrightonOklou – Choke EnoughOklou’s Choke Enough has been my No 1 ever since I first heard it. It’s the album I keep going back to. So catchy, so joyously uplifting, I’m never not in the mood for it. Highlights include ICT, the greatest song ever about an ice-cream truck, and Harvest Sky, a witchy dancefloor-filling banger.Chloe, 40, Perth, AustraliaYHWH Nailgun – 45 PoundsI was reading Pitchfork’s weekly album summary and they described the use of rototom on this record, I immediately knew I had to listen to it. I turned it on in the kitchen, and my wife immediately asked: “What is this crap?” The album is beautiful and the percussion is so wild. Just when you think you’ve caught the rhythm it all collapses in on itself. I saw them at Green Man in the summer, and it’s impossible to dance to, but there were some young kids singing along to every unintelligible word ...Matt Jollands, 40, TauntonExplore more on these topicsMusicBest music of 2025Pop and rockHip-hopIndieSoulfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Well, sort of – the meta video, in which an egomaniacal Chalamet proposes they “highlight international cooperation” by painting both the Statue of Liberty and the Eiffel Tower a “very specific shade orange”, satirizes the tedium of movie marketing desperate to get people in seats, while also introducing a harebrained marketing strategy that’s unabashedly thirsty to get people in seats.Marty Supreme review – Timothée Chalamet a smash in spectacular screwball ping-pong nightmareRead moreThe “leak” heralded an unconventional and extremely committed press campaign forJosh Safdie’s 50s-set ping-pong epic that has turned movie marketing – so often formulaic, cloying or apathetic – into eye-catching performance art. “Movie marketing is trying to be passive, trying to be chic,” Chalamet says in the video, for which he wrote the script. “We’re not trying to be chic.”Not chic, perhaps, but certainly entertaining. In the weeks since Chalamet pitched “fruitionizing” Marty Supreme via big orange blimp (the “vehicle representation of American greatness”), the actor and studio have been somehow bothunpredictable and everywhere. Among the highlights: staged pop-up screenings with Chalamet flanked by bodyguards sporting giant orange ping-pong balls for heads; a near-wordless Instagram live that introduced the refrain “Marty Supreme Christmas Day” to the masses; an ad campaign in which the so-called Goats (Greatest of All Time) of various fields, from Tom Brady to Bill Nye to Misty Copeland, wear a branded windbreaker – “the defining garment of 2025”, according toGQ– for an ad campaign that exhorted people to “dream big”; a mock talent competition with Chalamet and the ping-pong bodyguards as judge; and, of course, a bright orange blimp above LA, with journalistson board. (As of this writing, the Statue of Liberty remains green, but A24 did get the Sphere in Las Vegas to that very specific rust shade.) The hype for an unreleased, original ping-pong movie was sky high even before Chalamet memorablydebunked rumorsthat he’s moonlighting as an underground rapper namedEsDeeKid, when he appeared in amusic videofor a remix of the masked Liverpudlian’s hit 4 Raws.It all makes for easily the most idiosyncratic, unhinged and genuinely enjoyable press run in a year when the movie press run often seemed like it had run out of road. And it appears to be working – in limited release in New York and Los Angeles ahead of the holidays, Marty Supreme scored thebiggest per theater averageopening for a film since 2016, a promising start for A24’s most expensive feature to date, with a budget reportedly around $60m. That’s a rare spot of good news for original theatrical releases this year, which have by and large failed to connect with audiences despite marquee movie-star wattage. Even with top-tier talent making the traditional rounds, films such asA Big Bold Beautiful Journey(Margot Robbie and Colin Farrell),The Smashing Machine(Emily Blunt and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson),Roofman(Channing Tatum and Kirsten Dunst),After the Hunt(Julia Roberts and Andrew Garfield),Good Fortune(Keanu Reeves and Seth Rogen),Kiss of the Spider Woman(Jennifer Lopez) andAnemone(Daniel Day-Lewis, in his first film role in eight years),struggled to attract peopleto theaters in recent months.There are, of course, numerous macro reasons why it’s more difficult than ever for original and/or indie films to compete in a market dominated by remakes, reboots and franchises: the decline of the movie star, for one, as well as the proliferation of streaming and the many, many second screens competing for audience attention. But the Marty Supreme press coup underscores just how important, as well as confounding and inconstant, the work post post-production has become. Many a celebrity and their marketing managers have been bedeviled this year by what Vulturetermed“the New Media Circuit” – the vast, unofficial constellation of celebrity-friendly podcasts, video series and outlet-affiliated gimmicks sought by movie marketers for the vaporous goal of activating the internet.These days, a traditional (“passive”) movie campaign – late-night show anecdotes, junkets, gauzy profiles in a respected outlet – isn’t going to cut it, even when the star at hand is as funny and game as Jennifer Lawrence. (No amount of charm offensive on Hot Ones could get people to see her dark psychodrama Die, My Love.) Winning the attention wars is no guarantee of success, either; Sydney Sweeney was in plenty of headlines and social media posts this fall, but her boxing biopic Christy flopped spectacularly.Fallen stars: why are Hollywood A-listers flopping at the box office?Read moreIn the rules of the new media circuit, there is no guaranteed success, only volume and a willingness to try new things … which is, unfortunately, how you end up with A-list movie stars like George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio on a podcast hosted by the Kelce brothers. (Perhaps that helped get the dudes out to see F1.) In a beyond over-saturated media environment, the name of the game is surprise and memorability. Ryan Coogler’s Sinners, the highest-grossing original film since 2010 and indisputably theindustry highlight of the year, ran a decently standard press campaign, and thrived on exceptional word of mouth.That, and a sincere pitch for the continued existence of original cinema, which equates the purchase of a ticket with a defense of the arts at a critical time. “I believe in cinema,” Coogler wrote ina thank-you noteto Sinners viewers. “I believe in the theatrical experience. I believe it is a necessary pillar of society. To see your response to the film has reinvigorated me and many others who believe in this art form.”Chalamet, already adept at the New Media Circuit from last year’saward-worthy campaignfor the Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown (in which he crashed his own lookalike contest in Manhattan, out-called the sports analysts on College Gameday, fooled around with Brittany Broski, rode a Lime Bike on to a red carpet and taught dude-bro podcaster Theo Von about government-subsidized arts housing), has taken film appreciation as press crusade to the next level. In his handful of more traditional stops on this very untraditional press blitz – the Tonight Show, Good Morning America, BBC Radio – Chalamet has framed all of his extra-ness as in service of independent, original films in theaters. “This is the easiest sell, for me to come here,” hetoldJimmy Fallon, before imploring viewers “you will not regret it” directly to camera one.“People’s attention spans are so short these days ... How do you convince them to go to the cinema, to spend money to see a film, rather than waiting to stream it illegally, or for it to be available on Netflix?” hesaidduring a different junket stop. “I have an audience, so I engage with them, and I give it 150%.”Time will tell if Chalamet’s 150% will make the difference between a social media hit and a cinematic one. But I can’t knock the effort, as a supporter of original film and of press tours being less rote and overwhelming at the same time. Not every film can pair extremely game movie star with sellable pitch with solid cause, and also make it fun. But here’s to hoping others pick up the new marketing playbook in 2026.Explore more on these topicsTimothée ChalametMarty SupremefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Is it just a retro affectation – or does this physical connection strengthen our relationship to music?Tue 23 Dec 2025 07.55 ESTLast modified on Tue 23 Dec 2025 08.00 ESTShareAirPods changed my life. I was previously a user of excellent but somewhat cumbersome Audio Technica over-ears, but Apple’s wireless headphones – dinky in their construction, finicky in their setup, temperamental in their ability to actually work – liberated me from cords. My listening habits are, at best, frustrating for the people around me: when you write about music, you have to listen to the same things over and over, and sometimes those things are very bad. Suddenly I could listen to a terrible new pop record or an ominous drone piece while making breakfast or folding laundry late at night without fear of disturbing my housemates by listening from a speaker. I kept my Audio Technicas but built out my collection of AirPods; now I use the wireless in-ear ones while commuting and also have the over-ear AirPods Max.For a while, though, I’ve been thinking about moving back to wired earbuds. At some point, doubts about the joyous wireless future I was living in began to creep into my head. I am conspiracy-prone, and started to wonder what all that Bluetooth was doing to my head. I thought aboutthe security issues that come with Bluetooth. And after a fall from a Lime bike on a slippery road, I started thinking about ways to avoid all future falls, one of which was to cycle without listening to music or podcasts.Most of all, I wondered whether my ability to listen to music constantly was making me value it less. When you have to listen to music occupationally, your standards necessarily get higher – a lot of music really is quite samey – but is my ability to listen on my minute-long walk to check the mail really beneficial, or is it simply turning art into ambient noise? And that is to say nothing of the way wireless headphones seem to turn communal spaces such as cafes and sidewalks into thoroughfares for individuals. These problems theoretically exist for users of wired headphones too, but I can’t say I ever considered headphones antisocial or anti-art until AirPods came along.I’m clearly not the only one. I see more and more people, especially people around my age, rocking the classic white iPod-associated earbuds instead of the previously ubiquitous AirPods. Celebrities and politicians such as Bella Hadid, Zendaya, Dua Lipa and Kamala Harris use them, as do a lot of musicians I know. When New York magazine published its annualReasons to Love New Yorkissue last week, it featured stars such as Debbie Harry, Cameron Winter and Subway Takes host Kareem Rahma sharing wired earbuds on the cover, because photographer Hannah la Follette Ryan had noticed more and more people listening to music that way on the subway. You see the same casual intimacy on the tube in London and on buses. The other day I even saw a teenager recreating the ultimate symbol of cool of my youth: two white earbuds dangling from the inside of his collar.Feel good … Apple’s Gorillaz-soundtracked ad for iPods in 2005.Although there is undeniably some swaggy retro appeal in wearing wired headphones – especially dinky white ones, which allow Gorillaz-loving zoomers, of whom there are many, to relive the era of the Feel Good Inc-soundtracked iPod ad – I think the return to cords was likely born out of a desire for simplicity and economy. The facts of being young right now – just of beingaliveright now – are that wages have stagnated as prices have gotten higher and rent has become exorbitant. AirPods cost £99, wired Apple headphones are £17: the moment you lose an AirPod – or, as once happened to me, drop one as you leave a bus and look on in horror as the bus slowly rolls over it – you realise that they are emphatically a luxury product, not the everyday essential they may have seemed when you were using them to tune out a rowdy toddler on said bus. As with streaming, or TikTok, or next-day delivery, luxuries we’ve had access to for only a few years can seem indispensable when there’s actually evidence to suggest the world functioned a whole lot better before we had all these things.That wired headphones are experiencing a resurgence is heartening – it may be a bellwether for a society ready and willing to slowly divest from all the crutches it uses every day. (I hope ChatGPT is next.) On the other hand, it could mean nothing except that 18-year-olds have just discovered the aura-increasing capabilities of white rubber-coated wire and PVC. Either way, I am ready for our corded future. When I go Christmas shopping this week, I certainly know what Shaad is getting.Explore more on these topicsMusicHeadphonescommentShareReuse this content"

It’s what the cinema was made for. It looked amazing; its sound was so rich and textured; and the juke joint dance sequence was a genuine WTF surprise that could have been grim but was utter genius. And if you haven’t seen it, please stay for the scene that comes mid-credits: it has to be my favourite five minutes of film all year.Michael, ManchesterPillionPillion blew me away – no pun intended. I’d expected it to be sexy and subversive but it’s a much bigger film than that. We saw it in a pretty full cinema and it felt like all of us were realising that fact together – the first laughs sounded surprised, mine included – but as the film revealed itself, it was clear we were all firmly on side. I left with a massive grin on my face and won’t shut up about it to anyone who so much as mentions a motorbike.Izzy, LondonBlue MoonView image in fullscreenAndrew Scott as Richard Rodgers and Margaret Qualley as Elizabeth Weiland in Blue Moon. Described by our reader Martin McDonald as ‘sharp and witty’.Photograph: Sabrina Lantos/PAI’ve seen 156 films at the cinema this year, 114 of them new. My favourite, rather surprisingly to me, was Blue Moon. It’s just fabulously well done. The premise – lyricist Lorenz Hart trying to come to terms with the end of his professional partnership with composer on the opening night of Rodgers’s and Oscar Hammerstein’s first smash hit musical Oklahoma – is inspired. The script is sharp and witty and the acting superb, especially from Ethan Hawke as Hart, Andrew Scott as Rodgers and Margaret Qualley as Gary’s would-be love interest Elizabeth Weiland. I expect all of them to get Oscar and Bafta nominations, as well as the film itself getting nods for best picture and best original screenplay.Martin McDonald, 60, ManchesterIf I Had Legs I’d Kick YouEvery aspect of the film gripped the audience in terrifying, magnetic ways, up until the climactic final scene. Never leaving Rose Byrne’s captivating performance and never panning to the daughter until the very end, the film captured a side to parenthood that we do not often see represented in media: the particularly devastating toll it takes on one’s capacity to see and deal with the world around oneself, as parent or child.Jonny Lawrence, Ithaca, New YorkNickel BoysNickel Boys is a wonderfully evocative, Malick-style film that effortlessly gets at a depiction of interiority that is so rarely achieved; a literary adaptation that is completely cinematic. A truly unique experience, emotional and thoughtful without descending into the sort of brutality that often punctuates this kind of story. A triumph.Sean, 33, LondonView image in fullscreenTom Basden and Carey Mulligan in The Ballad of Wallis Island, described by our reader Seán Gorman as ‘absolutely gorgeous’.Photograph: Focus Features/PAThe Ballad of Wallis IslandThere have been some superb films this year but The Ballad of Wallis Island takes it for me. Absolutely gorgeous, great soundtrack – and who knew Tim Key could act so well?Seán Gorman, 43, Galway, IrelandWicked: For GoodThe end of the yellow brick road, this film did not disappoint in concluding the emotional rollercoaster that the first film started last year. The more Q&As, interviews, podcast episodes I hear and conversations I participate in, the more I am impressed with every single element of this film. No detail, no motivation, no frame was taken for granted, leaving us with a powerful and incredible experience that changed me for good.M, California, USAOne Battle After AnotherOne Battle After Another is a stunning film with a host of compelling themes about modern America and indeed the world running through it. It’s funny, surreal and frightening. A real treat.Gary Ingrey, 66, Wisbech, CambridgeshireF1It’s difficult to choose, but I really enjoyed F1 the movie. As a keen motorsports enthusiast, I found it was light yet captured elements of the tactical side of racing that are often overlooked. The “experienced” veteran v newbie “dismisser” story also gave me a laugh.Raymond, 58, Kildare, IrelandThe Ice TowerWith its hazy colouring, late-60s setting and fairytale inspiration, The Ice Tower is steeped in a world of nostalgia, making for an easy favourite. Jumping off from The Snow Queen, the film also recalls the temporal uncertainty of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, and the visions of A Matter of Life and Death. Much as The Snow Queen left me as a child, The Ice Tower bound me in chilling wonder.Lauren, 28, LondonOslo Stories TrilogyMy favourite this year was the Oslo Stories Trilogy from writer turned director Dag Johan Haugerud; three films that present a long, meandering meditation on love in its different forms. Beautifully written dialogues and soulful understated acting; just really moving slices of life without the usual bombast. I loved the visual themes too; the stairs inDreams, rooftops inSexand river-quay vistas inLove. Some of the characters appear in all three films, and as a whole the Stories reminded me of Kieslowski’s Three Colours. From the 100 films or so I saw this year, this trilogy really stood out.Ariela Flusser, LondonView image in fullscreenGuillermo del Toro, left, and Oscar Isaac on the set of Frankenstein. Our reader Sylvia Rowe said it was the film adaptation she had waited her life to see.Photograph: Ken Woroner/APFrankensteinFrankenstein byGuillermo del Torois the best film of 2025. I think he did a spectacular job of showing the creature’s empathy towards others and his anguish at being a “monster”, and Jacob Elordi gave a masterly performance. The cinematography was gorgeous, as were the costume design (Kate Hawley is a genius!) and set designs. Alexandre Desplat composed a fitting original score that added childlike whimsy to what could have been considered gruesome scenes, which put me into Victor Frankenstein’s mental state as he was crafting his creation and helped me see his process through his eyes. Oscar Isaac was well cast as the tormented creator and Mia Goth was perfect as the loving and benevolent Elizabeth. This was truly the Frankenstein film I’ve waited for my whole life.Sylvia Rowe, 58, Tennessee, USATrain DreamsTrain Dreams is a beautifully made meditation on life. It’s told with excellent performances throughout, with Joel Edgerton delivering a career best.Patrick, IrelandA House of DynamiteView image in fullscreenRebecca Ferguson in A House of Dynamite. ‘A gripping thriller,’ says our reader Richard Western.Photograph: Eros Hoagland/PAA House of Dynamite is very well written, directed and edited. Excellent cast. A gripping thriller that emphasises the hard truth about the dangers of nuclear weapons in our time. Fictional, but factually accurate.Richard Western, 86, Oregon, USABlack BagBlack Bag is an interesting story that felt almost like a whodunnit. I enjoyed the atmosphere, the scenery and the wonderful cast.Jane, South EastTornadoTornado is a revenge western set in an imagined 18th- t0 19th-century Scotland, with a Japanese hero whose father is a samurai, and who may or may not be a samurai herself. It’s made on film, 90 minutes long. What’s not to like?Tim Bradshaw, DevonThe Perfect NeighbourThe true crime genre has morphed into a standardised, boiler-plate format, forgoing nuance and empathy for schlock and sensationalism. But Geeta Gandbhir’s The Perfect Neighbour bucks this trend through the meta lens of a true found-footage film. Such a cinematic choice risked being contrived, but it gives the film a profound and disturbing power. Despite exclusively using bodycam and CCTV footage, the film’s POV is almost a character in its own right – lingering on scenes and tableaux that resonate. The image of an empty chair in a police interview room, with a handwritten note resting by its leg, will haunt me for a long time.Matt, medical writer, MacclesfieldNouvelle VagueMy favourite film this year is Nouvelle Vague by Richard Linklater. The movie narrates the pre-production and filming of Breathless by Jean-Luc Godard. I went to see it thinking it would be another biographical film filled with cliches and nostalgia about the golden age of French cinema. Instead, it was incredibly witty, funny and heartwarming, with great performances by unknown actors and a really creative and interesting approach to the story that mixes reality with fiction. It was the surprise of the year!Victoria, 22, AthensThe KingdomView image in fullscreenGhjuvanna Benedetti in The Kingdom. ‘Raw and intense,’ says our reader Catherine Laz.Photograph: hi-Fou-Mi Productions/PAThe Kingdom shows a very little-known aspect of Corsica outside France. I’m from Brittany so I totally understand the pride Corsicans feel about their territory and culture. This film was made by Julien Colonna, the son of the head of the Corsican nationalist movement, Yvan Colonna, who murdered Claude Érignac, prefect of Corsica. This film centers around the raw and intense relationship between the head of a clan and his rebellious teenage daughter. They go on the run when their hiding place is discovered. It can only end badly because it’s a story of endless feuds, violence and revenge. It reminded me of As Bestas (The Beasts), another movie about culture clashes. The French government is largely unable to control the situation, and autonomy for the region may be the only solution for this fiercely independent territory.Catherine Laz, 63, LondonCaught StealingThis movie is a throwback not only to its sweating hotdog ofa 1998 New York setting, but also to the kind of film it is. A film where a flawed character gets in an unimaginably horrible situation through no fault of their own and just makes everything worse at every opportunity. I love these kind of movies, the evil Alice in Wonderland story where characters descend into the veins of a living city underworld with a hero ill equipped to overcome any of it (Austin Butler loses a kidney in the first 12 minutes). The film shines in its set pieces, balancing its farcical elements with action. It is, above all, incredible fun. It will join the pantheon of films I put on when I get home from the pub.Tom Crozier, Melbourne, AustraliaExplore more on these topicsFilmBest films of 2025Guillermo del ToroSinnersWicked: For GoodNickel BoysA House of DynamiteOne Battle After AnothernewsShareReuse this content"

Here’s our full countdown of the very best television of 2025More on the best culture of 2025Tue 23 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTFirst published on Wed 10 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTShare50-4150The Last of Us(Sky Atlantic/Now) TV’s best ever video game adaptation screamed back to life with the year’s most traumatic killing off of a beloved character. Losing one half of the show’s central duo was no easy thing to move past, but The Last of Us morphed into a touching meditation on grief, loss and the pain of love left unspoken – with added mushroom monsters.What we said:“A gutsy and thoughtful rendering of humans on the edge.”Read more49All Her FaultView image in fullscreenNo one is more watchable … Sarah Snook and Dakota Fanning in All Her Fault.Photograph: Peacock/AP(Sky Atlantic/Now) Is anyone as watchable as Sarah Snook? Her performance as Marissa, whose son Milo was kidnapped when she thought he was on a play date, was an absolute powerhouse as we’ve come to expect from the Succession star. It started with the most profound fear a parent can face, before it turned out to be even worse: orchestrated from within her own inner circle. But the plight of Dakota Fanning as her friend Jenny, trying to navigate the incessant hell and guilt of being a working mother, was relatable and affecting too. Together, they deepened this thriller into something far more intriguing.What we said:“All Her Fault is fantastically well done. All the carefully planted seeds come to fruition. All the narrative cogs turn and interlock fast and seamlessly. You come for the terrifying premise and stay for the absolute pleasure.”Read more48The Last Musician of Auschwitz(BBC Two/iPlayer) This exceptional film told the extraordinary story of the now 100-year-old cellist Anita Lasker-Wallfisch, the only surviving member of the women’s orchestra at Auschwitz. First-hand testimonies – including from the stoic, straight-talking subject herself – plus archive footage and musical performances merged to show the emotional turmoil of prisoners playing beautiful music in a hellscape, as well as tiny glimmers of resistance.What we said:“This incredibly impressive programme does not let us forget about Auschwitz’s corpse mountains or stench of burning bodies for a second, all the while posing questions about art and humanity that should ring in your ears for years to come.”Read more47Apple Cider VinegarView image in fullscreenA tissue of lies … Kaitlyn Dever as Belle Gibson in Apple Cider Vinegar.Photograph: Ben King/AP(Netflix) A remarkable true story, superbly told; this series dramatised the rise and fall of Belle Gibson, an Australian woman who established herself as a “wellness guru” by falsely claiming to have mitigated cancer via dietary tricks and alternative medicine. The truth was simpler: Gibson didn’t have cancer and her career and persona was a tissue of lies. Kaitlyn Dever’s portrayal of Gibson was admirably nuanced; she’s deeply dishonest but also desperately needy and in denial about the consequences of her actions, not least for her followers, some of whom relied upon her hokum to combat life-threatening conditions.What we said:“A fast, drily witty, acutely intelligent, compassionate and furious commentary on greed, need, mass delusion, self-deception, the exploitation of the credulous and the enabling of insidious new forms of all of these by technology.”Read more46The ResidenceView image in fullscreenCharmingly good fun … The Residence.Photograph: Erin Simkin/Netflix(Netflix) Something terrible has happened at the White House! No, not Donald Trump’s new ballroom extension but a fictional murder at the heart of American power. This funny, quirky whodunnit starred Uzo Aduba as Cordelia Cupp, an eccentric detective (she’s a keen birder, dresses entirely in brown tweed and frequently utilises her binoculars for work purposes) sent to solve the case. It’s charmingly good fun – essentially a country house murder mystery with added snark and West Wing trappings.What we said: “A gorgeous, gleeful romp.”Read more45Common Side EffectsView image in fullscreenAn absolute triumph … Common Side Effects.Illustration: Adult Swim(Adult Swim/Channel 4) Has Mike Judge ever made a bad show? This is the question it was hard not to ponder while watching this impeccable animated thriller-comedy. The plot? A fungi expert discovers a mysterious mushroom that seems to cure all illness, and ill-advisedly tells his childhood crush Frances – who now works for big pharma. The resulting high-octane deep-state drama was a blackly humorous adventure with real heart that satirised the state of healthcare in a capitalist society. An absolute triumph of TV-making.What we said:“Not merely the best thing I’ve seen on TV this year but one of the best shows I’ve seen in my life.”Read more44Gaza: Doctors Under Attack(Channel 4) The film the BBC couldn’t broadcast. Thanks be, then, to Channel 4 for stepping into the breach and airing it – for this was an essential document of our times. Its unsparing look at the targeting of Palestinian medics showed a pattern that has emerged over the past two years at hospitals across Gaza. First, they are bombed. Then, they are raided and doctors detained and tortured. Then, when their workplaces are reduced to rubble, the cycle starts on the next hospital. The testimony by Dr Khaled Hamouda, whose home was bombed, killing most of his family … before a drone strike mere moments later hit the supposed safe house his remaining children had escaped to, was an unforgettable piece of television that really needed to be aired.What we said:“In an open letter before its broadcast, Channel 4’s Louisa Compton warned that Doctors Under Attack would ‘make people angry, whichever side they take’. She is right. This is the sort of television that will never leave you.”Read more43Am I Being Unreasonable?View image in fullscreenDangerously addictive … Daisy May Cooper as Nic in Am I Being Unreasonable?Photograph: Simon Ridgway/BBC/Boffola Pictures(BBC One/iPlayer) This riot of marital, sexual and social awkwardness (with a side order of murder and betrayal) came courtesy of Daisy May Cooper and Selin Hizli, who have created a worthy successor to Julia Davis’s scabrous 2004 sitcom Nighty Night. Cooper stars as Nic, a woman juggling guilt, trauma and parenting catastrophe, still finding time for extramarital hi-jinks and yetsomehowremaining deserving of sympathy, mainly because of the cavalcade of monsters around her. A dangerously addictive chamber of horrors.What we said:“Howlingly funny.”Read more42Task(Sky Atlantic/Now) This crime drama starring Mark Ruffalo as gone-to-seed cop Tom Brandis allocated a dangerous new assignment in Philadelphia certainly wasn’t for the faint-hearted. But if you could handle the all-pervasive air of impending catastrophe, it was a fine, gritty, twisty procedural centred on stick-up merchants, biker gangs and the grim ramifications of the fentanyl trade. An intense downer, in the best possible way.What we said:“A meditation on guilt, sin and the possibility of redemption.”Read more41The TraitorsView image in fullscreenThe worst traitor ever to roam the castle … Linda, with fellow traitor Minah and faithful Fozia.Photograph: Euan Cherry/BBC/Studio Lambert(BBC One/iPlayer) Before the celebrity version gave us Alan Carr, the third series of normies Traitors delivered Linda, AKA the worst/best traitor to ever roam the castle. Her head-turn when Claudia Winkleman said “traitors” wasn’t the only golden moment. Charlotte’s fake Welsh accent! Lisa the vicar’s bare-faced lie about her job! The shock return of Alexander! Rare is the show that makes appointment TV and creates national watercooler chat in 2025. But beyond all that – Claudia’s gothic outfits alone were worth tuning in for.What we said:“As a study of human behaviour – of deception, manipulation, self-preservation – it remains captivating. As perhaps the best example of social experiment-style reality TV, it has cemented its place in the cultural firmament.”Read more40-3140Dope ThiefView image in fullscreenRide-or-dies … Brian Tyree Henry and Wagner Moura in Dope Thief.Photograph: Jessica Kourkounis/AP(Apple TV) The two amiable, small-time Philadelphia crooks at the heart of Dope Thief have a good thing going. They rob low-level stash houses disguised as DEA officers and put on a performance of authority to avoid using violence. But when a big score at an out-of-town location is offered, they roll the dice and very quickly regret it: soon they have a bunch of very dangerous people on their tails. The key to this show was the chemistry between ride-or-die leads Brian Tyree Henry and Wagner Moura. As the stakes rose, these alternately hilarious and heartbreaking hoods had us rooting for them in no time.What we said:“Brian Tyree Henry ranges from comedy to tragedy in a single scene and never misses a beat. He is extraordinary and the rest of the cast are up there with him. He gives Dope Thief heart and at times threatens to break the viewer’s. Wonderful.”Read more39Squid GameView image in fullscreen‘Hi, Cate Blanchett!’ … Squid Game.Photograph: Netflix(Netflix) Hwang Dong-hyuk’s killer game dystopia was one of those exciting shows that nobody saw coming – and it quickly became the biggest show of 2021. But after the sagging second series, the end was in sight with this final one. Fans simplyneededto know whether Player 456 – name: Gi-hun – could take down the evil game masters and VIPs from within. While he attempted that, new games meant more scream-at-the-screen entertainment, and we had other contestants to side with (or hate). The twists were totally bewildering (hi, Cate Blanchett!), which made this one hell of a ride to the finish line.What we said:“If you can get on board with the new contestant twist – and that is a big if – then the final two episodes have a nicely grand and operatic feel to them, and ultimately, Squid Game does its job.”Read more38Dept. Q(Netflix) Like a Scottish Slow Horses, but with fewer fart gags. This TV adaptation of a series of Danish crime novels – relocated to Edinburgh – was a sarcasm-packed thrill ride as it told the tale of unpopular maverick copper Carl Morck, sent to work on futile cold cases in the basement. You couldn’t help but root for the team he pulls together to track down a missing lawyer, but the show’s real joy lay in the dynamic between grumpy Morck andKelly Macdonaldas his cheeky, pomp-pricking, work-mandated therapist.What we said:“It is all fantastically well, and rigorously, done. The pacing has a leisurely confidence that some may find a touch slow, but allows for a character-first approach, creating a richness that amply rewards initial patience.”Read more37This City Is Ours(BBC One/iPlayer) The city in question was Liverpool and while the drug gang at this drama’s heart had the territory well and truly locked down, the internal politics of family and succession were a different matter. James Nelson-Joyce stole the show as Michael, the gang’s heir apparent who finds his assumed rise to the top threatened by retiring boss Ronnie’s (Sean Bean) surprising preference for his feckless son Jamie. Needless to say, as the brains and the brawn of the operation, Michael doesn’t take this well. This City Is Ours never fully escaped from standard gangster tropes but instead, leaned into them with compelling relish. And that final rooftop standoff! Breathtakingly tense.What we said:“The Sopranos influence can be felt” …Read more36The Beast in MeView image in fullscreenAwards will surely be given … Claire Danes and Matthew Rhys in The Beast in Me.Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix/AP(Netflix) An extraordinary performance of jittery, self-destructive anguish fromClaire Daneslies at the heart of this ambiguous psychological thriller. Danes is Aggie Wiggs, a creatively blocked and prickly author who is dealing with the trauma of bereavement. When Matthew Rhys’s rebarbative (indeed, possibly murderous) real estate magnate Nile Jarvis moves in next door, it seems like the last thing she needs. Sure enough, the pair hate each other almost on sight – but soon, a weird, co-dependent fascination develops between them which leads to some very dark waters indeed. The two leads inspire each other into something genuinely startling.What we said:“It is, they are, absolutely wonderful to watch. Awards will surely be given, and in the meantime you cannot look away.”Read more35A Thousand Blows(Disney+) The best of Steven Knight’s many shows this year, this punchy underworld drama contained pretty much a full house of his favourite tropes: strangely poetic outlaws, beautifully realised period trappings (London’s East End in the grubby, gruesome late Victorian era) and regular outbursts of bone-crunching violence. It also boasted a trio of magnificent lead performances: Malachi Kirby’s immigrant boxer, Hezekiah Moscow, was charming, principled and deadly, while charismatic gang leader Mary Carr (Erin Doherty) was shrewd and slippery. Meanwhile, Stephen Graham – an actor whose combination of vulnerability and volatility loomed over this TV year – was somehow terrifying and desperately poignant as fading prize-fighter Henry “Sugar” Goodson.What we said:“Hasan irresistible, Dickensian-yarn quality that helps smuggle in timely social and political commentary, much as the great man did himself.”Read more34I Love LAView image in fullscreenA gen Z delight … I Love LA.Photograph: HBO/Sky Comedy(Sky Comedy/Now) Is internet comedianRachel Sennottthe Lena Dunham of her generation? Her first comedy series certainly has potential to be as relevant to gen Z as Girls was for millennials. The show follows 27-year-old aspiring talent manager Maia (Sennott) in LA as she navigates relationships, friendships, career ambitions and all of life’s mortifying moments in between. It took a few episodes to find its feet but the cast burst with energy as they delivered near-constant gags. Plus, for the millennials: Leighton Meester guest stars as Maia’s boss.What we said:“The endless embarrassments and boundless opportunities of celebrity can seem, by season’s end, not too different from that of being alive, particularly in one’s 20s. It’s a bumpy ride, but they’re just getting started.”Read more33The ChangeView image in fullscreenGorgeous whimsy … Bridget Christie as Linda in The Change.Photograph: Photographer: Jon Hall/Channel 4(Channel 4) Bridget Christie’s comedy drama is something special: a deeply personal call to arms for menopausal women who feel invisible. It’s also hilarious. Linda (Christie) is a fiftysomething mother and wife who escapes life on a motorbike to go and find herself in the Forest of Dean. By series two, she has had quite an effect on the local people: women wear “Je suis Linda” T-shirts and, armed with their copy of Linda’s Ledger, boycott doing unrecognised work. But she’s still on her own journey, too, with plenty of touching moments and acts of sisterhood. All of this was explored with Christie’s gorgeous whimsy. What a shame Channel 4 cancelled the show, despite Christie writing it for a three-series arc. Hopefully it will find a new home.What we said:“The Change is still the best (and probably the only) TV comedy series ever written about menopause.”Read more32South ParkView image in fullscreenIncredible … Donald Trump and Satan in bed in South Park.Illustration: YouTube(Paramount+) After Paramount settled a lawsuit with Donald Trump for $16m (£13.5m) and discontinued Stephen Colbert’s show after the late-night host called the deal “a big fat bribe”, South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker signed a $1.5bn five-year contract with the network – and immediately fought back. Episode one starred Donald Trump with a micropenis, climbing into bed with Satan. ICE, AI, tech bros and Labubus have all been in the line of fire. For an animated show in its 28th series to not just stay relevant, but boldly retaliate against the Trump administration’s censoring of the media, is incredible. It’s also still really, really funny.What we said:“Even for a show like South Park, which has often been defined by its anger, this may well go down as its most furious ever.”Read more31Mussolini: Son of the Century(Sky Atlantic/Now) Joe Wright’s stylish adaptation of Antonio Scurati’s doorstop of a historical novel followed Il Duce’s wobbly first steps towards fascism, as he moved from national laughing stock to the March on Rome and his ultimate enshrining as dictator. Luca Marinelli was chillingly compelling as a fourth-wall-breaking Mussolini, walking the audience through each of his norm-shattering acts in a series that served as a honking great warning klaxon in these fractious times.What we said:“A brilliantly performed portrait of a pathetic monster.”Read more30-2130What It Feels Like For a GirlView image in fullscreenCertainly a wild ride … Ellis Howard as Byron in What It Feels Like For A Girl.Photograph: Hera Pictures/BBC(BBC Three/iPlayer) Based on Paris Lees’ unflinching coming-of-age memoir, What It Feels Like For a Girl followed Nottingham teenager Byron (an incredible breakthrough for Ellis Howard) who befriends a group of club-loving transgender women and starts to explore their own identity. Byron is far from a likable protagonist – but that, along with the nuanced ways the story tackled sex work and drug use is what made it so authentic, so bold. It was a challenging but captivating watch, made even better for capturing the 00s in all their inglorious mess.What we said:“It’s certainly a wild ride – I’ll struggle to look at a toilet brush the same way ever again.”Read more29AmandalandView image in fullscreenWelcome to SoHa, darling! … Lucy Punch as Amanda and Samuel Anderson as Mal in Amandaland.Photograph: Natalie Seery/BBC/Merman(BBC One/iPlayer) Replicating the sheer watchability of Motherland’s phenomenal ensemble cast is no mean feat. But it certainly doesn’t hurt to draw on solid-gold comedy pedigree performers like Joanna Lumley and Siobhán McSweeney, plus Motherland’s most underrated character: the gloriously daffy Anne. Add in the subtlety and vulnerability that Lucy Punch brought to her turn as post-divorce queen bee Amanda, plus a script that skewered Insta-obsessed posh parents, and you had a televisual joy. Just don’t accuse her of living in South Harlesden: it’s “SoHa”, darling.What we said:“When writing is this good, it fizzes with the hysterical energy of perimenopause.”Read more28The BearView image in fullscreenStill hits so hard … Ayo Edebiri as Sydney in The Bear.Photograph: FX(Disney+) This one sure divided the critics. There were those who felt the hit restaurant drama that skyrocketed blood pressures and sales of sexy white T-shirts had served up its duffest course yet. But those who stuck with its fourth season were rewarded in spades with way less shouting of “Yes chef” and way more deep and brave and emotional television that had catharsis by the crateload. The under-the-table wedding scene? That two-hander between Sydney and Carmy (“I believe in you more than I’ve ever believed in myself”)? The funeral reveal (“I will fucking destroy you, Carmy”)? This was TV that still hits so hard.What we said:“Having put his creations and his audience through hell, showrunner Christopher Storer now lets the light in via a torrent of tenderly written, fiercely performed interactions where broken people who love each other start to heal, saying variations on those two beautiful phrases, ‘sorry’ and ‘thank you.’”Read more27Andor(Disney+) Probably the best and certainly the most universally appealing of the many additions to the Star Wars universe in recent years, this Rogue One prequel may have had the usual fantasy trappings but was also a stirring meditation on oppression and resistance. And dropping in the year of Donald Trump’s second coming, it felt particularly poignant and potent. It starred the excellent Diego Luna as Cassian Andor, a thief and scavenger whose home planet has been rendered uninhabitable by the Galactic Empire. Andor is a natural leader but he’s also a cynic; sceptical of revolutionary idealism. How does such a man turn into a freedom fighter, willing to risk everything for his cause?What we said:“Even when it’s in a lighter mode, Andor is Star Wars for grownups. This rebellion is a serious business.”Read more26HacksView image in fullscreenStuff of dreams … Jean Smart as Deborah in Hacks.Photograph: Universal(Sky Max/Now) Never mind that this wasn’t the Jean Smart-starring, odd-couple sitcom’s finest season. So glorious is this Emmy-winning tale of a veteran standup paired with a gen Z comedy writer that even a low-key outing is the stuff of most show’s dreams. This time round, we got a new roster of scene-stealing minor characters, heart-wrenching moments of pathos and zingers so acerbic you were in constant danger of spraying tea across the room. It also doesn’t hurt that the relationship between its two leads is one of TV’s most captivating.What we said:“Season four of Hacks is very funny. But what makes it really special is just how raw it is, too, ready to hit you in the feels when you least expect it.”Read more25Trespasses(Channel 4) This beautiful adaptation of Louise Kennedy’s layered story about a forbidden love affair set against the Troubles truly crushed hearts. It followed young Catholic teacher Cushla (Lola Petticrew) who falls for Protestant barrister Michael Agnew (Tom Cullen). Obviously, things couldn’t end well – as the story navigates the temperature of Belfast during that time. Gillian Anderson has, rightly, received a lot of praise for her portrayal of Cushla’s grieving alcoholic mother. But Petticrew is a rising talent, as proven in last year’s Say Nothing.What we said:“Trespasses seems like a collection of familiar melodramas, each borrowing from the Troubles for extra dramatic heft. The narrative is constructed with deceptive skill. As individuals’ hopes and feelings are crushed in the gears of events much bigger than them, we feel that pain.”Read more24The AssemblyView image in fullscreenRare candour … Danny Dyer is grilled in The Assembly.Photograph: ITV(ITV1/ITVX) There’s no denying that one of the great pleasures of this interview show was watching Gary Lineker subjected to an unfiltered grilling, just as he followed years of controversy by announcing he was leaving the BBC. But that was just one of many excellent reasons to tune in to TV’s most joyous chatshow, with the questions this group of neurodivergent people fired at a visiting celebrity leading to unfailingly brilliant viewing. The panel were fearless, funny and not afraid to ask questions most entertainment journalists wouldn’t dare to. All the celebrity guests, including Danny Dyer, Jade Thirlwall and David Tennant, answered with rare candour – while the musical performances left you bawling.What we said:“This is some of the warmest telly you’ll see this year … even when Danny Dyer starts dropping f-bombs left, right and centre.”Read more23Dreaming Whilst BlackView image in fullscreenAlways goes there … Adjani Salmon and his Tyrese backing singers in Dreaming Whilst Black.Photograph: BBC/Big Deal Films/Gary Moyes(BBC iPlayer) “Sometimes you have to Hit the Pavement. Ask Zohran Mamdani.” Since season two of his BBC comedy Dreaming Whilst Black came out, Adjani Salmon has been taking to the streets of central London with his Bafta in one hand and a poster in the other that says “Do you watch Black shows”. It’s an ace marketing strategy, but everyone in the UK should already know Salmon, and should already have watched his show – one of the most exciting and hilarious comedies of our age. In its second outing, aspiring film-maker Kwabena (Salmon) starts out unemployed – his uncle brutally roasts him, declaring “Kwabena is the only Black man in England that never got any work out of Black Lives Matter” – but soon lands what seems like a dream gig: directing a new period drama with colour-blind casting. Soon, though, the wheels come off (literally) in the most catastrophic way. It’s punchy and it always goes there; it even recreated the Tyrese Gibson RnB banger How You Gonna Act Like That. More please, BBC!What we said:“Dreaming Whilst Black remains rich with funny, true observations, about the hypocrisies and degradations of working in TV, and Black British life in general. Pertinent questions raised in this series include: “Who the fuck wines to Giggs?” and “What has Jamaican national dish ackee and saltfish – served on rye, no less – got to do with celebrating Barbados?”Read more22Riot Women(BBC One/iPlayer) This story about a menopausal rock band in Hebden Bridge was unmistakably by Sally Wainwright: a wickedly funny, hugely moving and personal take on women who feel invisible in midlife – with a few twists chucked in for good measure. The cast was some of Britain’s best, including Joanna Scanlan, Lorraine Ashbourne, Tamsin Greig and Sue Johnston. But Rosalie Craig was the standout as furious lead singer Kitty, who belted out their absolute bangers (“Give. Me. HRT!”). There was poignant social commentary, too, and many moments that were a reminder to call your mum tonight. But ultimately, it was a rollicking ode to women who won’t be ignored. Rock on series two!What we said:“Sally Wainwright should be prescribed on the NHS as a form of HRT.”Read more21MoView image in fullscreenAlmost miraculous … Mohammed Amer as Mo.Photograph: Eddy Chen/Netflix(Netflix) Mo is an almost miraculous thing, managing to find humour and humanity in the most impossible circumstances. And the worst of it is that while Mo’s struggles towards belonging in America during season one were already considerable, the Trump administration’s extreme hostility towards “invaders” makes the real situation for such people almost unbearable to contemplate. And yet, Mo’s Palestinian-American creator Mohammed Amer continues to make his extremely heavy points with remarkable lightness – really, the big takeaway should be that the pride, ingenuity and cultural richness offered by strivers like Mo would be an asset to any nation open-hearted and self-possessed enough to welcome them in.What we said:“Surely one of the most heart-rending things you’ll watch on TV this year. It brings together food, identity, immigration, family and Middle Eastern politics in a way that’s as fresh and intriguing as the falafel tacos that become central to the plot.”Read more20-1120Just Act NormalView image in fullscreenThere’s no other show like this … Tionne (Akins Subair), Tiana (Chenée Taylor), Tanika (Kaydrah Walker-Wilkie) and chicken in Just Act Normal.Photograph: Ben Gregory-Ring/BBC/The Forge(BBC Three/iPlayer) Drugs, social services, a live chicken: this wry comedy drama had it all. As if a comic tale of three under-18s desperately trying to avoid being taken into care after their mum vanishes wasn’t idiosyncratic enough, it set the series up with one of the year’s most astonishing narrative rug pulls. The youthful cast was astonishing, the gags were strong and its charmingly dark tone was like nothing else on TV. Eye-prickingly sad moments of childhood trauma rubbed up against satire, with plots that ranged from hilarious spoofs of heist movies to a tender teen romance whose early stage played out in a massage parlour. It also featured the most touching tale of a child bonding with a local drug dealer seen on TV this year. Like we said, there’s no other show like this.What we said:“It is, within each episode and over the entire series, beautifully structured and holds its many strands in perfect tension … It is altogether a wonderful thing.”Read more19ShiftyView image in fullscreenDazzling … a waxwork of Margaret Thatcher from Shifty.Photograph: Adam Curtis(BBC iPlayer) While it’s possible to argue that Adam Curtis has been telling variations of the same story for many years now (the slow death of liberal democracy and human autonomy at the hands of late-stage capitalism), he still finds new and dazzling ways of illuminating his thesis. Shifty was his most convincing offering in some time: an emotional rather than strictly historical journey and all the better for it. It begins in the Thatcher years and, using Curtis’s extraordinary skill as an editor and archive-hunter, maps a path to the New Labour years. There’s no voiceover – simply a cascading collage of imagery that feels at once familiar and revelatory. Curtis’s films are best appreciated as art installations rather than historical narratives, but this intuitive masterpiece felt convincing on every level.What we said:“It is an increasing rarity to stand in the presence of anyone with an idea, a thesis, that they have thoroughly worked out to their own satisfaction and then present stylishly, exuberantly and still intelligently. The hell and the handcart feel that bit more bearable now.”Read more18Slow Horses(Apple TV) We’ve reached season five of the little espionage thriller that could, and by this point it’s become a bona fide blockbuster. Though we can’t help but feel it’s a slight case of diminishing returns, this season still had Gary Oldman giving his all as the slovenly Slough House spy boss Jackson Lamb, Nick “Celebrity Traitors” Mohammed as the London mayor nearly getting shot in a mosque and the honey-trapping of Roddy Ho almost bringing down the whole of MI5. Thankfully, Jackson managed to step in with a cracking checkmate to save the day – and his Slough House crew. Or as he put it: “Fuck MI5. My gaff, my rules.”What we said:“Season five isn’t really about white nationalists, or environmental activists, or hostile foreign actors, and yet it is also about all of those things, all at once.”Read more17The Chair Company(Sky Comedy/Now) Fans of Tim Robinson’s awkward brand of humour were in for a real treat with this cracking series. He played family man and office worker Ron, who becomes obsessed with tracking down the company behind the chair that caused an embarrassing accident in front of his colleagues. But what starts as a week of angry emails and phone calls turns into a rabbit hole of conspiracy theories and the unravelling of a man who has had enough. Bizarre, worryingly relatable and absolutely hilarious.What we said:“You can’t tell exactly when the next massive, stupid laugh is coming.”Read more16Last One Laughing UKView image in fullscreenAnyone who cracks is out! … host Jimmy Carr with the cast of Last One Laughing UK.Photograph: Amazon MGM Studios(Prime Video) It’s a simple concept: round up 10 comedians in a room and get them to try to make each other laugh – anyone who cracks is kicked out. No wonder it’s been a hit in 26 other countries. Joe Lycett lasted mere minutes, while Richard Ayoade’s deadpan ways consistently worked in his favour. Daisy May Cooper’s re-enactment of being on a rollercoaster deserves a shout-out, too, but it was Bob Mortimer who stole the show. So much so that he has already been confirmed for season two next year.What we said:“Bob Mortimer performed a magic act first seen on The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer 30 years ago and sang some songs he posted on social media during Covid. The fact that these routines not only found new life on LOL UK, but also pushed his fellow contestants to the brink, is testament to Mortimer’s talent.”Read more15PlatonicView image in fullscreenComedy gold … Rose Byrne and Seth Rogen in Platonic.Photograph: Katrina Marcinowski/Apple(Apple TV) Kayaking disasters, LSD-related wedding catastrophes and the most grim golfing-related accident ever shown on TV – in its second season, Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne’s tale of two uni pals navigating midlife lost none of its anarchic spark. And yet its depiction of the pressures of working motherhood felt more acute than ever, with Byrne the standout performer, reliably turning in comedy gold that veered from deadpan to OTT frenzy. Not bad going in a year that her co-star broke records for the number of Emmys he won for his other comedy, The Studio.What we said:“The show does a brilliant job of capturing that feeling of exclusion from the real world that often accompanies motherhood, and Byrne expertly walks the line between aspirational cool girl and relatably downtrodden housewife.”Read more14Big Boys(Channel 4) It kicked off with Jack finally losing his virginity in a tent in Faliraki and ended up with an emotionally pulverising beach scene (“I didn’t make it did I?”) followed by the revivification of a most beautiful mate. But over three series, Jack Rooke’s gorgeous autobiographical uni comedy about awkward bod Jack (Dylan Llewellyn) and his straight best mate Danny (Jon Pointing) was never one to do things by halves. It tackled love, loss and the drinking of poppers. It had a fish named Alison Hammond, a dissertation called To Bum or Not to Bum, and it offered a masterclass in how to eat Peperami while giving birth to your delivery driver’s baby. But the way it moved towards its final moments was a masterstroke. We can’t wait to see what Rooke does next.What we said: “It’s heartbreaking, it’s beautiful, it’s a valuable companion in itself: sitcoms don’t get much more deep and meaningful than this.”Read more13Such Brave Girls(BBC Three/iPlayer) None of the characters are nice, but it’s almost impossible to watch an episode of this darkly comic, impeccably acted show about three women on the brink and not want to spend more time in their company. A ferocious, laugh-out-loud funny rampage through mental health crises, debt and toxic relationships. Given that creator Kat Sadler and her sister co-star Lizzie Davidson are wringing sparklingly bleak comedy out of material based on their own lives, it makes the bravery of this Bafta-winning creation even more impressive.What we said:“If you like your comedy scary, lairy and perfectly portioned, it is a total knockout.”Read more12PluribusView image in fullscreenSpectacularly original … Rhea Seehorn and Kevin Chambers in Pluribus.Photograph: Anna Kooris/Apple(Apple TV) With Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul behind him, there were huge expectations for showrunner Vince Gilligan’s new drama – but he has pulled off a spectacularly original sci-fi story. Carol (the brilliant Rhea Seehorn, who the show was written for) is a miserable novelist who is immune to an alien virus that takes hold of 99.9% of the world and turns them into a happy hive. As Carol tries to “save” the world, the show morphs into a sharply funny social observation and a psychological thriller that hums with existential dread. As per Gilligan’s works, trust and patience are rewarded – thanks in part to those hypnotic opening montages – and each episode racks up more questions that you’re happy to wait whole series to find answers to. It’s a good job season two has already been commissioned.What we said:“It takes some chutzpah to look at the world in 2025 – especially if you are a non-Maga citizen of the US – and say to yourself, “Yes, but wouldn’t it be almost more terrible if everybody just … got along?” But that is essentially what Gilligan has done. The execution may not be flawless but the audacity of the question is incredible.”Read more11The White LotusView image in fullscreenMelting hearts … Aimee Lou Wood in The White Lotus.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/AP(Sky Atlantic/Now) Parker Posey’s lorazepam-fuelled North Carolinian accent! Aimee Lou Wood’s melting of hearts! And … Patrick Schwarzenegger’s sibling incest! The third season of Mike White’s luxury resort drama, set in Thailand, might not have been the best – but it was stuffed with viral comedy moments, treacle-dark twists and career-high performances. This is still one of the most solid series going, with White taking it in weirder and wilder directions each time, so who on earth knows what the next White Lotus stay will bring.What we said:“Exquisitely shot, scripted, paced and performed, it’s a sumptuous feast for all the senses. ”Read more10-110Louis Theroux: The Settlers(BBC Two/iPlayer) As a follow-up to his 2011 film, The Ultra Zionists, Louis Theroux returned to the West Bank after the 7 October attacks, as more Israeli religious nationalists settled in the occupied Palestinian territory. Not many could keep their cool while having rifles pointed at them repeatedly, or when spending time with Ari Abramowitz, a gun-holding settler from Texas who refused to utter the word “Palestinian”, or Daniella Weiss, the outspoken “godmother” of the settler movement. Even Theroux, in a jaw-dropping moment, set aside his gentle persona and asked whether she is a sociopath. Bold, alarming and necessary viewing.What we said:“I’ve been watching Theroux’s films for more than three decades, and watching him be this forthright feels like a true watershed moment in his career. It suits him.”Read more9SeveranceView image in fullscreenTouching and troubling … Adam Scott and Britt Lower in Severance.Photograph: Apple TV+(Apple TV) Following up the stunning cliffhanger finale of this creepy workplace satire’s first season was always going to be a difficult feat. But this second outing managed to move past the novelty of a clever premise, featuring employees mentally “severed” into two personalities so that their workplace incarnations are ignorant of their personal lives and vice versa. What emerged were love stories that were touching, troubling and had a flair for wrongfooting the viewer, the show’s creepiest scenes ever and a terrifying guest spot from Gwendoline Christie that’s not just a strong contender for the show’s most memorable moment, but possibly one of her defining roles. Forget Brienne of Tarth: here’s Terrifying Corporate Goat Herd.What we said:“Severance is a rarity in so many ways – stylish without sacrificing substance, a thoroughly singular vision, fresh, challenging, a wholly credible world made of a tissue of incredulities.”Read more8How Are You? It’s Alan (Partridge)(BBC One/iPlayer) The Gibbons brothers’ BBC revival of Partridge continued apace with this triumphant return to fly-on-the-wall TV redolent of I Am Alan Partridge. This supposed attempt by the broadcaster to tackle a mental health epidemic had a wide brief: from episodes spoofing BBC show Winter Walks to Partridge taking on borderline consumer champion role that saw him tackle an unscrupulous tech boss on behalf of an unfairly sacked employee (only to “give her story the hearing it deserves” by flying one of the company’s jetpacks while screaming “Sell your kids! Get one before they ban it!”). He got wasted on white wine at a book club, was forced to let Lynne nearly crash his car and ruined her church music group by turning them into a rehearsal space for his electronic drum kit. Is that how you champion better mental health? Clearly not. But this is Alan Partridge, after all – on the form of his life.What we said:“Whatever medium he inhabits, Partridge remains the funniest comic creation in Britain, and even placeholder Partridge has more laughs-out-loud per half-hour than anything else on telly.”Read more7The RehearsalView image in fullscreenPrepare to be wrongfooted … Nathan Fielder in The Rehearsal.Photograph: HBO/2025 Home Box Office, Inc. All rights reserved. HBO® and all related programs are the property of Home Box Office, Inc.(Sky Comedy/Now) Nathan Fielder is worried about aircraft safety. Well, he might be. Or he might be using the subject as a smokescreen for a rambling, surreal exploration of the concept of authenticity. Or maybe a bit of both? Fielder’s new series – in which he tries to persuade the aviation industry to adopt new techniques to ensure better cockpit communication between pilots – will wrongfoot you so frequently you’ll end up stumbling in circles. Along the way, he builds a full-scale replica of parts of Houston airport, performs an experiment with a pair of cloned dogs and suckles on a huge model of the mother of heroic pilot Chesley Sullenberger. He also (quite literally) sticks the landing in a way that genuinely leaves you gasping. Whatever you expect this show to be, prepare to be wrong. But prepare to be dazzled too: no one else makes television like this.What we said:“At the end of the finale, I realised that all I had written for the final 30 minutes was ‘how on EARTH did they do this????’ over and over again, like a bad version of the typewriter scene in The Shining.”Read more6Alien: EarthView image in fullscreenHell was unleashed …. it’s the demon-eyed sheep on Alien: Earth.Photograph: FX(Disney+) Who could have predicted that a demon-eyed sheep would become the most symbolic baddie in the Alien franchise? Making a TV series of the beloved films (the first two, at least) was a huge gamble. But boy did Noah Hawley pull it off. Fleshing out the mythology, he introduced us to a not-so-far-fetched dystopia where a rich brat in pyjamas called the shots and immortalised dying children via synthetics. He also really wanted aliens. But when his wish came true, hell was unleashed: the trypanohyncha ocellus – a tentacled eyeball that buried itself in its victim’s eye socket, including that poor sheep – joined the xenomorph in scaring the bejesus out of fans. Hawley took his time in telling the story, but even when humans weren’t being ripped apart, the masterly production ensured a sense of doom and always had you wondering: who are the real monsters here?What we said:“The series always has a way of making us feel like helpless prey being circled. Something gloriously horrific is just around the corner.”Read more5Blue LightsView image in fullscreenWhat a show … Siân Brooke as Grace in Blue Lights.Photograph: BBC/PA(BBC One/iPlayer) It’s meticulously researched, so rooted in its Belfast location that it feels like no other cop drama on TV, and almost certainly the show with television’s finest Westlife-based comic moment. As its third season saw action move to the drug trade’s links to wealthy elites it took a darker turn than previously, with fewer comic moments, and a run of grippingly tense episodes that repeatedly raised the bar for the year’s most intense watch. The stress of two officers failing in their battle to stop a car crash victim bleeding out, only to nearly end up being assassinated by dissident republicans while informing the driver’s parents of his death? Pfft. Standout episode Ordo Ab Chao saw a low-key restaurant disturbance end in a stabbing for constable Shane, while colleague Grace had to protect a witness against a carful of gunmen, despite having no weapons, armour or clue what she was supposed to do. At times it was stressful enough to give you a panic attack, and yet, it still managed to end the series on a joyful, smile-inducing singalong. What a show.What we said:“Blue Lights has quietly become one of the best shows on TV.”Read more4The StudioView image in fullscreenOne side-splitting farce after another … Ike Barinholtz, Kathryn Hahn, Seth Rogen and Chase Sui Wonders in The Studio.Photograph: AP(Apple TV) Seth Rogen’s sitcom about a Hollywood film studio broke records for the number of Emmys it won, and with good reason. Despite being stuffed with brilliant celeb cameos (Dave Franco as a live wire, drug-taking party monster! Ron Howard knocking Rogen head over heels in a fight!), its core cast outshone them, oozing astonishing comic flair as they rattled through one side-splitting farce after another. The show’s embrace of its subject matter extended to a soundtrack of big band-style skittering drums redolent of golden era Hollywood and artfully directed episodes whose camerawork included one filmed in an elaborate single-take shot (while the plot of the episode is about a film-maker trying to get an elaborate single-take shot). Don’t let the highfalutin artsy stuff fool you, though: after all, one of the most memorable moments of this hilariously slapstick show is a drug-addled, violently spray-tanned Bryan Cranston in a leopard-skin thong. Unforgettable.What we said:“Many things mark The Studio out from the ever-increasing herd of satires on Hollywood. There is the unimpeachable casting, from core to cameos; the former comprising not just Catherine O’Hara as the raw-nerved Patty but also Kathryn Hahn as permanently, incandescently furious marketing maven Maya.”Read more3The Celebrity TraitorsView image in fullscreenBrilliant … The Celebrity Traitors.Photograph: Euan Cherry/BBC/Studio Lambert(BBC One/iPlayer) The Traitors has long blown every other reality TV show out of the water with its ability to create event television. And it might just have torpedoed even itself with its brilliant celeb version. Throwing in a troupe of national treasures to the Scottish castle made for instant investment in a show that has never exactly been difficult to care about. The joy of not just seeing the gripping game mechanics unfold, but also being able to draw conclusions about both the contestants (how does Alan Carr have so little volume control?) and the nature of celebrity itself (is the reason they did so badly that they’re all so used to fakeness that they can’t spot it?) added even more layers to a millefeuille of stressful viewing. And the twist in that finale! Undoubtedly the finest Traitors ever. How are we going to go back to caring about the normal one now?What we said:“All the essential elements are present and correct. The Winkleman. The castle. The only difference is that it is a bit easier to keep track of those first-round contestants because they are all familiar faces, designed as a group to pull in punters from all possible demographics and keep the BBC’s current greatest hit as popular as ever.”Read more2Dying for SexView image in fullscreenBeautiful and life-affirming … Michelle Williams as Molly in Dying for Sex.Photograph: Sarah Shatz/FX(Disney+) This spectacular show starredMichelle Williamsat her funniest and most vulnerable as Molly, a woman with terminal cancer who decides to devote the rest of her life to a quest for her first ever orgasm with a partner. Based on a brilliant podcast, Molly’s sexual adventures took in all-day masturbation sessions, cock cages, pup play and a dominatrix awakening. Helping her in this pursuit were a glorious Jenny Slate as her best pal and soulmate, Sissy Spacek as her eccentric mother and Rob Delaney as the comically slovenly neighbour who allowed her to open up. Beautiful, life-affirming TV to revel in – and weep to.What we said:“A wave of horniness”Read more1AdolescenceView image in fullscreenIt could only be one thing … Owen Cooper and Stephen Graham in Adolescence.Photograph: Netflix(Netflix) It was discussed in parliament. There were calls for it to be shown in secondary schools. It stood head and shoulders above every other programme made this year. The No 1 TV show of 2025 is, of course, the drama about 13-year-old Jamie Miller, accused of murdering a female classmate after being radicalised online. Stephen Graham, who starred in and co-wrote Adolescence with Jack Thorne is essentially the best actor we have, but there wasn’t a single duff performance from any of the other cast – be it the warm, weary humanity of Ashley Walters as the investigating police officer, Erin Doherty’s masterful turn as a psychologist or Owen Cooper, who blew Graham off the screen in his first ever TV performance, and who might just be the find of the decade. Add in the fact that every episode was filmed in a single shot, with footage including the camera literally taking off and flying through the sky, and it’s hard not to think that by every metric, Adolescence was genuinely excellent. It might just be perfect TV.What we said: “How could it be anything else?”Read more"

Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianOn the winter solstice, the Cornish town transforms into a rambunctious festival full of dance, delinquency and Morris dancers. Our writer dodges the vegetable missiles – and learns how to get the best out of a horse skullByJames Banyard. Photographs byJonny WeeksTue 23 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 23 Dec 2025 07.55 ESTShareIncense burners as big as basketballs send thick clouds of smoke into the hyped-up crowd. “Hoo hoo Holly!” cries a man in a suit of twisted roots, looking like an oversized Shredded Wheat. The crowd begins to chant: “Make way for the Holly!” And two 10ft tree gods – the Oak King and the Holly King – begin to lash and headbutt each other, as flamethrowers blast the air with hot orange streams. These mysterious-seeming traditions are part of Montol, Cornwall’s biggest solstice festival. Each year on 21 December, Penzance’s high streets close to traffic and crowds of thousands wearing elaborate outfits and horses skulls prowl, throw brussels sprouts and burn effigies of the sun.Elements of Montol have pagan roots, including rituals such as “wearing animal masks and cross-dressing, going from house to house performing ludicrous plays and performing really crap music”, says one co-organiser, Aaron Broadhurst. But Montol itself only began in 2007, when Simon Reed, former Penzance mayor and campaigner for Cornish Culture, found the word, meaning “balance”, in an old Cornish dictionary. In its first incarnation, says co-organiser Paul Tyreman, the festival consisted of a wind band, the Turkey Rhubarb Band, who led a procession up Market Jew Street and through the town. “People gathered, sung carols, lit a beacon, and went home.”Over time, the festival acquired more traditions, some rooted in Cornish culture, others entirely made up. There are osses – people wearing real horse skulls who prowl the streets throughout the day’s events, in keeping with the Padstow May Day “obby oss” and the Welsh Mari Lwyd (Grey Mare) – and Cornish carols are sung. There is guise dancing – costumed dancing – that stretches back to at least the late 19th century.But Reed invented the Guilds, says Broadhurst – the costumed troupes who roam the pubs and streets after dark performing absurd plays and “testing the ale”. (This might remind you of Lewes Bonfire Night, except Penzance’s shop windows don’t get boarded up.) And sprouts are both currency and ammunition for pelting fellow revellers in the street, a tradition with a poignant origin: it honours the late John Dudding of Falmouth, the self-styled Chancellor of the Cabbage who died suddenly in 2021 and had always attended Montol dressed – naturally – as a cabbage, to be duly pelted with sprouts. Before the festivities begin today, a man carries a green crate filled with sprouts through the streets, singing: “I have all the sprouts.”View image in fullscreenOsses on the prowl around Penzance.View image in fullscreenAaron and Nicole Broadhurst, dressed as Lord and Lady Montol, during the Sundowner parade.View image in fullscreenA band plays as they parade through Market Place.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreen(Left) Four horsemen of the apocalypse, including Donald Trump and Nigel Farage. (Right) Cllr Stephen Reynolds gets nibbled by the osses.View image in fullscreenDancers, musicians and revellers swarming on the streets of Penzance.Montol is supported with a £7,500 grant from the town council. “What is really important about our festival culture here in Penzance is that they are community festivals,” says mayor Stephen Reynolds. “They are by the community for the community. Our job is to support, but not direct or control. Everything else comes from volunteer effort.” It’s not about return on investment. “In Penzance, we resist this kind of corporate feel that some festivals can acquire when they get big. We are the antithesis of corporate down here.”The far west of Cornwall only encourages such festivities, says Broadhurst. “When I first moved here from Bristol, someone said to me: ‘You’ve got to understand this about Penwith. Cornwall’s a bit like a Christmas stocking. Where do all the nuts end up? Down in the toe.’ It’s true.”The festival begins gently at 2pm with border morris dancing. Pensans (Penzance) Morris and other visiting troupes take over the traffic-free Greenmarket. They clack sticks in yellow and black costumes and their performance of What Shall We Do With the Drunken Sailor is a sober palate-cleanser for the madness to follow. The guise dancers include the Scaleybacks of Hakeybay, lead by Admiral Hake from St Ives, who dress to a nautical theme: one is a selkie, another a mermaid, there is even a lighthouse. Generally, Broadhurst explains, the poor dress as rich, and everyone wears masks. “The tradition is that you wear tatters, which is a social inversion thing, or you wear mock posh or mock formal, where you take the piss out of the rich.”Tyreman and Aaron and his wife, Nicole, have been the administrative engine of Montol since 2023, when Reed stepped down. When volunteers were asked to take over, the room at the pub where they met suddenly emptied out. “It was like a scene in a comedy, with a sudden scraping of chairs,” says Aaron. “The room was empty apart from four or five of us. We were sat there thinking: ‘Oh shit, what have we done?’View image in fullscreenPensans morris dancers in action, bearing the county’s colours: black, white and yellow.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreen(Left) Festival-goers in full regalia. (Right) Morris dancers on the march.View image in fullscreenMusicians play tunes for the morris dancers.Among the many challenges in mounting a festival that runs for more than eight hours across 22 spots is managing locals’ conflicting takes on what it stands for. “There’s one lady who won’t have anything to do with it because she thinks it’s too pagan,” says Tyreman.Equally, says Aaron, “I have to deal with a bunch of pagans who think it’s a pagan festival, and tell me to get rid of all this Christian iconography! We sometimes describe Montol as a big family – from time to time we absolutely hate each other.”At 3.30pm, the crowd grows around the Farmers Arms for the Cornish carols. Facilitator Kelsey Michael is a community singing leader in Penzance. She draws from a book called Hark! The Glad Sound of Cornish Carols by Hilary Coleman and Sally Burley, a record of carols sung throughout the county. Kelsey keeps the arrangements to simple two-part harmonies to allow everyone to join in. “Despite the singing culture in Cornwall, sometimes people are nervous about it,” she says.View image in fullscreenCarol singing on Causeway.View image in fullscreenFestive performers surrounded by spectators.More nerve-racking, however, are the horse-headed osses. Mid-afternoon, Penhood and Maur Bras are walking slowly down Causewayhead, snapping hats from festival-goers’ heads. Their teasers (minders), Rachel and Sophie, make sure they don’t fall over. Both osses call in to the Zennor Wild cafe, stooping through the doorway and nudging drinkers’ coffees.“With the osses, there’s this tingling sensation,” says Aaron. “Especially with kids, because they are both scared because it’s a big monster who might bite their head off, but they also know it’s a person in a suit. Our osses are so skilful, they can use their teeth to pick up bags of sprouts from the Co-op.”Acquiring a horse skull is simple. Wearing one is more complicated. “The skulls weigh a ton,” says Aaron. “You can buy them on eBay, or you can go to an abattoir. In fact, if you approach an abattoir in advance, they will leave them outside in a bucket for the flesh to be eaten by maggots, so the skull is reasonably clean. Then you take it home and boil it in water and bleach and find someone you know who can articulate the jaw. You want a good snap.”View image in fullscreenCharlotte and Linus carrying the midwinter sun to the ‘burning of the sun’ parade at Princess May Recreation Ground.View image in fullscreenA fire dancer at the recreation ground.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreen(Left) Paul Carey, band leader and bagpiper.

His own bucca (male sea spirit), a 12ft metal pagan god that looks like Count Binface with articulated tentacles, looks fresh from his scrap heap.In the fight itself, of course, this being midwinter, after a few decent body checks, the Oak King wins, as is tradition. “We’ve been doing this for about six years, although it sometimes doesn’t look like we’ve done it before,” says Gray. “As with anything at Montol, there’s a sense of anarchy and misrule and mischief that goes along with all of it.”You can watch a previous year’s tree fight in a short film about Montol that Gray has made with Ryan Mackfall and Kingsley Marshall. Howlsavla Gwav (winter solstice) will be released in 2026, with music byacclaimed local folk musician Daisy Rickman. “It started as a little advert for the festival, but the scope grew into this crazy, uncontrollable plant.”View image in fullscreenThe Skaleybacks of Hakeybay.View image in fullscreenA dragon interacts with spectators on the parade route back from the recreation ground.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreen(Left) Stilt walkers welcome the winter solstice.

After the tree fight, the combined bands are the heart of the procession up to the muddy Princess May Recreation Ground from 6pm, where the sun is ceremonially burned, showering the delighted crowd in orange sparks.By 8pm, during a lull in the formal processions, the Guilds’ “revels” begin – and the first sprouts are lobbed. At the Admiral Benbow pub, one man aims a sprout that bounces off someone’s head, and laughs. Two people advance behind road closure signs, using them like riot shields. Occasionally, the first-floor window of the pub is pulled down and armfuls of the diminutive brassica are flung out, hitting festival-goers. One man escapes from the melee, and yells to his friends: “I got sprouted in the balls! I love this festival!”View image in fullscreenSpectators holding candles ready for the final procession.View image in fullscreenA firepit awaits the late-night revellers.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreen(Left) The ‘chalking of the mock’ by Tas Nadelik, near Jubilee Pool.

Down on the promenade, the Mock, or yule log, is “chalked” – burned in a roaring brazier. At the end of the procession, Lord Montol gives a speech and the remaining sprouts rain down on him.What does it all mean? It’s a festival full of homemade rituals, and Cornish defiance. “The parades are small acts of reconquest,” says Aaron. “We’re taking ownership of our little town.”On the year’s shortest day, it’s also a much-needed injection of energy. “The festival makes your hair stand on end,” says mayor Stephen Reynolds. “It’s amazing to be in the midst of all that energy. The further west you go, the wilder it gets.”Explore more on these topicsThe Guardian picture essayFestivalsCornwallDanceShareReuse this content"

Loo Shu-hsin is born into privilege in 1924 – her father is a banker in the largely British-run International Settlement of Shanghai – but her life is marked by her mother’s constant belittlement. “Bad bad girl! You don’t know how to talk,” she’s told, after speaking out of turn. “With a tongue like yours, no one will ever marry you.”Her only solace in the household is a nursemaid, Nai-ma, who vanishes one day without warning – a psychic wound that lingers even as she grows up, emigrates to the US and enrols in a PhD programme.In one striking way, however, Loo Shu-hsin is different from Jen’s previous protagonists: she happens to be Jen’s own mother. Bad Bad Girl is in part a fictionalised reconstruction of Jen’s mother’s life, in service of a searching attempt to excavate their troubled relationship. “All my life, after all,” Jen writes, “I have wanted to know how our relationship went wrong – how I became her nemesis, her bête noire, her lightning rod, a scapegoat.”Bad Bad Girl is half story, half imagined conversation, the frank discussion Jen and her mother never had when her mother was aliveThe result is an intriguing blend of fiction and nonfiction. Jen began writing Bad Bad Girl as a memoir (Loo is referred to as “my mother” throughout), but she found that fiction crept in to fill the gaps of her reticent mother’s life. It’s an empathetic, expansive choice. By attempting to imagine the full story of her mother’s life, to see things from her perspective, Jen allows her to become not a villain but a deeply flawed human being, even as she unflinchingly describes the emotional withholding, criticism and physical violence that marked their own relationship. In Jen’s telling, her mother’s upbringing clearly prefigured Jen’s own. Just as her mother was berated for her curiosity and spirit, so she berated Jen with the same cutting refrains: “Bad bad girl!” and “No one will ever marry you”.But it’s not just emotional history that shapes a person and a relationship, the book makes clear. Bad Bad Girl is also a case study of the way the sweeping events of world history can warp individual lives; at times, it functions as a kind of capsule summary of 20th-century Chinese history. In 1937, Loo witnesses Japanese forces invade and conquer Shanghai – a terrifying period of firebombing and panicked mobs – and lives through Japanese occupation until the end of the second world war. After she leaves for America, we catch glimpses of the Communist party’s rise through Loo’s discussions with other Shanghainese students and the letters she eventually receives from her family: the Nationalist party’s flight to Taiwan; the passage of an agrarian reform law; food shortages that ultimately culminate in the Great Famine from 1959 to 1961. A sister is sent to a labour camp, and she never sees her parents again.The weight of this history colours the second half of the book, where the focus shifts to Jen’s own childhood memories in suburban Yonkers and Scarsdale and her mother’s selective cruelty. Jen was given the smallest bedroom among her siblings and the burnt ends of their meatloaf dinners, and was hit by her mother over and over again. Here, it’s clear, is the root of the obsessive ache that fuels the entire book. Even months before her mother dies in 2020, Jen is still trying, as an adult with children of her own, to win her approval. “I want to have had a real mother, Mom,” she thinks in an imagined conversation. “Just like you wanted. A mother who loved me. I want to have had a mother like Nai-ma. I want not to have a mother-shaped hole in my heart.”These imagined exchanges crop up throughout Bad Bad Girl – moments outside the narrative, when Jen and her mother talk about what Jen is writing, commenting on and complicating the text. Bad Bad Girl is thus half story, half never-ending, imagined conversation, the freewheeling, frank discussion she and her mother never had when her mother was alive. It’s a kind of wish fulfilment, as Jen is perfectly aware. But the novel is all the more piercing for this unsatisfied, unsatisfiable yearning for understanding. We never stop talking to – or arguing with – our parents, Jen’s book reminds us. They linger in our heads all our lives, attachments durable enough to withstand even death.Bad Bad Girl by Gish Jen is published by Granta (£18.99).

Sprouting at the foot of the Cerro Rico, South America’s most populous settlement produced 60% of the world’s silver, which not only enabled Spain to wage its wars and service its debts, but also accelerated the economic development of India and China. The city’s wealthy elites could enjoy crystal from Venice and diamonds from Ceylon while one in four of its mostly indigenous miners perished. Cerro Rico became known as “the mountain that eats men”.The story of Potosí, in what is now southern Bolivia, contains the core elements of Sven Beckert’s mammoth history of capitalism: extravagant wealth, immense suffering, complex international networks, a world transformed. The Eurocentric version of capitalism’s history holds that it grew out of democracy, free markets, Enlightenment values and the Protestant work ethic. Beckert, a Harvard history professor and author of 2015’s prize-winning Empire of Cotton, assembles a much more expansive narrative, spanning the entire globe and close to a millennium. Like its subject, the book has a “tendency to grow, flow, and permeate all areas of activity”. Fredric Jameson famously said that it was easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism. At times during these 1,100 pages, I found it easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of Capitalism.“No religion, no ideology, no philosophy, has ever been as all-encompassing as the economic logic of capitalism,” Beckert claims, defining it as “the ceaseless accumulation of privately controlled capital”. Accounting for it therefore feels like explaining water to fish. Adam Smith, “the hero of capitalism’s triumphant self-remembrance”, attributed it to benign self-interest. Beckert, however, calls it a revolution, centuries in the making, which depended on things that Smith downplayed: “power, violence, the state”. Far from natural or inevitable, it has always been “unstable and contested”, proceeding by jolts.The word “capitalism”originated in France in the 1840s, around the same time as its antagonists “socialism”, “communism” and “anarchism”, but the system was much older. “Capitalism is a process,” Beckert writes, “not a discrete historical event with a beginning and an end”. He begins tracking the process in the port of Aden in 1150. This vibrant trade hub between Asia and the Middle East, in what is now Yemen, was one of several “islands of capital” which formed a “capitalist archipelago”. Inventing new trades like accountancy and insurance, its “strikingly modern” residents were in the vanguard of a global insurgency. But their accumulation of profit for its own sake was regarded with suspicion by rulers, religions and ordinary people alike. They enjoyed wealth without power or prestige: “capitalists without capitalism”.He visits Barbados, Samarkand and Phnom Penh; he quotes cultural texts from Abba to ZolaWhat they needed was the state’s collaboration. This developed during the “Great Connecting” between 1450 and 1650, when the discovery of the Americas (named after a slave-owning merchant) finally enabled European traders to challenge Asia and the Middle East while makingthemselves indispensable. In the era of “war capitalism”, new trade routes and territorial seizures triggered conflict, which trade then financed. Colonialism established capitalism’s “connected diversity”, which is to say, think global, act local.Like silver, sugar reconfigured the world. On the previously uninhabited island of Barbados, just 74 sugar planters used “American lands, African labour and European capital” to create a private slave colony – the new capitalist avant garde. Across the Americas, millions of enslaved people represented trillions of dollars in unpaid labour. Even after Britain abolished slavery in 1833, there were no clean hands. An ordinary European who began his day with a cigarette and a cup of sweetened coffee was already complicit in three branches of the slave trade. The Industrial Revolution, capitalism’s Great Leap Forward, required less explicit forms of coercion and exploitation. One luminary described Victorian Manchester as “the chimney of the world … the entrance to hell realised”. Meanwhile, envy of America’s vast territories and abundant resources inspired Europe’s dismemberment of Africa, which one French newspaper called “America at our doorsteps”.Beckert enjoys shredding capitalism’s self-flattering myths. He calls the notion of the free market “nothing more than a figment of scholars’ and ideologues’ imaginations”. The Protestant work ethic was deployed to justify child labour at home and forced labour abroad. “It is necessary to use methods that best can shake their idleness and make them realise the sanctity of work,” was how the Belgian King Leopold II rationalised working millions to death in Congo Free State. And yet, impossible though it was to imagine at the time, capitalism outlasted both slavery and empire.Capitalism’s “permanent revolution”, Beckert writes, produces both dynamism and instability. Similarly, its “connected diversity” cuts both ways – when one crucial region or commodity catches a cold, the whole world sneezes. Crisis is in its DNA. Some emergencies, like the long depressions of the 1870s and 1930s, appeared terminal. Karl Marx, of course, believed that capitalism had an expiration date, but so did the conservative economist Joseph Schumpeter, who asked in 1942: “Can capitalism survive? No. I do not think it can.” Yet every Jeremiah underrated its remarkable survival instincts. Infinitely adaptable, agnostic about nations and creeds, and essentially amoral, it keeps on going.If anyone comes out of this story looking good then it’s John Maynard Keynes, who sought to save capitalism from itself. Combined with thriving labour movements, the challenge of communism and the double shock of war and depression, his prescription for state intervention tamed capitalism’s worst instincts during three decades of extraordinary growth and relative equality after 1945. Call it capitalism with a human face. But then the neoliberal counterrevolution, Beckert argues, spurred capitalism towards its endgame: the commodification of everything. In 2025 it would be foolish to argue that capitalism goes hand in hand with liberal democracy.The scope of Beckert’s research is mind-boggling. He visits Barbados, Samarkand and Phnom Penh. He quotes cultural texts from Abba to Zola. He profiles emblematic figures such as the Bavarian merchant Jakob Fugger (possibly the richest man who ever lived), Chile’s General Pinochet (“the Lenin of neoliberalism”), the Indian nationalist and industrialist Ardeshir Godrej and the German steel magnate and war criminal Hermann Röchling. He manufactures a ceaseless, and sometimes exhausting, flow of startling details.The question that Beckert never quite answers is: why capitalism? While it’s hard to argue with his copious evidence of capitalism’s poisonous offspring, from scientific racism to climate change, and the numerous efforts to resist its advance, there must be more to it than war, slavery, imperialism and inequality. Even Marx and Engels gave the devil his due in The Communist Manifesto: for all its savagery, it had “accomplished wonders”. Beckert is so good at decrying the sticks that he downplays the carrots: longer lives, higher living standards, labour-saving innovations, new vistas of experience. In this story, capitalism is the answer to every question, the root of every ill, yet the histories of feudalism and communism suggest that cruelty and exploitation are not unique to one economic system.If Adam Smith was wrong to see capitalism as human nature manifest, then Beckert overcorrects by presenting it asanti-human: a “rogue artificial intelligence”, an invasive species, an alien force, a supernatural hunger. It is insatiable and unkillable. Beckert calls his book an “actor-centred history” about a phenomenon “made by people”, but it is ultimately a kind of horror story about a monster that eats men.Capitalism: A Global History by Sven Beckert is published by Allen Lane (£50).

But, as this overlooked follow-up attests, he was always a class act. In fact, this is one of his best: a rich, rousing ghost story shrouded in trademark gothic gloom but executed with technical flair and a good deal of empathy.As with his later breakthrough Pan’s Labyrinth, it’s part-horror, part-fairytale, with children at its centre. The setting is a middle-of-nowhere boys’ orphanage in 1930sSpain, a leftist sanctuary from Franco’s fascists during the civil war. Newcomer Carlos (Fernando Tielve) must find his feet in this semi-surreal realm, with an unexploded bomb in the middle of the courtyard, some kindly adults (one-legged Marisa Paredes and kindly doctor Federico Luppi), some not-so-kindly adults (aggressive caretaker Eduardo Noriega), and junior bullies to win over. There’s also a ghost in the mix: a pale-faced boy named Santi, whose death no one seems to want to discuss, and to whose empty bed Carlos is ominously assigned.There are moments of eerie suspense as this nocturnal apparition stalks the corridors and lures Carlos down to the cellars; del Toro turns up the dread magnificently, with atmospheric lighting, sharp objects and babies pickled in jars. But the real terror, of course, comes from the mortal grownups, whose approaches to child safeguarding are, let’s say, variable, and whose own intrigues embroil all the children as the war closes in. The political and the supernatural come together beautifully (and violently), and the unsentimental portrayal of childhood is refreshing, with terrific performances from the boy actors. It’s altogether a supremely satisfying tale.The Devil’s Backbone is in UK cinemas from 26 December.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsGuillermo del ToroHorror filmsWar filmsSpainPeriod and historical filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

I was born in Harare, Zimbabwe, where I lived until I was 12. It was years later, when my sister’s boy Nicholas was about five, that I first discovered it – and it was through his eyes. We saw one at Stratford East and he was blown away by how cool everything was, how colourful. His mates were in the audience and that felt great, too. It became a tradition we tried to keep until, of course, he became too cool for school. Panto audiences are different, they have this “response-ability”, which I think is interesting when you go as a big family. You are encouraged to disrupt the action that’s happening and you try your best as a kid to help the goodie do the right thing.Vikki Stone’sAladdin at the Lyric Hammersmith in London in 2021truly changed my perspective on what panto could do. It was just after lockdown and she took the piss out of anything she could: the out-of-our-heads silliness of those times, those maddening press briefings – there was also a Boris Johnson lookalike and there are few things more panto than him. It didn’t exclude anybody and it came with the soothing joy of having a proper, bonkers laugh with a bit of music and dance. It was captivating.Although I have been known to make work that engages directly with the audience, I was floored by how they achieved that feeling, that special giddiness.View image in fullscreenSoothing joy … Ellena Vincent, Kate Donnachie and Irvine Iqbal in Aladdin.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe actors have to be in the moment – they are playing a character, but they’re also reading the audience and reacting to them. I think that is a really hard thing to get right. I also think they are particularly African things, because in southern Africa, we sing, dance and act almost simultaneously. Movement is always a part of your expression and so is music. In Britain, I think panto is the only time that I’ve seen that synthesis.I am a queer person from Zimbabwe and I’ve written plays about Robert Mugabe and the trauma of migration. I don’t have a problem with being a writer who addresses those things, but Aladdin changed the trajectory of my work. It took me out of the “making Black/African work” box, allowed me to lean into my own silliness, and at the same time celebrate my tendency towards exactness. You need that for a good panto.And can you believe it? Here we are now, embracing an utterly African central dame inMama Goose, which I co-wrote with Vikki. And Nicholas, now a talented DJ, has his ticket. I hope to make him proud.Mama Goose is atTheatre Royal Stratford East, London, until 3 JanuaryAs told to Lindesay IrvineExplore more on these topicsPanto seasonThe play that changed my lifeTheatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

There were sightings, exorcisms, illicit grave excavations and even some desecrations. At the frenzied height of the speculation, the local police force got involved.In real-life events that sound like the stuff of Hammer horror (indeed, the Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing Hammer horror filmDracula AD 1972was apparently inspired by the incident), two men, David Farrant and Sean Manchester, got involved in hopes of solving the case. But rather than becoming a Holmes and Watson of the supernatural dimension, they embarked on a bitterly fought contest to be the first to vanquish the vampire, each undermining the other man’s authority along the way.View image in fullscreenA bitter contest … James Demain as Farringdon and Alexander Knott as Sheffield.Photograph: Charlie FlintHere, Patrick Sheffield (Alexander Knott) is a bishop in robes and cassock while Daniel Farringdon (James Demain) is a tobacconist by day and vampire hunter by night. Written by Demain and Knott, this hour-long comedy is shaped as a lecture which both men try to lead, each wrestling the narrative from the other, stopping, starting, disagreeing, and involving even their lecture’s technician, Audrey (played by Zöe Grain, who is also the show’s projection designer and producer). She apparently creates creepy sound effects in key moments of their testimonies (the sound design and musical composition is in fact by Samuel Heron) and enthusiastically shakes her maraca by the side of the stage during a musical number.Directed by Ryan Hutton, this is surprisingly sweet meta-theatre that zips along like a sketch. The men comically transform into various eye-witnesses and there are some funny lines about Karl Marx, who is famously buried in Highgate cemetery. It is charmingly performed although it could afford to be both sharper and scarier. You feel some goosebumps, such as during the account given by a teenage girl who spots a red-eyed “entity” in the dark that holds her in a vampiric trance – but you wish for more of such moments to contrast the breezy comedy. Still, it is an amusing alternative to a Christmas ghost story, all the more outrageous for its stranger-than-fiction roots.

Sarathy Korwar – There Is Beauty, There AlreadyA 40-minute suite of continuous, repetitive drumming might not sound like the most accessible music but south Asian percussionist and producer Sarathy Korwar’s latest album, There Is Beauty, There Already, turns this concept of insistent rhythm into strangely alluring work. Leading an ensemble of three drummers, Korwar develops a dense percussive language throughout the record’s 10 movements, channelling Steve Reich’s phasing motifs as well as Indian classical phrasing and anchoring each in the repetition of a continual, thrumming refrain. As the album continues, the refrain begins to emulate the hypnotic repetition of ceremonial rhythm, drawing us further into Korwar’s percussive world the longer we listen.9. Yasmine Hamdan – I Remember I ForgetAfter an eight-year break, Lebanese singer-songwriter Yasmine Hamdan returns with a mournful collection of songs expanding on the Arabic-language, dub-influenced sound that has made her a staple of the region’s indie music scene since the 1990s. Hamdan’s voice is quiet and ruminative, singing tender melodies over the bowing strings of Hon and the rumbling trip-hop groove of Vows, while on livelier tracks such as Shadia and Abyss, she employs a wavering, yearning vibrato over north African synth lines and rattling electronic percussion. The production is sparse and understated yet that minimalism provides the perfect setting for Hamdan’s emotive songwriting to shine through. Well worth the wait.8. Debit – DesaceleradasView image in fullscreenMenacing grooves … Debit.Photograph: Monse GuajardoMexican producer Debit has a knack for eerie reinterpretations of historical sounds. In 2022’s The Long Count, she used samples of Mayan flutes to create a new electronically filtered musical language for the ancient instruments and on her latest release, Desaceleradas, she turns her attention to the 90s style ofcumbia rebajada– a slowed, dubby take on the shuffling Latin American dance music genre. Debit slows this sound even further, processing its signature synths and syncopated beat through layers of sludge and static to produce a new, menacing groove. At turns ambient and discomfiting, Debit turns the joyous dancefloor sound of cumbia into a lasting, ghostly echo.Read the full reviewTell us your favourite albums of 2025Read more7. DJ K – Radio Libertadora!Maximalism is the key term when it comes to the records of São Paulo producer Kaique Vieira, AKA DJ K. Coining his own genre of “bruxaria” (witchcraft), Vieira layers a cacophony of sirens, explosive bass tones and screamed lyrics over the longstanding Brazilian dance style of baile funk to emulate the propulsive sound of favela street parties. On his second album, Radio Libertadora!, Vieira cranks up the intensity, adding everything from techno kick drums to the Islamic call to prayer into hisbruxariamix, creating a particularly frenetic and punishingly loud 40-minute listening experience. Surrender to the noise and Vieira’s brash productions become strangely liberating.Read the full review6. Mohinder Kaur Bhamra – Punjabi DiscoView image in fullscreenRediscovered gem … Mohinder Kaur Bhamra performing in Bedford, circa 1980.Photograph: Courtesy of Kuljit BhamraSikh devotional singer Mohinder Kaur Bhamra’s 1982 album of disco music and Punjabi folk melodies is a rediscovered gem. Recorded by her son Kuljit, a music producer, Punjabi Disco’s 10 tracks deliver an unusually engaging combination of the metallic sound of synthesisers and drum machines with her melismatic Indian classical vocal technique. Electronic percussion mirrors the undulating tones of the tabla and synthesiser melody doubles the traditional sound of the harmonium on tracks such as Pyar Mainu Kar, while bossa nova rhythm comes to the fore on Soniya Mukh Tera and Nainan Da Pyar De Gaya channels a fast-paced walking disco bassline. It’s a dancefloor fusion delivered over a decade before the Asian Underground explosion.Read the full review‘I felt caught between cultures’: Mongolian musician Enji on her beguiling, border-crossing musicRead more5. Enji – SonorMongolian singer Enji’s gentle fourth album, Sonor, expands on her jazz-influenced sound to deliver some of her most wide-ranging music to date. Moving away from her training in traditional Mongolian “long song” singing, the record’s 11 tracks veer from the soft Norah Jones melodics of downtempo number Ulbar to the German spoken-word lyrics and trilling guitar lines of Unadag Dugui and the sprightly, funk-inflected cover of 80s Mongolian pop hit Eejiinhee Hairaar. Featuring a full backing band, rather than her usual setup of guitar and bass, Sonor’s sound is still intimate, pulling the listener into the tender acoustics of her singular voice.4.

It’s a 70s throwback sound anchored in Yıldırım’s powerful falsetto and influenced by producer Leon Michels’ analogue tape aesthetic. Yet, on Turkish standards such as the nursery rhyme Hop Bico and 60s song Ceylan, the group reaches lively new territory, developing slinking, downtempo grooves and soaring vocals that lend a new, off-kilter twist to the Turkish psych sound.Read the full review3. Lido Pimienta – La BellezaCatholic requiem mass music, Czech harpsichord folksong and orchestral strings all come together on Colombian singer Lido Pimienta’s remarkable fourth album. Arranging music for the 60-piece Medellín Philharmonic Orchestra, Pimienta and producer Owen Pallett traverse everything from the Gregorian chants of opener Overturn (Obertura de la Luz Eterna) to the dramatic counterpoint melodies of Aún Te Quiero and syncopated dembow rhythms of the woodwind-heavy El Dembow del Tiempo. It’s Pimienta’s indefatigable voice that is the star, though, floating from yearning intimacy on Quiero Que Me Beses to the fierce full-throated harmonies of Busca la Luz, taking on her mighty symphonic backing with ease.Read the full review2. Negros Tou Moria – Mavri ElladaView image in fullscreenDextrous flow … Negros Tou Moria.Photograph: Giannis StasinopoulosAthenian rapper Negros Tou Moria has made his name over the past decade for coining the genre “trabetiko” – a blend of the Greek working-class folk music ofrebetikowith trap. On Mavri Ellada, he supplants folk melodies for a more raw, hard-hitting sound, rolling through the sub-bass and baritone verses of Samatas to the Afrobeats groove of An Einai Dinaton, the bouzouki motifs of the title track and pumping dancefloor synths of PragmatiKotita. Armed with a dextrous flow, an open ear for unusual production and fierce lyrics on his country’s response to immigration, NTM establishes himself as a rap talent moving far beyond the Greek scene.Read the full review1. Titanic – HagenView image in fullscreenDelightfully unconstrained … Titanic.Photograph: Jasmine SalvinoFearlessly experimental, Guatemalan cellist Mabe Fratti has ranked high in more than one of these global end-of-year lists, including for the enveloping introspection of 2021’s solo effort Será Que Ahora Podremos Entendernos? and 2023’s Vidrio, her freewheeling debut as Titanic with her multi-instrumentalist partner Hector Tosta. For their second Titanic release, Fratti and Tosta are delightfully unconstrained, playing through the metal blastbeats of Gotera, 80s stadium synth-pop of Lágrima del Sol, slinky funk of Escarbo Dimensiones and the post-rock moodiness of La Gallina Degollada. An arresting, consistently surprising record that truly sounds like nothing else.Read the full reviewExplore more on these topicsMusicBest music of 2025Pop and rockDance musicElectronic musicClassical musicDiscoJazzfeaturesShareReuse this content"

How did it become a family favourite?Jimi FamurewaTue 23 Dec 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 23 Dec 2025 07.03 ESTShareThe culinary essence of the festive season is a kind of sanctioned chaos. Never mind that, from one angle,Christmasis mostly just rigidly observed collective food traditions and grown adults dying on the hill of whether yorkshire puddings should be served with turkey.I don’t think I ever really feel that warming yuletide rush until I have turned a disparate assemblage of leftovers into what, to the casual observer, looks distinctly like a completely unhinged plate of food. I think most of us will know the sort of thing: there will be ragged hunks of surplus cheese, brine-slicked olives, stray bits of fruit and thick slices of the last of the cola-glazed ham; there will be a splat of cranberry sauce, a wodge of stewed red cabbage, and a dense, sticky slice of breathalyser-troubling Christmas cake. It is, I suppose, what most people think of as a Twixmas picky tea. Or maybe even aTikTok “girl dinner”, where the specific “girl” being channeled is an exhausted Mrs Claus pouring herself a massive Baileys on Boxing Day.What began as a use for an accidental surfeit of stuffing-bound sausage meat has become one of winter’s most potent pleasuresHowever, in our household, these fridge-forages tend to feature one constant: a hulking, golden-yolked half of one of the peppery homemade scotch eggs that have become my mum’s most beloved signature and our family’s most sanctified, non-negotiable Christmas food tradition.Christmases vary with changing life circumstances. The past 25 years or so of festive celebrations have featured inconveniently timed hospital stays, Covid-induced separation, a mass decamping to Florida, and those adolescent, semi-fallow years where my brothers and I would generally slump beside a scantly decorated tree, silently contending with our Yates’s Wine Lodge hangovers. Despite all this, and whether they arrive in steamed-up Tupperware or hot and burnished direct from the stove, there is no Christmas without those boulderous, deep-fried orbs.One Christmas Day, in our indolent, child-free years, my wife and I had both nodded off on the old corner sofa, stuffed and content, only to wake at 1am to the sound of commotion and the drifting scent of sizzling pork. “Good news,” chirped mum, bustling in with a manic gleam. “The scotch eggs are ready.”What began one year as a use for an accidental surfeit of stuffing-bound sausage meat has become one of winter’s most potent and long-lasting pleasures. And its popularity in West Africa in particular is longer established than I realised: once eggs were introduced to the culinary vernacular by colonial missionaries in the 1920s and 1930s, scotch eggs emerged as a favoured menu item at Nigerian fast-food chain Mr Bigg’s, and are especially beloved in Cameroon, where spiced mackerel is often substituted for pork. My adaptation of Mum’s recipe doesn’t feature anything quite so experimental as that, though I do “double scotch” them, as she does, with the enlivening addition of some scotch bonnet pepper and all-purpose seasoning. While I always thought their Christmassiness was an incidental quirk specific to my family, so many things about them – their laborious sense of festivity, the core ingredients required, their utility as part of the omnivorous household’s post-Boxing Day cavalcade of scavenged grazing plates – make them perfect for this time of year.Start by gently placing four medium eggs in a bubbling pan of well-salted water and boiling for seven minutes exactly (this will get you fudgy, just-set yolks for eggs kept in the fridge; cook longer for a harder boil). Plunge them into a bowl of cold water to rest, cracking lightly at their bases to make peeling easier. Now, add a teaspoon each of black peppercorns, fennel seeds, all-purpose seasoning, chopped fresh sage and a finely chopped quarter of scotch bonnet to a mortar before grinding into a dryish rub and setting aside.Split eight good-quality pork sausages (around 450g), discard the skins, and add your seasoning paste to the sausage meat. Mix well, before forming into four balls. Squash these between two pieces of clingfilm to about coaster-thickness, peel the eggs, lightly dust them in plain flour and then form each meat patty around each egg, patting together to form an even, tightly sealed oval.Now make a pane line: three dinner plates, one filled with 120g plain flour, another with one beaten egg, and a final one with 120g panko breadcrumbs. Roll each sausage ball along the line, dunking in the flour and egg wash, before thoroughly coating in breadcrumbs. Warm about two and a half inches of vegetable oil in a saucepan to a medium, rippling heat(about 150C on a cooking thermometer, or at the point that a few breadcrumbs sizzle and take on colour after a few seconds), and fry the breaded scotch eggs in batches for six to eight minutes, keeping an eye on the crumb to make sure it doesn’t darken too quickly. Drain and leave to cool on kitchen paper. Serve with piccalilli or brown sauce, a chaotic plate of leftovers and, if you like, a fistful of mid-tier Celebrations in lieu of petits fours.Picky by Jimi Famurewa is published byHodder & Stoughtonat £20.
