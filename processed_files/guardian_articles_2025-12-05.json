Now, more than ever, we must invest in hopeKatharine VinerFor this year’s Guardian charity appeal we are asking readers to donate to Citizens UK, The Linking Network, Locality, Hope Unlimited Charitable Trust and Who is Your Neighbour?Donate to our charity appeal hereFri 5 Dec 2025 07.07 ESTLast modified on Fri 5 Dec 2025 12.55 ESTShareIt has been an unsettling year of social division, anger and unrest in the UK and beyond. Extremist violence and rhetoric are escalating, with the demonisation of migrants reaching a fever pitch. Far-right activistsmarch in the streets. NHS nurses,care workersandcharities face abuseamid a resurgence of“1970s-style racism”.Against this toxic backdrop, the Guardian is launching its 2025 charity appeal on Friday. This year’s theme, unapologetically, is hope. We are supporting grassroots charities, which, through their vital work at the heart of local neighbourhoods, nurture community pride and positive change, and provide a powerful antidote to polarisation, distrust and hate.Our partner charities – and the projects they support – are united in the belief that however loud the forces of hate and division, they will never drown out the values shared by the vast majority: tolerance, compassion and common humanity.Many local communities face huge challenges, as public services, communal spaces and civic infrastructure have been eroded. Rising inequality, driven by austerity and our broken economic model, has led to resentment. For too many, poverty is deep-rooted. For others, dreams of a better future – for themselves and their children – have been dashed.Trust in politicians and institutions is fragile. The spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories, enabled by social media and the rightwing press, has distorted and soured debate. Intimidation, harassment and violence against minorities and those who support them have grown. It can feel frightening, and bleak.The Guardian is committed to reporting on fresh ideas, not only critiquing the state of the world, because we believe that the way things are isn’t the way they need to be. And the work of our partner charities offer examples of practical and inspiring options.These charities, which operate in some of the UK’s most economically deprived areas, campaign for better housing, improved health services and thriving high streets. They help restore abandoned libraries, parks and community centres. They run food banks, jobs and skills initiatives, youth and sports clubs, drop-in centres, arts projects, neighbourhood festivals and refugee welcome initiatives. They help to build hope.Their achievements are grounded in the way they approach their work. It is locally led and focused. It is built around respectful, empathetic and honest conversations about what matters to people. It brings together neighbours and cultures and faiths to find common values and drive positive change. They make connections and build relationships, hope and resilience. They offer a true antidote to division and despair, and focus on what unites rather than what divides us.As Locality, one of our charity appeal partners, puts it: “Our communities are the beating heart of a fairer society and a defence against hatred – places where everyone should feel safe, valued, and that they belong. Now, more than ever, we must invest in hope, and in the people who make it real, day after day, on the ground.”Charity alone can never make up for the divisions in our society, the extreme inequality, our damaged public services and years of austerity. But the Guardian appeal showcases what is possible. It is a tribute to those whose voluntary efforts transform individual lives and communities, in the public interest, and a celebration of social justice. Your donations will make a real difference.Donations will be shared between our five appeal partners:Citizens UK,The Linking Network,Locality,Hope Unlimited Charitable Trust, andWho is Your Neighbour?Each champions practical initiatives to change their communities for the better.Over the next few weeks, we will highlight our partner charities’ work. Our charity appeal telethon takes place on Saturday 13 December, when our great journalists will take your calls and donations. TheGuardian Bookshopwill donate 20p from every order received until 31 December to the appeal.Over the past decade, Guardian readers have raised an incredible £15m for good causes through our annual appeal. Themes have included refugees and asylum seekers, child poverty, the climate crisis, the Windrush scandal, and support for victims of war and conflict.Your generosity has been very moving. We hope we can inspire you to donate once again.Explore more on these topicsSocietyGuardian charity appeal 2025Voluntary sectorCharitiesCommunitiesThe GuardiancommentShareReuse this content"

Croatia in Toronto or Dallas. Ghana in Boston or Toronto. Panama in New Jersey or Philadelphia. And that is just the group games.With the excitement running wild and, well,Englandbeing England, their determination to bring it home to the fore, it was not long before the permutations were being scrutinised. It could be Mexico at the Azteca in the last 16 – the scene of the Hand of God in 1986. It could be Brazil in Miami in the quarter-finals. Tuchel pulled a face as if to say: “Wow.” There had been a lot to process. And that is before we talk about the Honourable Donald J Trump and his Fifa peace prize glory.World Cup 2026 draw: England face two 2018 reunions, Scotland land BrazilRead moreOn we hurtled to the heat and humidity; the travel. There was an idea before the draw that it was not so much about the who for England as the where and when – in terms of the specific stadiums they will play in and the kick-off times. They will not be revealed until Saturday at a secondary ceremony that starts at 5pm UK time. Fifa is certainly getting bang for its buck from this event.As an aside, Tuchel indicated that the Football Association would probably have to think again about its idea to look for a training base in Kansas City – with England given a largely east coast outlook. The FA is also now clear to confirm the proposed March friendlies against Japan and Uruguay at Wembley.Then Tuchel essentially said stop. About the overthinking. About the obsessing. For him, it has to be about the controlling of what England can control. And a phrase that he has mentioned numerous times came up again: bring it on. All the difficulties, everything. England will confront them on their terms.“We don’t worry,” Tuchel said. “We don’t worry about our opponents. We don’t worry about what can happen, what happens in the other groups. Just focus on what we can really influence. This is the mindset and the energy that we want to keep on having.“Someone said: ‘Whoever wins the medal in New Jersey [in the final], they will absolutely deserve it at the toughest tournament.’ What’s just been said to me [about Mexico and Brazil in the knockout rounds] … it sounds like a pretty hard tournament.View image in fullscreenEngland manager Thomas Tuchel walks the red carpet ahead of the draw for the 2026 World Cup.Photograph: ANP/Shutterstock“I would be excited to play in Mexico City because I remember theWorld Cupthere. When I watched it as a teenager, it was like watching something from Mars or another galaxy so to play a knockout game against Mexico …“But we are not getting carried away now talking about Mexico or Brazil. We don’t know if we meet them. And we don’t meet them for sure if we don’t perform in the group so we need to make sure that we are there. Who else joins us, we cannot influence.”Tuchel joked that he would definitely be getting a message from the Croatia midfielder Mateo Kovacic, whom he managed at Chelsea. And it is fair to say that England have history with Croatia, most notably from the 2-1 semi‑final defeat at the 2018 World Cup. England beat Croatia 1-0 in the opening group game at Euro 2020.Croatia were the highest seeded team in pot two of the draw here while Ghana emerged from pot four. The African nation, who can call upon Premier League talents such as Antoine Semenyo and Mohammed Kudus, have only played England once – in a 1-1 friendly draw at Wembley in 2011. England’s lone game against Panama was the 6-1 victory at the group stage of the 2018 World Cup. So, is it a good draw?“I think it’s a very complex group, a very difficult group but, OK, it is what it is,” Tuchel said. “Croatia are difficult. It’s a big opening match and it could easily be a quarter-final or even later in the tournament but we don’t wish for things. We don’t want to avoid at all costs anything.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hundreds and hundreds of them queued for more than two hours in the snow, surviving the forensic bag searches, and it was not long before they were rubbing their eyes in disbelief.The highlights? Where to start? Probably with Gianni Infantino, the Fifa president or, as he put it at one point, the leader of the organisation that is the “official happiness provider” of the tournament. The cringeworthy snapshots piled up, taking in Infantino’s efforts to whip up the audience into chants of “USA, USA, USA”.The low point was surely when Infantino presented Trump with the Fifa peace prize, the US president getting a huge trophy, gleaming medal and certificate, too. “You can wear the medal wherever you want,” Infantino said. Trump promptly hung it around his own neck.There was the unscheduled moment when Infantino organised a stunt that saw Trump, the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, and the Mexican president, Claudia Sheinbaum, step up as impromptu draw assistants. For a few seconds, it appeared as though Trump would be a part of the entire draw. Instead, the trio pulled out only their own nations, those that will co-host.The off-cuts? How about Lionel Scaloni, the manager of the defending champions, Argentina, emerging with the World Cup trophy, suited up but also wearing a pair of white gloves, like a high‑end snooker referee. Perish the thought that Scaloni’s skin might touch the gold. On we went before, after nearly 90 minutes, we finally got to the draw. There was genuine tension, drama; confusion at times, too. The outcome would reverberate around the world.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026EnglandWorld CupThomas TuchelanalysisShareReuse this content"

Except, on Friday at 6pm, it was nowhere to be seen. By 6.05, with still no sign of it, her faithful began to grow itchy. “Where’s your show?” they tweeted at her. A few more minutes passed. “FFS Liz get your act together,” sighed another.By 6.20 it was starting to look like Truss had as much grasp of YouTube’s upload procedure as she did of the British economy. Two minutes later, someone else tweeted: “Could this be the Deep State in action?” and I honestly cannot tell you if it was a joke.But then, miracle of miracles, The Liz Truss Show finally appeared. At7pm. Presumably because Liz Truss still hasn’t worked out how to change her clocks back from British summer time.The Liz Truss Show will confront the big issues of the day. For example: who on earth would watch Liz Truss? | Marina HydeRead moreSo, an inauspicious start. But at least it was immediately followed by one of the most barking mad opening monologues in recent memory.“You’d have to be watching the fake news BBC to not know that Britain is going to hell in a handcart,” Truss began, sitting in what appeared to be a cupboard furnished with the sort of books that pubs buy by the metre.The theme of the monologue was clear: Britain is in desperate trouble. “Small businesses are dying. Big businesses are leaving … people are having to pull their own teeth out,” she groaned.We live in a crime-ridden, socialist, Islamist dystopia. If they made Yes Minister today, she said, Humphrey Appleby would be “a radicalised trans activist”. Worse still, the British people don’t realise this because the media, with their “Gail’s bakeries and gated residences”, refuse to tell them the truth.At this point it became painfully clear what The Liz Truss Show actually is. Blanked in her own country to such an extent that ITV Racing didn’t even recognise her last time she went to Goodwood, Truss is now pinning her futureon being embraced by the American right.Her opening monologue was nothing more than a laundry list of Maga stereotypes about the British. The woman longs to become Donald Trump’sLord Haw-Haw, or at least a version of Lord Haw-Haw who looked and sounded like a bucket of spanners had just dropped on his head.Monologue done, Truss started to interview her guests. The first was Matt Goodwin, billed as “Britain’s No 1 Substack”. We’ll have to assume he was there because, for an abnormally long amount of time, the camera never left Truss’s face.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I don’t know if you’ve ever spent 40 seconds looking at Liz Truss wordlessly blinking and gulping, but it’s a genuinely disturbing sight. I wouldn’t wish it on anybody.After a brief chat with a second guest – a podcaster in a “FREEDOM” T-shirt – it was on to the former Brexit party MEP Alex Phillips, who inevitably frothed on about immigration.The most notable thing about her interview was how it ended, cutting off abruptly just as she started along a dodgy road about how to “encourage” legal migrants to leave the UK. Whatever could have happened? Did she say something that was beyond the pale, or was it that darn Deep State silencing her again? We may never know.To think, this whole endeavour exists purely because Liz Truss wants America to love her, even though the only thing that America knows about her is thatshe held her own book upside down on Fox News once. And so she’s resigned to this, ranting in a shoebox on the internet, like the first person to die in a disaster film. It’d be tragic if it wasn’t so deeply stupid.Episode 2 of The Liz Truss Show will be aired next Friday at 6pm. That is, assuming that Liz Truss has figured out how clocks work before then.Explore more on these topicsLiz TrussTV reviewYouTubeTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Actually, Tarantino mostly finished the business of re-integrating two volumes of Kill Bill into a single feature as early as 2006, just a couple of years after the release of Kill Bill: Vol 2. But while that version played at Cannes and had a few more recent runs at Tarantino-owned theaters in Los Angeles, it never reached home video (though some bootlegs attempted to recreate it) or a wide theatrical release. That’s all changed with this weekend’s debut of Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair, a four-and-a-half-hour version of the movie hitting over 1,000 screens across North America.Quentin Tarantino weighs in on one of cinema’s big questions: what is the best Tarantino movie?Read moreTarantino made long movies before and after Kill Bill; features that run over two and a half hours make up the vast majority of his filmography. But in the early 2000s, Kill Bill represented a major pivot for the film-maker, away from his then-signature crime dramas with healthy helpings of black comedy. Tarantino and his Pulp Fiction starUma Thurmancooked up the character of the Bride – “Q & U” are named as providers of the source material in the credits – as a pregnant ex-assassin who becomes the victim of a vicious wedding-eve attack from her ex-boss/lover (that would be Bill) and their lethal colleagues (those would be the other four on her “death list five”, a phrase whose rhythm recalls Fox Force Five, the fictional TV pilot Thurman’s character in Pulp Fiction once starred in). The Bride unexpectedly survives the shooting, goes into a coma, and wakes up years later desperate for revenge, forming the backbone of a movie that pays extensive tribute to the kung fu, exploitation and revenge movies of Tarantino’s youth – and his dreams, if the vividly colorful look of the film is any indication.When Kill Bill went over budget and started approaching the four-hour mark, Tarantino’s producer – since-disgraced and jailed sex criminal Harvey Weinstein – suggested splitting the movie into two parts, rather than either gambling on a four-hour movie or forcing the film-maker to cut his opus way down. So instead, the film was sliced down the middle. The gambit worked financially, to the tune of $330m worldwide between the two movies, and hardcore fans assuming a “full” version was probably just around the corner. It was not. But now it’s finally here, more than 20 years later.So what’s different in this supersized version that you can’t get from playing the two movies back-to-back at home? In several cases, it’s actually less a question of making additions than undoing them. To give the two-movie version a little more shape, a major revelation once intended for the movie’s final chapter was shifted to a cliffhanging tease at the end of volume one. Though The Whole Bloody Affair does throw to a 15-minute intermission after the events of volume one, it eliminates dialogue from Bill revealing that the Bride’s daughter is alive and well. In both versions, The Bride herself finds out about her daughter in the film’s final stretch; now the audience (or at least, the hypothetical audience who hasn’t seen the movie before) learns of the daughter’s existence alongside the heroine. Volume two also loses a brief black-and-white introduction delivered directly to the camera by Thurman; it’s the only noticeable change to the back half of the movie.Some first-film material, however, has been expanded, mostly to accommodate additional arterial spray. The animated chapter depicting the backstory of O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu in live-action form) has an additional action sequence depicting a young O-Ren battling with another killer. And the gorgeous House of Blue Leaves sequence, which has The Bride slicing her way through dozens of O-Ren’s henchmen in flesh and blood, has been slightly expanded and now proceeds in full color. The volume one version switched to black-and-white after a few minutes, and cut some of the gnarliest carnage, to avoid an NC-17 rating. The sequence was already magnificent, but it does gain even greater power with the full extent of Robert Richardson’s primary colors on display: the yellow of the Bride’s Bruce Lee-like tracksuit; the blue glow of overhead lights and the wintry night sky; and, of course, the bright red of all that blood.The single deleted scene from the volume two DVD – the only time we’d really see Bill in martial-arts action – hasn’t made it back into the longer cut. However, the release does feature a different, non-canonical bonus scene that exists apart from the feature. After the credits, viewers can watch an animated “lost” chapter of the story, deleted from an early draft well before anything was shot, where Yuki, the twin sister of schoolgirl-ish assassin Gogo, seeks revenge on the Bride. It was made for the video game Fortnite, and non-fans of the game will probably wish it hadn’t been. Seeing this inconsequential but elaborate action sequence done up as proper anime probably would have been a kick; as an uncanny bit of Fortnite-engine weirdness, complete with game-character cameos, it, well, captures a moment in time, let’s say. No movie fan is likely to find it essential. Some may not even find it watchable. At the showing I attended, it had the additional oddity of being a computer-animated Fortnite short projected as part of a 70mm celluloid print.View image in fullscreenUma Thurman and Lucy Liu.Photograph: Cinetext/Miramax/AllstarAn ill-fitting Fortnite chapter does, however, stay true to the digressive nature of Tarantino’s biggest, wildest movie. Watching a single 270-minute version really drives home the fact that in pure story terms, the “important” stuff that happens in Kill Bill could be pretty easily depicted in 95 minutes or less. By design, this is not one of Tarantino’s best screenplays. (I’m pretty sure that at one point, the Bride says “entropy” when she means “atrophy”.) Yet the writer-director was right to resist cutting it. Without the largely extraneous bits – O-Ren’s baroque origin; a long scene where the Bride meets a legendary sword-maker and engages in some shtick at his tiny restaurant; Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) reading poisonous snake facts she dutifully copied down from a website; Bill’s eventual monologue ruminating on Superman – the movie is about a woman having five different fights. With all of that material, it transcends its roots and becomes a brilliant cross between a cinematic DJ set, half a dozen different types of exploitation films and a sprawling novel.In fact, the movie works shockingly well as two discrete volumes, with tonal differences that apparently came naturally before the split was even conceived. You don’t really need to see The Whole Bloody Affair to truly appreciate Kill Bill – though, again, that House of Blue Leaves sequence only gets better and more colorful with the extra blood, and fans who live near any of the70mm engagementswill be understandably excited. Even without that lure, though, it’s a great opportunity to immerse yourself in Tarantino’s sensibility or, if that doesn’t appeal, a true powerhouse performance from Thurman. In the longer version, it’s even easier to appreciate how gracefully she moves from physical, technical demands to movie-star charm to raw emotionality as motherhood throws her off her axis and imbues her with an even greater sense of purpose. Some have found later-period Tarantino overly arch and referential, starting with this precise four-hour indulgence. Yet it’s hard not to take the movie at least somewhat seriously, even at its silliest, when the Bride is on-screen. More than any particular tinkering, it’s the fullness of Thurman’s performance that turns Kill Bill into a genuine epic.Explore more on these topicsQuentin TarantinoKill Bill: Volume 1Kill Bill: Volume 2Action and adventure filmsUma ThurmanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For example: who on earth would watch Liz Truss?Marina HydeEveryone’s favourite former PM is back! Her mission? To save Britain from its current ‘doomloop’ with, you guessed it, a YouTube talkshowFri 5 Dec 2025 08.46 ESTLast modified on Fri 5 Dec 2025 13.56 ESTShareWill you be seeing a pantomime this year? Birmingham’s got Gok Wan and Biggins in Robin Hood, Bradford has Sinitta in Snow White, while Bromley landed Su Pollard for Beauty and the Beast. And at the end of YouTube’s infinite pier, there’sThe Liz Truss Show, starring She’s-Behind-You herself. Curtain up on that one is tonight at 6pm.According to the producers, Liz’s show “confronts the issues that others tiptoe around”. Wow. The lives, loves, and clinical explanations? Let’s just say I’d watch that. Sadly, this doesn’t seem to be the format. Instead, like all seasonal entertainment, TheLiz TrussShow is based on a fairytale. “The deep state and their allies in the media and politics tried to destroy me,” madam explains in a statement, “now I’m back.” Are the gilt markets the deep state now? Honestly, I can’t keep up. You’ll remember that the irony of Truss’s flameout at the hands of market forces was particularly acute given that she had spent an entire career explaining that free markets were the greatest judge of absolutely everything. Small ideological adjustment: free markets are now the greatest judge of everything except the ideas and personage of Liz Truss.Anyhow, Liz says her new show, also available on other platforms such as Spotify, X and Substack, is for people who are “tired of experts who get everything wrong, elites who refuse to listen, and weak leaders”. Amazing. Liz famously ticked each of those three boxes, yet somehow regards herself as the antidote. It’s a sort of political homeopathy, I guess, where a very small amount of the thing is also the cure for the thing. Furthermore, it confirms the notion that the modern political wilderness truly is a wilderness, in that absolutely no one even goes there any more, let alone stays there.Primarily, our host says, this new punditry and debate show is about “the cultural battles reshaping the west”. Like me, many of you will feel you missed the meeting where Liz Truss was elected as the standard-bearer of “the west”. Yet it seems to have become the most inescapable element of her post-premiership LinkedIn profile. Her flop book was entitled Ten Years to Save the West, which is arguably not route one to appealing to a book-buying public whose mortgages you’ve just hiked. If Liz were capable of saving any west, you’d have thought South West Norfolk would have been a start, but the voters there had other ideas,overturning her 26,000 majorityin the general election last year. (Incidentally, the save-the-west book was subtitled: Lessons From the Only Conservative in the Room. Which is one way of spinning the fact that you’re the onlypersonin the room, because everyone else suddenly remembered they need to talk to someone in the kitchen.)The new show tries once again for a new start, with Truss tweaking the origin story quite spellbindingly. Try to imagine the Family Fortunes researchers going down any British high street, asking 100 people, “Why did Liz Truss get ditched as PM?” and getting the following answer from even one of them: “I was deposed as prime minister for trying to save Britain from the doomloop we are in.” Picture the host with his arm around Truss, wincing comically at the board and saying: “If it’s up there, I’ll give you the money myself.”Speaking of giving money to Liz, we must move on, because – amazingly – this new media venture is not even my favourite Truss announcement of the past fortnight. That honour has to go to the unveiling ofa new private London club, spearheaded by Liz, who wants members to give her – are you ready for this? – £500,000 each to join. I know! But it’s true! She’s recorded a personal invitation video message and everything, in which she seeks recruits for a new kind of private members’ club. So, no shit coke or proud dad sexual harassers claiming to be film producers? Truly, end of a very long era. But apparently, this is one for “pro-growth leaders”, which is certainly something you can imagine being droned in your ear at 2am by an experiential marketing agency boss who’s missed the last train to Beaconsfield.Sorry, where was I? Oh yes, it’s called The Leconfield, and I think you can officially regard the search for the most cursed private members’ club in Mayfair as over. What seems to be being offered is a shared office, or as Liz would have it, “a secure ecosystem” and “unique business centre” for people “at the forefront of technology, policy, and capital”. I want to call it “a WeWork for arseholes” but I think that’s just a WeWork. But with something this much of a joke, what a miss not to call it HoHo House.Instead, black lacquer boxes have arrived at the offices of solicited members. These contained the personal message from Truss and the information that she was seeking to sign up no fewer than 700 people at that price point. “Join me,” she coaxed, “as we build this new reality of collaboration, innovation and prosperity together.”Join her? JOIN HER? Now that I’ve perused the introductory offer – and, indeed, now that I know about The Liz Truss Show – I am struck by the fact that there is in fact a certain coherence to these two seemingly absurdist projects. If, after everything, Liz Truss genuinely is able to find 700 people to pay her half a million quid, then fine – I will agree with her. Because how could you not? How could you draw anything other than the conclusion that not just this country, but the entire west, has actually fallen?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead, he launched a tirade aimed at the BBC and ITV for questioning him about an ongoing Guardian investigation into allegations of past antisemitism and racism.Citing television shows including Are You Being Served? and It Ain’t Half Hot Mum, Farage accused the BBC, which he suggested he would boycott, of “double standards and hypocrisy”, and claimed ITV had a case to answer for airing the comedian Bernard Manning in the 1970s.View image in fullscreenYinka Bankole and the Dulwich college pupils’ list from 1980.Bankole, whose parents, a nurse and an osteopath, came to the UK from Nigeria in the 1950s, said he had found it the “most amazingly disingenuous example of the phrase ‘let he without sin cast the first stone’”, adding: “It was also the final straw.”He said: “I went to the school for a year between 1980 and 1981, starting at a mere nine years of age. I was in the most junior class (JC) at the time, in a college that was so large, consisting of lower, middle and upper schools with an age range from nine to 18.Holocaust survivors call on Nigel Farage to apologise over alleged antisemitic commentsRead more“My hardworking parents celebrated with pictures as proud parents would do when their child is so privileged to attend such a well-reputed educational institution.“It took him a while, I recall, but one day Farage, and at least one other, spotted me in the lower-school playground. He was about 17 years old.“He towered over me. ‘Where are you from?’ he asked. Within seconds of offering my rather confused and sputtering answers, he had a clear response: ‘That’s the way back to Africa,’ with an accompanying hand gesture pointing towards a place far away.”Bankole, 54, an engineer, said that once his “existence as a target was established”, Farage “would wait at the lower-school gate, where I was dropped off for school, so as to repeat the vulgarity”.He said he would always remember what he described as a “look of hatred he had for me, seemingly simply for existing”.View image in fullscreenYinka Bankole said he would always remember the ‘look of hatred he had for me’.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianBankole said: “Without knowing my name, but just looking at me with what appeared to be no appreciation of my humanity and simply because of how I looked.”Farage has variously claimed that while comments that were “banter” more than four decades ago might be seen as bigoted today, he had never said them “directly” to anyone or “with intent” to hurt.Nigel Farage’s shifting answers on school-days racism claims – a timelineRead moreBankole added: “I will leave it to the reader to decide whether this was ‘malicious or non-malicious’, ‘meant with intent or not with intent’, ‘direct or non-direct’. I know how I experienced it. It certainly felt malicious to me.”Bankole is one of 28 school contemporaries of Farage’s at Dulwich college, a public school in south-east London, who claim to have witnessed deeply offensive racist or antisemitic behaviour by theReform UKleader.He had previously spoken to the Guardian on the condition of anonymity but decided to put his name to his story because he had been angered by Farage’s response.A lawyer acting for Reform had “categorically denied” that Farage had “ever engaged in, condoned or led racist or antisemitic behaviour” when allegations were first put by the Guardian to the party.Farage later admitted he may have said things in “banter” at school that could be viewed differently today but denied saying anything racist or antisemitic “directly” at an individual.On Thursday, Farage denied saying anything racist “with malice”. He has repeatedly suggested that the claims are politically motivated and questioned whether it would be possible to remember events from the 1970s and early 80s.Bankole said he has voted for multiple parties over his life and is not a member of any political party.View image in fullscreenNigel Farage has admitted he may have said things in ‘banter’ at school.Photograph: Victoria Jones/Shutterstock“Farage has suggested that it is simply inconceivable that anyone could recall such events of over four decades ago,” Bankole said.“I would simply ask: can a victim of such abuse ever forget? I know I haven’t forgotten. I recognise his walk every time I see it on TV as that same walk that used to approach me.“Looking back, it was perhaps a stroke of luck that I left after a year – the high school fees being a contributory factor along with family relocation.“The thought terrifies me of what could have happened if I was there the following year when the bully would have had even more authority. The prospect of him having infinitely more of that in a few years’ time is truly a chilling thought.”Explore more on these topicsNigel FarageRaceReform UKAntisemitismLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

England beat Panama handily, though, winning 6-1 in the group stage. They have never faced Ghana at the World Cup.“Difficult group, difficult opener,” Thomas Tuchel said. “Difficult group with Croatia and Ghana, two regulars in World Cups and two proud and strong nations. Panama, I don’t know much about Panama but we will find out about it before the tournament starts, of course.”At the draw in Washington DC, which lasted more than two hours after 90 minutes of preamble, there were a number of strong groups selected. Scotland will also face a partial repeat of their last World Cup campaign in 1998 after they weredrawn alongside Brazil and Morocco, as well as Haiti, in Group C.The most prominent candidate for the title of “Group of Death” is Group I, where the seeds France are joined by Senegal and Erling Haaland’s Norway alongside the winner of an international playoff.USA faceAustralia, Paraguay and a European playoff winner.If England win their group they will face a third-placed team from groups E, J, I, H or K in the last 32. Victory would probably then bring a match against the winners of Group A, where Mexico are drawn alongside South Africa, South Korea and the winner of the playoff section involving the Republic of Ireland. Win that and there is the potential for a mouthwatering quarter-final against Brazil.After seeding changes by Fifa, England would be in line to face Argentina in the semi-finals.Although Croatia will be strong opponents for England, their golden generation has mostly retired, with the remaining stars Ivan Perisic and Luka Modric 36 and 40 respectively. England have beaten Croatia at a tournament since the chastening defeat in Moscow,winning 1-0 in their opening matchof the 2021 European Championship.Ghana have featured in four of the past five ­tournaments but have fallen some way from the team that reached the quarter-finals in 2010. Their squad includes familiar faces from English football, Tottenham’s Mohammed Kudus and Antoine Semenyo of Bournemouth among them.

He denies betting on his own teamsAnna IsaacandRob DaviesFri 5 Dec 2025 12.17 ESTLast modified on Fri 5 Dec 2025 13.59 ESTShareTony Bloom, the billionaire owner of Brighton & Hove Albion FC, is facing questions over claims he was an anonymous gambler behind $70m (£52m) in winnings – which allegedly included bets on his football teams.Bloom – one of the world’s most successful professional gamblers – is claimed to be the “John Doe” referred to in a US legal case that tried to unmask who has benefited from the lucrative winning streak.Approached by the Guardian, Bloom declined to answer whether he was the “John Doe” in the court filing issued earlier this year. Bloom denied betting on his own teams or competitions that involve them, and a source close to him described the allegations as “entirely false”.MPs, including the former shadow sports minister Clive Efford, called on the Football Association (FA) to investigate the allegations.The Guardian revealed this week that Bloom faces a separate UK court claim that heuses frontmen to place substantial bets for a gambling syndicate he controls– including allegations he used Nigel Farage’s former aide and Reform UK insider George Cottrell.The US court case, which has not previously been linked to Bloom, also centres on claims that a gambling syndicate has been using a frontman to mask its role in winning vast sums of money.Bloom’s syndicate was publicly accused of placing bets on his own football teams by the co-founder of the online gambling company Rollbit, which brought the US legal action.Its co-founder, known as Razer, posted the claim on X on 14 November, alleging that Bloom’s syndicate placed bets on his own teams on Rollbit via a frontman. Since that time, other sources have also made the same claims: that Bloom’s syndicate bet on his own teams and competitions they participate in. That would breach FA rules.The US legal action was brought in order to seek information that would clarify that the “John Doe”, identified as Bloom’s syndicate on X, received winnings from bets placed by a frontman. The initial application was denied by a judge, but the dispute is ongoing.Bloom is already under scrutiny because of the separate lawsuit in England, which alleged he was using frontmen to place substantial bets for a gambling syndicate he controlled. Frontmen include “footballers, sportsmen and businessmen”, as well as Cottrell, the UK court document alleges.This syndicate bet “predominantly” on football, the UK document claims.Razer’s X post, and other sources who have spoken to the Guardian, go further, and claim Bloom’s syndicate bet on his own teams with his knowledge and participation. Bloom declined to answer questions about his involvement with his syndicate.As well as Brighton, Bloom has a financial interest in Royale Union Saint-Gilloise in Belgium.A source close to Bloom denied he and his betting syndicate had placed bets on his football clubs and competitions involving them, and said his betting activities were audited by a leading accountancy firm annually.This process was “to check and confirm that such bets have not taken place” and had shown Bloom had fully complied with the FA’s betting policies. Bloom follows the same audit procedure in Belgium, the source said.Bloom is one of a handful of club owners who was given in 2014 a “carve-out” to allow him to carry on gambling, but not on any of his own teams or competitions they take part in. If the allegations made are proved, this could be a breach of FA rules.Efford, a Labour MP, questioned this controversial exemption and said the FA should investigate.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Severe sanctions have been imposed on players for gambling on matches and owners are covered by the same rules so this cannot be ignored.”Clive Betts, the chair of the all-party parliamentary group on football, said: “It demonstrates a potentially very serious problem and could just be the tip of the iceberg. It needs a thorough and comprehensive investigation from the FA and transparency around the regulations that govern this in the future.”Iain Duncan Smith, a former leader of the Conservative party, added: “The FA must be much more transparent about their lax policy concerning the use of gambling money in the running of their clubs.”Bloom is regarded as one of the world’s most successful gamblers, and is known in the industry by the moniker of “The Lizard”.His gambling collective, the Starlizard Betting Syndicate, is alleged to make about £600m each year, according to the UK court filing.The claim in England has been started by a former business partner, who has alleged that Bloom owes him his share of gambling profits estimated in the region of $250m.A source close to Bloom has said he intends to file a defence to the high court claim in due course.Cottrell did not respond when asked for comment.Explore more on these topicsBrighton & Hove AlbionGamblingnewsShareReuse this content"

However, the pictures and audio have been reworked so that the speakers are encouraging women going through menopause to buy products such as probiotics and Himalayan shilajit from the company’s website.The revelations have prompted calls for social media giants to be much more careful about hosting AI-generated content and quicker to remove content that distorts prominent people’s views.“This is certainly a sinister and worrying new tactic,” said Leo Benedictus, the factchecker who undertook the investigation, which Full Fact published on Friday.‘It was about degrading someone completely’: the story of Mr DeepFakes – the world’s most notorious AI porn siteRead moreHe added that the creators of deepfake health videos deploy AI so that “someone well-respected or with a big audience appears to be endorsing these supplements to treat a range of ailments”.Prof David Taylor-Robinson, an expert in health inequalities at Liverpool University, is among those whose image has been manipulated. In August, he was shocked to find that TikTok was hosting 14 doctored videos purporting to show him recommending products with unproven benefits.Though Taylor-Robinson is a specialist in children’s health, in one video the cloned version of him was talking about an alleged menopause side-effect called “thermometer leg”.The fake Taylor-Robinson recommended that women in menopause should visit a website called Wellness Nest and buy what it called a natural probiotic featuring “10 science-backed plant extracts, including turmeric, black cohosh, Dim [diindolylmethane] and moringa, specifically chosen to tackle menopausal symptoms”.Female colleagues “often report deeper sleep, fewer hot flushes and brighter mornings within weeks”, the deepfake doctor added.The real Taylor-Robinson discovered that his likeness was being used only when a colleague alerted him. “It was really confusing to begin with – all quite surreal,” he said. “My kids thought it was hilarious.View image in fullscreenBlack cohosh supplement pills.Photograph: Julie Woodhouse/Alamy“I didn’t feel desperately violated, but I did become more and more irritated at the idea of people selling products off the back of my work and the health misinformation involved.”The footage of Taylor-Robinson used to make the deepfake videos came from a talk on vaccination he gave at a PublicHealthEngland (PHE) conference in 2017 and a parliamentary hearing on child poverty at which he gave evidence in May this year.In one misleading video, he was depicted swearing and making misogynistic comments while discussing menopause.TikTok took down the videos six weeks after Taylor-Robinson complained. “Initially, they said some of the videos violated their guidelines but some were fine. That was absurd – and weird – because I was in all of them and they were all deepfakes. It was a faff to get them taken down,” he said.Full Fact found that TikTok was also carrying eight deepfakes featuring doctored statements by Duncan Selbie, the former chief executive of PHE. Like Taylor-Robinson, he was falsely shown talking about menopause, using video taken from the same 2017 event where Taylor-Robinson spoke.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It wasn’t funny in the sense that people pay attention to these things.”Full Fact also found similar deepfakes on X, Facebook and YouTube, all linked to Wellness Nest or a linked British outlet called Wellness Nest UK. It has posted apparent deepfakes of high-profile doctors such as Prof Tim Spector and another diet expert, the late Dr Michael Mosley.View image in fullscreenMichael Mosley.Photograph: TT News Agency/AlamyWellness Nest told Full Fact that deepfake videos encouraging people to visit the firm’s website were “100% unaffiliated” with its business. It said it had “never used AI-generated content”, but “cannot control or monitor affiliates around the world”.Helen Morgan, the Liberal Democrat health spokesperson, said: “From fake doctors to bots that encourage suicide, AI is being used to prey on innocent people and exploit the widening cracks in our health system.“Liberal Democrats are calling for AI deepfakes posing as medical professionals to be stamped out, with clinically approved tools strongly promoted so we can fill the vacuum.“If these were individuals fraudulently pretending to be doctors they would face criminal prosecution. Why is the digital equivalent being tolerated?“Where someone seeks health advice from an AI bot they should be automatically referred to NHS support so they can get the diagnosis and treatment they actually need, with criminal liability for those profiting from medical disinformation.”A TikTok spokesperson said:“We have removed this content [relating to Taylor-Robinson and Selbie] for breaking our rules against harmful misinformation and behaviours that seek to mislead our community, such as impersonation.“Harmfully misleading AI-generated content is an industry-wide challenge, and we continue to invest in new ways to detect and remove content that violates our community guidelines.”The Department of Health and Social Care was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsHealthDeepfakeSocial mediaTikTokArtificial intelligence (AI)MedicineInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

He was 96.Gehry, the most recognizable American architect since Frank Lloyd Wright, was one of the first to embrace the potential of computer design, and pioneered a distinctively exuberant style of bravura power, whimsical and arresting collisions of form. His most famous work remains the Guggenheim Museumin Bilbao, a fantastical, titanium-clad composition on the Nervión Riverwhich received international acclaim upon its opening in 1997, heralding a new era of emotive architecture.The project lent its name to a phenomenon – the Bilbao effect – in whichdecaying old cities tried to spur revival with spectacular architecture, and became, as Guardian critic Rowan Mooreput itin 2019, “the icon of what would be called iconic architecture”.Other famous works included the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, completed in 2003; Miami’s New World Center, a concert hall finished in 2011; and the Fondation Louis Vuitton, an ethereal museum in Paris completed in 2014.View image in fullscreenThe Frank Gehry-designed Cleveland Center Lou Ruvo for Brain Health in Las Vegas.Photograph: George Rose/Getty ImagesBorn Frank Owen Goldberg on 28 February 1929, to a working-class Jewish family in Toronto, Canada, Gehry was a relatively late bloomer as an architect. He moved to Los Angeles in the mid-1940s, where he attended the University of Southern California, studying ceramics, after a brief stint in the US army. He switched to architecture after a teacher introduced him to the work of Raphael Soriano, a pre-eminent designer of postwar modernism in southern California. As a young graduate, he changed his surname to Gehry, a decision he later attributed to a desire to avoid antisemitism.Frank Gehry obituaryRead moreGehry spent several years working as a mid-level designer at a firm specializing in shopping malls before opening his own firm, in 1962, while designing houses and offices for friends on the side.The remodeling of his own house in Santa Monica – an eye-catching clash of crude and conventional designs made of unglamorous materials, suggesting turmoil within – frustrated neighbors but drew critical attention, and inspired a mid-life crisis. “Is this what you like?” a developer client asked him in 1980, after the completion of another shopping center. When Gehry said it was, he told the Guardian in 2019, the client responded: “Well, if you like this you can’t possibly like that,” pointing in the direction of the shopping centre, “so why are you doing it?” At 50, Gehry stopped working on his commercial projects and refashioned his career as an auteur designer, working his way up from small-to-medium civic projects like the 1983 design for the Temporary Contemporary (now the Geffen Contemporary) at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, to, in his 60s, the reputation-making museum in Bilbao.View image in fullscreenThe Guggenheim Museum, Bilbao.Photograph: Ian Dagnall/AlamyA sociable person, Gehry maintained the kind of starry circles befitting a celebrity of American architecture – his office included photos of himself with such figures as Herbie Hancock, Shimon Peres, Princess Diana, Jasper Johns, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Quincy Jones and numerous former world leaders. He remained based in Los Angeles, and continued working into his final years, on projects such as a distinctive 76-story residential tower at 8 Spruce Street in Lower Manhattan that appears to be rippling with glass and steel, which was completed in 2011.Frank Gehry at 90: ‘I love working. I love working things out’Read more“I love working,” he told the Guardian shortly after his 90th birthday. “I love working things out. I love the client interaction – I think it’s a 50-50 game. I love that we do what we do, and bring it in under budget, which no one believes, but it’s true.”Gehry is survived by his second wife Berta Aguilera, as well as their two sons Sam, also an architectural designer, and Alejandro, an artist. His daughter Leslie Gehry Brenner, from his first marriage to Anita Snyder, died in 2008.Explore more on these topicsFrank GehryArchitecturenewsShareReuse this content"

It adds: “Should present trends continue, the continent will be unrecognisable in 20 years or less.”US policies must therefore include “cultivating resistance to Europe’s current trajectory within European nations” as well as enabling Europe to “take primary responsibility for its own defence” and “opening European markets to US goods and services”.Responding to the strategy document on Friday, Germany’s foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, said the US remained a vital ally on security but “questions of freedom of expression or the organisation of our free societies” did not fall into that category.“We see ourselves as being able to discuss and debate these matters entirely on our own in the future, and do not need outside advice,” he said.View image in fullscreenGermany’s Johann Wadephul rejected the need for ‘outside advice’ from the US.Photograph: Tobias Schwarz/AFP/Getty ImagesThe policy document, released by the White House late on Thursday, underscores the Trump administration’s clear alignment with Europe’s far-right nationalist parties, whose policies centre on attacking supposed EU overreach and excessive non-EU migration.In language that will appear extraordinary to close allies, it says the US should “stand up for genuine democracy, freedom of expression and unapologetic celebrations of European nations’ individual character and history”, adding that Washington “encourages its political allies in Europe to promote this revival of spirit”.With far-right parties in government, supporting rightwing coalitions or leading in the polls in several EU member states, the document says the “growing influence of patriotic European parties … gives cause for great optimism”.The Trump administration has repeatedly sought to foster closer ties with Europe’s nationalist parties, including Germany’s far-right Alternative für Deutschland. In September a senior AfD party figure visited the White House for meetings with senior officials.On immigration, the strategy document appears to endorse the “great replacement” conspiracy theory, which claims ethnic white European populations are deliberately being replaced by people of colour. It says it is “more than plausible” that “within a few decades at the latest” some EuropeanNatomembers “will become majority non-European”.It claims Europe must “remain European, regain its civilisational self-confidence and abandon its failed focus on regulatory suffocation”, arguing that the continent’s lack of assurance is evident in its relationship with Russia.As Trump seeks an end to the Ukraine war that would most likely favour Russia gaining territory, the document accuses Europeans of showing weakness. Despite a “significant hard power advantage”, it says, many on the continent “regard Russia as an existential threat”.It argues it is a “core interest of the US to negotiate an expeditious cessation of hostilities in Ukraine” but that Washington “finds itself at odds with European officials who hold unrealistic expectations for the war perched in unstable minority governments, many of which trample on basic principles of democracy to suppress opposition”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It also says the US “needs a strong Europe to help us successfully compete and to work in concert with us to prevent any adversary from dominating Europe”.It adds that Washington wants to “work with aligned countries that want to restore their former greatness”.The top Democrat on the US Senate foreign relations committee, Jeanne Shaheen, said: “This plan, and the administration’s approach, is riddled with contradictions. President Trump rightly wants our European allies to step up on their own defense but undercuts their ability to do so by actively promoting far-rightwing, pro-Russian political parties.“By drawing an equivalence between our European allies and murderers in the Kremlin, this strategy at least explains why President Trump has been so inept at ending the war in Ukraine.

Workers at a further 850 BP-branded forecourts run by partners are on different pay deals.BP is an accredited member of the Living Wage Foundation’s fair pay scheme, under which employers commit to pay staff an annually set wage to meet living costs.Hourly pay for BP’s affected workers will rise to a minimum of £13.45 in February, from £12.60 this year – a 6.7% rise in line with the scheme. However, one worker said the company’s changes to employee benefits would reduce take-home pay by at least 6.25%, wiping out much of the hourly rise.At present, most BP workers receive 1.5 times their usual hourly pay for working on bank holidays and are paid for one 20-minute break in a shift of four to six hours or a 30-minute break if their shift is more than six hours.According to the Guardian’s calculations, that would mean that someone working an eight-hour shift, including a 30-minute break, would receive £100.87 under the new pay regime, compared with £100.80 now.Expressing annoyance at the measures, one source said BP had summoned managers to its Sunbury base to tell them about the change to benefits.The source claimed BP was “framing the announced increase to the real living wage, which they are committed to implementing as part of their role as a real living wage employer, as a new benefit they are going to offer instead [of paid breaks and bank holiday premiums], when in reality they were committed to implementing this increase as they have done every year sincethey signed up in 2020”.The source suggested the benefits were “written into customer service assistants’ contracts”, and workers could be “encouraged to agree to the changes without fully understanding their rights to disagree and without being offered any compensation or incentive to consent to the changes”.Under UK employment law, workers have the right to one uninterrupted 20-minute rest break during their working day if they work more than six hours a day. However, the government does not mandate that a worker should be paid during this break.Many retailers, includingAsda,MorrisonsandSainsbury’s,have cut paid breaks in recent years as a way to offset increases in the legal minimum wage, employers’ national insurance and other labour costs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As a result, early next year we will be adjusting how we structure pay for hourly paid colleagues working in our 310 company-owned retail stores across the UK.“From February, we will no longer pay for rest breaks and pay premium rates on fewer national bank holidays. However, we will be increasing our base hourly pay and, to help support colleagues, we will bring in this annual increase two months earlier than usual, also in early February 2026.”Paul Nowak, the TUC general secretary, said: “Workers are still suffering a severe cost of living hangover from 14 years of Tory government. This would be the worst possible time for BP to cut benefits and impose a stealth pay reduction.“In the future, the employment rights bill will provide important new protections to prevent employers from imposing contractual changes to workers’ pay.”Explore more on these topicsBPLiving wagePayEnergy industryOil and gas companiesnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s an investment in the future of the children who are affected by poverty,” he said.McFadden added that further changes to the welfare system to encourage work were important for improving children’s lives, arguing that getting people into jobs will make families better off and save money on the benefits bill.The flagship policy in the strategy is the government’s pledge to end the two-child limit on universal credit, at a cost of £3bn to the Treasury. The move is expected to lift 450,000 children out of poverty by 2031.Other measures in the package include helping parents choose cheaper baby formula, getting families out of temporary accommodation faster, establishing breakfast clubs and extending free school lunches.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer visits a children’s centre in Cardiff on Friday.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PALabour MPs are delighted with the move to scrap the two-child limit, and won a victory in July whenthey forced ministers to abandon plans to cut disability benefits.However, McFadden said it would be a “mistake” for anyone to think the government was not aiming for further changes to the welfare system.“I think because of what happened in July, there’s been a conclusion that no reform is happening. That’s a mistake. Reform is happening. But I think we will need more in the future, too,” he told the Guardian as he toured aLittle Village baby bankin north London that has supported more than 11,000 families with the cost of living.In a sign he will pursue further significant changes, McFadden said: “I don’t think the right thing to do with the welfare system is just to circle the wagons around a system that is not delivering as well as it should and has such significantly rising costs.“We should see this system as not just about the distribution of benefits but ask ourselves: does it do everything it can to help people into work? I don’t think it does right now, and so there is a case for further reform to the system and there’s also reform happening [now].”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Finally, this government has found its mission | Polly ToynbeeRead moreThe chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has also saidthe benefits bill cannot “remain untouched”. Two reviews are under way:the Timms reviewlooking at the disability benefits system, and another headed byAlan Milburn, examining youth inactivity.Asked whether he was planning to cut people’s payments or reduce eligibility for benefits, McFadden said: “I can’t say yet and I don’t want to start ruling things in or ruling things out.“What it will involve is us asking the question: how do we deal with rising inactivity among the young and what can we offer to enhance people’s opportunity and the chance to get into work right across different government departments?”He said it was wrong to look at taking out costs from the welfare system without considering how changes would help people back into work – improving their finances and prospects as well as generating tax revenue for the Treasury.“If a young person gets on to benefits and stays on them, they will lose out about a million pounds in earnings over the course of their life and it will cost the state about a million pounds too,” he said.“Rather than approaching this the way that it has [been] done in the past, where people say: ‘I’m going to take a figure of X billion, and then retrofit a policy on to that,’ think about that million pounds.“Every person we can get into work and not have them on benefits for years is earning and paying tax. That does save money on the benefits bill and I think that’s a good thing if that’s the way that we save money on the benefits.”McFadden also firmly rejected the Conservative’s claim that last month’s budget would help those on benefits more than those in work. He said the two-child limit brought in by the Conservative government in 2017 was “never really about saving money on the benefits bill”.“It has always been seen in part as a political dividing line with children used as the weapon of choice,” he added. “I think setting this up as some sort of division between the working and the non-working is just factually wrong.”Explore more on these topicsWelfareBenefitsChild benefitsPovertyChildrenPat McFaddenLabournewsShareReuse this content"

He told the audience of 2,000 people: “This is truly one of the great honours of my life.”It was aNorwegian football commentatorwho once memorably celebrated victory over England by shouting: “Maggie Thatcher … your boys took a hell of a beating!” Now Fifa had delivered its own “Norwegian Nobel committee … your boys took a hell of a beating!” rebuke to the body that snubbed its favourite president.Foreign leaders such as Keir Starmer and Benjamin Netanyahu have learned over the past year that flattering Trump is like feeding gold candy to a baby. The more blatant and obvious, the better it works. Now, thanks to Infantino, Trump was centre-stage at world sport’s greatest spectacle.History sure does rhyme. Benito Mussolini used the 1934World Cupin Italy to promote a resurgent Roman empire. Before every match, the Italian team performed the “Roman salute”. Il Duce even created a special trophy, the “Coppa del Duce”, which was six times bigger than the official Jules Rimet World Cup trophy.The last time the US hosted the World Cup, in 1994, the draw was held in Las Vegas and President Bill Clinton did not attend. But Infantino, who regards America as football’s undiscovered country of profit, has pursued Trump as ardently as Count Dracula crossing oceans of time to find his lost love.The Fifa supremo was spotted at Trump’s second inauguration earlier this year and is a regular guest in the Oval Office and at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. He made no objection whenTrump elbowed his way into Chelsea’s Club World Cup celebration. Fifa has even opened a new office in Trump Tower in New York.The World Cup final draw was therefore held without irony at the Kennedy Center, where Senate Democrats have launched an investigation into alleged cronyism and corruption under the leadership of a Trump appointee, just round the corner from the Watergate building, where a burglary and cover-up brought down Richard Nixon.All veryFifa.The extravaganza began with the Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli belting out the aria Nessun Dorma, which translates as “None shall sleep” – a subtle dig at the president who has recently been seendozing at meetings?The hosts were the model and presenter Heidi Klum, wearing a shimming gold dress, and comedian Kevin Hart, wearing a black sweater with a sparkling necklace. There was the customary montage of football clips, including Diego Maradona’s second for Argentina against England in 1986 – perhaps Trump, often accused of cheating at golf, would have preferred Maradona’s shameless “Hand of God” first.Trump, who coined the phrase “truthful hyperbole” in his book The Art of the Deal, would surely have admired the way Infantino declared: “This will not just be the greatest football event, this will be the greatest event in human history, the greatest event that humanity will ever witness … This is like 104 Super Bowls in one month.”The Lex Luthor of world football got Americans in the audience to chant “USA! USA! USA!” then Canadians to chant “Canada, Canada, Canada!” and Mexicans to chant “Mexico, Mexico, Mexico!” Then, after a noisy display by Nicole Scherzinger and Robbie Williams, it was time for Trump’s moment of glory.As a glossy video played, a voiceover tried to convince everyone this prize had not just been made up entirely for Trump’s benefit. “Peace creates hope and football translates that hope into unity,” it said.“We honour a dynamic leader who has engaged in diplomatic efforts that create opportunities for dialogue, de-escalation and stability and who has championed the unifying power of football on the world stage.”It was more wordy justification than the Dodo offered in Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland: “All must have prizes.”The narration ran through the dodgy list of eight conflicts that Trump claims to have settled during his 10 months in office. It did not mention his fawning over Russia’s Vladimir Putin or extrajudicial killing of dozens of unnamed, untried people on small boats in the Caribbean. Any chance of VAR on this decision?The audience was treated to slow-motion video of Trump at the Gaza peace summit, Trump meeting the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, Trump signing the Abraham accords, Trump with the leaders of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda – and of Infantino giving him a thumbs-up like a proud football dad.Then came the presentation and, shortly afterwards, Trump standing on stage alongside the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, and Mexican president, Claudia Sheinbaum, behind plastic stands as if taking part in a gameshow. The US president tried to go all Ted Lasso, reminiscing about watching Pelé play for the New York Cosmos and admitting that soccer should be called “football”.Once the convoluted draw – did Trump’s eyes stay open? – was done, the show ended like a Trump rally with the Village People belting out Y.M.C.A. The president had got his prize and Infantino had got his man.

Photograph: Alan Gibson/The GuardianTāme Iti’s colourful memoir covers his decades-long fight for Indigenous rights in New Zealand and takes aim at ‘saboteurs’ in the governmentByEva Corlettin WellingtonFri 5 Dec 2025 18.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 5 Dec 2025 18.01 ESTShareThere are so many ways to begin telling the story of Tāme Iti, arguably New Zealand’s most recognisable Māori rights activist, who was once branded a terrorist by the state and is now considered by many a national treasure.You could begin with his formative school years at the foot of Te Urewera ranges, where he was made to write the lines “I will not speak Māori” as punishment for speaking his language – lines that have since become a prominent feature of his art and activism.Or the time he pitched a tent outside parliament, his hair long, his face not yet lined with his distinctive full-face tattoo, and pronounced it “the Māori embassy”, making front page news.You could start with his part in organising the famous 1975 Māori Land March that contributed to thecreation of the Waitangi Tribunal– a landmark institution set up to investigate breaches of theTreaty of Waitangi, the country’s founding document signed in 1840 between Māori tribes and the British Crown.View image in fullscreenTāme Iti at his home in the Bay of Plenty, New Zealand.Photograph: Alan Gibson/The GuardianOr the time he was arrested in the infamous 2007 Te Urewera raids, during which police raided the Tūhoe people, under the mistaken belief that Iti was building a domestic terrorist network. The police later apologised to Tūhoe.Iti – who was this year a finalist in the New Zealander of the Year awards – has been making headlines for more than five decades. Now, he is telling the story of his own beginnings.His memoir, Mana, is peppered with photographs of Iti sporting his distinctive bowler hat, alongside images of his art and the people who have fought for Indigenous justice alongside him. It is a personal story, as much as a history of the Māori cultural and political renaissance.‘Reframes history’: fears Māori knowledge diluted in plan to revise New Zealand curriculumRead more“This book isn’t really about me: Tāme Iti,” he tells the Guardian over the phone, while parked up on a road somewhere between Auckland and his home on the East Coast, Whakatāne.“The book is about us during that period of time, my generation.”At times, Mana reads like a rallying cry for the protection of Indigenous rights.“It’s time for an overhaul, it’s time to dismantle the whole infrastructure, down to its very foundation,” Iti writes in his final chapter. “It’s time for new relationships. Our own in the name of our whenua [land] – not someone else’s God, King and Country.”In other moments, the book feels like a thriller – there are art heists, run-ins with speed boats, protests that result in burning cars and flags being shot. But much of it is a deeply personal account of a man trying to make sense of, and ultimately reshape, the society around him.Iti’s commitment to Māori rights and expression, and forcing the country to reckon with its colonial history, took root early in his life. He was born in 1952 on a moving train and has “been on the move ever since”, he says. From the age of two, he was raised by an older couple as a “whāngai” child – a customary care arrangement – in Ruatoki, an economically poor and culturally rich area, near the East Coast of the North Island.View image in fullscreenIti is a longtime Māori activist, artist, actor, social worker and well known figure in New Zealand society.Photograph: Alan Gibson/The GuardianAs a child he listened to adults discussing the history of his iwi (tribe), Tūhoe, the waves of settler violence against his people, and the confiscation of iwi land.“Those conversations stuck in the back of mind and the rest is history,” he says.At school, he was prevented from speaking his language, and when, aged 16 he moved to Christchurch to take up an interior decorator apprenticeship, he experienced overt racism. Before then, he “never knew that people don’t like you because of the colour of your skin”.Soon, protests against the Vietnam war, and later South Africa’s apartheid, erupted in New Zealand. Iti soon joined the newly formed group Ngā Tamatoa – a Māori youth activist group set up to promote Māori rights, fight racism, and confront government policies.One of Iti’s first actions was establishing the “Māori embassy” on parliament’s lawns in 1972 – the sort of symbolic and theatrical protest action synonymous with Iti’s style, but which older generations, including his birth father, often found difficult to stomach.“My father’s generation was traumatised,” Iti says. “Everything was geared to: ‘how to be a Pākehā [European New Zealander]. God, King and country’.”But that mood changed, as the movement – led by groups like Ngā Tamatoa – gained prominence and started to push the dial on the recognition of Māori rights.View image in fullscreenIti photographed in waters of the Whakatāne River near his home.Photograph: Alan Gibson/The GuardianIti’s push to advance Māori rights has – and will remain – influential for generations to come, says Annette Sykes, a Māori rights activist and lawyer who has represented Iti.“He … led the Māori renaissance for land restoration and rights, but was part of the revolution for modern art and reclamation of art forms like tā moko [traditional tattoo],” Sykes tells the Guardian.She says his politics are fundamentally about caring for humanity. “Even though he is a small man, he is a giant in our world.”The final chapter of Iti’s book covers thehistoric 2024 hīkoithat became the largest ever protest march for Māori rights, and the2024 Waitangi Day event, which saw record crowds descend on the treaty grounds to confront the government.Since taking office, the coalition government has said it wants to end “race-based policies”. It has ushered insweeping rollbacksto policies that are designed to improve health, wellbeing and representation outcomes for Māori.During these events, hundreds of protesters wore T-shirts emblazoned with the words“ I will not speak Māori” – lines imbued with new potency, since Iti was forced to write them seven decades earlier.“The present coalition government – they are saboteurs … trying to create chaos out of their own paranoia,” he says, referencing the government’s policies to wind back the use of Māori in public services.“But I don’t care what they think,” he adds. “They are only here for a short period of time; we are here for ever.”Manaby Tāme Iti.

This summer saw the resurgence of the lighthearted genre, which at its best sends up the pretensions of overly serious genre with a barrage of pitched cliches, sight gags and stupid-clever puns.The Naked Gun, starring Liam Neeson and Pamela Anderson in a spoof of a buddy-cop spoof, opened to moderate box office success; the hapless rock band dialed it back up to 11 inSpinal Tap II: The End Continues. Reboots of the horror spoof gold-standardScary Movieand the Mel Brooks Star Wars ripSpaceballswere greenlit, and there wererumorsof a return for international man of mystery Austin Powers. Unserious times, it seems, beget appetite for knowingly unserious, joke-dense, refreshingly shallow fun.Oh. What. Fun. review – Michelle Pfeiffer leads Amazon’s underbaked Christmas turkeyRead moreThe latest of these goofy parodies, which premieres on the beyond-parody day that Fifa awarded Donald Trump aninaugural peace prizeand Netflix announced its plan to buy Warner Bros, is Fackham Hall, a Downton Abbey spoof that pokes at the very pokeable pretensions of gilded British period dramas. (Yes, Fackham rhymes with a crass kiss-off to the aristocracy.) Co-written by British Irish comedian and TV presenter Jimmy Carr and directed by Jim O’Hanlon, Fackham Hall has plenty of material to work with – the historical soap’s grand finale just premiered in September, 15 years after Julian Fellowes’s series started going upstairs-downstairs with ludicrous portent – and wastes none of it. From ludicrous start (servants rolling joints for the household and responding to calls from the “masturbatorium”) to ludicrous finish (someone manages to marry a second cousin rather than a first!), this enjoyable silver-spoon romp packs all of its 97 minutes with jokes and bits ranging from the puerile to the genuinely funny, proving that there may yet be more to wring from eat-the-rich satire.Like Downton, Fackham Hall is a pastiche of very self-important rich people and very obsequious servants, of effete masculinity and feminine gamesmanship. What is life as a British aristocrat, if not to drink tea and scheme others’ marriages? Having lost their four sons in four separate tragic accidents, the feckless Lord Davenport (an enjoyably affected Damian Lewis) and his anti-reading wife, Lady Davenport (Katherine Waterston), are left to focus on their daughters. Poppy (Emma Laird), the younger sister, has accomplished the family goal of finding the right first cousin to marry, lest the manor drift out of family control. But when Poppy bails on a future of know-nothing conversation with cousin Archibald (a perfectly smarmy Tom Felton) for a simpleton, the family’s hopes land on the unmarried Rose (Thomasin McKenzie) – at 23, a “dried-up husk of a woman”, according to her mother – whose belief in such things as female autonomy leads her to detest Archibald.Carr fares much better joking about the suffocating expectations on early 20th-century women often mined for self-serious drama – poor Rose just wants to read books (the scandal!) in but One Shade of Grey – than joking about women, as in hisdisastrous recent standup. The trope of respectable, enviable femininity are the stars here, and often make for the best punching bags; when plucky pickpocket Eric Noone (the dashing Ben Radcliffe), hand-selected from his London orphanage by a mysterious stranger to deliver a letter to Fackham, collides into Rose, he is inevitably sidetracked by an “incredibly beautiful woman with a kind of carefree essence that makes men grateful to be alive!”The return of the spoof: can comedy’s silliest subgenre make a comeback?Read moreAs befitting an intentionally ridiculous spoof, the plot is secondary to the bits, which Carr keeps delivering at an amiably humorous clip, with a solid three guffaws in the mix. There is a murder, and an incompetent investigation. The forbidden romance between Noone (pronounced “no one”) and Rose, played by Radcliffe and McKenzie as just the right balance of bumbling and beguiling, imperils the aristocrats’ best-laid plans. Genre skewering, pratfalls and spoof-staple wordplay abound. (“I’m here for the murder,” says the investigator (Tom Goodman-Hill). “I’m afraid someone’s already done it! But come in anyway,” says the butler.)It’s all in lighthearted fun, though that itself has limitations. The dialed-up silliness of a spoof can wear quickly, and the mileage on this particular variety runs out somewhere between sketch and feature. At a certain point, you might wish to return to the world of (very slight) reason. But you have to respect a sincere commitment to the artform – if we’re going to amuse ourselves to death, might as well laugh at it.Fackham Hall is out in US cinemas now, in the UK on 12 December and in Australia on 19 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsComedyDamian LewisJimmy CarrreviewsShareReuse this content"

So why do I have a Spotify ‘listening age’ of 86?Many users of the app were shocked, this week, by this addition to the Spotify Wrapped roundup – especially twentysomethings who were judged to be 100Donna FergusonFri 5 Dec 2025 10.07 ESTLast modified on Fri 5 Dec 2025 10.08 ESTShare“Age is just a number. So don’t take this personally.” Those words were the first inkling I had that I was about to receive some very bad news.I woke up on Wednesday with a mild hangover after celebrating my 44th birthday. Unfortunately for me, this was the daySpotifyreleased “Spotify Wrapped”, its analysis of (in my case) the 4,863 minutes I had spent listening to music on its platform over the past year. And this year, for the first time, they are calculating the “listening age” of all their users.“Taste like yours can’t be defined,” Spotify’s report informed me, “but let’s try anyway … Your listening age is 86.” The numbers were emblazoned on the screen in big pink letters.It took a long time for my 13-year-old daughter (listening age: 19) and my 46-year-old husband (listening age: 38) to stop laughing at me. Where did I go wrong, I wondered, feeling far older than 44.But it seems I’m not alone. “Raise your hand if you felt personally victimised by your Spotify Wrapped listening age,”wrote one useron X. Anotherpost, with a brutal clip of Judi Dench shouting “you’re not young” at Cate Blanchett, was liked more than 26,000 times. The 22-year-old actor Louis Partridge best mirrored my reaction when he shared his listening age of 100 on Instagram stories with the caption: “uhhh”.“Rage bait” – defined as “online content deliberately designed to elicit anger or outrage” in order to increase web traffic – is the Oxford English Dictionary’s word of the year. And to me, that cheeky little message from Spotify, warning me not to take my personalised assessment of my personal listening habits personally, seemed a prime example.“How could I have a listening age of 86?” I raged to my family and friends, when the artist I listened to the most this year was 26-year-old Sabrina Carpenter? Since I took my daughter to Carpenter’s concert at Hyde Park this summer, I have spent 722 minutes listening to her songs, making me “a top 3% global fan”.The only explanation Spotify gave for my listening age of 86 was that I was “into music of the late 50s” this year. But my top 10 most-listened to songs were all released in the past five years and my top five artists included Olivia Dean and Chappell Roan (who released their debut albums in 2023).Admittedly, Ella Fitzgerald is in there too. But her music is timeless, I raged; surely everyone listens to Ella Fitzgerald? “I don’t,” my daughter said, helpfully. “I don’t,” added my husband.It’s also true that I occasionally listen to folk music from the 50s and 60s – legends such as Pete Seeger, Bob Dylan and Joan Baez. But when I analysed my top 50 “most listened to” songs, almost all of them (80%) were released in the last five years.What’s particularly enraging is that Spotify knows my taste is best described as “eclectic” – because that’s how Spotify has described it to me. I have apparently listened to 409 artists in 210 music genres over the past year.None of it makes sense, until you see the extent to which inciting rage in users like me is paying off for Spotify: in the first 24 hours, this year’s Wrapped campaign had500 millionshares on social media, a 41% increase on last year.According to Spotify, listening ages are based on the idea of a “reminiscence bump”, which they describe as “the tendency to feel most connected to the music from your younger years”. To figure this out, they looked at the release dates of all the songs I played this year, identified the five-year span of music that I engaged with more than other listeners my age and “playfully” hypothesised that I am the same age as someone who engaged with that music in their formative years.In other words, no matter how old you are, the more unusual and idiosyncratic and out of step your musical taste is compared with your peers, the more likely it is that Spotify will poke fun at some of the music you enjoy listening to.But now that I understand this, rather than rising to the bait, I know exactly what to do. I walk over to my dusty, ancient CD player. I insert an old CD I bought when I was a teenager. I turn the volume up to max. And then I play one of my favourite songs, a classic song that everyone who has a listening age of 86 or over will know, like I do, off by heart: You Make Me Feel So Young by Ella Fitzgerald.Explore more on these topicsSpotifyDigital music and audiofeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sheep have a small sensory organ located above the roof of the mouth, and the flehmen response helps to flood it with any sex pheromones wafting about.Usually, rams flehmen when they encounter ewes during the mating period, according to Michael Stücke, a farmer with 30 years of experience raising sheep in Westphalia,Germany. But on Stücke’s farm, the rams flehmen “all the time”.“They do this all the time, because they find each other attractive,” said Stücke of his 35 male sheep. “They’re cuddling. They’re showing signs of affection. They’re jumping on each other. It’s undeniable that they’re attracted to each other.”View image in fullscreenMichael Stücke with one of his gay sheep.Photograph: Steve Marais for Rainbow WoolStücke is the proud shepherd of the world’s first and probably only flock of gay rams. Thoughresearchers have foundthat as many as 8% of male sheep are “male-oriented”, homosexuality is viewed disfavorably by most farmers, who expect rams to perform a breeding function. Rams who refuse to breed are often slaughtered for meat, and it was during a discussion of this harsh reality with Stücke’s friend and business partner Nadia Leytes that the idea forRainbow Woolwas born: “What can we do to not send all of them to the slaughterhouse?”“My heart beats for the weak and oppressed in general,” Stücke told the Guardian, with Leytes translating. “I am gay myself and know the prejudices and obstacles that come with being a gay man, especially in the agricultural business.”Homosexuality is not only part of the human condition, but of the animal worldMichael SchmidtRainbow Wool’s solution has been to buy gay rams directly from breeders, outbidding the price they might receive from a slaughterhouse, and keep them for their wool. The flock now numbers 35, and the farm has a waiting list. Individual sheep can be named and sponsored – they include a Bentheimer landschaf namedWolli Wonka, a Shropshire namedPrince Wolliam, andJean Woll Gaultier– and the wool is processed by a mill in Spain. All profits are donated to LGBTQ+ charities in Germany. “A couple of sheep [have been] saved but also a couple of people,” Leytes said, noting that their donations have supported relocating people living in countries where being gay is illegal.Correctly identifying a sheep’s sexual orientation can be tricky. “Everybody can just say: ‘Hey I have a gay ram,’” Stücke said, “but what we’re doing is observing their behavior.”“Some rams basically jump on everything, whether it’s female or male,” he added. “That would not qualify as being a gay ram. That would qualify as being a dominant. But if a ram consistently refuses to mate with a female sheep, this is the sign that you know he prefers other rams.”Stücke’s flock burst on to thefashion scenelast month when they provided the raw material for a knitwear collection designed by Chrome Hearts collaborator Michael Schmidt and sponsored by the gay dating app Grindr. Schmidt sent 36 looks down a New York City catwalk, all knit or crocheted from the wool of Stücke’s gay sheep. Each look represented a male archetype, starting with Adam sans Eve and including a pool boy, sailor, pizza delivery boy, plumber and leather daddy.View image in fullscreenModels wait backstage at Michael Schmidt’s presentation of I Wool Survive at Manhattan’s Altman Building.Photograph: Oliver Halfin“I really wanted to lean into the gay,” Schmidt told theNew York Times. “I view it as an art project. It’s selling an idea more than a collection of clothing, and the idea it’s selling is that homosexuality is not only part of the human condition, but of the animal world. That puts the lie to this concept that being gay is a choice. It’s part of nature.”The naturalness of homosexuality as demonstrated by the gayness of sheep has been a subject of media fascination for decades, thanks in large part to Charles Roselli, a professor of biochemistry at Oregon Health and Science University. Roselli’sresearchinto how sex hormones affect brain development is the source of the statistic about one in 12 rams being gay.View image in fullscreenDesigner Michael Schmidt greets the audience.Photograph: Randy BrookeIn 2007, his work fell victim to what the New York Timescalled“a textbook example of the distortion and vituperation that can result when science meets the global news cycle” when theTimes, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) and some gay rights activists accused Roselli – inaccurately – of seeking to “cure” homosexuality in rams and, ultimately, humans. (Roselli did not respond to an interview request from the Guardian.)Rainbow Wool has not been targeted with the same degree of vitriol – a snarky Telegraphheadlineabout a supposed “woke test” for New York’s fashion scene notwithstanding – but Stücke has been moving the gay flock from field to field to ensure their safety after receiving online threats. “Nobody knows where they are stationed because there’s a lot of haters,” Leyte said.View image in fullscreenModel Yves Mathieu walks in a delivery worker-inspired outfit.Photograph: Randy BrookeStill, the project has faced criticism for whitewashing the realities of animal farming, which demand “brutal, violent heteronormativity”, the scholars Gabriel N Rosenberg and Jan Dutkiewicz wrote in theNew Republic. “If anything, the gay wool fashion show should make us think not about the good fortune of the few rescued rams but about how animal farming systematically, routinely, and often violently exploits the reproduction of all the animals it encounters.”Rosenberg and Dutkiewicz point to a number of problems with ascribing human identities such as “gayness” to animals, including the fact that researchers only classify sexuality based on “topping” behavior, and have no way to register a ram’s preference for “bottoming”. “You can’t ask rams about their identities, and we have no evidence that sheep ascribe any special significance to sex in the way humans often do,” they write. “Calling rams gay risks either imputing human thoughts and feelings to sheep … or distorting what people mean by gay.”The limits of how far any kind of biological essentialism can get in helping to justify human rights through appeals to naturalism became immediately clear when I asked Stucke whether Rainbow Wool had any plans to provide sanctuary for lesbian sheep.“I am personally convinced there are lesbian sheep, and I would like to create a new herd out of them, but it’s really hard to determine,” Stucke said. A key problem is that it’s impossible to know female sheep’s sexual preferences. “The act of being jumped on happens without consent in most cases, especially if the female herd is being kept for profit – for lambs or for meat,” he said.Once a farmer starts taking an animal’s consent into account, is it possible to still be a farmer? What about the sheep whoprefer not to be shorn? Or eaten? Every year, approximately 6.5bn male chicks are “shredded alive” soon after they hatch, for the crime of being born male; female chicks get to live – but only for as long as they produce eggs.View image in fullscreenA sheep at Rainbow Wool’s farm.Photograph: Steve Marais for Rainbow WoolStücke is conscious of the limits of comparisons between farm animals and humans, but he nevertheless finds meaning and purpose in tending to his flock of gay sheep.“I had some times when it was not easy for me to accept who I was and how I was wired, especially growing up in a very conservative family,” he said. “I needed to find myself, and I found myself, and this is now something that I treat with openness.“If we can save an animal who is living in a different way, it sends a powerful message. It doesn’t have to be a direct comparison to say animals are just like people. It’s metaphorical.”Explore more on these topicsFashionAnimalsFarmingGermanyEuropeNew YorkLGBTQ+ rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We know it will eventually get here (supposedly in October 2027), but nobody knows quite what it will look like. Entire geological epochs may come and go before the film-maker finally decides which doyen of Batman’s infamous rogues’ gallery he wants to unleash next. The foundations of Gotham itself may shift before Reeves works out whichbrooding, rain-soaked grunge dittywill form the basis of the new soundtrack.And then – out of nowhere – comes this week’s news that Scarlett Johansson is in final talks tojoin the cast of the sequel. We have no idea who she’s likely to play but it matters not: this feels consequential, a bat-signal flickering to life over a city long abandoned. Johansson is more than just an A-lister; she’s one of the few actors who still puts bums on seatsandappears in Wes Anderson movies. She retains a veneer of golden-era Hollywood cool that feels exactly right.View image in fullscreenRobert Pattinson in The Batman.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyWhat does her involvement tell us? In years past, the media might have mocked up images of Johansson as Poison Ivy or Harley Quinn, but neither is particularly likely to show up. First there’sThe Batmanitself, which was one of the more orthodox and street-level big-screen outings. Not for Reeves a shared universe in which superheroes and villains exist alongside the Dark Knight’s more homegrown nemeses: this will be left for Andy Muschietti’s Batman: The Brave and the Bold, which – unlike the Battinson movies – will exist within James Gunn’s mainstream DCU.Reeves prefers his Gotham grimy and grounded. His villains aren’t cosmic tyrants; they’re maladjusted weirdos with unresolved childhoods. Quinn has already been introduced in Joker: Folie à Deux, and Johansson can’t play Sofia Falcone, because Cristin Milioti already snagged that role in The Penguin TV series. Options for well-known Batman-adjacent female characters are limited; Zoë Kravitz played a version of Catwoman in the last film.There has beenspeculation in corners of the blogospherethat Johansson might be playing Andrea Beaumont, AKA Phantasm, a villain whose serial-killer instincts would seem to fit Reeves’ penchant for Gotham tales steeped in crime, trauma and municipal mildew. Reeves has said he’s looking for an antagonist who“goes into Batman’s past and his life”, and Beaumont ticks that box with gusto: an old flame of Bruce’s in the comics and (more definitively) 1993’s animated Mask of the Phantasm film, a woman whose heartbreak curdled into masked vengeance. Her origin story even makes room for the Joker as a low-level mobster – a detail that would let Reeves begin teeing up Barry Keoghan’s chaos-goblin for a third instalment.Perhaps the more interesting question is what a five-year gap between episodes does to a franchise originally pitched as a three-part story. Trilogies are meant to build momentum, not ossify into prestige archaeological curios, yet here we are. Maybe that’s the charm of this strange, sodden universe. Perhaps this is just a Gotham where villains fester for years, A-listers drift in like supernatural omens, and every update feels like a transmission from some alternate Batverse.If Johansson really is joining the fray, at least this suggests the Reeves-Pattinson trilogy is stirring again, however tentatively. With luck, part two may just lumber into cinemas before Warner Bros unveils itsnextnew Batman.Explore more on these topicsFilmWeek in geekScarlett JohanssonThe BatmanMatt ReevesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The simple, elegant exterior that reflects the surrounding scenery and evokes traditional Sami dwellings is matched by an interior that has the most comfortable pews I have ever sat on. The stunning glass mosaic titled the Return of Christ at one end may not be to everyone’s taste, but to me had power and majesty. Exiting this magnificent building after an organ recital to be met by the northern lights flickering overhead was awe-inspiring.Bruce HortonViews over Nice from Matisse’s graveView image in fullscreenMonastère Notre Dame de Cimiez.Photograph: E Fesenko/AlamyI never understood what people get out of churches. TheMonastère Notre Dame de Cimiezis different. The flower and herb filled gardens offer a stunning view over Nice, and the cemetery contains Matisse’s grave, but it is the small chapel that truly captures what a church should be. Although it would never compare with grander establishments, that is the point. It has unostentatiously soaked up belief for centuries. Sitting there I couldn’t quantify the feeling I had. Peace? Tranquillity? Serenity? Yes, all of that, but something more, something that finally made me understand what people get out of churches.Robert StroudProfileReaders' tips: send a tip for a chance to win a £200 voucher for a Coolstays breakShowGuardian Travel readers' tipsEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

However, the highlight of the complex is the Duomo Vecchio, completed in the 12th century. A romanesque rotunda with an underground crypt, the cathedral is brimming with history and charm. Brescia’s cathedrals serve as a microcosm of Italy’s architectural evolution.Daniel BakerGlass and concrete masterpiece in GermanyView image in fullscreenMaria, Königin des Friedens (also known as Mariendom) was built in the 1960s.Photograph: Joern Sackermann/AlamyIn the Ruhr, south of Essen, is the town of Neviges in which stands one of the most breathtaking and individual cathedrals in the world. Maria, Königin des Friedens (Mary, Queen of Peace) is a modernist masterpiece built between 1966 and 1968 at the behest of Archbishop Frings of Cologne, a brave opponent of the Nazis during the second world war. Asymmetric galleries of concrete and stunning stained glass create a lofty space of light and warmth that belies any attempt to pigeonhole this design as “brutalist”. And if that’s not enough for a visit to this tourist-free location, then just down the road is the 8-mile Wuppertaler Schwebebahn – an amazing suspension railway.RichardViews of the Swiss Alps from LausanneView image in fullscreenLausanne Cathedral’s spectacular setting.Photograph: Guven Ozdemir/Getty ImagesLausanne Cathedral sits up high, with views stretching from the picturesque old town all the way down to the lake and the towering Alps in the distance. The cathedral is free, but for a small fee you can also climb the bell tower. As well as its impressive gothic architecture and breathtaking city views, the cathedral, which dates back to the 12th century, hosts a varied programme of free performances, exhibits and events as a popular venue in Switzerland’s most vibrant and artistic city.AmyOrkney shrine built by Italian prisoners of warView image in fullscreenThe Italian Chapel was built from Nissen huts in the mid-1940s.Photograph: Kevin Elsby/AlamyEach time I visit theItalian Chapelin Orkney, I feel humbled by the craftsmanship and faith of the Italian prisoners of war who built it. After a request from the camp priest, artist Domenico Chiocchetti and his fellow prisoners were allowed to use two Nissen huts joined together to provide a chapel. Using scraps of metal, wood, paint and anything else they could find, they created a beautiful chapel full of love and peace during a time of war – an inspiring place to visit 80 years later.Carol Haydenskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Set on a hill high above the River Aveyron, this huge fortress-like medieval marvel has endured centuries of construction, plague and the hundred years war. The interior is a gasp-inducing chamber of vaulted ceilings and towering pillars, all framing the colossal organ that greets you on entry. The pews and misericords are intricately carved and polished with time. It’s a bewildering feat of engineering that can only be enjoyed if you manage to draw your gaze from the hypnotic leer of the hundreds of writhing gargoyles that seem to burst out of the stonework outside. They don’t look carved, they look fossilised, long dead guardians of this beautiful basilica.Gareth RobertsMysterious beauty in a field in OxfordshireView image in fullscreenElements of St Oswald’s go back to Saxon and Roman times.Photograph: Wirestock /AlamyAlthough it’s easy enough to find, St Oswald’s in Widford sits in a remote field and the only access to it is via a rough footpath. Widford itself is a hamlet with only a few houses. Park on a nearby grass verge, walk over the cattle grid and head for what looks in the distance more like a barn than a church. The building is clearly mostly from the 13th century, but once you’re inside parts of an earlier church (Saxon or early Norman) become visible. Excavations of the site revealed Roman floor mosaics and partially uncovered wall paintings from the 14th century. Box pews from the 1700s are still in place. Mysterious, beautiful and powerful.Michael HStunning paint job, BulgariaView image in fullscreenThe Church of the Nativity, Arbanasi.Photograph: Peter Ptschelinzew/AlamyThe village of Arbanasi near Veliko Tarnovo surprised us with one of the most magnificent churches we had ever seen. From the outside, bar the braces that now protect it from earthquakes, theChurch of the Nativityis rather unassuming, possibly to not raise suspicions with the Ottomans then ruling. But the inside more than makes up for it. Every conceivable surface is painted with Orthodox icons and biblical scenes. It is truly overwhelming.MarcusWinning tip: beautiful windows in KentView image in fullscreenStained glass window by Marc Chagall at All Saints Church, Tudeley, Kent.Photograph: Pjr Windows/AlamyA couple of years ago, I went to All Saints Church in Tudeley, near Tonbridge in Kent. It’s a tiny church founded in the 12th century and restored over time. The church itself is quite ordinary, but all thewindows are by the brilliant French and Russian artist Marc Chagall. In 1963, a local couple commissioned Chagall to design a stained glass window for the church inmemory of their daughter. The artist liked the church so much he also designed the other 11 windows, in collaboration with glass-worker Charles Marq in Reims. The final windows were installed in 1985 shortly before Chagall’s death. The colours – a whole spectrum of blues – are magnificent. Being surrounded by all the blues in a peaceful place was blissful. And entry is free.Anna LowyThanks to everyone who contributed to this week’s readers’ travel tips. The shortlist here only represents a small proportion of the many wonderful entries we received.

Mexico have won one knockout game at theWorld Cup, beating Bulgaria last time they hosted, in 1986. Their manager, Javier Aguirre, was a forward in that side and will be targeting their third quarter-final as hosts. South Africa, coached by the veteran Belgian Hugo Broos, qualified for their first World Cup since hosting, finishing above Nigeria and Benin, despite having a game against Lesotho they appeared to have won awarded against them for fielding a suspended player.This will beSouth Korea’s 11th consecutive World Cup. Hong Myung-bo played in four of those, and came third in the voting for the Golden Ball when South Korea reached the semi-final in 2002. He is now their coach and led them unbeaten through a far from straightforward qualifying group. The fourth team in Group A will be aEuropean playoff winnerfrom the Czech Republic, Denmark, North Macedonia or Republic of Ireland.View image in fullscreenMexico and South Africa will once again meet in a World Cup opening game.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianGroup BCanadahave qualified for the World Cup twice and although Qatar 2022 brought their first goal in a finals, it did not bring their first point. Jesse Marsch is manager of probably the best squad in their history, with Jonathan David playing for Juventus and Alphonso Davies for Bayern. How kind the draw looks depends largely whether Italy make it through theUefa playoff(the other three teams are Bosnia and Herzegovina, Northern Ireland and Wales).After failing to qualify in 1998 and 2002,Switzerlandhave got through the groups in four of the past five World Cups and were quarter-finalists at the past two Euros. Murat Yakin’s side qualified unbeaten from probably the easiest of the Uefa groups and, in Ricardo Rodriguez and Granit Xhaka, have two players hoping to play at their fourth World Cups. Having finished fourth in their third-round qualifying group,Qatarwere handed a significant advantage by being chosen as a host for the fourth round and secured progress with a 2-1 win over the UAE. Julen Lopetegui’s squad is entirely drawn from the Qatari league.Group CView image in fullscreenScott McTominay and his Scotland teammates will be hoping to progress to the knockout stages for the first time.Photograph: Andy Buchanan/AFP/Getty ImagesScotland’s first World Cup in 28 years looks a lot like the last one, when they lost toBrazilandMorocco;Haititake the place of Norway. Their aim will be to make it through to the knockout phase for the first time after eight group-stage exits. Haiti’s only previous World Cup, in 1974, was notable less for their three defeats than for the fate that befell the midfielder Ernst Jean-Joseph who, after failing a drugs test, was beaten by Haitian army officers at the Munich Sheraton before being sent back to Port-au-Prince. They will have limited support because Haiti is on the USA’s travel ban list.Carlo Ancelotti became Brazil’s third managerin a qualifying campaign that included a run of three successive defeats, but there is little jeopardy in Conmebol qualifying these days. He has overseen a clear improvement. Semi-finalists in Qatar in 2022, Morocco look the best of the north African sides, capable both of overwhelming opponents and playing on the counter, qualifying with a 100% record.Group DView image in fullscreenThe form and fitness of Milan forward Christian Pulisic will be key for the hosts.Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty ImagesEarly last year, theUSAseemed in a dismal state, losing to Panama and Canada in the Concacaf Nations League and to Turkey and Switzerland in friendlies. But over the past year, Mauricio Pochettino has seemingly begun to get his message across and in November the USA beat Paraguay before thrashing Uruguay 5-1 in friendlies. They will start againstParaguay, who are playing in their sixth World Cup. They have won one game at each of the previous five, a record that has led to both group-stage exits and a quarter-final. The familiar defensive mindset hasn’t changed: they scored only 14 goals in their 18 games in Conmebol qualifying.This is not the most fluentAustraliaand their squad lacks obvious stars, but despite an iffy start to the third round of AFC qualifying, Tony Popovic’s side made it through by beating Japan at home and Saudi Arabia away under intense pressure in their final two matches. The group’s fourth team will come from the winner ofEurope’s playoff C(Kosovo, Romania, Slovakia or Turkey).Group EAfter successive group-stage exits,Germanyare no longer the bogeymen of old. The shift to a more progressive style has brought a vulnerability and the draw initially looked like presenting a huge challenge to Julian Nagelsmann’s side.Ecuadorwere the revelations of qualifying, finishing second behind Argentina in Conmebol. Although they scored only 14 goals in 18 games, a defence featuring Willian Pacho of Paris Saint-Germain and Piero Hincapié of Arsenal, protected by Chelsea’s Moisés Caicedo, conceded a paltry five.View image in fullscreenNick Woltemade will be a danger man for Germany.Photograph: Omar Havana/ReutersCôte d’Ivoirelive in a state of permanent declinism, where nothing is ever quite as good as the golden squad of 15-20 years ago. But since taking charge during the 2023 Cup of Nations, the head coach, Emerse Faé, has proved inspirational.After an implausible Afcon success on home soil, Côte d’Ivoire were ruthless in qualifying, scoring 25 without reply.The smallest country ever to qualify,Curaçao, were the fourth team drawn, though, making the group look a lot less daunting than it might have been.Group FRonald Koeman’sNetherlandsperhaps lack the star quality of previous Dutch generations, but they qualified unbeaten and Memphis Depay, who scored eight goals in qualifying, always looks a more reliable player with his national side than at club level. They open againstJapan, who will play in their eighth successive World Cup, and were by some way the most impressive of the Asian sides in qualifying, losing one of their 16 games across the two groups, with a combined goal difference of 54-3.Tunisiamade sure of a third consecutive World Cup appearance by dominating a straightforward qualifying group, picking up 28 points of a possible 30. Sami Trabelsi’s squad are perhaps not as dour as certain previous Tunisian sides; they had a remarkable 14 different scorers in qualifying. If Graham Potter’s Sweden make it through theUefa playoff(against Ukraine in the semi, then either Poland or Albania in the final), that will set up a repeat of the group game in Dortmund in 1974 when Johan Cruyff first performed the Cruyff Turn.Group GView image in fullscreenEgypt and Mo Salah will hope to impress in North America, after missing out on Qatar in 2022.Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty ImagesBelgiumandEgyptare emerging from the shadow of golden generations.

Mohamed Salah and Omar Marmoush give them cutting edge, but it was a defence that conceded twice in 10 games that meant they qualified unbeaten.A guaranteed place for Oceania effectively meant a spot at the finals forNew Zealand, who cruised through qualifying, winning five games out of five, scoring 29 goals, nine of them by Chris Wood, but they are the lowest-ranked side to have secured their place in North America next summer.Iran, who lost once in a tricky third-round qualifying group, are on Donald Trump’s travel ban list, potentially presenting a range of logistical problems.Group HView image in fullscreenSpain will undoubtedly be one of the teams to beat next summer.Photograph: Kevin Voigt/Getty ImagesSpain, the European champions, are the No 1 side in the Fifa rankings and with good reason. Blending the technical quality and patient possession game that has defined recent Spanish football with direct wingers comfortable running with the ball, Luis de la Fuente’s side dropped only two points and averaged 3.5 goals per game in qualifying.Uruguaystarted extremely promisingly under Marcelo Bielsa, but performances have declined and, aftera humiliating 5-1 defeat by the USA last month, there were reports of a divided dressing room.The rise ofCape Verdehas been remarkable. They did not reach their first Africa Cup of Nations until 2013, and have not qualified for this year’s tournament in Morocco. Their stingy defence, though, was enough to eliminate Cameroon. Back under the management of Hervé Renard,Saudi Arabialurched through qualifying, forced into the fourth-round repechage, conveniently held in Jeddah, and avoiding a further playoff for a place in the inter-confederational playoff on goals scored.Group IThe headline will be the meeting of Kylian Mbappé and Erling Haaland asFrancefaceNorwayin their final group game, but before that France take onSenegal,who beat them in the opening game in 2002. France have absurd depth in every position yet seem less than the sum of their parts. Mbappé is not an easy player to fit in a coherent system and there is a growing sense that Didier Deschamps, who captained them to glory in 1998 and managed them to glory 20 years later, with his fixation on Aimé Jacquet-style solidity, is holding them back. Norway qualified with a 100% record as top scorers in Europe: 37 goals in eight games.Senegal, managed by Pape Thiaw, a squad member in 2002, have been the best sub-Saharan African team for a while now. Sadio Mané remains the main threat, but their strength is the midfield, with Ismaïla Sarr, Pape Matar Sarr, Habib Diarra and Iliman Ndiaye all capable of contributing goals. The fourth team in the group will come fromplayoff 2(Bolivia, Suriname or Iraq)Group JView image in fullscreenWill it be one last hurrah Lionel Messi?Photograph: Natacha Pisarenko/APOnce the drought broke forArgentina, the rain has not stopped. They went 28 years without winning anything, but in the past four years under Lionel Scaloni they’ve lifted not onlythe World Cupbut also two Copas América, while finishing first in Conmebol qualifying. The only question is whether Lionel Messi, who will turn 39 during the tournament, is still worth his place in the starting lineup.Vladimir Petkovic’sAlgeria, in their fifth World Cup, are more open and entertaining than the team that won theCup of Nations in 2019. Ralf Rangnick’sAustriawere one of the most watchable sides at the last Euros and although they had to come from behind against Bosnia and Herzegovina in their final game to secure automatic qualification, they have largely maintained that form, thanks to a dynamic midfield in which Konrad Laimer is key.Jordan’s coach, the former Morocco midfielder Jamal Sellami, favours a 3-4-3 that proved particularly effective away from home, absorbing pressure and striking on the break.Group KCristiano Ronaldo,two games of his suspension for violent conduct mysteriously suspended, will be available for start of the tournament – although that is a mixed blessing for Roberto Martínez, who has made clear he will select the 40-year-old come what may. Without him,Portugal’s fleet of gifted attacking midfielders scored nine against Armenia in the final qualifier and there is a clear sense that his lack of mobility gums the mechanisms. DR Congo could offer a testing start if they progress through theplayoff(against either New Caledonia or Jamaica).The tendency is to hold upUzbekistanas one of the beneficiaries of the expansion of the tournament, but they had the fourth-best record in Asian qualifying and on that logic would have qualified for a 32-team tournament. Only Japan let in fewer goals in the third phase of Asian qualifying.Colombiareached the final of the last Copa América, held in the US. The evergreen James Rodríguez and Luis Díaz ensure plenty of attacking options.Group LThomas Tuchel was appointed with a specific brief: to win the World Cup. And for the second time in a row,Englandgo to a World Cup not just with hope but expectation. They qualified without conceding a goal and Tuchel had perhaps the greatest array of creative talent any England manager has been able to choose from. They really need Harry Kane to stay fit, though. For the third time in five tournaments they will face Zlatko Dalic’sCroatia. The highest-ranked of the pot two sides, they qualified with the minimum of fuss, dropping two points in the group.Ghana’s failure to reach this winter’s Africa Cup of Nations was almost inexplicable given the attacking talent available – Antoine Semenyo, Mohammed Kudus, Iñaki Williams, Abdul Fatawu, Jordan Ayew – and, with Otto Addo back as head coach they made their point by winning eight of 10 matches in qualifying.Panamapassed unbeaten through the final round of Concacaf qualifying to reach their second World Cup; England put six past them in Russia.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026World CupanalysisShareReuse this content"

His second arrowed into his pads, knocking him off his feet, and after a review the umpire raised his finger.Forty-five overs later, Australiawere all out for not many. But that was Perth, a bowling performance that started with a statement of intent from England’s premier fast bowler and a lead followed by his teammates.England rue five dropped catches as Australia build lead in second Ashes TestRead moreArcher’s first ball of this Test pitched outside leg stump and flew harmlessly behind Travis Head. His second was more wayward still, again going down leg. His third a wild overcorrection, well wide of off stump. His fourth went back the other way, down the leg side.Again the tone was set, much more discordant this time, and the lead was followed. By the end of the first session of day two here, the main topic of conversation was whether the bowling unit could possibly have fumbled an obviously key period any more clumsily. That kind of behaviour, after all, is normally their batters’ preserve.The pink Kookaburra is not known for being helpful for long, but it is known for being very helpful indeed for the short period when it is fresh and hard and the bowlers fresh and fast. Mitchell Starchad offered a blueprint on day oneand in the 13 day-night games he had played in Australia over the past decade.England did not appear to have so much as glanced at it. The plan was right there for them, but instead they went in with none: they peppered the pitch in all the wrong places, bowling too wide and then too straight, too short and then too full. It was miserable to watch and easy to face: much of the time the only thing that could possibly have been feeling less threatened than the two batters was the top of off stump.Australia’s innings, it is true, started with three maidens, but then Gus Atkinson bowled short and wide to Weatherald, who leaned back to nudge the ball down to the third man boundary – the first of an infuriating number of similar gifts, a flood of easy runs off the back foot – and they were away. Another boundary followed later in the over; in the next Archer got his line wrong again, the ball flicking Head’s buttock and running away for four leg byes.View image in fullscreenBrydon Carse took three wickets but at a cost of 113 from his 17 overs on day two.Photograph: Robbie Stephenson/PAFrom no runs after three overs they went at 7.1 an over until drinks, which gave England a sorely needed few minutes to regroup, an opportunity to huddle and chat, for someone to say a few telling, motivating words.The players’ body language here was fascinating: Ben Stokes spoke quietly to Brydon Carse, whose first over had just bled 14 runs, and everyone else just stood around.Steve Smith on top again after he resumes Ashes rivalry with Jofra Archer | Geoff LemonRead moreThey had by then been toiling for an hour in the Brisbane heat, mounting misery interrupted only by the moment when Archer – by a distance the least bad of England’s bowlers – happened upon the right line, found the edge of Head’s bat and Jamie Smith flubbed a straightforward catch behind the stumps.It was as close as they had come to encouragement and its effect was instead demoralising. The only thing the bowlers successfully achieved thereafter was identifying a method of guaranteeing it was not repeated. Head was struggling a little at the time of the drop and scored four off his first 29 balls. And then 29 off his next 14.Between drinks and tea the run rate dropped only marginally, to 6.8, even though Head miscued another of Carse’s invitations to score and Atkinson backpedalled to take the catch at mid-on.As this was happening, the words ofZak Crawley the previous nightfloated irrepressibly to mind. “I think it’s a good score,” he had said of England’s overnight total of 325, to which they would add another nine, “and the fact that we might score a bit quicker and get more runs in the day than Australia might play in our favour.”Well, yes, about that. It turned out it wasn’t just dinner Crawley was eating at the end of Friday’s first session, at which point Australia had ransacked 125 off their previous 18 overs and the tone for the day had been set.There was one period when they scored 91, with 16 boundaries, in the space of 11 overs, most of those bowled by Carse, whose inconsistency of line and length was at times bewildering, and Stokes – the pair who would briefly hint at rescuing the situation towards the end of the day.Crawley’s comment, and indeed the England total, may have felt reasonable at the time, but it seemed a bit less impressive a couple of playing hours later when only going off for tea halted Australia’s teeing off.Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26Jofra ArcherAustralia cricket teamEngland cricket teamAustralia sportThe AshesCricketanalysisShareReuse this content"

Buta spirited performance at Newcastle in midweekin which Cristian Romero equalised with an overhead kick in added time has lifted spirits after three successive losses.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreFrank has increasingly tinkered with his lineup as he attempts to juggle the demands of two matches a week, with only Chelsea and Wolves having made more changes this season. In particular, he seems undecided over the left of his attack, having rotated between Brennan Johnson, Mathys Tel and Wilson Odobert for most of the season. The £51m signing Xavi Simons has not started the past four matches.Asked whether he was still searching for his best team, the head coach said: “Yes, I think it’s fair. I’ve got an idea of quite a few positions. I also think there’s competition so it’s not that easy all the time to say: ‘OK, it’s just those 11,’ because you need more than 11 players. It’s a combination also with the amount of games and that rotation, so definitely for the rest of the season if we do well in the Champions League there will be rotations. But it will be closer and closer until you see the main nine or 10 players that we go with.”Frank spent nine years atBrentfordbefore replacing Ange Postecoglou at Spurs in the summer and he insisted old friendships would be put on ice on Saturday. Keith Andrews’ side have lost six of their seven league away games but Tottenham’s only home league victory came against Burnley on the opening day. Frank is confident his players are not mentally scarred by their disastrous start against Fulham.“It was a freak six minutes, but that of course happens when things are not perfect,” he said. “I think it’s about talking about it. You can’t run away from it … No matter what happens, stick to the plan. No matter what happens, be calm. And then encourage each other. And then like with everything, it’s one step at a time. Then we know every game you will have a bit of momentum. And then it’s about taking that.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I have a big belief that he’ll be very good for us … As long as the player trains well, keeps the right attitude, keeps doing the right thing, step by step, we will see him flourish.

The adrenaline of Aston Villa’s 4-3 comeback win at Brighton on Wednesday has probably only just faded. He made cinematic viewing and triggered memories of Mario Balotelli struggling to put on a warm-up bib and Tim Sherwood, while Villa manager a decade ago, launching his club-branded jacket towards the turf after Christian Benteke equalised against QPR.By the end, Emery was hoarse and Villa had chalked up an eighth victory in nine Premier League matches, 12 out of 14 in all competitions. Across the past 10 league matches, Villa have accrued a division-high 25 points and in that time onlyManchester City have scored more goalsandArsenal conceded fewer. This is the same team that failed to win any of their opening six matches and took three points from their first five league games. At that point Emery was concerned and shared his feelings with his squad, insisting his players raise their performance levels at training and in matches. Belief within an experienced squad – at 27.4 years, the average age of players selected in the league this season is the joint-oldest, with Fulham – did not waver.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreNow Villa will move within three points of Arsenal if they extend their winning streak to seven matches when they host the leaders on Saturday. Villa qualified for the Champions League 18 months ago and last season missed out on goal difference after anagonising final‑day defeatat Manchester United. But is this Villa squad at its peak? Might their experience be their superpower?Nine Villa players who featured in Emery’s first match, a 3-1 victory against United in November 2022, are key cogs in this machine. Emiliano Martínez, despite a moment of madness at Old Trafford in May, is the undisputed No 1, Ezri Konsa has evolved into an automatic pick for club and country, John McGinn and Boubacar Kamara are midfield monsters, and Lucas Digne, Matty Cash and Emiliano Buendía appear reloaded. Ollie Watkins leads from the front and Tyrone Mings was a regular until he was injured.The scary thing for Villa’s rivals is that while their top-flight record has been peerless since rallying against Fulham at the end of September, they have not necessarily been entirely convincing. They have not been blowing away teams, bar their 4-0 rout of a Bournemouth side in the midst of a five-game winless streak. October brought four wins in five matches, the highlights surely Cash, Digne and Buendía combining to devastating effect to earn acomeback victory at Tottenham, and a statement win over Manchester City, in which the right-back Cash scored the only goal with a wicked left-foot strike. November brought five wins in six matches. And yet, until scoring twice in midweek, Watkins, Villa’s only bona-fide striker, had scored only once across 19 matches.View image in fullscreenUnai Emery could not contain himself when Aston Villa came from behind to beat Brighton.Photograph: Sean Ryan/IPS/ShutterstockThe slow-burn emergence of the former Arsenal youngster Donyell Malen has helped, the Netherlands forward signed from Borussia Dortmund in January last year is Villa’s leading goalscorer after stepping out of the shadows. Emery recently explained Watkins had been managing knee pain since the start of last season. If his double against Brighton can spark a goalscoring run, Villa will surely be an even stronger proposition. The England forward, 30 at the end of December has hit double figures in each of his five previous seasons at the club, scoring 19 and 16 goals, respectively, in the 2023-24 and 2024-25 campaigns.Villa’s home form has been a foundation for success. They have been formidable at Villa Park since Emery took charge, the Basque losing eight of 58 league games there and only two since the start of last season:Crystal Palace’s 3-0 win in Augustthat heightened those early concerns and Arsenal’s last visit – just over 15 months ago. Since that Palace defeat, Villa have won their eight home matches across all competitions, conceding three goals.This season Digne, Cash, Kamara, McGinn and Morgan Rogers, an inspired Emery-driven signing last year, have agreed new contracts after an unsettling summer. The £40m sale of Jacob Ramsey to Newcastle to help comply with profitability and sustainability regulations (PSR) demoralised several of the squad and led some players to question their futures.

Most presumed that was a given considering Elliott arrived fresh from winning the player of the tournament asEngland retained the Under-21 European Championship, but he has not featured since 2 October. Sancho, borrowed from United, is yet to start a league match.Last month McGinn, the likable Villa captain, spoke of the “hangover” from missing out on the Champions League. “It was a big wake-up call to everyone how important these rules are,” he said of PSR. “It was a lot of uncertainty for players that left, players that stayed, and it certainly did affect us. It was tricky, but my job was to keep the players as focused as possible. And I think we’ve recovered now, after a slow start.”Explore more on these topicsAston VillaUnai EmeryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The paddock positively hums with a febrile, pulsing excitement and sense of expectation that is impossible to ignore. Amid all of which the title favourite,Lando Norris, finds himself at the moment he has dedicated his life toward, destiny lying in his own hands.After a gruelling 23-race trek around the world, the conclusion of all the work, sacrifice and effort will be decided in just an hour and a half on Sunday afternoon in Abu Dhabi.McLaren will use team orders in quest for F1 world drivers’ title in Abu DhabiRead moreNorris has been fascinating to observe across a season during whichhe opened on top, was then eclipsed by his McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri before mounting a comeback in the final third to retake the lead. Entering the final rubber at the Yas Marina Circuit, he holds a 12-point advantage over Red Bull’s Max Verstappen and 16 over Piastri.Back in April at Suzuka, Norris was as forthright and honest as ever whenwe discussed his title hopes. At the time a potential championship decider was a world away but he was already adamant about how he would like to win it.“I feel like there is a very prescribed version of how people say a world champion needs to be – overly aggressive,” he said. “I’ll do whatever I can to win a championship but maybe I won’t sacrifice in my life as much as some others, in terms of who I am as a person and have the ‘fuck you’ mentality people say you’ve got to have. I still believe I can be a world champion but doing it by being a nice guy.“I want to just enjoy my life. That’s kind of the attitude that’s maybe not as much of a killer instinct. I just don’t think you have to have that to be a world champion. I want to prove you can be a world champion and not have it. I’ll still take risks and I’ll still do whatever I know I can do to be a world champion but without losing the liberty ofwhoI am.”This weekend will present the acid test of how Norris copes with maintaining that sense of self. Thus far, true to his word, he has played a straight bat. The British driver has got his elbows out on occasion as he didagainst Piastri in Singaporebut has kept a good relationship with his teammate as the title race has fluctuated between them and as Verstappen charged back into the reckoning.It was instructive that as he composed himself preparing for the decisive race, Norris still had that sense of perspective. “If it doesn’t go my way, then I try again next year,” he said. “It’ll hurt probably for a little while but then that’s life. I’ll crack on and try and do better next season.View image in fullscreenLando Norris in relaxed mood in the pit lane.Photograph: Clive Mason/Getty Images“I also feel like I have the mentality of ‘I have nothing to lose’ because it’s just a race for a championship. In 30 years’ time, I probably won’t think of it that much either way. So, I’m not too bothered.”Such nihilist analysis is surely a mechanism to allow him to focus simply on the job at hand, rather than the import which hangs so heavy over it.Of the many permutations of what might happen on Sunday, if Norris does not seal it the criticism he is most likely to receive is that he is not ruthless enough and that he may well have been beaten by Verstappen who has no such qualms.Indeed, the most ominous sign going into the weekend washow entirely relaxed the defending world champion was. Observing him laughing and joking about the task ahead and his repeated observations that he had nothing to lose, must have given Norris and the outsider Piastri pause for thought.Verstappen has closed out four consecutive drivers’ championships. His nerves are certainly not jangling, he feels no pressure. He noted in Abu Dhabi that his parents were not attending as he had no expectation to be in the title fight at the finale.“I have four of those [trophies] at home, so it’s nice to add a fifth,” he said to laughter when asked about his ambition going into the race. “I’ve already achieved everything that I wanted to achieve in F1 and everything is just a bonus. I just keep doing it because I love it and I enjoy it. That’s also how I go into this weekend, have a good time out there, try to maximise the result.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The first title is always the hardest and any error in this race might make the difference. Verstappen was so nervous on the final laps of his controversial first championship winhere in Abu Dhabi in 2021that his calf muscles began cramping.The mathematics of this decider have many permutations but put simply, Norris will win if he finishes in front of both his rivals or claims third place or better. Verstappen would need to win and hope Norris finishes outside the podium places while Piastri would need to win and have the Briton finish sixth or lower.View image in fullscreenDefending champion Max Verstappen (left) is the closest challenger to Lando Norris (centre) while Oscar Piastri (right) can also win the title if events go his way in Abu Dhabi.Photograph: ANP/ShutterstockOther factors might yet also be in play but will not become clearer until after qualifying. In terms of performance the track in Abu Dhabi is finely balanced between McLaren andRed Bull, with both enjoying sectors that will suit their car. Equally, Mercedes and Ferrari will expect to be strong at least in fighting to be the third and fourth fastest cars and drivers from both teams might project themselves into the title fight.All four of whom drivers will pursue their goal of finishing as well as possible with no thought for how it affects the protagonists around them. On recent form George Russell and Charles Leclerc might expect to be in the mix, especially if there is an upset in qualifying. Neither will yield a place easily.View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen can take the title if he wins in Abu Dhabi and Lando Norris fails to make the podium.Photograph: Antonin Vincent/DPPI/ShutterstockHowever, one advantageMcLarendoes enjoy is that both their drivers will be in said mix. Verstappen’s teammate Yuki Tsunoda is highly unlikely to play any part in the Dutchman’s charge given how far off the pace he has been this season .Indeed, unless Norris or Piastri suffers a cataclysm in qualifying the three protagonists will probably be duking it out at the front for the championship on Sunday and that is what everyone wants to see.

But defeats on their home turf on the outskirts of Salford have been a rarity in recent seasons under Sanderson; now they have suffered two inside a week.The Sale director of rugby, whose side lost 27-26 at home to Exeter after leading 26-6, said: “I’m not concerned – I’ve been on longer runs of losses in 20 years of coaching.“I understand that at times it gets hard, but that’s the way sport goes and it’s about finding a way to work your way out of it. Weirdly, some part of me enjoys that aspect of the job. You have to otherwise you’ll spend 30-40% of your life in abject misery.”Smith, Glasgow’s head coach, could not hide his delight after another notable victory over Sale, who they thumped 38-19 at Scotstoun last December. The South African said: “Sale were on a revenge path after last year, but I’ve got a lot of confidence and trust in my boys. We often fight back, but to score 26 points after you’ve been down 14 was important. Now it’s on to the next challenge.”View image in fullscreenMarius Louw dives over for Sale’s third try to bring them back into the match in the second half.Photograph: David Rogers/Getty ImagesIt was a bitterly cold, windswept evening, the kind that can test the soul, but Sale quickly warmed to their task. With the wind at their backs, they led when their captain, Ernst van Rhyn, outmuscled the visiting defence to squeeze over from close range and Rob du Preez converted.Sale lost the centre Rekeiti Ma’asi-White to injury in the 16th minute but his replacement Ollie Davies, 19, scored on his Champions Cup debut soon after following excellent work from the full-back Arron Reed.Du Preez’s second conversion put Sale 14-0 ahead but Glasgow steadied themselves and began to go through the phases in home territory. Their pressure finally told in the 32nd ­minute when the hooker Gregor ­Hiddleston was driven over in the left corner.Moments before the interval, ­the Scotland flanker Rory Darge dived over from close range and Adam Hastings’s conversion cut Sale’s lead to two points.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A poor box kick from Sale’s scrum-half, Raffi Quirke, was seized on by Steyn and he showed impressive speed and strength to break away, outpace a leaden-footed home defence and score.It was awful defending and Hastings added the conversion to put Glasgow 21-14 in front before his side grabbed a fourth try in the 54th minute. This time the impressive McDowall capitalised on more dreadful defending to canter over from close range on his 100th appearance for the Warriors, who had now scored 26 points without reply.In the 64th minute, Marius Louw scored Sale’s third try after good work by Tom O’Flaherty. Du Preez converted to cut Glasgow’s advantage to five points.Could Sanderson’s men, with Ben Curry having been introduced, rouse themselves once again to find a match-winning score? The answer was no as Sale were left with a now familiar sinking feeling.Sanderson, a positive person by nature, said: “We lost by a point last week and five points tonight, so it’s not a big step to start turning things around and getting wins. I’m ­encouraged by that, but there are some things we can do better.”Explore more on these topicsChampions CupSaleGlasgow RugbyRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

Owen Farrell, Elliot Daly, Tom Willis and Nick Isiekwe are some of the­distinguished names who will line up in north ­London aiming to put a small, symbolic dent in the notion that French clubs are poised todominate the competition again.Even without the rested England captain, Maro Itoje, and back-row Ben Earl – both recently returned from a successful autumn campaign – the quality of the lineup indicates the depth required for a deep tournament run.New recipe for success required to stop France’s grands chefs dominating the Champions CupRead moreNoah Caluori, the 19-year-old who shot to prominence in October and was rewarded withan England call-up, makes his European debut: the presence of the 6ft 4in wing, allied to Farrell’s kicking prowess, will be causing some stress among Clermont’s coaching team.Saracens last lifted the trophy in 2019, when theybeat Leinster in the final, and Caluori had yet to enter his teens.Exeter triumphedthe following year,but since then French clubs and the Dublin-based province have dominated, at least based on final appearances if not silverware in Leinster’s case.ForSaracens, 2020 brought the conclusion of the salary-cap scandal that resulted in them being demoted to the Championship: the cap that significantly hampers Prem sides aiming to fight on two fronts, ­domestically and in Europe.A further hazard for clubs producing Test players is losing them to international duty, injuries ­sustained while away and the obligation to rest them at inconvenient times. Jamie George is a case in point. The ­veteran hooker is recovering from a ­hamstring injury sustained in England’swin against the All Blackslast month, but there is no better qualified spokesperson.George began this year by reaching 300 Saracens appearances and brought up a century of England caps,against Italy, in the Six Nations soon after. While he is not exactly downbeat on Saracens’ prospects, his assessment is an exercise in managing expectations.View image in fullscreenJamie George, who misses the visit of Clermont with a hamstring injury, says competing with French clubs in Europe is ‘very challenging’.Photograph: Ben Brady/Inpho/Shutterstock“It’s very challenging,” he said of the Prem teams’ task to compete domestically and in Europe. “What Bath did last year [winning theEuropean Challenge Cupandthe ­Premiership] was very impressive, so they have proven it’s possible. They have really great strength in depth.”Bath’s double was a fine ­accomplishment, but George knows preventing the most coveted European trophy again falling into French hands will be a ­different ­matter. “There’s got to be a little bit of luck on our side in terms of keeping ­people fit and generating a little bit of ­momentum going into the ­competition,” he said. “French rugby’s in a brilliant spot.”Clermont, who Saracens defeated at Murrayfield in the 2017 final, have problems of their own. They listed 14 players as unavailable due to injury, Alivereti Raka the most notable among them. Régis ­Montagne of France and Marcos Kremer of Argentina are unavailable due to the recent international window.Added to salary-cap restrictions for English clubs is a recent factor that is theoretically the same for all: ­playing in South Africa. The forecast is 11C for the ­Clermont encounter and 30C in Durban a week later, when Saracens face the Sharks.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We didn’t do so well last time we went out there, in Pretoria. We had a pre-season trip to Durban, we checked out the sights, so we know what to expect.”When George passed the 300-cap mark for his club in January, Saracens’ director of rugby, Mark McCall, said his longevity is due to “competitive spirit and drive … but he’s able to combine that with being a really good bloke.”Quick GuideCurry to face no action for Contepomi clashShowNo formal sanctions will be issued in the incident after the Argentina coach, Felipe Contepomi, accused England player Tom Curry of hitting him after last month’s Autumn Series fixture.Contepomi told reporters Curry had hit him in the tunnel and called the flanker a bully after a 27-23 loss to England in London.“On considering all factors leading into and beyond incident, based on the balance of information, and acknowledging a highly charged end to the fixture, no formal sanction will be issued to either party,” Six Nations Rugby said in a statement.“However, this incident will remain on record and should a similar incident by either party occur in future tournaments, the record of this incident will be brought to the attention of the relevant disciplinary committee.”ReutersWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Similarly it tells you a lot about George’s personality that Steve Borthwick, the England head coach, asked him to stay with the squad at Pennyhill Park in a leadership capacity after his injury. “That was really cool for me to do,” George said. ”I’d loved the ­previous three weeks and felt like I could still add, even if I wasn’t ­necessarily on the field.”Asked for his favourite European wins aside from the obvious finals, George said. “The Toulon game in 2016. That was an amazing win. They’re the ones you remember for a very long time. It was a full-circle moment, one of the times we realised we were in the place we needed to be in order to be successful.”After kicking things off againstClermont Auvergne, Saracens will know a little more about the place they in are now.Explore more on these topicsChampions CupSaracensClermont AuvergneRugby unionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The announcement of the deal in June was led by lengthy remarks from Rehal, who described the takeover as “more than a business venture” and “a long-term commitment, rooted in respect, responsibility, and a genuine love for the game”.Morecambe are 22nd in the National League, having gone into pre-season with five registered players.The Independent Football Regulator (IFR), which was not in place when the takeover went through, said it would “urgently” assess the situation at the club. “We are working with relevant authorities and using our statutory information gathering powers to look into this matter urgently,” a spokesperson said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Skelton would be the first trainer to complete the Paddy Power/Coral/Tingle Creek treble, too.A win for L’Eau Du Sud might also be a useful nerve-stiffener for his trainer, as Il Etait Temps has the potential to be among Mullins’s biggest money-earners this season.The Flat season was already up and running when the seven-year-old returned from a 359-day absence in the Grade One Celebration Chase over Saturday’s track and trip in late April, and so Il Etait Temps’s impressive five-and-a-half length defeat of Jonbon did not, perhaps, receive quite the attention it deserved.It was every inch a Grade One performance, though, and backed up by an excellent time, and while Jonbon was much further behind L’Eau Du Sud in the Shloer Chase at Cheltenham last time, better ground could well see Nicky Henderson’s runner improve significantly for the run.View image in fullscreenGrey Dawning’s owner Robert Kirkland, left, and trainer Dan Skelton, centre, after winning the Betfair Chase at Haydock in November.Photograph: Danny Lawson for The Jockey Club/PAWith the major contenders all priced up between 10-11 and 4-1, this is a three-way go for the Tingle Creek that summons memories of the match-up between Moscow Flyer, Azertyuiop and Well Chief in this race in 2004. All three principals are Grade One winners over course and distance and while the nine-year-old Jonbon may struggle to reverse his recent form with Il Etait Temps and L’Eau Du Sud, there is very little between the latter pair on ratings, form or the pick of their time-figures.As a result, the bet at the prices in a race to savour is surelyL’Eau Du Sud(3.00)at around 5-2. He won as he pleased at Cheltenham last time but still posted a very strong time in the conditions, and while he may not have as much scope for improvement in fitness terms as his main rivals, a repeat of his latest form could well be enough.Sandown 1.20 A 7lb for a second successive win looks generous forTurndlightsdownlowand is largely offset by Freddie Keighley’s claim.Sandown 1.50Four exciting novice chase prospects for the card’s first Grade One and none more so than the four-year-oldLulamba,last year’s Triumph Hurdle runner-up.Aintree 2.05Edelak,a product of the Aga Khan’s breeding operation, did enough on the Flat for Johnny Murtagh to suggest he will be an interesting recruit to juvenile hurdling.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Saturday tipsShowWetherby11.10 Ade Boy 11.40 Athair Mor 12.17 Kilbarry Hill 12.50 Chase A Fortune 1.25 Express Surprise 1.57 Solly’s GoldAintree11.48 Captain Hugo 12.24 Sandscape 12.58 Inedit Star 1.30 Margaret’s Legacy 2.05 Edelak 2.40 White Rhino 3.15 Rambo TChepstow11.55 The Price Of Peace 12.29 Ben Solo 1.04 Idefix De Ciergues 1.36 Pats Fancy 2.11 Bective Abbey 2.46 Modern Man 3.21 PresleySandown12.10 Sober Glory 12.43 Sunset Marquesa 1.20 Turndlightsdownlow (nap) 1.50 Lulamba 2.25 Go Dante (nb) 3.00 L’Eau du Sud 3.35 TanganyikaWolverhampton4.30 Arnaz 5.00 Galileo Charm 5.30 Archers Bay 6.00 R P McMurphy 6.30 Zryan 7.00 Yurinov 7.30 Hackney Diamonds 8.00 Gilt Edge 8.30 I Can ImagineWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Sandown 2.25Track specialistGo Danteis just 1lb higher than for the first of his two Imperial Cup victories.Aintree 2.40It is still early days forWhite Rhinoas a chaser and his return to action over the National fences in the Grand Sefton was a non-event after he was hampered at the third.

I’ve never forgotten his – it felt maliciousFormer Dulwich pupil says Farage told him: ‘That’s the way back to Africa’Fri 5 Dec 2025 13.12 ESTFirst published on Fri 5 Dec 2025 12.52 ESTShareFor someone who has waited so long – umming and erring, should I or shouldn’t I – about whether to speak out, it became abundantly clear on Thursday what I had to do. There was Nigel Farage holding a press conference on live television and responding to racism allegations from his teenage yearsby lambasting the BBC and ITVfor giving airtime in the 1970s to the comedian Bernard Manning and the fictional character of Alf Garnett. As a Christian, I could not help but see it as the most amazingly disingenuous example of the phrase “let he without sin cast the first stone”. It was also the final straw.My late parents were born in Nigeria and came to the UK in the 1950s. For the Windrush generation, I am told it was a ship ride of many days. My parents came to serve, as is so typical of immigrants from the Commonwealth at the time. My mum had to undergo “further” training as a nurse despite having already practised as a nurse in Nigeria, while my dad qualified as an osteopath. They both in effect came over here to participate in creating a healthy nation, whether via the NHS or in a private capacity.Nigel Farage’s shifting answers on school-days racism claims – a timelineRead moreI will spare everyone their experiences of racial abuse in the 1950s and 1960s, both “direct or indirect”, both “with intent or without intent”, both “malicious or non-malicious”. Not only does this categorisation,deployed by Farage in recent days to explain away his behaviour, distract from the real issue, it is an unnecessary attempt to imply some levels of racist abuse are tolerable. But I was simply not there to experience the vulgarity of that period. It is not my story. I was, though, at Dulwich college, a public school in south-east London, at the same time as Farage, the teenager. That is a story I can – and now want – to tell.I went to the school for a year between 1980 and 1981, starting at a mere nine years of age. I was in the most junior class (JC) at the time, in a college that was so large, consisting of lower, middle and upper schools with an age range from nine to 18. My hard-working parents celebrated with pictures as proud parents would do when their child is so privileged to attend such a well-reputed educational institution.It took him a while, I recall, but one day Farage, and at least one other, spotted me in the lower-school playground. He was about 17. He towered over me. “Where are you from?” he asked. Within seconds of offering my rather confused and sputtering answers, he had a clear response. “That’s the way back to Africa” with an accompanying hand gesture pointing towards a place far away.View image in fullscreenYinka Bankole with his father, Dr Oluwole O Bankole.Photograph: Yinka BankoleOnce my existence as a target was established, he would wait at the lower-school gate, where I was dropped off for school, so as to repeat the vulgarity. I will leave it to the reader to decide whether this was “malicious or non-malicious”, “meant with intent or not with intent”, “direct or non-direct”. I know how I experienced it. It certainly felt malicious to me.I’ll never forget the look of hatred he had for me, seemingly simply for existing. Without knowing my name but just looking at me with what appeared to be no appreciation of my humanity and simply because of how I looked.Farage has suggested that it is inconceivable that anyone could recall such events of more than four decades ago. I would simply ask: can a victim of such abuse ever forget? I know I haven’t forgotten. I recognise his walk every time I see it on TV as that same walk that used to approach me.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The thought terrifies me of what could have happened if I was there the following year when the bully would have had even more authority. The prospect of him having infinitely more of that in a few years’ time is truly a chilling thought.My mum died this year and I try to live by her peaceful, tolerant, “just get on with it” attitude to life. It is one common to the vast majority of immigrants to a new country. But quite why such events from more than four decades ago have stuck with me will be well understood by those who have experienced something similar. Sometime ago, I started putting down some thoughts in a memoir, dedicated to my mum. I did not think I was quite ready for it to have a wider readership. But the sight of a perpetuator denying or dismissing hurt will always be a trigger for even the quietest, most peaceful private person to finally feel the need to speak out.Explore more on these topicsNigel FarageRaceReform UKLondoncommentShareReuse this content"

What Netflix hopes to achieve by buying Warner BrosAndrew PulverIP success stories such as Barbie and the DC Universe? That elusive best picture Oscar? Or perhaps the main goal is a good old-fashioned blockbusterFri 5 Dec 2025 11.59 ESTLast modified on Fri 5 Dec 2025 14.33 ESTShareCorporate Hollywood has undergone huge upheavals in recent years – as consequential, perhaps, as the 1970s and 80s, when the studio marques that had made their names in the movies’ golden age were being bought up by international conglomerates. The acquisition of Warner Bros – legendary for crime pictures in the 40s and 50s, and Batman movies in the 90s and 00s – by a streaming service feels particularly significant, coming as it does on the back ofthe merger of Paramount with Skydance Mediaearlier this year and, in 2019,Disney’s purchase of fellow studio 21st Century Fox.What is most evident in all these deals is how streaming services have changed the game. Disney’s buying spree – which had previously included Marvel, Star Wars and Pixar – in retrospect looks essentially like preparatory positioning to increase the marketability of their Disney+ player. It is significant thatthe new Paramount regime’s first movewas to prise Stranger Things creators Matt and Ross Duffer away from Netflix. And Netflix, of course, have made their billions by upending the traditional pitch-session-to-cinema pipeline that had sustained the film industry for decades. They have signed up legions of the classiest directors, hogged nearly all the audience-friendly documentaries and premiered one water-cooler series after another.So what do Netflix get out of buyingWarner Bros? Is it really the end of big screen cinema as we know it? Partly, of course, Netflix is getting its hands on successful IP (intellectual property), the most valuable commodity in today’s entertainment industry. (In this case, it’s DC Universe movies, Harry Potter, Barbie and Game of Thrones.) But there’s something else at play here: for all its success, there are two things Netflix wants and has never achieved. First is to win the Academy Award for best picture and, second, to make a proper blockbuster movie. It’s well to remember that Netflix is a US corporation, not the radical guerrilla outfit it sometimes presents itself as; the Netflix suits like rubbing shoulders with other studio suits at the Oscars, which after all is Hollywood’s ultimate end-of-year knees-up. And they want their films to be at the heart of mainstream American culture in the same way their TV shows are; something that has hitherto eluded them, except on sporadic occasions.The other point to remember about Netflix is that for much of its life it has made its money by selling subscriptions to its platform; individual film results didn’t matter to the bottom line, other than to attract more subscribers and reward talent on performance-related deals. That will have changed whenNetflix started to show ads– the better a film does, the more they can charge – and perhaps the company’s internal culture has slowly morphed towards a more traditional studio type than before. Certainly – to considerable relief on the part of cinema operators everywhere – Netflix gradually realised the benefits of showing their films in cinemas, especially their more prestige items. Partly it has major marketing benefit (even if it won’t make them that much money); partly it keeps the big names happy, who can’t turn up at a red carpet event for a streaming premiere; and partly because it’s the way to qualify for an Oscar.There’s still the question of the “window” – the period of exclusivity physical theatres get to show a film before it heads to home entertainment formats – and it’s significant thatNetflix moved quickly to reassure cinemasthat Warner Bros’ current slate of films will still be released on the big screen. That being said, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos did say the window would “evolve”; it doesn’t take much reading of the runes to realise that will mean any film will be yanked out of cinemas on to streaming platforms as soon as it has served its purpose.In the end, though, the reasonNetflixbought Warner Bros is surely to get its hands on the machinery of making big-scale, big-money, big-screen entertainment; something it’s tried and failed to do in the past. With money-trap efforts like The Electric State, The Gray Man and Red Notice failing to set the world on fire, the company has found to its considerable cost that making blockbuster films is a lot trickier than it looks. With access to Warner Bros it now has a fighting chance.Explore more on these topicsFilmWarner BrosNetflixFilm industrycommentShareReuse this content"

Leaked messages froma WhatsApp groupcontaining several senior members of Reform UK in Wales seemed to suggest that the party’s director of communications called me a bad word in January this year. I won’t say the word, but it’s the bad one beginning with C.Personally I don’t have any issue with being called that inside a private group. I would have considered it a stain on my professionalism if any political party’s comms chief had given me a glowing review. Mates of mine have actually suggested that it’s perhaps the most accurate thing to come out ofReform UKHQ. However, it is symbolic of behaviour from Reform in Wales that makes me far more concerned about what the party would be like in power, and which should worry voters both here in Cymru and in the wider UK. The first concern has to be its attitude to scrutiny.The message thread in which Reform treated me with such warmth was discussing a social media post where I’d suggested that the fact the party hasn’t named a Welsh leader was disrespectful toWales. I had posted: “They are telling the people of Wales: ‘Vote for us, but if you do, you’ll only find out who your first minister will be after we win.’” Former Conservative MP Mark Reckless posted in the chat:“My inclination would be to ignore it.” This has been Reform’s attitude to Wales ever since it put the Senedd in its crosshairs – it offers almost nothing specific to Wales, and having no Welsh leader it therefore avoids the scrutiny that comes with the position.Last year I went to Reform UK’s Wales conference in Newport. Nothing sums up its attitude to a free and independent media like this bizarre experience. First I was denied an interview withNigel Faragebecause I was a Guardian columnist. When I explained that the vast majority of my work was as an independent reporter scrutinising the decisions made by the Welsh Labour government, party officials relented and granted me “two minutes” with the chief. By contrast, they gave 15 minutes to GB News, whose interviewer still only found time to ask one question about Wales.Just before my encounter began, one of Farage’s righthand men came up to me and said: “I have never worked with you before, and it will depend on how this goes whether I ever work with you again.” The message seemed clear to me: if you ask hard questions, you won’t get access. I can see why this threat may have worked in the past. Farage is a huge driver of newspaper sales and online clicks, so denying a journalist access to him is a powerful stick.It’s not hard to extrapolate what it would be like if the party were ever to get its hands on the levers of state. Much like in Trump’s US, access would be predicated on support for the regime. We have already seen this in Reform-run councils such as Nottinghamshire, whichbanned the local paperover a disagreement about a story it ran on local government reorganisation. It meant that none of the paper’s journalists or those covering the council for the BBC-fundedLocal Democracy Reporting Servicewere able to attend council events or interview councillors, as well as being taken off distribution lists for press releases. The ban was only lifted in October, after more than a month, following a legal challenge from the paper. That will be the party’s famous love of free speech in action. In Kent, another council the party controls, it was revealed last month that Reformplanned to drastically cutthe number of committees scrutinising its work.Another lesson the rest of the UK can take about Reform’s actions in Wales is that its members are really bad at turning up for the jobs they claim to want. The party only had one Senedd member, Laura Anne Jones, who defected from the Tories. She waslabelled a “part-timer”after declining a place on a Senedd committee, making her the only MS who isn’t a member of any of the parliament’s 16 committees.One councillor recently elected in the Vale of Glamorgan is namedBrandon Dodd. He won a byelection in September on the basis of being “a real local voice on the Vale council” who would “speak up” for local residents. In the first two council meetings held there since he was elected, the “local voice” failed to speak.He didn’t show up for the thirdone this week, when a key vote affecting a development in his ward was happening.In that WhatsApp group is encapsulated perhaps the most defining trait of Reform – and its precursor, Ukip – in Wales: bitter infighting. Of the seven Ukip candidates elected to the Senedd in 2016, only one of them was still a member by the end of the five-year term because of internal disagreements. One of them, Gareth Bennett, defected and became the first ever Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party MS (though not beforehe claimed £10,000on an office that never opened).We can already see the cracks forming within Reform UK in Wales. The very fact that someone within the inner circle was willing to leak internal messages, just to do over a rival, shows that the tension is there even before the Welsh elections next May. Back in summer, in the space of six weeks,seven of the 15 Reform branch heads were removed. Three of these were women, meaning that there is only one woman in any position of power left within the Welsh party.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Though even that may be too generous a description.On Thursday, word came that the US military had launched yet another deadly strike on a small boat moving through international waters. This timethe attack killed four people, bringing to at least 87 the number of people the US has killed in a series of 22 such strikes on what it says are drug boats – vessels carrying illicit narcotics in the Caribbean or eastern Pacific.This has been happening for months, but the issue has only just drawn political heat thanks toa Washington Post investigationof the first such attack on 2 September.The paper reportedthat US forces hit the targeted boat once, then hit it again – the second strike killing two survivors clinging to the wreckage. According to the Post, the defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, had issued a verbal command to “kill them all”.Now that incident is under congressional scrutiny, with even some Republicans uneasy about what appears to be a clearcut case of a war crime. The defence department’s own Law of War manual forbids precisely this kind of action, spelling it out in black and white onpage 448: “Members of the armed forced and other persons … who are wounded, sick or shipwrecked, shall be respected and protected in all circumstances.” Not that you should need a manual to tell you that. The law of the sea demands that you rescue those at risk of drowning; basic human decency demands that you don’t fire on them.Trump loyalists have denied that Hegseth gave an explicit order that everyone on board be killed and have tried to argue that the two men in the water were legitimate targets because they had proved themselves to be still “in the fight”, perhaps by calling in help from fellow “narco terrorists” nearby. Democrats who have seen the same classified footage of the incident say that, on the contrary, the video shows the killing of men in distress, their vessel destroyed and posing no threat.That would constitute a war crime, but for one thing: there is no war. The Trump administration says that the boats in its sights are ferrying drugs – fentanyl and the like, which kill Americans – from Venezuela to the US and that the traffickers are part of a “designated terrorist organisation”. In effect, it argues that the “war on drugs” is an actual war, in which theUS militaryhas the right to act as it would against any other armed enemy.But the laws of war don’t work like that. As Sarah Yager of Human Rights Watchexplained to the Guardian, a US president “can’t just make up a conflict”. Of course, Donald Trump would dismiss the demand that for a war to be legal it has first to be declared by a congressional vote, but harder to brush off is the fact that the supposed enemy in this case poses nothing that could reasonably be described as a military threat. These are small boats that may or not be carrying drugs, with no serious means of defending themselves. The right way to deal with the danger they represent is the way they were dealt with under previous administrations – as a policing operation involving interception and arrest.All the president’s millions: how the Trumps are turning the presidency into richesRead moreIn other words, the problem here is not just the “double tap” incident that killed those two shipwreck survivors. It is the entire, months-long operation which has killed 87. In Yager’s words: “Nobody on those boats can be killed legally by the United States military.” Viewed like this, we are not contemplating a war crime on 2 September so much as a string of crimes: extrajudicial killings that, simply put, look like murder.There could hardly be a graver charge, yet how has Hegseth himself responded? By posting a mocked-up cover of a children’s book, depicting the much-loved character Franklin the Turtle apparently aiming a rocket launcher at a group of boats, under the imagined title,Franklin Targets Narco Terrorists. AsLogan Roymight put it, this is not a serious person.There is no need to pretend that Hegseth’s actions amount to the sullying of a previously clean reputation; no one is under any illusions as to the long and appalling record of the US in Latin America. Even so, the Trump administration is somehow managing to plumb new depths – and not only in that part of the world.Europeans have long been alarmed at Trump’s lopsided approach to the Ukraine war, evinced most recently by his unveiling of a supposed peace plan that the White House was compelled to deny had originated in Russia, so closely did it resemblea Kremlin wishlist. Thesixth and latest visit to Moscowof Trump’s golfing buddy and personal envoy, Steve Witkoff, this week, and his chumminess with Vladimir Putin, did little to dispel that impression.For a while, this closeness to Russia intrigued observers. Could the explanation really be that Putin helddamaging kompromat on the US president? It seems the answer centres on a lust that is almost as basic: not sex, but money.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionWhat’s driving Team Trump’s push to end the war is not the hope of restoring Ukraine’s sovereignty and independence but rather the desire to cut a deal that would bring US businesses hundreds of billions of dollars. According toa major probe by the Wall Street Journal, what Witkoff andKirill Dmitriev, Putin’s handpicked envoy, have been negotiating in closed-door meetings in Miami and elsewhere is a grand bargain that would “bring Russia’s $2tn economy in from the cold”, while giving the US a slice of the action, whether access to $300bn or so of Russian central bank assetsfrozen in Europeor joint US-Russian ventures to exploit the enormous mineral wealth of the Arctic. Russia would end its isolation, Americans would get even richer and – an added bonus for Moscow – those pesky Europeans would be cut out. In the words of the Polish prime minister Donald Tusk: “We know this is not about peace. It’s about business.”And to be clear, that business motive is not solely about enlarging the coffers of the US Treasury to benefit the hard-pressed US taxpayer. Note how Jared Kushner, who joined Witkoff in Moscow this week, saw his investment fund, Affinity Partners, enjoybillion-dollar cash infusionsfrom the very Gulf monarchies with whom he negotiated as a White House official during his father-in-law’s first term. In Trump world, the boundary between public and private does not exist: what profits the US profits Trump and his circle.A favourite example, if only for its vivid clarity, wasthe meeting this summeron board a superyacht moored off the coast of Sardinia. Present was Witkoff and a member of the ruling family of the United Arab Emirates in charge of $1.5tn of the UAE’s sovereign wealth. The two men had much to celebrate. In May, it had been announced that one of the sheikh’s investment firms would deposit $2bn into World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency outfit founded by the Witkoff and Trump families. Two weeks later, the White House granted the UAE access to specialist AI computer chips that had previously been off-limits, thanks to national security fears that the chips might find their way to China. What a happy coincidence it was that those two unrelated events followed each other so swiftly, and how convivial that encounter in Sardinia must have been.The word corruption can be used in two ways. In its legal sense, it can refer to dishonest conduct by those in power, typically involving bribery. But it can also have a deeper meaning, referring to the corrosion of standards, the decline of norms and the removal of moral restraints. If and whenDonald Trumpand those who serve him, and themselves, are eventually called to account, they will be confronted by that single word, in all its shades – and all its force.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistGuardian newsroom: Year One of Trumpism: Is Britain Emulating the US?On Wednesday 21 January 2026, join Jonathan Freedland, Tania Branigan and Nick Lowles as they reflect on the first year of Donald Trump’s second presidency – and to ask if Britain could be set on the same path.Book ticketshereor atguardian.liveExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionPete HegsethUS militaryDonald TrumpRussiaUkraineUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Finally, this government has found its missionPolly ToynbeeThe new strategy lays out Britain’s social disgrace in painful detail. But it also offers hope and a clear way forward that is worthy of a leftwing partyFri 5 Dec 2025 07.13 ESTLast modified on Fri 5 Dec 2025 12.51 ESTShareOnce Labour set up a child poverty taskforce, it was predestined that the two-child benefit limit would be abolished. Every authority consulted confirmed it as the fastest way to rescue the most children from a life of direst poverty. Every authority, that is, except the general public, who oppose removing the capby 56% to 31%, YouGov finds. This was an unpopular act knowingly taken for good reasons. Not many will read thetaskforce’s findings, but if they did, even the meanest mind might soften: the dismal facts of a child’s life in poverty are, as ever, shocking.All the many measures in this far-reaching policy willlift 550,000 childrenabove the poverty line by 2030 – the most achieved within one parliament. But that leaves behind about4 million poor childrenliving without the basics. That still makes us among themost unequal andmost poverty-strickenof similar European countries. This is a major factor in why British five-year-olds have now becomeup to 7cms shorterthan children of the same age in Europe.Streams of reports emerge from thinktanks and charities describing the plight of desperate people. It’s a story so familiar that it’s easy to be numbed into accepting thata third of the children around usare poor, often without adequate food or heating, many without a home, with no internet connection for homework and no joining in what classmates take for granted: “my holiday”. Labour governments don’t hide these brutish facts of British life. The government’s new strategy lays bare our social disgrace in painful detail, promising annual updates on all the causes, effects and remedies. In 1999, Tony Blair stunned experts with his promise toeliminate child povertywithin 20 years: by the halfway mark in 2010 good progress had been made, but the countrywas not quite there. There’s never time to get enough done, before the right takes over to reverse and vandalise everything. Think of the 3,500 Sure Starts mostly closed or left without the people and services to provide families with the support that changed lives.One of the lucky survivors, a model to remember, is the Jubilee children’s centre in Brixton, south London: beautiful, spacious and purpose-built with every kind of children’s activity and support for adults. On Thursday, parents were in a sewing-machine class, while outsidea food bus projectwas selling fruit and veg at low cost as it travelled round local estates. Two of the ministers, Liz Kendall and Alison McGovern, who together with Bridget Phillipson were lead authors of the strategy chose this location to share their findings, promoting a long list of initiatives across departments from health to housing and transport: getting children out of squalid temporary accommodation that is several bus journeys away from their school is a key promise. Strings of policies designed to root out disadvantage count the ways poor children “do less well in school, are more likely to be unemployed when older and earn less throughout their lifetimes”. Billed as a decade-long strategy, this “is just the first step on our journey to drive down child poverty”, it says. Will Labour get the time?For the contrast between right and left governments, just look at child poverty graphs to know who was in power when. George Osborne’s savage benefit cuts, mostly targeted at families, came with toxic messages pitting the strivers against the skivers, the familysleeping behind the blindsin the morning while next door leave for work. His poison was taken up by programmes such asBenefits Street, which selected choice feckless cases to pillory as examples of everyone on social security. The message accompanying the new strategy is emphatic: almost three-quarters of children in poverty now come from working families. Jobs don’t guarantee escape from poverty – a word the Tories never used, preferring the description “low-income”. On it goes, with Kemi Badenoch labelling this “a budget for Benefits Street” 10 years after the programme ended, stirring up moral panic without admitting that total benefit costs arenotspiralling: non-pensioner benefits have stayed at4-5% of GDP for the past 40 years.Are we by nature nastier? Belief that the criteria needed to qualify for benefits aren’t strict enough has grown in the past few years,says Patrick English of YouGov. Gideon Skinner of Ipsos tells me that younger people in Britain are the most generous, with 18- to 24-year-olds most in favour of abolishing the two-child cap and older people most strongly against. Asked what spending should be cut,voters put welfare top.Never underestimate the life-long foghorn influence of the rightwing media both on- and offline. Here are the Sun’s responses to the budget: “Jobless mums hail Reeves’ ‘Benefits Street’ budget as ‘dream come true’ and vow to cash-in by having more kids”; “Families will foot handout bill for skivers”; “Labour is layabouts party”. Arguing against that is an uphill task. The Blair government ducked persuasion, doing good by stealth instead, rebadging benefits as “working tax credits” to sound better. Successful back-to-work programmes for young people emphasised stick not carrot in public, though kindly, well-attuned help was what worked, not threats.“You have to make the case about poverty time and again, for every generation,” Kendall says, recalling what it took for Harriet Harman to steer the Blair-Brown government towards nurseries. She quotes the theme of the strategy’s foreword: beyond pity for lives wasted, it warns of “the cost of inaction that our economy – and future generations – cannot afford … in poorer health, worse educational attainment, lower skills and lower earnings”.It was a sadness to see one of the remaining Sure Start centres; a reminder of what might have been everywhere by now. This government is rolling out newBest Start hubs, aiming forone in every council area in Englandby 2028. Pressing on means making children every department’s priority. It helps that Phillipson and Wes Streeting themselves come from poor backgrounds, in the most working-class cabinet ever, which is likely to prevent this child poverty strategy from becoming a one-day policy. A government lacking a coherent theme would do well to make children the focus and the purpose of everything from now on.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’ve been thinking about that for days, since reading the Local Government Association’s recent report on a growing crisis in early childhood. We’ve known for a while about children starting schoolstill in nappies, orspeaking in Americanismsabsorbed from hours stuck in front of YouTube, or even struggling to sit uprightbecause they’ve spent too long slumped over an iPad to develop core muscles. So sadly, it’s not surprising to read of early-years workerstelling the LGAthey see more and more pre-schoolers who can barely speak, play with others or contain their rage when things don’t go their way. But it was the practitioner who noted that some children“don’t seem to respond to their name” who got to me. You have to wonder how often that child hears a loving adult trying to get their attention. Too often, another practitioner said, “children are not spoken to at home, but offered screens all day” – at mealtimes, out shopping, or in the car – with parents seemingly scared of provoking tantrums if they take the phone away.The report describes a complex puzzle with multiple causes: poverty, and the parental exhaustion that comes of a hardscrabble life; growing up in a pandemic; changes in early-years provision; and way too much screen time. It can’t be solved by money alone, but certainly won’t be solved without it. So a two-pronged strategy of lifting the two-child limit on children’s welfare payments – as Rachel Reeves did last week – and intervening early wheretoddlers aren’t meeting their milestones makes sense. The Best Start family hubs rolling out gradually nationwide will, we learned this week, getSend (special educational needs and disabilities) co-ordinators, focusing particularly on speech and language. They’ll promote the upcomingNational Year of Readingto wean kids off screens and on to books,and more generally attempt, on a shoestring, to mimic the support that their predecessor programme Sure Start once offered parents. There’s not enough funding – there never is – but there are the beginnings of joined-up thinking, accepting that tackling problems in nursery rather than in primary school is easier, cheaper and kinder on everyone involved.Let’s not tempt fate, given this government’s unparalleled ability to take one step forward and three back. But for the record: taxing the better-off in the budget to invest in tackling child poverty, telling some home truths about the economic damage done by Brexit (as Keir Starmer alsodid this week), and striking azero-tariff dealon pharmaceuticals with Donald Trump to save a lot of jobsisn’t a terrible week at the office. More surprisingly, for the first time in ages Labour is talking about things its supporters actually like. Jobs! Europe! Children not going hungry! Evidently there has been a disturbance in the force.Westminster rumour has it that the Morgan McSweeney tendency inside government – focused on wining voters back from Reform – is currently being out-argued by those more worried about losing them to the Liberal Democrats and the Greens. Who knows whether this will last, or what this will do to their electoral fortunes, so for once let’s stay focused on those at the sharp end.Thebiggest budget winnersin terms of net income, the Resolution Foundation thinktank notes, were the poorest 10%; the biggest losers were the richest 10%. Strip away all the fuss about who leaked what to whom, and there’s the gist: Reeves raised money mostly from the better off and spent it mostly on poorer families. She got there inelegantly but she got there, and now there will be children waking up tomorrow who won’t suffer the lifelong harms of early deprivation. At the time of writing, the government’s imminent child poverty strategyis still under wraps, but children’s charities were unanimous that it would be pointless without scrapping the two-child limit. That’s done. What remains is to tell a compelling human story about how children’s lives will change as a result of all that public money, to make people feel it’s worth it.Of course Nigel Farage will say Labour is whacking up taxes for no good reason. But he backed the lifting of the cap this summer, and Reform has problems of its own. For all its meteoric rise in the polls, it has struggled tobreak the 30% ceiling– a nice problem to have, admittedly, when you’re still miles ahead of the two supposedly big parties, but 30% isn’t enough to win an election. Hence renewed speculation that Reform will merge with the Tories, which would indeed make sense electorally – if only so many of those involved didn’t hate each other.Meanwhile both Labour and Tory strategists have noticed that Reform’s vote share seeminglyfalls a bitwhen the economy is uppermost in people’s thoughts, and rises when immigration is. When the battle is over tax and how to spend it, or where new jobs are coming from, Reform isn’t clear what it wants to say and so loses ground to the Tories. The striking thing about watching Kemi Badenoch pummel Rachel Reeves in parliament last week was how it left Farage oddly out in the cold.Let’s not get carried away here. The chancellor’s path remains strewn with landmines – including a revolt brewing among ruralLabourMPsover the increasingly toxic farm inheritance tax – and this administration’s capacity for self-destruction is prodigious. But when a Labour government actually delivers some of what its supporters were screaming for, it’s churlish not to acknowledge it.

While her brave act brought national attention to the civil rights movement and triggered student sit-ins to end segregation across the south, it also subjected her and her husband, Raymond, to constant death threats. Consequently, like many other Black families fleeing Jim Crow south’s racial violence, in August 1957, Rosa and Raymond moved up north toDetroit.When the Parks arrived in Detroit, they and other Black people did not have to sit at the back of the bus. Nonetheless, the city was permeated by a quieter but no less pernicious type of racism: racist policies, which are any written or unwritten laws and processes that produce or sustain racial inequity. In my book Plundered: How Racist Policies Undermine Black Homeownership in America, I demonstrate how racial covenants, redlining, urban renewal, blockbusting, predatory mortgage lending and racialized property tax administration have stymied the Black community.What Rosa Parks can teach us about resistance today | Jan-Werner MuellerRead moreWith access to the nation’s most lucrative blue-collar jobs, Black people in Detroit were thriving. By 1950, the median Black household income in Detroit had reached $2,298, whereas the national median for Black households was $952. Most Black families could not, however, translate this triumph into better housing because of racist policies.For instance, racial covenants – private legal agreements that prevented Black people from residing in certain neighborhoods – kept them confined to ghettos. These covenants also prevented Black people from moving to the suburbs where the schools and other amenities were superior and the homes were cheaper, bigger and higher quality.Beginning in the 1930s, the FederalHousingAdministration drew a red line around the neighborhoods where racial covenants corralled Black people, depriving these areas of mortgages, home repair loans and other valuable investment. Redlining turned Black people into pariahs, their very presence diminishing housing prices.In a practice known as blockbusting, real estate agents advised white homeowners that the arrival of Black residents would cause their home values to plummet, inducing panic sales throughout the neighborhood. After purchasing the homes at fire sale prices, the agent would then resell them to Black families at much higher prices, reaping morally dubious profits.Urban renewal programs, prevalent in the 1950s and 1960s, demolished entire communities in an attempt to erase the blight and disorder manufactured by redlining. But alongside the dilapidated buildings, these programs also demolished lucrative Black businesses, intact properties, cultural institutions and most importantly, the social ties that held the communities together. Because displaced Black families could only relocate to a limited number of Black neighborhoods, these spaces became crowded with strangers suffering from “root shock”, a term Dr Mindy Fullilove created to describe “the traumatic stress reaction to the destruction of all or part of one’s emotional eco-system”. Unsurprisingly, crime and disorder thrived in these newly reconfigured communities.Rosa and Raymond Parks were able to rent a home in Detroit at 3201 Virginia Park Street, where they resided from 1961 to 1988. But because of racist policies, today, the home is vacant and worth less than $50,000. It is surrounded by vacant lots and other homes in equally bad shape.Even worse, the City of Detroit is overvaluing the former Parks home along with many others. How did this happen? Due in large part to predatory lending by banks, which spurred the Great Recession and the mortgage foreclosure crisis in 2008, housing prices in Detroit and other majority Black cities dropped precipitously and did not quickly recover. In the midst of the largest municipal bankruptcy in US history, the City of Detroit did not have the capacity to reduce the value of its homes, leading to systematic overvaluation.The City of Detroit proceeded toovertax up to 84% of its homesin violation of the Michigan constitution, which states that no home can be assessed at more than 50% of its market value. As a result, aDetroit News exposé found, the City of Detroit overtaxed Detroit homeowners by at least $600m. The Parkses’ former home on Virginia Park Street was overtaxed by $2,058.More importantly, Detroit is not alone. Recentresearchhas found that, on average, Black and Hispanic people pay a 10% to 13% higher property tax rate than white people for the same bundle of goods, which equals about $300 to $400 more a year.On this 70th anniversary of the Montgomery bus boycott, we should indeed memorialize the heroic work of civil rights leaders like Parks, but we should also expand our notions of racism beyond the cross burnings and segregated lunch counters and buses they faced in the Jim Crow south. We need to focus on the racist policies, hiding in plain sight, that continue to ravage the Black community today.Bernadette Atuahene is the Duggan professor at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law, the executive director of the Institute for Law and Organizing, and the author of Plundered: How Racist Policies Undermine Black Homeownership in AmericaExplore more on these topicsCivil rights movementOpinionRaceDetroitHousingcommentShareReuse this content"

But ministers have shown that they are serious and capable of listeningFri 5 Dec 2025 12.43 ESTLast modified on Fri 5 Dec 2025 14.53 ESTShareIf the government’s long-awaited child poverty strategy, launched on Friday, was a bit of a damp squib, that is because the best bit had been absorbed by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, inlast month’s budget. The decision to remove the two-child limit, which prevented parents from claiming child-linked benefits for third or subsequent children, is expectedto lift 550,000 children out of povertyby the end of this parliament. It is the best welfare decision taken by Labour since they were elected. Ms Reeves was correct to press the point that “potential suffocated by limited life chances” is a blight on society as well as on those who experience it directly.No wonder that Labour ministers and MPs have sounded confident when talking about it. The Conservative decision to make larger families poorer was unjustifiable and damaging. Stories of childrenlacking the basics of sufficient foodand secure housing have become shamefully common. With a record 4.5 million children in the UK in poverty, and 2 million in “deep material poverty” – in households that cannot afford the essentials of life – action was overdue. TheScottish governmenthas already introduced new child payments, putting incomes there on a different trajectory.Theextension of free school mealsin England is expected to lift about 100,000 more children out of poverty. But while none of the measures in the new strategy match this, or the removal of the two-child limit, for impact, the document still matters. First, because it is the clearest statement so far of Labour’s intent.Child poverty has fallenunder every Labour prime minister since Harold Wilson in 1974. Under Conservative governments it has consistently risen. While the 2025 strategy lacks the ambition of Tony Blair’s pledge to eliminate child poverty entirely, it at least establishes that the current government’s commitment to poverty reduction is real.Second, somesignificant measureswill improve lives, even if they will not shift the headline figures. That 2,000 families with children are stuck in B&B accommodation is a stain on the nation. The £8m funding behind a pilot scheme to help councils rehouse them within six weeks is modest. But it is good to see the government commit to help local authorities tackle this issue. The shortage of social and affordable housing, and the problems this causes for families forced to rent privately, are one of the worst social injustices in this country. By doing something about it, ministers have shown that they are capable of listening. The same is true of changes making it easier for benefit claimants to pay for childcare.Deep unfairness remains baked in to the benefits system. The overall cap that limits how much households can claim, and thefrozen local housing allowancethat lags behind rents, painfully restrict the incomes of millions of people. Now that the two-child limit is gone, attention can shift to these other areas. Polling shows thatattitudes to benefitsare complicated and changeable. Most people remain committed to a robust safety net. But public debate is warped by myths, such as the one that costs are spiralling or people are increasingly reluctant to work – when the truth is that spending on working-age benefits is stable, and nearly three-quarters of children in poverty have a parent in work.Ministers must be bolder in challenging such narratives. Labourshould be proudthat the UK government once again has a child poverty strategy. Now it must build on it.Explore more on these topicsPovertyOpinionChildrenSocial exclusionRachel ReeveseditorialsShareReuse this content"

But these are the latest takes on Dickens’s much-adapted classic:Christmas KarmafromGurinder Chadha, the Bend It Like Beckham director, brings us Mr Sood, a Ugandan Asian refugee (played by Kunal Nayyar), who came to Britain in 1972;Ebony Scroogetransforms the old miser into a Dominican fashion diva at the recently opened Sadler’s Wells East, London.We may think of Scrooge McDuck and theMuppets, but there was deep moral seriousness behind A Christmas Carol. Dickens had intended to write a political pamphlet entitled An Appeal on Behalf of the Poor Man’s Child, but instead decided to bury “the ghost of an idea” in a festive story.A Christmas Carolwas written in six weeks and published on 19 December 1843, when Dickens was just 31. By Christmas Eve it had sold all 6,000 copies. By February 1844 there had been eight stage adaptations.Now this 182-year-old novel is being retold as 21st-century migrant stories. It is not hard to see why: Scrooge’sMalthusian fears about “surplus population”and the Victorian belief that the poor should be punished are echoed in today’s anti-immigration rhetoric.This Christmas has also brought the latest incarnation of the UK’s favourite furry asylum seeker – Paddington. Thenew musicalknowingly updates Michael Bond’s 1958 original, inspired by child evacuees during the second world war. Here is multicultural London – albeit a wholesome Mary Poppins version with a carnival vibe, rather than the harsh reality experienced by most immigrants. A Peruvian bear who loves a cuppa, Paddington is unfailingly polite and eager to fit in. Embodying liberal and traditional values, he appeals to both sides of the culture wars. Only Paddington could have been invited totea with the late Queen to celebrate the Platinum jubilee.It is tempting to be cynical about such reboots, messing around with national treasures and promoting a tourist vision of London. Do we need a breakdancing Bob Cratchit or a performing Paddington? Chadha has defended her right to take on a classic in Christmas Karma. “We all did Dickens at school. We must find ways to own art and tell stories from our unique perspective,” she toldRadio 4. Updating these stories keeps them alive.The spirit of Dickens endures, and not just in adaptations. Former children’s laureate Michael Rosen and illustratorHelen Oxenbury(the duo behindWe’re Going on a Bear Hunt) have created a Christmas short story,Pax, about a modern family struggling to make ends meet. It is to be published in the Big Issue.With recordlevels of child povertyin the UK, rising homelessness, extreme inequality and hostility towards immigrants, Christmas isn’t looking cheery for many. Theirs are the stories we need to hear. As the Ghost of Christmas Present is fading in Dickens’s novel, Scrooge spies two wretched children huddled in the spirit’s robe – a boy and a girl, Ignorance and Want. If society doesn’t look after its children (from darkest Peru or anywhere else) we cannot expect a better future.In our secular, consumerist times, A Christmas Carol and Paddington deliver messages of tolerance and compassion, as well as the possibility of redemption and change, delightfully wrapped up in heartwarming stories. No wonder we keep coming back for more.Explore more on these topicsCharles DickensOpinionTheatreMusicalsMichael BondMichael RoseneditorialsShareReuse this content"

I believe the mixed messages being delivered will be deadly for some, as they were for my husband. He delayed having a PSA blood test because he believed it was unreliable and could lead to damaging treatments. He found out too late that he had prostate cancer and that it had spread through his body. He died less than three years after diagnosis aged 68. How did the “harms outweigh the benefits”?Your articles include a wealth of opinion and advice, much of it conflicting. Dr Jayne Spink of Prostate Cancer Research says: “Many men don’t come forward because prostate cancer often has no symptoms in the early stages, and some don’t realise they are at higher risk. This means that we are diagnosing far too many men when their cancer is already advanced and becomes incurable” (What is prostate cancer and should I be worried if I wee a lot at night? 28 November). She is a clear proponent of aiming for early diagnosis. Yet Cancer Research UK “supports” the conclusion that there isn’t enough evidence that screening would do more good than harm, and the chair of the Royal College of GPs is still keen on discussing with patients the “risks and benefits of conducting a PSA [prostate specific antigen] test”. My widow inner-voice asks: what risks and harm outweigh dying unnecessarily?I thought this publicity about prostate cancer would be a good thing and encourage men to get tested, but I’m afraid it will actually be the opposite. Confusion and mixed messages will cause more heartbreaking losses like mine.Pat SharpeWandsworth, LondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Without secure supplies and adequate subsurface storage, the UK has come close to running out of gas, most notably in March 2013, when we were within hours of doing so.Given that 85% of the roughly 30m homes in the UK currently rely on gas for heating and cooking, pivoting away from the energy source is not going to happen soon. Furthermore, gas provides more than half of our electricity base load on cold, windless and dark days, meaning it’s critical that we have supplies for national security.As the article pointed out, the Ormen Lange gas field and Langeled pipeline are critical points of failure. The alternatives are either to ensure we continue responsible production from domestic fields in UK waters, or to ramp up and pay for high-carbon intensity liquid natural gas imports from sources like Qatar and the US, which are far worse for the global climate and lead to the risk of price spikes that ultimately increase bills.Securing the domestic sources requires the government to encourage and incentivise the sector to find and produce the gas we need as we manage the transition away from fossil fuels. The recent relaxation of policy through the introduction of transitional energy certificates is encouraging, but an obvious additional step is to remove the windfall tax. Unless that is done, I fear investment in domestic gas production will not be forthcoming, leaving the country vulnerable to gas shortages that Neso has highlighted.Prof John UnderhillUniversity director for energy transition, The Interdisciplinary Institute, Aberdeen UniversityHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Plus letters fromMartin ArglesandJohn CaperonFri 5 Dec 2025 12.30 ESTLast modified on Fri 5 Dec 2025 12.55 ESTShareMy answer to the pertinent question put by Helen James in her letter (Was JMW Turner’s mother really ‘mentally ill’?, 27 November) is that whatever illness Mary may have had would have been greatly increased by the frustration that she must have felt with her circumstances in the mean lodging in Covent Garden, which her husband lacked the ambition to better. These contrasted with the comfortable Islington home in which she grew up and with the even more prosperous circumstances of her relations. I have discussed those in the Genealogists’ Magazine, the British Art Journal and now inmy publicationforTurner 250: Happy Birthdays! JMW Turner and Prince George on Richmond Hill. Since I wrote the last, aplaque was erectedon the site of the house of the uncle of Turner in Brentford, where he was sent to escape the bedlam at home and where, like Beethoven at a similar age at Bonn, he acquired lifelong cultured friends.Dr Selby WhittinghamSecretary, the Independent Turner SocietyRegarding artistic rivalries, including that between JMW Turner and John Constable (28 November), in 1969 I met Francis Bacon at a health hydro in Surrey. He claimed to have been sent by his agent to dry out. His unaffected friendliness overcame my awe at encountering the great painter. In my first Mini, I drove him to seethe Turners at Petworth House, where there happened to be a William Blake exhibition as well. He was dismissive of Blake as an artist, preferring the poetry. But the surprise was his little concern for the Petworth Turners, which he hadn’t seen before. I prefer Constable, he said. The following day he felt obliged to go to Guildford (by himself) for a glass of burgundy.Paul CollinsHorton cum Studley, OxfordshireIt’s refreshing to read that Constable’s work is worth more than chocolate box decoration.

An earlier attempt to release these same transcripts was denied by a different judge earlier this year.House Democrats release new images of Epstein’s private Caribbean islandRead moreThe justice department has sought the unsealing of materials from three separate Epstein-related investigations. With the Florida request now approved, attention turns to the pending New York cases, where the justice department faces a Monday deadline to file responses to submissions from victims, Epstein’s estate and Maxwell’s legal team.The decision marks the first successful unsealing of Epstein-related grand jury records under the new law. Two additional requests remain pending in New York courts for grand jury transcripts from Epstein’s 2019 sex-trafficking case and Maxwell’s 2021 sex-trafficking prosecution.The Epstein Files Transparency Act, led by representatives Ro Khanna and Thomas Massie that passed through Congress in November, requires the justice department to release all unclassified records and investigative materials related to Epstein within 30 days of enactment, setting a 19 December deadline.The House passed the measure 427-1, with only Congressman Clay Higgins of Louisiana voting against it. The Senate then approved it by unanimous consent.Trump had at first strongly opposed the measure, mocking the fervor around the calls for the release of the files, but reversed course in mid-November when Khanna and Massie had the power to force a vote after collecting enough signatures in their petition, which would have forced individual Republicans to go on the record on protecting a convicted child sex offender. He then urged House Republicans to support it.The act compels disclosure of justice department files on Epstein and Maxwell, including documents on other individuals, immunity deals and internal communications about charging decisions. However, it also permits the justice department to withhold materials that could jeopardize active federal investigations or contain victims’ personally identifiable information.The law explicitly bars withholding records solely to prevent embarrassment or reputational harm to public figures, government officials or foreign dignitaries.Officials concluded that Epstein, a financier with connections to some of the world’s most wealthy and powerful figures – including being a one-time close friend to Trump – killed himself in his New York jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges. The charges alleged he sexually exploited minors, some as young as 14, paying them for sexual acts at his properties in New York and Florida.Maxwell, Epstein’s longtime associate, is serving a 20-year prison sentence for facilitating his abuse of underage girls.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

M23 is now in control there.Detonations that shook buildings echoed throughout the morning near Kamanyola, an AFP journalist reported in Bugarama, a border post on the Rwandan side about 2km (1.3 miles) away.On Friday, the M23 accused the Burundian army of firing “without interruption” into the DRC.A Burundian military source told AFP they were reinforcing their positions to ensure they were not overrun by M23 fighters and their Rwandan backers.“The fighting is intensifying,” the source added, speaking on condition of anonymity. “There is a real risk the situation escalates. We are bringing reinforcements to the front because this is a red line for Burundi.”The source said his country could not accept it if “the terrorists of M23 and their Rwandan backers reach Uvira”, a city in DRC less than 30km from Bujumbura, Burundi’s biggest city.Lines of civilians fleeing the fighting crossed the border in the early hours watched by Rwandan police.“The bombs were exploding above the houses,” said one witness, Immaculee Antoinette, from Ruhumba, near Kamanyola. “We were asked to remain locked inside our houses, but that seemed impossible.”Hassan Shabani, an administrative official in Kamanyola, said schools, hospitals and civilian homes were all shelled.On the Rwandan side, some residents were “scouring the hills from where the shots are coming, in small groups”, said a local woman, Farizi Bizimana. “The children and women are very scared and take refuge in houses when the gunfire becomes intense,” she added.In January, M23 backed by Kigali and its army went on the offensive,capturing the major regional cities of Gomain North Kivu province andBukavu in South Kivu.On Thursday in Washington, DR Congo’s president, Félix Tshisekedi, and Rwanda’s president, Paul Kagame, signed an agreement that their host, the US president, Donald Trump, called a “miracle”.Explore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoRwandaBurundiAfricaUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Broadcasters voted only to introduce new rules designed to stop governments and third parties from disproportionately promoting songs to influence voters.“A large majority of members agreed that there was no need for a further vote on participation and that the Eurovision song contest 2026 should proceed as planned, with the additional safeguards in place,” the EBU said in a statement.This “large majority” amounted to 65% of delegates voting in favour of the changes to the song contest and no further discussion on participation of Israel, while 23% voted against and 10% abstained.Some countries had raised concerns over undue promotion methods after Israel topped the public vote at the contest in May, finishing second overall when the jury votes were taken into consideration. InIreland, the broadcaster RTÉ has called for an audit of the public vote.RTÉ said on Thursday it would be “unconscionable” to participate in the 2026 contest if Israel also took part “given the appalling loss of lives and the humanitarian crisis” in Gaza.The Slovenian broadcaster RTV SLO said it would be boycotting the contest “on behalf of the 20,000 children who died in Gaza”.View image in fullscreenVoting result on voting reform to Eurovision song contest at EBU general assembly 4 December 2025.Photograph: Lisa O’CarrollOf the boycotting countries, the Netherlands participated in the song contest’s inaugural edition in 1956. Ireland shares with Sweden the record for most Eurovision wins, with seven.Ireland’s prime minister, Micheál Martin, said on Friday he “fully understands” his country’s withdrawal from the song contest, describing it as an “act of solidarity”.So far, no further countries have joined in the boycott. Sweden’s national broadcaster SVT confirmed on Friday it would take part in the 2026 contest, after speculation that it might pull out over Israel’s confirmed participation.“The new rules mean, among other things, that governments refrain from campaigns, fewer votes per participant and that professional jury panels are once again introduced in the semi-finals”, SVT said.“Technical security is also being strengthened to avoid vote fraud. This – combined with the result of the vote – is in line with the conditions that SVT has set for participating in Eurovision: a broad European support and a competition that is as apolitical as possible.”Nordic countries including Finland, Norway, Denmark and Iceland expressed support for the EBU’s public voting changes on Thursday.The Icelandic broadcaster RUV, which had previously reserved the right not to participate, said it would consider its position at a board meeting on Wednesday.The BBC has until spring to decide if it will participate as it is holding a selection process through the music industry rather than a public runoff.Explore more on these topicsEurovisionAustriaIsraelSpainIrelandSloveniaNetherlandsnewsShareReuse this content"

Using OS Open Names data from 2004 to 2024, the conservation charity found that road names featuring bird species had risen by 350% for skylarks, 156% for starlings and 104% for lapwings, despite populations of these having fallen in the wild.Between 1970 and 2022 the UK lost 53% of its breeding skylarks, 62% of lapwings and 89% of nightingales. The RSPB’s chief executive, Beccy Speight, said the analysis “shows councils and developers are happy to name streets after the nature we love while efforts to prevent these birds disappearing from our skies remain woefully inadequate”.The2023 State of Nature reportcalled the UK “one of the most nature-depleted countries on Earth”, and wild bird numbers haveplummeted since the 1970s.The RSPB study also found that “meadow” in street names had risen by 34%, though wildflower meadows are down 97% since the 1930s.The RSPB called for the government to do more to support nature, with the planning and infrastructure bill for England entering its final stages. In October it reneged on backing an amendment to the bill calling forswift bricksto be installed in every new home. Swift road names have grown by 58%.The RSPB argued it was “possible and essential” to have a planning system that restores nature, and cited recent research by More in Common that found only 20% of Britons think environmental standards should be weakened to build more houses.Michael Warren, the author ofThe Cuckoo’s Lea, about the history of birds in British placenames, said: “We love a nature name and developers know it. But the trend for birds in new-build placenames masks the severe detachment many of us suffer from nature, while making it seem like everything is OK.”Warren said placenames once reflected ecological reality, but while “at best” pretty, the modern equivalent was a “deceiving, cheap and easy way to give the impression of addressing nature deprivation without actually doing that”.Speight said: “We deserve to enjoy the sounds of a nightingale in full song or swifts screaming overhead, rather than living in silent streets with ironic names.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The idea was to create huge reserves for rare species to thrive – projects promoted as decades-long commitments to securing habitat for wildlife well into the future.Conservationists have warnedthese changes, as well as underfunding, will lead to low take-up and less land protected for nature. They say allowing contracts to be ripped up after a year is unworkable, as it would leave landowners with rewilded land they can no longer farm and too little time to reconvert it.Landscape recovery is the most ambitious part of the environmental land management schemes (Elms), which were introduced by the previous Conservative government to replace EU farming subsidies.Initially, the schemes were to be split into three strands, with landscape recovery receiving a third of the £2.4bn a year funding pot. But this week, the environment secretary, Emma Reynolds, announced the projects would be given only £500m over 20 years.Jake Fiennes is the director of conservation at the Holkham estate,one of the government’s firstpilot schemes for landscape recovery in 2022. He has been creating more than 2,000 hectares (4,940 acres) of wildlife-rich habitat along the north Norfolk coast, including restoring wetland that has already attracted thriving bird life such as thereturn of rare spoonbills.View image in fullscreenOn-farm habitat must be ‘high-quality, the right mix and in the right places’ to support wildlife, says one expert.Photograph: Arterra/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesFiennes said: “£500m over 20 years is sod all. It was supposed to be a third of the [farming] budget – we could have worked with that. If you’re the person in the street, £500m sounds like the most enormous amount of money. But if you understand the environment and food budget is £2.4bn annually, this is a fifth of that over 20 years. A tiny fraction of it for the most ambitious nature schemes.”Spread across the landscape recovery schemes, it will amount to only a few million pounds a year. But what is being asked of the landowners is incredibly expensive and ambitious, Fiennes says.“Some of the pilots are asking so much more than that as they understand the value of land, and if you put it into permanent land use change, you permanently remove its value. Then it’s implementing your scheme, like re-meandering a river and completely redesigning a landscape. That costs money,” he added.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has claimed the funding shortfall could be topped up with private investment. However, farmers say this is unlikely while schemes remain vulnerable to being scrapped with only a year’s notice.View image in fullscreenTom Bradshaw, the president of the National Farmers’ Union of England and Wales, says attracting private investment has been challenging.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianThe president of the National Farmers’ Union, Tom Bradshaw, said: “Defra’s plans for landscape recovery projects under the [environmental improvement plan] involve combining government funding with private investment. However, experience shows that attracting private investment has been challenging, raising concerns about how farmers can confidently engage their businesses in the projects.”Toby Perkins, the chair of the environmental audit committee, said: “Do the government’s commitments match its ambition? The £500m for landscape recovery is much needed but, at £25m a year, I am very sceptical that it offers anything like adequate funding.”The government’s environmental improvement plan, announced this week, has watered down the overall ambition for nature on farmland.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

That is a huge step backwards.“The science is unequivocal: on-farm habitat must be high-quality, the right mix and in the right places to support thriving wildlife populations. Government is simply wrong to suggest that getting 41% of farms to manage 7% of land under almost any [sustainable farming incentive (SFI)] option will be enough. It won’t. And it risks locking in further decline.“The falling numbers of species like corn buntings and turtle doves tell us something deeper that pollinators, beneficial insects, soils and climate-resilient landscapes are under stress.”Farmers and other landowners who signed up to the scheme found that their contracts allowed the government to terminate them for convenience – with no fault attached – with just 12 months’ notice.Fiennes said he would not sign up to the new schemes yet and hoped to renegotiate with the government.He added: “Some of the legal advice says don’t sign because the government can end the scheme in 12 months. If you’ve done potentially irreversible land use change, you are up a creek without a paddle. Pension funds, banks – if they know there is a commitment from government for a set period, they will top this up, but at the moment it can be struck off in a year.”The nature-friendly farming schemes have been beset by difficultiesand delays. Under the Labour government,funding was cut by £100mand the SFI wasabruptly frozen, locking farmers out. Ministers say they plan to reopen the SFI in the new year.A Defra spokesperson said: “The £500m for landscape recovery projects is a downpayment which will go a long way to protecting and restoring nature across England.”Explore more on these topicsConservationGreen politicsRewildingFarmingWildlifeEnglandGreen economynewsShareReuse this content"

To do it, they place a piece of metal on the soil, hit it with a hammer and measure the waves. These bounce back off hard surfaces such as rocks or compacted soil and travel through the structure of holes made by earthworms and microorganisms, to provide a fine-grained map of what is happening underground.The waves can also be affected by the dryness of the soil so can detect when more water is needed and the extent of microbial life so farmers know when to add more organic matter.Over a pint in Oxford, we may have stumbled upon the holy grail of agricultureRead moreThe non-profit company, cofounded by the Guardian columnist George Monbiot, aims to create a free app for farmers to measure the health of their soil and to be given advice on how to improve it.The soil ecologist Prof Simon Jeffery, another co-founder, said: “Soil is one of our most precious resources. 99% of the calories we consume come from the soil, from plants we eat or from animals who eat the plants which grow in the soil. It’s very underappreciated as many people don’t know how important it is, but without soil we would not be here.”Poor agricultural practice of tilling soil and addingpesticides, as well as erosion and extreme weather caused by climate breakdown, have damaged the soil we need across the world to grow food. Global crop yields are forecast to reduce in some regions by 50% as the population increases.It is difficult for farmers to address soil problems due to a lack of fine-tuned mapping. Crop yields can vary from metre to metre within the same field, owing mostly to soil properties that are undetectable from the surface, meaning farmers rely on broad interventions such as fertilising and tilling the whole field, which harms wildlife and soil health, pollutes rivers and is expensive.Peter Mosongo, a soil scientist based in Kenya, said this could be life-changing for farmers in the region. “We were in a village near Mount Kenya and a farmer there told us he has never done any soil sampling on the farm. They’re aware they need to do that testing but the labs which are able to do it are far apart and the poorest farmers do not have the ability to get there. Our technology can find areas of subsoil compaction which can, in turn, reduce flood risk and increase crop yields.“If we are going to address soil fertility we can address the food crisis. We can tell farmers the problems with their soil and then they can increase their yield by taking interventions like adding more organic matter.”Using the seismic wave technology means Mosongo and Jeffery will not have to dig as many holes in their day-to-day lives. “Peter and I have dug far too many holes in our time,” said Jeffery.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The UK, being a small and well-studied island, has the best soil map in the world, but even that is a 5km x 5km grid of accuracy, which is not finely tuned enough to know all the different soil types and the fertility and compaction differences across a field.Jeffery said: “Where I am at Harper Adams [an agricultural university in Shropshire], the soil map says there are only three types of soil and no peat, but actually we have found 18 types and quite a lot of peat with this technique.”The situation was worse in countries in Africa, Mosongo said, where the soil map “relies on a few samples”, which means farmers have been unable to address fertility problems.He said: “We have problems when the rainy seasons come – the water cannot penetrate the lower layer so we get a lot of flooding. The plants also do not survive as the roots cannot penetrate.”It was important to protect soils from erosion and degradation, Monsongo said. “In the UK it can take about 500 years for 1cm of soil to develop. That can be washed away in an afternoon. It ends up in rivers as sediment and is washed towards the ocean – we can’t get it back. If we run out of soil, we run out of food.”The method can also be used to measure the amount of carbon in the soil, as currently much of that calculation is guesswork.Most importantly, they hope their technology can help farmers to continue to feed the world. Mosongo said: “We have increasing population growth and we are not increasing agricultural productivity, it is going down. If we do not do anything, we are looking at starvation.”Aidan Keith, a soil ecologist at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, who is not involved in the project, said: “Soil is a relatively complicated medium when it comes to listening and tuning in to wave signals. The development of advanced yet affordable sensor technology, and robust data analysis, to predict a variety of key soil physical properties using seismic waves could be transformative.“It has great potential as a method with limited disturbance and straightforward deployment but, of course, we do need a sound understanding of current boundaries and ultimate limits. Interdisciplinary collaboration is key to give greater meaning to observed data.”Explore more on these topicsSoilFarmingAgricultureBiodiversityClimate crisisDroughtFaminenewsShareReuse this content"

Sign up hereNina LakhaniFri 5 Dec 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 5 Dec 2025 02.02 ESTShareDonald Trump’s decision to boycott Cop30, withdraw the US from the Paris agreement and illegally terminate a slew of investments in renewable energy will not change the reality of climate breakdown for Americans.In what has become an annual reporting tradition, I found myself in Arizona reporting on heat-related deaths during yet another gruelling heatwave, when temperatures topped 43C (110F) on 13 out of 14 straight days in Phoenix. Before embarking on this trip, I spent weeks combing through hundreds of autopsy reports, which I obtained from two county medical examiners using the Freedom of Information Act. Each death report gave me a glimpse into the person’s life, and I used clues from the case notes to track down friends and loved ones in the hopes of better understanding why heat is killing people in the richest country in the world.More on what my reporting taught me about America’s ongoing climate crisis, after this week’s climate headlines.Essential readsHow cyclones and monsoon rains converged to devastate parts of Asia – visual guideThe environmental costs of corn: should the US change how it grows its dominant crop?‘Those who eat Chilean salmon cannot imagine how much human blood it carries with it’In focusView image in fullscreenRichard Chamblee who died from extreme heat in Arizona.Photograph: Courtesy of the Chamblee familyIn Mohave county, a vast sprawling desert area that borders California and Nevada, about 70% of confirmed heat-related deaths occur indoors, with low-income residents living in RVs and mobile homes most at risk.I went to meetthe family of Richard Chamblee, who died just two days after his central air conditioning broke.Richard was clinically obese and bed-bound in the living room as the temperature hit 46C but his family could not afford to immediately replace or repair the AC system. They tried their best to keep him cool: they bought a window AC unit and installed it next to Richard’s bed, and positioned fans, ice packs and cold drinks at his bedside. But their mobile home is old, open-plan and poorly insulated; Richard overheated, struggling to breathe. His core temperature measured 42C when he was rushed to the emergency room, but doctors were unable to cool him down. His wife, Sherry, who works three jobs, told me: “We had no idea the heat could be so dangerous so quickly inside. It just happened so fast.”Richard was just 52. He was a devout Baptist and loved playing video games.Another person who made my heart ache was Hannah Moody, a super-fit, inspiring social media influencer who regularly posted about her passion for the outdoors. Hannah went out on a desert hikeand didn’t come home. Rescuers found Hannah, 31, the following day, just 90 metres from the car park, where her body temperature measured 61C. Hannah was among 555 suspected heat deaths this year alone in Maricopa county, home to Phoenix, America’s fifth-largest and hottest city. This year’s death toll comes on top of another 3,100 confirmed heat-related fatalities over the past decade.One of the most troubling things I have learned over these past few years is that the US does not have a reliable way of counting heat deaths. The nation’s 2,000-plus coroner and medical examiner offices follow no single protocol, and in many cases, whether heat is listed as a factor depends entirely on the experience and qualifications of who certifies the death. Maricopa county is considered the gold standard for investigations, yet my reporting suggests that even they could be undercounting heat-related deaths, specifically for people who are homeless.Every single heat death is preventable, but the US chooses not to know just how many people are dying and why. “No one dies from a heatwave,” Bharat Venkat, the director of the University of California, Los Angeles’s heat lab, told me. “The way in which our society is structured makes some people vulnerable and others safer.” In other words, it is not just the heat. It is inequality – who has access to shelter, healthcare, money and social support – that often determines who lives and who dies.What we do know is that the US is thebiggest historical greenhouse gas emitter, and that today it is second only toChina, so this country’s own culpability in the climate catastrophe now killing Americans did not begin with Trump.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The historic cash injection was meant to help revitalise and strengthen former coal communities, which overwhelmingly support Trump and are being increasingly hit with destructive floods.Trump’s lawless policymaking upended investments to support Appalachia’s transition from extractive industries to solar and other non-fossil energy technologies, which would have created thousands of jobs for a region that was broken first by coal then by the opioid epidemic. The cuts include cancelling money approved by Congress for a new fire station and solar-powered resilience hub in Dante, a mountain holler, population 600 (down from 3,000 when coal was king), which has been hit by days-long power outages and catastrophic flooding in recent years.Across Appalachia, Arizona, and the entire US, communities are being hit by Trump’s wholesale cuts to food stamps, medical care, and climate resilience programmes. Yet these same communities continue to be bombarded with misinformation and disinformation at church, through social media and right-wing broadcasters, and many remain skeptical about the role fossil fuels, climate change and capitalism plays in the economic hardship and environmental destruction wrecking their lives.Read more:Americans are dying from extreme heat.

However, it’s disappointing that we had not previously been told about this, despite regular engagement with the Home Office and police bodies as part of our wider work to hold government and the public sector to account on how data is being used in their services.“While we appreciate the valuable role technology can play, public confidence in its use is paramount, and any perception of bias and discrimination can exacerbate mistrust. The ICO is here to support and assist the public sector to get this right.”Police and crime commissioners said publication of the NPL’s finding “sheds light on a concerning inbuilt bias” and urged caution over plans for a national expansion, which could include cameras being placed at shopping centres, stadiums and transport hubs, without putting in place adequate safeguards.The findings were released on Thursday, hours after Sarah Jones, the policing minister, had described the technology as the “biggest breakthrough since DNA matching”.Facial recognition technology scans people’s faces and cross-references the images against watchlists of known or wanted criminals. It can be used while examining live footage of people passing cameras, comparing their faces with those on wanted lists, or to enable officers to target individuals as they walk by mounted cameras.Police officers can also retrospectively run images of suspects through police, passport or immigration databases to identify them and check their backgrounds.Analysts who examined the police national database’s retrospective facial recognition technology tool at a lower setting found that “the false positive identification rate (FPIR) for white subjects (0.04%) is lower than that for Asian subjects (4.0%) and black subjects (5.5%)”.The testing found that the number of false positives for black women was particularly high. “The FPIR for black male subjects (0.4%) is lower than that for black female subjects (9.9%),” the report said.Responding to the report, a Home Office spokesperson said the department took the findings “seriously”, and had already taken action, including procuring and testing a new algorithm “which has no statistically significant bias”.“Given the importance of this issue, we have also asked the police inspectorate, alongside the forensic science regulator, to review law enforcement’s use of facial recognition. They will assess the effectiveness of the mitigations, which the National Police Chiefs’ Council supports,” the spokesperson said.Explore more on these topicsFacial recognitionData visualisationsPoliceRegulatorsHome OfficeRacenewsShareReuse this content"

He told the News Agents podcast that rejoining the EU customs union was “not currently where we are” but that it was self-evident that Brexit had “badly damaged the economy”.The government views the youth mobility scheme as one ofa number of agreements it can finalise in the coming monthsthat would deliver tangible benefits to the British public.A government source said Nigel Farage was increasingly in “uncomfortable territory” over the UK’s relations with the EU, citing polling suggesting that a majority of voters now favour closer ties and more than 70% want to see a controlled and time-limited youth mobility programme.UK officials are pushing for a two-year time limit on the scheme and a cap in the “tens of thousands”, the Guardian understands, with negotiations continuing over a draft text.A government source briefed on the talks said that if a two-year scheme were up and running by 2027, the first tranche of Europeans arriving in the UK would return home before the next election expected in 2029.They said this would demonstrate to voters that the programme was controlled, time-limited and ensure it had no overall impact on the UK’s net migration figures. The numbers of Europeans temporarily moving to the UK would also be offset by Britons going to Europe.Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister leading the negotiations with Europe, is due to meet his European counterpart, Maroš Šefčovič, in Brussels on Wednesday to discuss progress.View image in fullscreenMaroš Šefčovič (left) and Nick Thomas-Symonds at a summit in May. The pair are leading the negotiations for the EU and UK respectively.Photograph: Neil Hall/EPAUK and EU officials stressed that the talks were at an early stage and the details were still being negotiated, including the age range at which young people would qualify. One source said the EU was pushing for a four-year limit to the scheme.Thomas-Symonds has previously said that any youth mobility agreement would be modelled on the UK’s existing schemes with countries including Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea.Britain’s scheme with Australia is capped at 45,000 – although only 9,750 Australians came last year, fewer than a quarter of the limit. Given the EU has a population of nearly 450 million compared with Australia’s 28 million, Brussels is likely to expect a higher cap.Formal negotiations over the scheme began in September, and talks over other aspects of the EU reset – including food standards and a joint carbon emissions scheme – only started in mid-November.UK government figures have expressed frustration at the delay, which they said was caused by the slowness in the European Commission obtaining its mandate from EU governments.One priority for the EU is ensuring that Britons who participate in the youth mobility scheme are committed to living and working in one European country for the duration of their participation, rather than moving around. There is also a desire that all the EU’s 27 members benefit.A priority on the UK side is to ensure the scheme is designed in such a way that young Britons from working-class backgrounds can take advantage of it, with no prohibitive fees or barriers to their participation.More than 60 Labour MPspublicly endorsed a youth mobility schemewith Europe earlier this year, and are supportive of the government’s drive for closer ties with the EU.“There has been a real step change in the language used by the people at the top of government compared with where we were in the first few months when we got elected,” one Labour MP said.“The impetus on our side has got to be that we can move quickly … The route to getting closer to the EU is by demonstrating that, step by step, we can make agreements that are concrete.”In a YouGov poll in September, 62% of voters said Brexit was more of a failure than a success for the UK, compared with just 11% who said it had been more of a success than a failure.However, experts warned that the collapse of negotiations between the UK and EU over defence last week demonstrated the difficulties of seeking improved terms across a host of areas. The talks, which were seeking to allow UK companies to play a greater part in the EU’s €150bn (£130bn) defence loans scheme,failed because of a dispute over money.Anand Menon, the director of the UK in a Changing Europe thinktank, said the episode demonstrated that UK relations were not a priority for the EU. “I think the urgency has totally gone on the EU side, and there’s also a disappointing tendency on the EU side to think in terms of how much cash they can screw out of us,” he said.David Henig, a trade expert, said: “I think the immediate optimism of a successful summit has now given way to the usual difficulties of negotiations, which are being exacerbated by Brussels being heavily focused on other issues, not least with regard to the US and China.”A government spokesperson said:“We are working together with the EU to create a balanced youth experience scheme which will create new opportunities for young people to live, work, study and travel.“As agreed with the EU in May, any final scheme must be time-limited and capped. We will not give a running commentary on ongoing talks.”This article was amended on 5 December 2025. An earlier version said that there were 28 members of the EU, rather than 27.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsImmigration and asylumEuropean UnionYoung peopleBrexitWork & careersEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The brand was expanded to about 40 sites at its peak, before a series of restructuring programmes started to reduce the number of locations from 2017.Two years later the now 50-year-old was forced to call in the administrators after a sales process that sought to bring in new investment into the business proved unsuccessful.In an email to staff at the time, Oliver blamed “the well-publicised struggles of the casual dining sector and decline of the UK high street, along with soaring business rates”.Oliver’s return comes at a time when the hospitality industry faces several challenges including soaring food inflation, increasing wage costs and lacklustre trade as consumers rein in spending on non-essentials amid higher household bills.“In theory it’s not the easiest time to return but conversely, I think it’s the perfect time,” Oliver said. “I believe the mid-market needs excitement, surprise and delight and that’s exactly what I am planning on delivering.”The failure of Jamie’s Italian in 2019 resulted in 1,000 job losses.After the collapse of the UK business, the Jamie’s Italian brand continued to operate overseas and it has more than 30 restaurants in 25 countries. Overall, Oliver still has about 70 restaurants around the world run by franchise partners.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This was despite a 6% rise in sales to £28.6m, helped by an increase in restaurant income after the November 2023 opening of his first directly run restaurant sincethe collapse of his UK empire.JOH includes Oliver’s media interests such as TV production, books, endorsements, his cookery school and his restaurant, as well as franchise income from the overseas outlets, fees for promoting the supermarket Tesco, and royalties from products bearing his name.Explore more on these topicsJamie OliverFoodHospitality industryRestaurantsnewsShareReuse this content"

TheIndependent Office for Police Conductsaid Smith left the ambulance near the junction for Weston-super-Mare and walked on to the live lanes of the motorway.Paramedics called Avon andSomersetpolice for assistance at about 11pm on 30 November and an officer arrived a short time later.The IOPC said body-worn video footage showed the officer tried to engage with Smith before firing a Taser, causing the Weston-super-Mare teenager to fall to the ground. He was then hit by a car travelling along the southbound carriageway and died at the scene despite emergency first aid.Derrick Campbell, the director of the IOPC, said: “My thoughts and sympathies are with Logan’s family and friends and everyone affected by this shocking and tragic incident. We want to reassure everyone that we will independently investigate all the circumstances surrounding this incident, including the use of a Taser.“After being notified by the force, we sent our investigators to the police post-incident procedure to begin gathering evidence. We have taken initial accounts from the officer and ambulance staff involved. We met with Logan’s family on Tuesday, to give our condolences, explain our role and to provide some further detail about our investigation, including a Taser being discharged during the incident.”The coroner has been informed and formal identification and a postmortem have taken place. Following Smith’s death, Avon and Somerset police said the on-duty officer had “attempted to bring him to safety to reduce the risk to him and other members of the public”.On Monday, Assistant Chief Constable Joanne Hall said: “Our thoughts are with the man’s family at such a devastating time. We will support them in any way we can. This incident has had a significant effect on our officers and ambulance crews who are understandably incredibly upset by what happened.“As well as providing support to the man’s family, we are also making sure that the appropriate welfare arrangements are in place for our staff and also for those members of the public who were either directly involved or who witnessed the incident.“A mandatory referral has been made to the Independent Office forPoliceConduct by our professional standards department. It’s already begun an independent investigation into the circumstances, which we will fully cooperate with.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsSomersetPoliceIndependent Office for Police ConductnewsShareReuse this content"

That is pure populism, or simply nonsense.”View image in fullscreenDemonstrators take part in a rally against conscription in Cologne on Thursday.Photograph: Ying Tang/NurPhoto/ShutterstockMöller expressed the sentiment building in recent weeks that a rise in interest in the German armed forces would ensure enough volunteers would be found to boost numbers to460,000, consisting of 260,000 active soldiers and 200,000 reservists.Germany currently has 182,000 active soldiers and just under 50,000 reservists.In 2011, under Angela Merkel’s government, Germany suspended its military conscription programme, which had been in place from 1956, in order to modernise it for the post-cold war world, where it was thought the focus would be on foreign missions requiring the skills of a professional army rather than conscripts needed to fight a war.Pistorius called the law “a critical step towards our ability to defend ourselves”, adding: “Our allies are looking to us.”The law was passed by 323 votes to 272, with one abstention. Among those against it were the far-right populist AfD and the far-left Die Linke.Desiree Backer, of Die Linke, urged young people to stand up against the law, which she said was “anything but voluntary”, as 18-year-olds would be obliged to fill out a questionnaire. She also pointed to evasive answers given by ministers when questioned over whether they would be prepared to see their own children conscripted.“Young people have other plans than risking their lives for the rich,” she said.The AfD’s Rüdiger Lucassen criticised as “superficial” attempts to attract young people to military service by giving them substantial pay increases and offering them benefits such as financing driving licences and language classes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In September it was announced the pair would be teaming up again for a belated sequel to that film, in which Caine plays a priest who assists Diesel’s immortal warrior to stop a plague ravaging the planet.Caine, 92, first retired in 2009, after gang crime drama Harry Brown and then again, 24 films later, in 2021, after starring as novelist in Best Sellers. He returned for little-seen Czech historical drama Medieval in 2022 and, the following year, starred in The Great Escaper as a D-day veteran who travels to Normandy solo from his care home for the 70th anniversary.Caine gave mixed messages about his retirement while promoting that film, telling BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I’ve figured, I’ve had a picture where I’ve played the lead and had incredible reviews. The only parts I’m likely to get now are old men, 90-year-old men, maybe 85. And I thought, ‘Well, I might as well leave with all this – I’ve got wonderful reviews. What have I got to do to beat this?’”View image in fullscreenMichael Caine and John Standing photographed in 2023.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianSpeaking to the Guardian to promote that film, however, Caine indicated some appetite to continue working, saying that the following year, he would be shooting a new movie in which he played Charles Darwin. “And that’ll be it. I won’t do another one after.”When questioned whether he was certain, Caine said: “No! But the point is,canyou do it? Can you remember all the lines? I’ve got used to not working and staying in bed till 11am and staying out late at night. I love it.”Anthony Hopkins has since been announced as the star of the Darwin film, which will begin shooting next year.In Jeddah, Saudi Arabia,Caine was joined on stage by his three grandchildren, Taylor, Miles and Allegra, while his wife, Shakira, and two daughters, Dominique and Natasha, watched from the stalls.‘I’m 90.

It’s the one that made all the money. I was born a cockney in London, which is very poor working class, and I grew up to be what I am which is, well, I am not multiple rich, but I’ve got enough money for an evening out, even an evening in.”Caine, who has been nominated for six Academy Awards, and won two, for Hannah and Her Sisters (1986) and The Cider House Rules (1999) added: “I’m here to get an award, which doesn’t surprise me. I won two Oscars.”He continued: “I’ve been married for 52 years. I have loads of photographs but none are of any of the movies I am in, it’s just family, because that’s my life.”“I have a fabulous family that I adore beyond belief. I’ve had a fairly fabulous movie family, some who’ve let me down, and I love them beyond belief, including the failures.”“But one of the biggest lucky things is tonight to turn up here. I’ll tell you why, because I had never been here. I’ve seen it on the television, but I thought I’d never win with anything there. And I have won something, so I’m happy, and you’ve surprised me.“I want to thank you for the surprise, because in show business, you never get many surprises, but you get a couple of shocks. So thank you.”Caine published his first novel, a thriller called Deadly Game, in 2023, and is believed to be working on a follow-up. His latest memoir, Don’t Look Back, You’ll Trip Over: My Guide to Life, was published in 2024.Explore more on these topicsFilmMichael CainenewsShareReuse this content"

Cole was accused of placing pipe bombs outside the headquarters of the Democratic and Republican parties not far from the US Capitol and the White House on the evening of 5 January 2021. Upadhyaya set a detention hearing for 15 December, with prosecutors expected to ask to detain Cole before trial.Cole told investigators that he believed in conspiracy theories that the 2020 election won by Joe Biden over Donald Trumpwas stolen, reported CNN and NBC, citing people familiar with the matter. The Associated Press reported that Cole confessed to planting the bombs.The FBI and Department of Justice have not commented on Cole’s alleged motivations.The devices were not discovered until the next day and were deactivated by police.

What Netflix hopes to achieve by buying Warner Bros | Andrew PulverRead more“A Netflix-Warner Bros would create one massive media giant with control of close to half of the streaming market – threatening to force Americans into higher subscription prices and fewer choices over what and how they watch, while putting American workers at risk,” she said.Her views were also shared by Pramila Jayapal, co-chair of the House Monopoly Busters caucus.“It would mean more price hikes, ads and cookie cutter content, less creative control for artists, and lower pay for workers,” she said. “The media industry is already controlled by a few corporations with too much power to censor free speech. The government must step in.”The deal, which would bring titles including Harry Potter, The White Lotus, Superman and Game of Thrones, into the streamer’s already vast library was also criticised by the Directors Guild of America.In a statement, the group said it raised “significant concerns” and they would be arranging a meeting withNetflixas soon as possible.The Writers Guild of America also released a statement, calling for it to be stopped.“The world’s largest streaming company swallowing one of its biggest competitors is what antitrust laws were designed to prevent,” the statement read. “The outcome would eliminate jobs, push down wages, worsen conditions for all entertainment workers, raise prices for consumers, and reduce the volume and diversity of content for all viewers. Industry workers along with the public are already impacted by only a few powerful companies maintaining tight control over what consumers can watch on television, on streaming, and in theaters. This merger must be blocked.”Ted Sarandos, a co-chief executive of Netflix, has said he is “highly confident” that the merger will go through without problems and called the deal “pro-consumer, pro-innovation, pro-worker, pro-creator” on an investor call earlier this week.James Cameron had already criticised the purchase earlier this week before it was made official. On the industry podcast The Town, hesaidit “would be a disaster”.The announcement comes after a number of other interested parties, including Paramount and Comcast, also entered discussions.This year has seen a number of theatrical success stories for Warner Bros including Sinners, Superman, A Minecraft Movie, Weapons and Final Destination: Bloodlines.“Netflix expects to maintain Warner Bros’ current operations and build on its strengths, including theatrical releases for films,” a statement from the streamer read this morning.Sarandos added: “I think over time, I think the windows will evolve to be much more consumer friendly, to be able to meet the audience where they are, quicker … I’d say right now, you should count on everything that is planned on going to the theater through Warner Bros will continue to go to the theaters through Warner Bros.”Explore more on these topicsWarner BrosNetflixFilm industryElizabeth WarrennewsShareReuse this content"

Earlier,it said a separate issue had been reportedwith its application programming interfaces.The issue, which affected 28% of its traffic, lasted for half an hour and was resolved shortly after 9am GMT, it said. This follows a far larger Cloudflare outage in mid-November that hit sites such as X, OpenAI and Spotify as well as multiplayer games such as League of Legends.That was caused by “a configuration file that is automatically generated to manage threat traffic” growing beyond its expected size and triggering a crash in the software system that handles traffic for a number of Cloudflare services.“We have spoken directly with hundreds of customers following that incident and shared our plans to make changes to prevent single updates from causing widespread impact like this,” Cloudflare said in its post.Friday’s error appeared far more minor, affecting sites including Canva, Shopify, the Indian-based stockbroker Groww, as well asLinkedIn, Zoom and Downdetector, a site used to monitor online service issues. The Downdetector website recorded more than 4,500 reports related to Cloudflare after returning online.Given the high-profile series of internet outages in the past months, it could cause some companies to reflect on how they use Cloudflare’s services.Steven Murdoch, a professor of computer science at University College London, said: “I think people will start asking questions now that there have been these two outages in a short period of time. They’re not very happy, and Cloudflare isn’t very happy either – they’re apologetic. But it’s too early to say whether there’s a systemic problem, such as bad software practices, or it’s just bad luck.”He said Cloudflare, aglobal cloud services and cybersecurity firm, marketed itself on the basis of its reliability. Companies use it because it offers a level of immunity to certain kinds of cyber-attacks and can improve the performance of websites, making them faster and more resilient to server crashes.Its recent outages in the past months, as well as anAmazon Web Services outage in Octoberthat affected more than 2,000 companies, have fuelled conversation among experts about whether key internet services are too centralised and thus vulnerable.“There’s a huge amount of centralisation,” Murdoch said. “Cloudflare do have a good product, that’s why so many people use them, but it leads to vulnerabilities.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is the fourth major global outage, large enough to be noticed by non-technical media and affect regular people around the world, since 20 October.”Cloudflare claims that about 20% of all websites use some form of its services. It has nearly 300,000 customers operating in 125 countries, and claims to block billions of cyber-attacks for these users daily. It makes more than $500m (£440m) each quarter.Woźniak said recent outages called into question Cloudflare’s marketing, based on its reliability and resilience, and the broader narrative that large companies were safer partners than smaller infrastructure providers. “These companies have become too big to not fail. And because they handle so much traffic, when they do fail, this immediately becomes a massive problem,” he said.Murdoch, however, said there could be an upside to this outage for Cloudflare. “When AWS went down, their share price went up, because people realised how many people are using them. In some ways [the outage] is great marketing, because you see how many people are using Cloudflare.”Explore more on these topicsInternetLinkedInZoomnewsShareReuse this content"

The move follows thelaunch of a lower-priced Model Y SUV, Tesla’s bestselling model, in Europe and the US.The cheaper Model 3 and Model Y cars drop some premium finishes and features of the more expensive versions, but still offer driving ranges above 300 miles (480km).Tesla sales haveslumped across Europeas the company faces increasingly tough competition from its Chinese rival BYD, which outsold the US electric vehicle maker across the region for the first time in spring.Sales across the EU have also been hurt by a buyer backlash against Musk’s support for Trump’s election campaign and period working in the president’s administration.In his role running the “department of government efficiency”, or Doge, the tech billionaireled sweeping job cuts, butquit in Mayand after falling out with Trump over the “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill.Musk has also alienated customers through other controversial political interventions, includingappearing to give a Nazi saluteat Trump’s victory rally,showing support for Germany’s far-right AfD party, and accusing Keir Starmer and other senior UK politicians ofcovering up the scandal about grooming gangs.New taxes on electric cars in last month’s budget could undermine UK demand, critics have said. UK electric car sales grew at their slowest rate in two years in November, at just 3.6%, according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).“[This] should be seen as a wake-up call that a sustained increase in demand for EVs cannot be taken for granted,” said Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the SMMT. “We should be taking every opportunity to encourage drivers to make the switch, not punishing them for doing so.”The chancellor’s new pay-per-mile road tax on EVs will charge drivers 3p for every mile from April 2028, costing motorists about £250 a year on average.Explore more on these topicsTeslaElon MuskUS politicsTrump administrationEuropeElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsnewsShareReuse this content"

Annual growth slowed to a 0.7% increase, down from a 1.9% rise in October.Amanda Bryden, the head of mortgages at Halifax, said: “While slower growth may disappoint some existing homeowners, it’s welcome news for first-time buyers. Comparing property prices to average incomes, affordability is now at its strongest since late 2015.“Looking ahead, with market activity steady and expectations of further interest rate reductions to come, we anticipate property prices will continue to grow gradually into 2026.”Earlier this week Nationwidereported growth in house pricesdespite fears that buyer demand might be affected because of uncertainty before last month’s budget.“Few were predicting record high prices following the budget, another reminder that UK house prices are often more resilient than we think,” said Anthony Codling, the managing director of equity research at RBC Capital Markets. “Perhaps without budget uncertainty they would have hit £300,000.”Codling said that with the Bank of England monetary policy committeelikely to vote to cut interest ratesat its next meeting later this month, house prices could pass the £300,000 milestone when figures for December are released.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In Andrea Arnold’s 2011 adaptation of the novel,James Howson became the first black actor to play the role. Robbie said of Elordi: “I saw him play Heathcliff, and he is Heathcliff. I’d say, just wait. Trust me, you’ll be happy.”She added: “It’s a character that has this lineage of other great actors who’ve played him, from Laurence Olivier to Richard Burton and Ralph Fiennes to Tom Hardy. To be a part of that is special. He’s incredible and I believe in him so much. I honestly think he’s our generation’s Daniel Day-Lewis.”There has also been some disquiet over Robbie’s casting. In the novel, Cathy is described as dark-haired and is in her late teens; Robbie is in her mid-30s andthe early trailer releasesshow her with blond hair.The film’s casting director Kharmel Cochrane said earlier this year: “There was one Instagram comment that said the casting director should be shot. But just wait till you see it, and then you can decide whether you want to shoot me or not. But you really don’t need to be accurate. It’s just a book. That is not based on real life. It’s all art.”In the same Vogue interview Robbie outlined her interest in the character: “I both understood her and didn’t, in a way that drew me to her. It’s this puzzle you have to work out.”Fennell also defended her decision to cast Robbie in the role, saying: “Cathy is a star. She’s wilful, mean, a recreational sadist, a provocateur. She engages in cruelty in a way that is disturbing and fascinating. It was about finding someone who you would forgive in spite of yourself, someone who literally everyone in the world would understand why you love her.”She added: “It’s difficult to find that supersized star power. Margot comes with big dick energy. That’s what Cathy needs.”View image in fullscreen‘A big epic romance’ … Elordi and Robbie in Wuthering Heights.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyFennell has built her directing career on constructing outrageous, social media-friendly narratives with strongly provocative elements. While making her mark as an actor, notably as Camilla Shand in the TV series The Crown, Fennell moved into writing and showrunning on the TV series Killing Eve before making her film directing debut with Promising Young Woman, starring Carey Mulligan, for which Fennell won the best original screenplay Oscar. She followed this up with Saltburn, which attained notoriety for scenes in which Barry Keoghan’s character Oliver drinks bathwater containing semen and dances naked through the stately home of the title.Fennell appears to be employing similarly audience-baiting tactics in Wuthering Heights, withreports emerging from an early test screening in Augustthat the film was “aggressively provocative and tonally abrasive”, and includes a scene of a public hanging in which the “condemned man ejaculates mid-execution”.Robbie, who recently starred in and produced the blockbuster Barbie adaptation, also acts as a producer on Wuthering Heights, having been a producer on both of Fennell’s previous feature films. Robbie’s production company LuckyChap, which includes her husband, Tom Ackerley, among its principals, has emerged as an entertainment industry force, with production credits on I, Tonya, Birds of Prey and My Old Ass alongside Barbie and Fennell’s films.At the Brontë Women’s Writing festival last year, Fennell defended her approach to Wuthering Heights, saying that Brontë’s novel, originally published in 1847, meant a huge amount to her: “I’ve been obsessed. I’ve been driven mad by this book. I know that if somebody else made it, I’d be furious. It’s very personal material for everyone. It’s very illicit. The way we relate to the characters is very private.”View image in fullscreen‘Epic romances and period pieces aren’t often made by women’ … Wuthering Heights.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyShe added: “[It is] an act of extreme masochism to try and make a film of something that means this much to you. There’s an enormous amount of sado-masochism in this book. There’s a reason people were deeply shocked by it.”Of the film’s erotic content, Robbie told Vogue: “Everyone’s expecting this to be very, very raunchy. I think people will be surprised. Not to say there aren’t sexual elements and that it’s not provocative – it definitely is provocative – but it’s more romantic than provocative. This is a big epic romance.”She and Fennell discussed this on the set: “What reads to us as hot or exciting or sexy? And it’s not just a sex position or someone taking their shirt off.” A scene in which Elordi’s Heathcliff shelters Cathy from the rain “almost made me weak at the knees”, Robbie said, adding: “It was the little things that we loved as two women in our 30s, and this movie is primarily for people in our demographic. These epic romances and period pieces aren’t often made by women.”Robbie said that Fennell’s ambition was to make “this generation’s Titanic” and Fennell told her: “I went to the cinema to watch Romeo & Juliet eight times and I was on the ground crying when I wasn’t allowed to go back for a ninth. I want it to be that.”Explore more on these topicsFilmMargot RobbieJacob ElordiEmerald FennellWuthering HeightsFilm adaptationsEmily BrontënewsShareReuse this content"

Since the 1960s he has been on a quest to collect, preserve and restore these fragile artefacts of early cinema – thousands of which were lost, binned, or melted down for their silver content.He even won an honorary Oscar in 2010 for his efforts. But perhaps less well known is Brownlow’s career as a film director; not just with the various documentaries and TV shows related to his passion for silent movies, but in feature films that are as good as any of the more celebrated products of British cinema’s 1960s and 70s golden age.Brownlow, in conjunction with co-director (and historian) Andrew Mollo, has two brilliant features on his CV: It Happened Here, released in 1964, and Winstanley, released more than a decade later in 1975. But that was it. Brownlow, now 87, seems pretty sanguine about it. “We did try,” he says. “If producers had been enthusiastic, I’m sure we’d have made at least one more feature.”View image in fullscreenBrownlow at the Motion Picture Academy and Mary Pickford Foundation’s annual celebration of silent film in Beverly Hills, California in 2013.Photograph: Valérie Macon/Getty ImagesThings might have been different, perhaps, if they hadn’t got themselves fired (byBryan Forbes, no less) from The Breaking of Bumbo, an adaptation of the Andrew Sinclair comic novel, after a row over casting. (Bumbo eventually came out in 1970, with Sinclair as director, and without Brownlow and Mollo’s choice in the lead role.) But it’s not as if Brownlow didn’t have anything else going on: he published The Parade’s Gone By, his seminal history of silent cinema, in 1968 (and followed it up with two more: The War, the West and the Wilderness in 1979, and Behind the Mask of Innocence in 1990); he was also the editor on Tony Richardson’s The Charge of the Light Brigade (also 1968), an authentic masterwork of the period.The two Brownlow/Mollo films that were finished and released were both essentially self-produced, tiny-budget affairs, but amazingly consequential in their impact, then and now. From our vantage point they look bizarrely prescient – which is why film-maker and curator Stanley Schtinter is hosting a rare cinema screening of both films at the Close-Up Film Centre in London tomorrow.The earlier film, It Happened Here, is perhaps the most obviously resonant. A sort of hybrid alternative-history drama-newsreel, it posits an England occupied by the Nazis, its inhabitants caught between bending the knee to the invaders and standing up to them. As much as anything else, it pushes back against the idea that England possesses a natural sense of liberalism. Not only do we hear at length from dyed-in-the-wool English Nazis – played, says Brownlow, by real-life fascists, including a BUF group leader called Frank Bennett – but we also see the incremental submission of middle-of-the-road “apolitical” types (including the central character, an Irish nurse). The British “partisans” that Brownlow and Mollo confect are just as brutal as their German counterparts, enthusiastically machine-gunning captured soldiers in a field.The story behind the film’s genesis is remarkable. Brownlow says he was inspired by hearing a man shout in German in the street in London’s West End. “I was doing a dreary job taking film cans to the local laboratory, and a Citroën, the kind the Gestapo took over in their occupation of Paris, screeched to a halt beside me. The driver yelled at somebody in the doorway of a delicatessen in German. I’d just been reading things by George Orwell and I thought: my God, what a story it would make.”Even more remarkably, Brownlow was only 17 when he started shooting the film in 1956: “I was earning four pound 10 a week, and I was completely addicted to film. This was my feeble attempt at doing a big picture.” Mollo was even younger, but fortunately for Brownlow had a job at Woodfall, the film company co-founded by Richardson, who gave the pair £3,000. “Andrew insisted that everything be absolutely authentic – even the tank that opens the picture. He had an uncanny ability to find exactly what we needed for the next bit of filming. I just don’t know how he did it.”View image in fullscreenChilling … It Happened Here.Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyThe cherry on top was a chance encounter with a legendary figure in the cafe of what was then the National Film Theatre. “Andrew and I were watching a von Stroheim film and in the interval we went to the coffee bar – and there was Stanley Kubrick. We admired him tremendously for what he’d done with Paths of Glory, so we went up to him. Kubrick said to us: ‘I once did what you are doing but I ran out of stock. Could you use some more?’ He was fantastic and sent us a huge crate packed with 35mm raw stock from Dr Strangelove, which he was doing at the time. It was so generous, and kept us going at a time when nobody was interested. But we were very worried we were going to get a double exposure with Peter Sellers!”In retrospect, It Happened Here is a fascinating oddity, of a piece with the kind of radical TV being turned out at the time, such asPeter Watkins’s pseudo-documentary Culloden, which was broadcast in 1964, the same year that Brownlow’s film premiered at the Cork film festival. Even more amazingly, Watkins – who would shortly embark on his celebrated nuclear-detonation film The War Game – was Brownlow’s assistant, and actually helped film parts of It Happened Here. “I can tell you, we used to have terrific rows about films and how to do realistic-looking scenes. It was really fascinating,” Brownlow says.Brownlow and Mollo stumbled into a censorship row with their fascist footage; not surprisingly, the film’s Hollywood distributors balked at showing such nakedly antisemitic material and removed it. Brownlow felt it was necessary: “I tried writing the words myself, and asked other people to. But it never rang true until we got a bunch of these people in front of the camera. It was absolutely chilling.” With the help of Kubrick’s lawyers, Brownlow and Mollo eventually got the rights back and restored the scene – which, as he says, is chilling.Cut to a decade later; the other side of The Charge of the Light Brigade, Bumbo and The Parade’s Gone By, and Brownlow and Mollo released Winstanley in 1975. Like It Happened Here, it was filmed almost entirely with non-professionals; the lead actor, Miles Halliwell, was a schoolteacher who brought the source material, David Caute’s Comrade Jacob, to the film-makers’ attention in the first place. Authentic and awkward, imbued with a deep sense of spirituality and a radical political consciousness, Winstanley is perhaps the closest British cinema ever got to Pasolini. It revolves around Gerrard Winstanley’s Diggers and their attempt, just after the English civil war, to take over common land on St George’s Hill, near Weybridge in Surrey.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I am not sure that is true; Halliwell’s Winstanley comes across as a deeply spiritual figure, if a bit more well-spoken than the historical figure was supposed to be.Historical accuracy was, naturally, a vital element of Winstanley, with Mollo to the fore again. Brownlow says: “He just went straight to the man who was the keeper of the armoury in the Tower of London, who gave us all the original 17th-century armour we needed for the opening battle scene.” But a large part of the film’s consequentiality was the way it tapped into the squatter culture of the 1970s; in another serendipitous connection,the notorious “king of the hippies”, Sid Rawle, was cast as a disquieting “ranter”. “I was very interested that the squatters were mirroring a lot of what went on in the 17th century,” says Brownlow. “Sid knew a lot about that period and he was very vocal about it.”Brownlow’s sideways step into silent film preservation may be British cinema’s loss, but it is certainly the wider film culture’s gain. Meanwhile, we should all celebrate these two unique films while we can, born out of the partnership of two exceptional people. “Andrew was very, very hard to please, but when he was satisfied, then I knew we’d got it. And I just went on until we did.”It Happened Here and Winstanley, plus a Q&A with Kevin Brownlow, isat the Close-Up Film Centre, London, on 6 December.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsPeriod and historical filmsSecond world warNazismfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was the first – and worse, only – day of shooting, and when cinematographer Julio Macat threaded some film into his camera, it was so cold that the film snapped. The gangsters flitted around menacingly, fedoras and machine guns at the ready.Macat was hoping to make a movie that was frightening and strange. “The goal,” he says, “was to scare a kid.” And so, even though it was 1990, he chose to shoot the noir like it was the 40s, with black and white film, fog filters on the camera lenses, and an intense, old-fashioned lighting setup to cast deep shadows on the set.Macat needed to do all of this to make the perfect family Christmas film.“It’s amazing to me how a lot of people don’t know that it’s not a real movie,” says Macat, almost 40 years later. He is talking – of course – about Angels with Filthy Souls, the film that sits inside the festive classic Home Alone. Our hero Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) watches the gangster flick wide-eyed when he’s left – you guessed it – home alone, and the fake film’s action sequences inspire Kevin’s later capers.But Angels with Filthy Souls ended up looking so realistic that audiences – including, for his “entire childhood”, the actorSeth Rogen– thought it was a real golden oldie.How do you make a film-inside-a-film? They are a fairly frequent but tragically understudied phenomenon – the Wikipedia entry, “List of films featuring fictional films” collates about 120 of them, but there are actually hundreds more. “They’re all great in their own way,” says Lynn Fisher, the 40-year-old creator of the speciality website “Nestflix”, which catalogues more than 1,000 stories nested in other stories. “I especially appreciate ones that obviously took a lot of effort to create. It’s the small details that really make it.”Fisher created Nestflix during a bout of unemployment in 2021 – she crafted the site to look like a streaming service. Ever since she learned that Angels with Filthy Souls wasn’t a real movie, the Arizona-based web designer has been fascinated by what she calls “nested films”. Her other favourites are teen dramaThe Pink Opaquefrom the psychological horror I Saw the TV Glow and the spy biopic Austinpussy from Austin Powers in Goldmember.Strangely, Home Alone isn’t the only festive film to host a fake film – it’s a fairly common occurrence. There’sTurbo Man: The Motion Picturein Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Jingle All the Way andThe Night the Reindeer Diedin Scrooged, not to mention the trailer for action film Deception in The Holiday.“I think they ground things,” says Macat, “it makes a movie more believable.” It makes sense that festive films need to be grounded with a bit of (fake) reality – it’s a speedy way to show the audience that fantastical Christmas magic is actually occurring in the real world. The Holiday’s production designer Jon Hutman has another theory. “Usually when there’s a film within a film the characters come to recognise that they are within the movie of their own lives,” he says, “and they have to rise, on some level, to being the hero of their own stories.”Audiences see less than 30 seconds of Deception in The Holiday, but nonetheless numerous online commenters wish the film was real. The action movie follows “your average 20-year-old” Rebecca Green (Lindsay Lohan), a waitress who is left something mysterious in her estranged father’s will. There are gunshots, explosions and steamy kisses.“You try to make it good without making it distracting,” Hutman says of making a film-within-a-film. As the set designer on The Holiday, Hutman was focused on bringing to life the now famous houses in the movie – an adorable English cottage and sprawling LA mansion. In comparison, he had to make the cafe in Deception understated and undistracting, while action sequences on an industrial-looking staircase and behind a chain-link fence set the tone with familiar tropey visuals. “You want it to be beautiful and clear and hopefully a little bit elegant and simple,” Hutman says.While Hutman admits that movies-within-movies can often be an “afterthought” for production, he says he personally treats these scenes the same as any others. Macat, too, certainly handled Angels with Filthy Souls like it was a real blockbuster – even though he had to shoot it in just one day, the final prep day before principal filming on Home Alone began.“You’re scared shitless, because it’s the first thing that the studio will see,” Macat says. It was his first movie as director of photography, and he battled impostor syndrome on set, particularly because he hadn’t used black and white film since film school. Nonetheless, when shooting started: “I could tell that we were doing something different and interesting.”“It was obviously inspired by Angels with Dirty Faces, and that sort of gangster type movie from 1938,” Macat explains. Because the old school film that Macat was shooting on wasn’t as light-sensitive as modern stuff, he required five times the amount of lighting – he also put some black netting over the lens to make the shots seem more vintage. Then there were smoke machines and a vintage Tommy gun used to pump the gangster “Snakes” full of lead. “It was all with the intent to shoot something that a kid hadn’t seen before that would scare the pants off him when he’s watching it by himself.”View image in fullscreenThe Night the Reindeer Died in Scrooged.Photograph: ParamountIn 2006, cinematographer Baz Irvine was about to work with auteur Nicolas Roeg on the supernatural horror Puffball – but then he broke his arm in a snowboarding accident. “I had this idea that I was going to be this leading light in alternative indie cinema in the UK and Ireland,” Irvine says – but, with a plaster cast up to his shoulders, he had to pull out of Puffball and scrabble for less physically demanding work. That’s how he ended up on Mr Bean’s Holiday.In Mr Bean’s Holiday, the titular Mr Bean wins a trip to Cannes. There, he watches – and ultimately interferes with – the premiere of arthouse film Playback Time, described as, “a film for all of us who hunger for truth, for all of us who cry out in pain”. Willem Dafoe plays actor-director Carson Clay in Mr Bean’s Holiday; Carson Clay plays a heartbroken detective in Playback Time. “I think Willem was completely baffled as to what was going on the whole time he was on the film,” Irvine laughs. “His scenes were so out of sync with each other and made no sense.”Irvine says Playback Time was, “not just a film within a film, but a homage to so many genres and a love letter to French cinema.”. So, in a way, the cinematographer did get to work on an indie darling. We see Dafoe ruminate in a long opening shot as he rises up an escalator – later, he runs through various industrial-looking spaces and stares into the distance as a tear rolls down his cheek. Footage was shot around London’s ExCel centre and Irvine estimates that filming lasted three days. He swapped from regular spherical lenses to anamorphic lenses with “that classic widescreen Hollywood look” to give Playback Time a different vibe from the rest of the film.“We just went to town on making something silly and fun and photographic,” Irvine says, “We were allowed to be indulgent.” The crew even had to crash the real Cannes festival to get shots for Playback Time’s premiere, walking the red carpet before the cast of a (real) Portuguese movie. “When you’re making a film, it’s quite gruelling. No matter how creative or brilliant it is, there is a monotony to the everyday,” Irvine says. “So it’s brilliant to be able to just suddenly put new lenses on, have a totally different aesthetic, and not worry so much.”Fake films certainly aren’t going anywhere – in May, Apple TV renewed The Studio, a satirical show about a Hollywood honcho who makes movies such as Alphabet City (a 1970s crime drama) and Duhpocalypse! (a zombie/diarrhoea epic). The Holiday’s fake action film featured very real celebrities – James Franco starred alongside Lohan, as did the instantly recognisable trailer narrator Hal Douglas – and so too does The Studio. The show’s casting director Melissa Kostenbauder managed to secure Martin Scorsese for its pilot. “We felt so lucky he wanted to do it,”she told Vulture, “Everyone was excited he was even entertaining it to begin with.”View image in fullscreenSeth Rogen in The Studio.Photograph: Apple TV+But, you might wonder, who exactly created and stars in The Studio? None other than Seth Rogen. Perhaps the revelation about Angels with Filthy Souls inspired the star to make his own nested films.Firm fan Fisher believes films-in-films should achieve one of three things. The first is that the phoney film should feel real, even if it’s a joke – audiences should say: “I can’t believe that movie is fake.” The second is that the crew should’ve “put way more time into that than they needed to”, that the attention to detail should be remarkable in and of itself. And, “The third reaction you want,” Fisher says, “is for people to say, I wish that was real so I could watch it.”Explore more on these topicsFilm industryMacaulay CulkinfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This is a takeover. Not only has this Jack and the Beanstalk gone from fairy story to panto to musical, but Jack has been relegated to second billing. To be accurate, this “new moooosical” by Jonathan O’Neill and Isaac Savage should be called Caroline and the Beanstalk, Caroline being the name of the highland cow who is adopted by Jack’s family and becomes sole supplier of milk for their Glen and Sherry’s brand of ice-cream.Played by an excellent Suzie McAdam, all ginger hair and stoicism, she is treated as an equal until the business fails. Then, it only takes a few magic beans for her to wind up in the Happy Smiles Petting Zoo, being prodded by unseen children while trying to hatch an escape plan with a hen, a llama and a pig. After some sub-Wallace and Gromit shenanigans, she is back home and ready to sort out the fickle Jack (Ronan O’Hara) and his troublesome beanstalk.In Stephen Whitson’s production, it is done with much pizzazz by a 10-strong cast (plus the giant voice ofBrian Cox), but the shift in emphasis is at the expense of the fable’s archetypal pull.Gone is any sense of the wonderment of a magical land, of the terror of being a child in an adult world and of the David and Goliath struggle between good and evil. In its place, a hazily dramatised caper about a single-minded cow, marred by the cynicism not only of Jack’s mum Sherry (Laura Lovemore), which you would expect, but of Jack himself, which feels all wrong.The story meanders away from its own heart, relying on expository dialogue to spell out the lessons learned: telling not showing. It does not help that many of the songs only delay the action.And yet those songs, an Americana-influenced collection that go from Broadway to vaudeville to rap, build the showbiz illusion that something greater is at stake: McAdam’s power ballad Udderly Alone being a case in point, key change and all. With crisp choreography by Lisa Darnell and some gorgeous harmonies under Savage’s musical direction, it is superficially lively but emotionally in the clouds.AtDundee Repuntil 30 DecemberExplore more on these topicsPanto seasonTheatreDundee RepMusicalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

He also runs A Colourful Storm – a fantastic indie label that massively punches above its weight when it comes to putting out charmingly moody experimental pop music, from artists as disparate as London-based percussionistValentina Magaletti, dubby Hobart duo Troth, and renowned underground polymath Simon Fisher Turner.In 2017, the label released I Won’t Have to Think About You, a compilation of winsome, C86-ish indie pop. Earlier this year, it put out Going Back to Sleep, a quasi-sequel to that record which also functions as a neatly drawn guide to some of the best twee-pop groups currently working. Sydney band Daily Toll, whose 2025 debut A Profound Non-Event is one of the year’s underrated gems, contribute Time, a seven-minute melodica-and-guitar reverie. Chateau, the duo of Al Montfort (Terry, Total Control) and Alex Macfarlane (the Stevens, Twerps), push into percussive, psychedelic lounge pop on How Long on the Platform, while Who Cares?, one of Melbourne’s best new bands, channel equal parts Hope Sandoval and Eartheater on Wax and Wane.Elsewhere, Going Back to Sleep features tracks from San Francisco indie stalwarts the Reds, Pinks and Purples; minimalist Sydney group the Lewers; and sun-dappled folk-pop from Dutch duo the Hobknobs.

Her self-titled 2012 debut was produced by Tame Impala’s Kevin Parker. On second album Bon Voyage (2018) she teamed up with Swedish psychedelic rock band Dungen, whose guitarist Reine Fiske popped up again on 2022’s Emotional Eternal and now features on Unclouded. Prochet’s fourth album is produced and partly co-written by composer Sven Wunder, and its dizzying array of contributors also includes Josefin Runsteen (opulent strings) and DJ Shadow collaborator Malcolm Catto (percussive fizz).View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Unclouded.Photograph: Domino Recording Company/PAStill, somehow Prochet retains her own singular vision. Borrowing a title from a quote by Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki – “You must see with eyes unclouded by hate. See the good in that which is evil, and the evil in that which is good” – Unclouded takes her airy vocals and baroque dreampop into brighter terrain. Some tracks have a 90s vibe, reminiscent of Saint Etienne or Lush. Others have a feel that can only be accurately described in horticultural terms: the blooming strings of the really lovely Broken Roses, or the sprinkles of xylophones that make Burning Man sound like, well, a Japanese garden.The balmy reverie is only briefly disrupted by Into Shadows’ brisker pace and mellifluous guitar runs, while Memory’s Underground brings another gentle tempo shift and Beatles-y strings. Unclouded is short on genuinely standout tracks, but it’s a becalming place to visit.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

A veteran explorer of the season (in 2020’s sparkling Winter Rituals EP with cellist Kate Ellis, and 2022’s starker New Christmas Rituals, with amplified fiddle-playing from André Bosman), Laura Cannell sets out on her best and darkest journey yet here, exploring the time of year when, as she writes on the liner notes, “joy and heartache try to exist together”.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Laura Cannell’s Brightly Shone the MoonNamed after the line in Good King Wenceslas before the cruel frosts arrive, Brightly Shone the Moon begins at the organ – a nod to Cannell’s childhood Christmases in the Methodist chapels and churches of Norfolk. Cannell’s fiddle then quivers around the 16th-century folk melody of O Christmas Tree/O Tannenbaum, as if the carol is swirling in a snowglobe, trying to settle in memory. All Ye Faithful follows, full of murky repetitions of the pre-chorus passages, where choirs usually sing “come let us adore him”. But here, love feels stuck, rooting around like an animal in the ground, a sonic reminder of how smothering and strenuous the winter can be for many.Beauty does appear elsewhere. The high melodies of Lost in a Merry Christmas seem to flurry around each other prettily in the air, then melt together. Bleak Midwinter has an urgent, icy rush to it, replacing melancholy with a frisky kind of hope. The apocalyptically titled Angels Falling from the Realms is the warmest of the lot, full of flickers of long-forgotten hymns magically appearing and disappearing. This is an album not for the party or the tree decorations, but one that carries you, hauntingly, through the passing of time, slips of ancient songs lighting the way like Christingles.Also out this monthAnna Pidgorna’s Invented Folksongs (Redshift) is the fascinating result of the Ukrainian-Canadian singer travelling to Ukraine to study with traditional music practitioners, then adopting folk idioms into her freewheeling, avant garde style. The album ranges from fabulous, feral power on tracks such as Drown in the Depth to urgent longing in What Else Can I Give Him?Released in time for Hanukkah,Michael WinogradPlays Tanz! (Borscht Beat) is a spirited live performance by virtuoso clarinettist Winograd of the long-celebrated 1955 klezmer album by Dave Tarras and the Musiker Brothers, which fused traditionally Ashkenazi Jewish instrumental music with jazz.Winter Wonderband’s Joy Illimited (self-released) brings together folk musicians Jennifer Crook, Maclaine Colston, Saul Rose and Beth Porter in the making of a mixed grab-bag of festive tunes. The best are takes on Shepherds Are the Cleverest Lads, learned from the Watersons, and Boo Hewerdine’s New Year’s Eve.Explore more on these topicsFolk musicFolk album of the monthreviewsShareReuse this content"

In Pelly’s account, the music streaming giant views music as a kind of nondescript sonic wallpaper, artists as an unnecessary encumbrance to the business of making more money and its target market not as music fans, but mindless drones who don’t really care what they’re listening to, ripe for manipulation by its algorithm. Sharp business practices and evidence of its deleterious effect on the quality and variety of new music abound: the worst thing is that Pelly can’t really come up with a viable alternative in a world where convenience trumps all.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

But it’s elevated to unmissable status by Mossman’s writing, which is so sparkling, witty and shrewd that your personal feelings about her subjects are rendered irrelevant amid the cocktail of self-awareness, affection and sharp analysis she brings to every encounter. In a world of music books retelling tired legends, Men of a Certain Age offers that rare thing: an entirely original take on rock history.Only God Can Judge Me: The Many Lives of Tupac ShakurJeff Pearlman(HarperCollins)Some posthumous accounts of rapper Tupac Shakur’s life have tended towards the hagiographic: better known as a writer on sport than music, Jeff Pearlman has written an incisive biography that reveals someone infinitely more complicated and contradictory than either the “thug” he was wont to portray himself as, or the saintly figure of the 2003 documentary Tupac: Resurrection. It suggests the persona he projected was carefully constructed: the young Shakur was actually a sensitive, geeky ballet student, albeit one from a very turbulent background. But his aspirations to a career in hip-hop coincided with the dominance of gangsta rap and he altered his approach accordingly: the saga of the mask gradually eating the face makes for grimly compelling reading.View image in fullscreenThe Tremolo DiariesJustin Currie(Simon & Schuster)The Tremolo Diaries opens with Del Amitri’s frontman in a dark place: diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, his partner in a care home following a stroke, his band bottom of the bill on a tour of the US – a country they once looked set to break – alongside an artist whose music he loathes. What follows is an extraordinarily frank exploration of illness, depression and life in a band whose members know that, while hardly struggling, their commercial heyday has long passed. Currie is perceptive, funny, winningly cantankerous company, disinclined to pull punches or graft a happy-ever-after narrative on to his story; you don’t have to know a note of his music to find The Tremolo Diaries richly rewarding.Love and Fury: The Extraordinary Life, Death and Legacy of Joe MeekDarryl W Bullock(Omnibus)Darryl Bullock died at the end of last year: the book he had just completed underlines what an authoritative chronicler of pop’s LGBTQ+ history he was. His biography of groundbreaking producer Joe Meek returns him to the territory of 2021’s fascinating The Velvet Mafia: The Gay Men Who Ran the Swinging Sixties, in which Meek featured heavily. The tragic figure behind the Tornados’ transatlantic chart-topper Telstar warrants deeper exploration not merely because he was a sonic genius but because he was so profoundly singular: openly gay, mentally unstable, mixed up with the Krays, obsessed with the occult and the extraterrestrial. Love and Fury proves that exhaustive research doesn’t preclude page-turning drama.To browse all music books included in the Guardian and Observer’s best books of 2025 visitguardianbookshop.com.

A new technology of super-fast pods revolutionises travel: launched into low orbit from spring-loaded podiums, they fly west and land again in minutes, regardless of distance. Since every action has an equal and opposite reaction, our globe starts to spin faster. Days contract, first by seconds, then minutes, and eventually hours. It’s a gonzo conceit, and Foster spells out the consequences, his richly rendered characters caught up in their own lives as the world spirals out of control. As days become six hours long, circadian rhythms go out of the window and oceans start to bulge at the equator. The increasing whirligig of the many strands of storytelling converge on their inevitable conclusion, with Foster’s sparky writing, clever plotting and biting wit spinning an excellent tale.View image in fullscreenWhen There Are Wolves AgainEJ Swift(Arcadia)There are few more pressing issues with which fiction can engage than the climate crisis, and SF, with its capacity to extrapolate into possible futures and dramatise the realities, is particularly well placed to do so. Swift’s superb novel is an eco-masterpiece. Its near-future narrative of collapse and recovery takes us from the rewilding of Chornobyl and the return of wolves to Europe, through setback and challenge, to 2070, a story by turns tragic, alarming, uplifting, poetic and ultimately hopeful. Swift’s accomplished prose and vivid characterisation connect large questions of the planet’s destiny with human intimacy and experience, and she avoids either a too-easy doomsterism or a facile techno-optimism. We can bring the world back from the brink, but it will require honesty, commitment, hard work and a proper sense of stewardship.LuminousSilvia Park (Magpie)This debut features humans with robotic body parts and robots with human consciousness in a vibrantly realised unified Korea. Ruijie, a schoolgirl afflicted with a degenerative disease, augments her human body with robot limbs scavenged from junk yards, where she meets a robot boy, Yoyo. We discover that Yoyo has two younger human siblings – but he is for ever 12 years old, and they are now adults. One is Detective Cho Jun, who is investigating the case of a missing robot: Jun, maimed in the course of duty, has had his body rebuilt as a cyborg. What starts as a YA school adventure grows into a more sophisticated piece of cyberpunk futurism that explores what it means to be human. An instant classic.View image in fullscreenIceJacek Dukaj, translated by Ursula Phillips (Head of Zeus)Published in Dukaj’s native Poland in 2007 to great acclaim, Ice has now been translated fluently into English by Ursula Phillips. And what a giant of a book it is: 1,200 pages of alternative history in which a mysterious alien incursion during the Tunguska event – the asteroid impact that hit Siberia in 1908 with a force about 1,000 times more powerful than the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki – has changed the direction of history. As the titular ice, a strange mutation of ordinary frozen water, spreads across a Russian empire that was never toppled by Communist revolution, Benedykt Gierosławski, a gambling addict and mathematical genius, must travel on the Orient Express from Poland into Siberia. He is in search of the father he believed he had lost, who it seems is able to communicate with the ice. Capacious, packed with invention and incident, set in a baroquely detailed world with a brilliantly chilly atmosphere, and featuring stimulating metaphysical exposition and kinetic and thrilling set pieces, this is a marvellous ice-palace of a novel.There Is No Antimemetics Divisionqntm (Del Rey)Donald Rumsfeld once distinguished between things we know, things we know we don’t know, and things we don’t know we don’t know, his “unknown unknowns”. qntm, the pseudonym of the British writer Sam Hughes, extrapolates this last idea into a blisteringly good, genuinely unnerving novel. “Memetics”, perhaps alien life forms, manifest in various ways in our world. They feed off our memories and devour information, making it impossible for anyone to remember encountering them. Their depredations upon humanity are countered by the titular Antimemetics Division, though it struggles against the near-impossible challenge. The author furnishes the story with a wealth of spookily weird creatures and episodes, and the sense of dread grows marvellously as it builds towards its startling ending. It’s the kind of novel that makes you reassess the actual world: after all, how can we be sure it isn’t actually true?To browse all of the Guardian’s best books of 2025, visitguardianbookshop.com.

Sarah Hesketh’s2016(CB Editions) is a fabulous example: it takes 12 interviews with a variety of anonymous individuals about the events of that year and presents fragments of the transcripts as prose poems. The cumulative effect of these voices is haunting and full of pathos, as “they vote for whoever, and their life stays exactly the same”.View image in fullscreenLuke Kennard and Nick Makoha also daringly remixed their source material and inspirations. The former’s latest collection,The Book of Jonah(Picador), moves the minor prophet out of the Bible into a world of arts conferences, where he is continually reminded that his presence everywhere is mostly futile. Makoha’sThe New Carthaginians(Penguin) turns Jean-Michel Basquiat’s idea of the exploded collage into a poetic device. The result? “The visible / making itself known by the invisible.”Leo Boix’sSouthernmost Sonnets(Chatto & Windus) celebrates a more familiar form as it weaves explorations of his native Latin America with ruminations on same-sex marriage. The combination is spellbinding throughout, the images simple yet vivid; Boix is a modern master of using the sonnet to illuminate “each day that passes, the hidden thread that binds us together”.View image in fullscreenPipping it to the Forward prize for best collection this year were two books, the first time the prize has rewarded two winners. Karen Solie’sWellwater(Picador) doesn’t just decry environmental catastrophe, it also focuses its gaze on the underlying economics that have brought us to this point. Her tone is refreshing, offering comfort only through its clarity: “Under the darkest night skies on Earth / an explanation is not forthcoming.” The other winner,Avidyāby Vidyan Ravinthiran (Bloodaxe), draws on the poet’s travels to the north of Sri Lanka, where his family are from, and his move to the US. As poems of journeys, they put me in mind at times of James Fenton, while Ravinthiran’s immersion in the English canon means linguistic delights throughout – “rivering, glitch-thronged, dubitable … belied, / believed, beloved”.View image in fullscreenIsabelle Baafi’sChaotic Good(Faber), a dissection of a toxic marriage that is at once playful and sharp, stood alone as the Forward prize’s best first collection. With lines such as “I guess the devil could have swallowed me / if I didn’t have all this ass”, these are poems that absolutely know their power and revel in it. Karen Downs‑Barton’s debutMinx(Chatto & Windus) was similarly eye-catching, unsparingly detailing both the poet’s time in the care system, and the wider discrimination she experienced coming from an Anglo-Romany background. Her use of Roma language in her poems adds an unexpected lushness to the often bleak content.View image in fullscreenThe most important anthology of the year wasNature Matters(Faber), edited by Mona Arshi and Karen McCarthy Woolf. In showcasing nature poetry by poets of colour, they both radically redefined what the subject could contain and put the political dimension of the environment front and centre. Meanwhile, the arrival ofThe Poems of Seamus Heaney(Faber) was a reminder of his still towering importance, 12 years after his death. Bringing together many previously uncollected poems, this book will be offering riches for years to come.This was a busy year for poet laureate Simon Armitage.New Cemeterymakes use of fast-flowing tercets to reflect on death, whileDwell(both Faber) is the inverse, a joyful testimony to how animals might still thrive in a human-dominated world. And there were two very welcome returns. Gillian Allnutt’s 10th collection,Lode(Bloodaxe), plays with time and memory in works that feel prayer-like in their intimacy and simplicity, while inForetokens(Chatto & Windus) Sarah Howe adds a bracing anger to her always elegant poems, giving them an unexpected fierceness.One collection above all others stayed with me this year. Richard Scott’s second book,That Broke Into Shining Crystals(Faber), is astonishing in how it handles the hardest of subjects, trauma and its aftermath, and finds beauty within. While the bold remixing of Andrew Marvell’s To His Coy Mistress would be achievement enough, the ekphrastic poems inspired by a variety of still lives are some of the best examples of the technique I’ve ever read, connecting pain to painting in ways that mesmerise: “So much crisp hurt in these / blue petals. And always the bloom’s corolla as a schoolboy’s face.” It stands as one of the bravest and most brilliant collections of this or any year.To browse all poetry books included in the Guardian’s best books of 2025, visitguardianbookshop.com.

Now it’s out, all the drama surrounding it seems superfluousAlyssa MercanteFri 5 Dec 2025 10.04 ESTLast modified on Fri 5 Dec 2025 10.08 ESTShareOn 25 November, award-winning Italian developer Santa Ragione, responsible for acclaimed titles such as MirrorMoon EP and Saturnalia,revealed that its latest project, Horses, had been banned from Steam - the largest digital store for PC games. A week later, another popular storefront, Epic Games Store, also pulled Horses, right before its 2 December launch date. The game was also briefly removed from the Humble Store, but was reinstated a day later.The controversy has helped the game rocket to the top of the digital stores thatareselling it, namely itch.io and GOG. But the question remains – why was it banned? Horses certainly delves into some intensely controversial topics (a content warning at the start details, “physical violence, psychological abuse, gory imagery, depiction of slavery, physical and psychological torture, domestic abuse, sexual assault, suicide, and misogyny”) and is upsetting and unnerving.View image in fullscreenControversial … Horses.Photograph: Santa RagioneThe plot is fairly simple, though it turns dark fast. You play as Anselmo, a 20-year-old Italian man sent to spend the summer working on a farm to build character. It’s revealed almost immediately (so fast in fact, that I let out a surprised “Ha!”) that the farm Anselmo has been sent to is not a normal one. The “horses” held there are not actually horses, but nude humans wearing horse heads that appear to be permanently affixed.Your job is to tend to the garden, the “horses” and the “dog” (who is a human wearing a dog head). Anselmo performs menial, frustratingly slow everyday tasks across Horses’ three-ish hour runtime, like chopping wood and picking vegetables. These monotonous tasks are, however, interspersed with horrible and unsettling jobs. On day one, you find a “horse” body hanging from a tree and have to help the farmer bury it.It’s disturbing, yes, but Horses doesn’t show most of these horrors playing out, and when it does, the simplistic, crude graphics dull its edges (when you encounter the farmer whipping a human “horse” and have to throw hydrogen peroxide on her back, the marks crisscrossing her skin are blurry and unreal).View image in fullscreenUnsettling … Horses.Photograph: Santa RagioneThe “horses’” genitals and breasts are blurred out. The enslaved are forbidden from fornicating, but you’ll find that they do that anyway (a simplistic, animalistic depiction of sex), and though you’re forced to “tame” them by putting them back in their pen, it’s just a button press to interact, with no indication of what you’ve actually done to them.Valve, the company that owns Steam,told PC Gamerthat Horses’ content was reviewed back in 2023. “After our team played through the build and reviewed the content, we gave the developer feedback about why we couldn’t ship the game on Steam, consistent with our onboarding rules and guidelines,” the statement read. “A short while later the developer asked us to reconsider the review, and our internal content review team discussed that extensively and communicated to the developer our final decision that we were not going to ship the game on Steam.”According toIGN, Epic Games Store told developer Santa Ragione: “We are unable to distribute Horses on the Epic Games Store because our review found violations of the Epic Games Store Content Guidelines, specifically the ‘Inappropriate Content’ and ‘Hateful or Abusive Content’ policies.” Santa Ragione alleges that “no specifics on what content was at issue were provided.”Horses’ gameplay is grotesque, not gratuitous. The horror is psychological and lies in the incongruity of performing menial tasks in a veritable hellscape, while having no idea why any of this is going on. There is barely any sound aside from the constant whirring of a film camera (the game is presented like a mostly silent Italian arthouse film), super-up-close shots of mouths moving as they talk or chew, unsettling character models, the occasional cut to a real-life shot of water pouring in a glass or slop filling up a dog bowl.There is no explicit gore or violence. You are uncomfortable, frustrated and unnerved throughout, and the horrors of humanity are on full display, but nothing ever threatens to upend your lunch. It is an interesting meditation on violence and power dynamics, but it is by no means a shocking or radical game. The conversation that has ignited around it – about video games as art and the censorship of art – is proving to be more profound than the actual content of the game.Explore more on these topicsGamesIndie gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But how do writers set about reanimating cherished characters in an entirely new medium?Del Aguila said: “When I was commissioned to adapt Dog Man my son was in fourth grade and extremely well versed in the books, so it was incredibly helpful to have a young expert at the breakfast table every morning.”The Emmy-winning writer and actor, whose credits include stage versions of Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Click, Clack, Moo and Pilkey’s Cat Kid Comic Club, said for him “it all comes down to tone”.View image in fullscreenDav Pilkey, the author of the bestselling Dog Man graphic novels, said the musical ‘surpassed my highest expectations’.Photograph: Ben Gabbe/Getty Images“If the show doesn’t feel like the books, the audience will revolt. They’re going to have quibbles no matter what – ‘that guy doesn’t look like the character in the book’ or ‘that character doesn’t speak the way I heard them in my head’ – but if you capture the sensibility of the books, I’ve found they can forgive all of that and go for the ride.”Children, he said, felt a particular ownership of the Dog Man universe because the books felt gleefully unsupervised by adults. It was that sense of “fun anarchy” the team wanted to capture. Pikey himself, he added, was remarkably hands-off.“He had only one stipulation when we started writing the show: Dog Man can’t talk. And if you’ve ever been told that the beloved title character of the musical you’re writing can only bark, you’ll understand the deep terror we felt. But we embraced the challenge and got inventive.”View image in fullscreenThe stage production of My Neighbour Totoro.Photograph: Manuel Harlan/RSC, with Nippon TVJessica Swale, whose Paddington: The Musical at the Savoy theatre in Londonpremiered to rave reviews, said she began by reading and watching every book and film about the bear before “putting them all to one side and asking the hard questions – why this story, why now, and why on stage?”Swale wanted to create a version that “celebrated theatricality” rather than simply transplanted the films to the stage. She added characters and shifted the story to embrace stagecraft – flying, magic, choreography.A central question for Swale was what Paddington’s journey meant to modern Londoners: “This little bear arriving without a home or a family, on a lifeboat, to a city where he hopes people extend him kindness.” At the same time, she had to keep the story timeless: “The hybrid Volvo gag died an early death.”Perhaps the greatest challenge was structural. “Traditionally, the lead character has a fatal flaw which shapes the story arc – the pompous character falls from grace, the greedy guy learns to share,” she said.But Paddington, eternally good and kind, resists that model. So instead, Swale focused on giving the Browns and the ensemble characters their own flaw that they overcame through learning from Paddington. “Judy combats her embarrassment, Mr Brown learns to embrace risk and Mr Curry learns to embrace people (or bears) from outside his neighbourhood,” she said.For Tom Morton-Smith, who adapted the 1988 Studio Ghibli fantasy My Neighbour Totoro for the RSC, first at the Barbican, where it won six Olivier awards, then the West End, immersion was also the key.He already knew the film, written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki, “but I just watched it over and over”. Working in translation, he said, offered a degree of freedom: he could deviate from the original text while still honouring its spirit.“What I knew was most important was not slavishly sticking to the original but finding a way to conjure the same atmospheres and feelings that the film provokes,” he said.View image in fullscreenAbbey Norman (Sophie) and Alan Atkins (Tiger) in The Tiger Who Came To Tea at the Vaudeville theatre in London.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian“I hope what we’ve achieved is a piece that feels in its bones like Totoro, not a hollow facsimile. It’s about finding the essence of what Miyazaki and Ghibli created and crafting something new – with the same rigour and attention – but using the tools of live theatre.”In Totoro, he added, the human characters were crucial. “There are beautiful, spiritual, sometimes surreal creatures in the story, but the audience meets them through the eyes of the family. So we had to land those dynamics. If the human characters felt too cartoonish, the forest spirits wouldn’t work at all.”View image in fullscreenPaddington: the Musical at the Savoy theatre in London.Photograph: Mike Marsland/WireImageMorton-Smith spoke of the “huge responsibility” of taking on such a beloved story. “If I’ve done my job properly, people won’t be aware that I’ve done anything at all.”For smaller companies, however, the challenges often begin long before the script: budgets, rights and the legal labyrinth of what is – and isn’t – in the public domain.Siblings Jonathan and Lucy Kaufman, whose recent adaptations include The Tales of Beatrix Potter for Spontaneous Productions in south London, say they are usually restricted to works already out of copyright.“Specific challenges we’ve faced include thinking Beatrix Potter’s stories were in the public domain and discovering they weren’t,” Lucy Kaufman said. “Luckily, we found out in time and obtained the rights. Another was writing a climactic chase scene involving 11 characters but only five actors – an exercise in logistics.”Adaptations now account for more than half of UK theatre box office takings. A recent British Theatre Consortium report found that venues were increasingly programming familiar titles to rebuild audiences after the Covid crisis. In 2023,adaptations made up 40.8% of all performances, up from 35.6% in 2019.“As a writer, I’d always prefer to create original plays,” Jonathan Kaufman said. “But because well-known stories tend to sell, my challenge is to transform familiar material into something new, engaging and – above all – relevant to modern audiences.”Explore more on these topicsTheatreSouthbank CentreChildren's books: 7 and underChildren's theatreLondonChildren and teenagersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It all makes for a smartly unexpected festive story. It’s 1999, ticking down to the millennium. At the Woolworths staff party in Oxford (paper hats, sensible shop-floor shoes), Zoya (Gurjot Dhaliwal) chirrups about the wonder of Woolies and her scathing colleague Iqra (Prabhleen Oberoi) scoffs that she has been radicalised. Both Pakistani-born – Iqra is a politics student, Zoya a young wife – they bop and plan their futures, until they are joined by Faiza (Hannah Khalique-Brown), a mysterious holiday temp who knows more about them than seems plausible.Iqra initially describes the newcomer as “BBCD” (“British-born confused desi”). “British Pakistanis are fascinating specimens,” she sighs. But who is Faiza? A management stooge or spy for Zoya’s in-laws? Or something far stranger? Even as the friends share secrets of the Pic ’n’ Mix, simple questions open up a chasm of anxiety – on the tight square stage, the space between the three actors is tense and watchful. Secrets and surprises start to spill like a scatter of toffees.View image in fullscreenSupernatural stylings … Gurjot Dhaliwal, Hannah Khalique-Brown and Prabhleen Oberoi.Photograph: Alex BrennerAs in his award-winningBrown Boys Swim, Khan upends the dreaming spires version of Oxford usually favoured in fiction. His is a real city of unglamorous work and a strong British Asian community. Iqra seems unsettled at Brasenose College, while Zoya is saving for a return to Rawalpindi. Faiza has spent her whole life in Oxford, but, she says, “it never really felt like my city”.Sparkily performed and staged beneath a trio of bauble wreaths (design by Maariyah Sharjil), Adam Karim’s production swoops on the supernatural stylings: spooky lighting, woozy yule tunes, snowglobes that oddly lack snow.In Dickens, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come is the decisive figure in Scrooge’s transformation. Here, an emissary from the future is enmeshed in conversations about what lies ahead, which can become wheel-spinningly circular in the second half. The future is all questions. Will dreams be fulfilled, friendship endure? Will Britain finally embrace its Muslim citizens? These aren’t straightforward questions.

As the opening night of this production hysterically demonstrated, the possibility for chaos thanks to the ephemeral nature of live theatre is reason enough.That ephemerality created a sequence of events that saw: a cast member (Simeon Truby as Inspector Kemp) join the audience to watch the show, a stage manager announce there would be a pause in the action – leaving Inspector Kemp ad-libbing for all he was worth – and then another member of stage management arrive to tell the audience, “just wait here and … entertain yourselves”. Someone did eventually remember a cast member had been left adrift and Truby was rescued. Then we were told that Inga (Julie Yammanee) had suffered an injury and that Jessica Wright, from the ensemble, would be stepping into Inga’s shoes. Within minutes she performed an astoundingly accomplished tap dance routine. What other medium gives you such moments?Who else but Mel Brooks can give you a story that is at once pastiche and homage to the original? His book, co-written with Thomas Meehan, tells the tale of Shelley’s famed doctor’s grandson travelling to Transylvania to claim the castle which is his inheritance. He discovers his grandfather’s experiment and attempts to rekindle the spark of life in a new monster.How Does Santa Go Down the Chimney? review – have yourself a merry little rumpusRead moreThe story descends into chaos and becomes less relevant as the action goes on. It is all about the set pieces.Director Nick Winston’s background as a choreographer is clear and there is a slickness to this production that belies its fringe theatre beginnings. While it looks impressive, it feels there is a heft missing, the comedy not mined as much as it could be – the sequence with a revolving wall, iconic when Gene Wilder performed it, becomes leaden in the hands of Daniel Brocklebank’s Dr Frederick Frankenstein. As Igor, Curtis Patrick attempts the impossible task of following Marty Feldman in the movie role and his over-gurning sets him up to fail, but as he owns the role he becomes ever more watchable. By the time Pete Gallagher’s Monster reveals his erudition, the ordered chaos has become irresistible and hysterical and truly alive.AtLiverpool Playhouseuntil 3 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreMel BrooksreviewsShareReuse this content"

The Man Like Mobeen star talks about interfaith Christmas … and why he refuses to go back to LaplandStuart HeritageFri 5 Dec 2025 08.00 ESTShareGuz Khan is developing something of a reputation as Mr Christmas. The comedian and actor is about to release Stuffed, a Lapland-set one-hour comedy co-starring Morgana Robinson. This time last year, he voiced a reindeer in the Richard Curtis animation That Christmas. Two years before that, he made a festive special with James Acaster testing the scientific validity of Home Alone.“It sounds like, based on all the projects you’ve just listed there, Christmas paid for the extension on my house,” Khan booms down the phone. “Christmas is way better than Eid, bro, based on the facts that you’ve just given me.”But if Stuffed represents Khan’s latest endeavour to become the face of Christmas, it’s one he seems slightly apprehensive about. If you’re familiar with his work, you’ll know how successfully he uses his garrulous personality and clusterbombing of the term “bro” (I count 46 uses in our interview) to camouflage a much more thoughtful intellect.And Stuffed is definitely a departure. At this stage, Khan is best known forMan Like Mobeen, the peerless sitcom about life around Birmingham’s criminal underbelly he co-created with writer Andy Milligan. And despite being written by Milligan, Stuffed has a lot less bite. The story of a hard-up dad who uses his Christmas bonus to take his family on the holiday of a lifetime, only to realise that it was paid in error and has to be returned, is a broad, big-hearted family affair. Like all good Christmas shows, it balances humour with a sweet undercurrent of melancholy.View image in fullscreenLooks like reindeer … Khan with Morgana Robinson as Hannah in Stuffed.Photograph: Janne-Pekka Manninen/BBC/Baby Cow“Was it all right?” he asks, nervously. “You never know when you make something. I never thought we’d ever be in this kind of slot. There’s lots of things that come along with doing a Christmas special.”How so? “A lot of the work I get asked to do is like: ‘Come in and do your thing.’ I just did season two ofThe Gentlemen, and it was such a fun week. There’s no rules. You can go absolutely crazy,” he explains. “But this was a little bit different. You have to follow some guidelines. And so it was a really good challenge for me. Where I’d usually express myself with dialogue, I had to try and get the same feeling with an expression.”Getting to film in Lapland must have been special, though. “Most of it was made just off a roundabout in Reading, bro,” he replies, breaking the spell somewhat. “But when we did go to Lapland, I realised that somewhere deep down within me, my genetics were warning me about going to a country so cold. It’s everything you can imagine: really beautiful, lovely people. But my brown arse will never enter that place ever again. Unless the sequel is changed to somewhere warm with a beautiful beach, I’m out.”What Stuffed does achieve, however, is something quietly groundbreaking. “I don’t know if at Christmastime there have been many depictions of interfaith couples,” he says. The central relationship in Stuffed is the marriage between Robinson’s Hannah (who celebrates Christmas) and Khan’s Arslan (who, as a Muslim, participates with a detached bewilderment). This element is buried deep inside the show, but it’s definitely there.View image in fullscreenBro life … Khan as Mobeen with Tolu Ogunmefun as Nate  and Salman Akhtar as Saj in Man Like Mobeen.Photograph: Paul Husband/BBC/Tiger Aspect“It’s a really interesting dynamic,” says Khan. “They just live a normal life. There’s nothing aggy, nothing stressful. It’s all the stuff that any couple would go through. And for me and Andy, especially on Man Like Mobeen, so many people would say: ‘Isn’t that groundbreaking?’ We were like, ‘Not really.’ It’s just normal life. I suppose a lot of the country will tune in and be like: ‘OK, maybe that’s the first time I’ve seen it.’ Maybe it’ll piss some people off. And you know, that’s also part of the journey.”It’s smart that you’re not underestimating the British public’s ability to be pissed off, I say. “Like my old mate Stephen Yaxley-Lennon,” he booms. “I’m gonna send him a link! I’m going to send him an early viewing link! I talk to him a lot on Instagram, so I might be like: ‘Steve, this one’s for you, baby boy.’”Outside of his ongoing Christmas fixation, this has been another big year in a long succession of big years for Khan. In May, he released the final season of Man Like Mobeen, the show that made his name. And it’s testament to the show’s quality that it went out with the best run of episodes yet. Over the years, what started as a street-smart, silly sitcom about a former drug dealer gradually sharpened its edges. Life got harder for the characters. There was a death. By the end, the show resembled a thriller as much as a comedy.View image in fullscreenBling bling … Khan as Chucky in The Gentlemen.Photograph: TCD/Alamy“I feel like a personal responsibility that it wasn’t like Only Fools, right?” he says of the ending. “You don’t all end up with winning the lottery. In Small Heath and the West Midlands, we have some of the most dangerous levels of crime that we’ve seen on record. And to present Mobeen as like: ‘Oh yeah, what an amazing guy,’ you can’t do that. It’s a bad life. It’s a life that will ruin you, and you’ll lose the people closest to you, so we always wanted to keep that sense. I never want a kid to watch the show and be like: ‘I want to be like Mobeen.’ I want you to have the friendships that they’ve got, but I certainly don’t want you to have the lifestyle.”Is this definitively the end? “It feels right for me personally, because that was based on one stage of my life from 20 years ago,” he says. “But now, with the size of my waist and all the good food that comes along with this game, I don’t feel like I’m the right guy to be telling the stories of Small Heath or any inner-city, working-class area. I want to see Girl Like Mobeen. I want to see that next generation. I still feel like bringing it to an end is the right thing. But we can never say never. I’d love to see what those characters look like in their late 50s, if we’re all still alive. So, yeah, definitely a special out there, but you never want to outstay your welcome.”If anything, 2026 looks like it might be a bigger year still. As well as The Gentlemen, and an unscripted show entitled Guz Khan’s Custom Cars, there is one project he seems especially excited about:Riz Ahmed’s upcoming Prime Video comedy Bait.“Riz is very excited about it, too,” he says. A show about a struggling actor thrust into an existential crisis after landing the role of a lifetime, the series was created by Ahmed, and at first glance sounds fairly autobiographical. “It’s the first time he’s created a show in nearly 27 years of acting, and it’s dropping next year,” continues Khan, who will play Ahmed’s cousin. “It’s his life story, and it’s an absolute honour to be part of it. He’s so proud that he gets to tell his story. And it blew my mind, bro, because when we were filming it, I was just talking about the context of making a show. And he turned to me, put his hand on my shoulder, and he went: ‘Bro, I’ve been doing this for 27 years, and until now no one has ever asked me to do my own show. Just remember how lucky you were.”View image in fullscreenForest life … Khan with Judi Love in Outsiders.Photograph: Steve Peskett/UKTVLooking at Khan’s career so far, it’s hard to get a full sense of scale. He’s made his own show, and balanced it with roles in ever bigger international projects, such as Andy Samberg’s animated comedy Digman! and Rebel Wilson’s upcoming movie Girl Group. And, as previously stated, he has now become the walking image of Christmas incarnate. Does he even have any ambitions left?“You know, fundamentally, what I have to do is raise these kids,” he says of his five children, who range from 11 months to 14 years old. “Now you mention it, though, you got me thinking. I worked with Idris Elba after only performing for a couple of years, and Pedro Pascal. I got tospend a week in a forestwith Judi Love. Bro, my life is beyond crazy. But for as long as it lasts, for as long as this crazy rollercoaster we’re all on continues to go, I just want to work with good people and catch good vibes. And I’ve been very lucky so far, whether it’s stuff that I’ve created or whether I’ve been asked to go and do it. Just keep having fun with it, bro. And that’s the biggest thing. I’m not worried about Hollywood. We’re just trying to have fun, bro, for however long this theme park carries on.”Stuffed is on BBC One on 23 December at 9pm.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionGuz KhanDramaTV comedyComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sign up hereGwilym MumfordFri 5 Dec 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 5 Dec 2025 12.01 ESTShareWe’ve just inched into December, which of course meansChristmaslist season. Already, five days in, plenty of publications have shared their cultural best-ofs for 2025 – you can read the Guardian’sbest booksandsongsof the year right now, with our countdowns in TV, film and music coming very soon.Meanwhile, many of you will have been bombarded on social media by screengrabs of your colleagues/friends/enemies’ Spotify Wrapped playlists (though Mood Machine author Liz Pelly has written pretty convincingly aboutwhy you shouldn’t share yours). This year’s Wrapped includes a “listening age” feature, which uses the release dates of the music you streamed to determine how horribly out-of-date your tastes are – revealing to some users thatthey are, in fact, centenarians.But there is, of course, no shame in taking a break from the deluge of new releases to catch some forgotten or not-forgotten classics. So in this week’s Guide we’re sharing some of the best non-2025 culture we watched, listened to, read or played in 2025 …FilmView image in fullscreenDeadly cool … Alain Delon in Le Samouraï.Photograph: Roland GrantFuelled by the appreciation for old films onLetterboxdand podcasts like Blank Check and The Big Picture, revival houses or repertory cinemas are having a moment on both sides of the Atlantic. I had a great time watching Jean-Pierre Melville’s noir classicLe Samouraï(available to stream on Prime Video, amazingly), with Alain Delon slinking about Paris in a trenchcoat on the big screen. And was pretty blown away seeing Billy Wilder’sThe Lost Weekend(available to rent on most streaming services) for the first time, a movie that may have received a bit of a viewing bump through the Oscars success of Anora, which joined The Lost Weekend in being one of four Palme d’Or winners to go on to win best picture (The other two? Parasite, of course, and 1955’sMarty, which is still on my to-view list.)In a big year for Richard Linklater (he has two films, Blue Moon and Nouvelle Vague, now out in the US), I revisited his breakthrough,Slacker(sadly not on streaming, but the DVD is pretty widely available). A trippy amble round early 90s Austin, Texas, in which you encounter a series of often defiantly odd (and defiantly unemployed) characters, it’s a film I absolutely loved in my own Slackerish early 20s, but worried I might have grown out of today. Not a bit of it: it’s still completely mesmerising, a world that you want to climb through the screen and live in.GMTelevisionWith Adolescence dominating this year’s TV landscape, I stumbled on an old British drama with a lot of parallels:Jake’s Progress(Channel 4), Alan Bleasdale’s 1995 drama about a dysfunctional middle-class Liverpool family struggling to deal with a pyromaniac child. It is quite of its time – both the acting and the score are grand – but it is compelling and, like all of Bleasdale’s stuff, it avoids the easy and cliched for something perceptive and lived-in.Meanwhile, while we already did a pretty exhaustive deep dive into theold documentaries available on streamingearlier this year in the Guide, there’s one more non-2025 documentary on iPlayer that I want to flag, though it is a bit of a cheat really: S4C docFfa Coffi Pawb!was released just eight days before 2025 began. It’s worth a look though, offering up an exhaustive, entertaining account of the DIY, defiantly anti-commercial Welsh language music scene that bubbled up in the 1980s, and launched the career of a young Gruff Rhys (later of Super Furry Animals fame). The archive footage is brilliant: clips of sweaty gigs in the back rooms of north Walian pubs, and a clip of a pre-puberty Rhys telling a Welsh chatshow host about the punk fanzine he just made. Fantastic.GMMusicView image in fullscreenZamrock reborn … The revamped lineup of Witch.Photograph: PRReading an article by an indie record label boss on the desperate state of the industry is an unlikely way of discovering some music, but Jagjaguwar founder Darius Van Arman’spiece for Stereogumdid introduce me to a great record his label put out in their early days:Drunk’s A Derby Spiritual(1996), a backwoods indie-folk album sat somewhere between Bonnie Prince Billy and Neutral Milk Hotel, which Van Arman says has received a grand total of $100 in streams in the 15 years it has been on Spotify. Bleak! Give it a listen.Elsewhere, thenew albumby Zamrock veteransWitchgot me digging into their 70s heyday. Their self-titled album, the last one before they splintered and became a disco group, is full ofgreat, summery, psych-tinged tunes. Finally, the best “needle drop” in a film this year came in One Battle After Another, asSteely Dan’sDirty Worksoundtracked an extremely stoned Leo attending a parent-teacher meeting. Between all these, my “listening age” must be hovering around the late 60s.GMskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sardonic, cutting and aggressively clever, Moore’s collection pokes fun at the self-help genre through stories written in the second person imperative, with titles like How to Be an Other Woman, How to Talk to Your Mother (Notes), and The Kid’s Guide to Divorce. Witty wordplay and experimental chronology mark out these stories exploring womanhood, relationships, illness, family and loss.

The warm-up DJ drops Fetty Wap’s 2014 smash Trap Queen, and the young crowd, a fair portion of whom were in primary school when the tune first came out, roar every word. They’re clad in baggy skatewear, with distressed, monochromatic union jacks plastered across hats and jackets. A coat sails across the room: someone is going home chilly tonight, but that’ll be the last thing on their mind as Liverpool rapper EsDeeKid, one of the fastest-rising musicians in the world, explodes on to the stage.Wrapped in a hooded cloak and spinning like a twig in a hurricane, he grabs the mic and snarls: “Are you ready for rebellion?”, his distinctive scouse accent battling a storm of apocalyptic bass and John Carpenter-esque horror synths. Behind him, projections flash in stark black and red – tower blocks, eyeballs, dot-matrix geometries – more like the ragged photocopy aesthetic of 80s post-punk than any luxury rap branding. The teenagers in the room are ecstatic, borne aloft by the palpable sense, thrumming from stage to pit, that this is A Moment.They are right. Two weeks after the show, EsDeeKid’s breakthrough single Phantom, one minute and 50 seconds of gothic inner-city pressure, crashes into the UK Top 20. Despite having only started to release music in 2024, the masked, anonymous rapper has more than 10m monthly Spotify listeners. By the end of November, his debut album, Rebel, was Spotify’s most streamed hip-hop album in the world; his latest single, Century, reached the UK Top 10. As he maintains silence in the press, wild conspiracy theories have circulated, including one suggestinghe was the US actor Timothée Chalametmoonlighting as a self-proclaimed“council house rat”from Liverpool. EsDeeKid has neither confirmed it, nor denied.To the outside world his rise seemed to happen overnight. But EsDeeKid is part of a new movement that has been gradually emerging – with a recent rush in momentum – from all corners of the UK. After grime shifted to road rap in the mid-00s, and the rise ofUK drill and Afroswingin the mid-2010s, this is the latest evolution of homegrown rap culture. And while UK rappers such as Dave, Stormzy and Central Cee still sell out arenas, and Aitch charms the masses on I’m a Celebrity, these new artists are starting to rival them for popularity while having considerably more edge.The kids at Electric Ballroom are friendly and eager to talk, and they all call the new sound “underground” rap. I chat with Billy, one of three lads who have come down from Birmingham, and he reels off a list of artists who are pushing the scene forward: “Lancey Foux, Fimiguerrero, Len, EsDeeKid, Rico Ace, Fakemink, Jim Legxacy. Underground is exciting – it keeps getting more and more experimental.”Pinning down the underground sound is tricky. Upcoming rapper Ceebo describes it as capturing the zeitgeist: “Constant stimulation – dopamine overload.” Fizzing, lo-fi tracks come and go in under two minutes, with everything cranked into the red. Crucially, Britishness is in the foreground, with older UK tracks used for samples, regional accents flourishing, and lyrics as likely to concern getting messy in small market towns as they are to imitate US gangster rap.View image in fullscreenPushing the scene forward … Fakemink.Photograph: PR IMAGEThe scene has spread through TikTok, Discord groups, Instagram and, most importantly, live shows of increasing size, something police forces often made impossible for earlier generations of drill and grime artists. (Many would argue the reason the underground scene hasn’t been similarly policed is because there is a higher proportion of white and/or middle class kids involved, both as artists and punters.) Promoters such as Aux (who also runs EsDeeKid’s label) have become serious players in the live space, packing out regular showcases with hordes of young fans who, numbed by the overwhelming flood of social media, crave the chaotic, tangible joy of mosh pits and massive speakers.Now, with US rap in the doldrums – in October there were no rap songs on the US Hot 100 for the first time since 1990 – fans across the Atlantic are starting to pay attention to this maxed-out music. We may be witnessing the start of a new British Invasion: another star of the UK underground, Fakemink, was pictured hanging with Clipse and Andre 3000 in Los Angeles in November, and played Tyler, the Creator’s festival there. “I’m a huge advocate of what’s going on in the underground,” says Kenny Allstar, the BBC’s chief rap DJ and arguably the foremost authority on British rap. “The next generation are here.”While the scene’s biggest shows have taken place in London, the sound has spread rapidly across the country, drawing in kids from suburban towns in much the same way as punk did in the 1970s. Ledbyher, one of the few rising female artists in the scene, grew up in a council house in Norfolk, and listened to US rap until she was introduced to UK drill by a school friend and learned you could rap convincingly in an English accent.“Where drill might have been a very niche aspect of London life, the underground is commenting on a life that more of us find ourselves in,” she says, while on tour around the UK. “The underground now, its lyrics relate to people growing up in High Wycombe or wherever – it’s a commentary on British life.” Originally coining the phrase “bedroom drill” for her sound, her tracks deal with relationships, dreams and depression – “Step into my wreck of a ship / I don’t even know whose wreckage it is,” she raps on her Bad News freestyle, a hazy, rainy cut that nods as much to trip-hop as trap.“The producers might be from Scotland, Ireland; you have people from Canterbury,” she says, and points out that YT, another of the scene’s leading lights, attended an institution not generally known as an engine room for British rap: the University of Oxford. “There’s not one place the scene is from.”But everyone acknowledges one artist who has been fundamental to its growth. “Lancey Foux is a trailblazer,” says Allstar. “He started in 2015, and couldn’t be boxed in: not drill, or Afroswing, or trap. He was more outlandish with his approach to the music, using heavy melodic vibes with distorted beats. It created a new wave.”He points to Foux’s skittering, chiming 2015 track About It. “It was like nothing we’d seen before. At that stage it didn’t have its own genre – you just knew which artists fitted the sound as they didn’t fit into any other mould. But if you went up to these artists and said, ‘Are you underground?’ they’d probably say no.”View image in fullscreenPunk aesthetic … Lancey Foux.Photograph: Elissa SalasRaised in Stratford, London by Ugandan parents, Foux, who turned 30 this week, agrees. He has consistently worked with the kind of woozy Day-Glo rap beats used by US megastars such as Playboi Carti and Travis Scott, with injections of UK slang, rhythms and bass, making a druggy-sounding, nocturnal music at odds with much of UK rap’s social realism. In 2024 he started collaborating with a raft of new talent, on singles such as the 15m-streaming Black & Tan with YT, and the Conglomerate mixtape with Fimiguerrero and Len, which reached the UK Top 30. These projects signalled a shift away from the nihilism of drill to a weirder space, but as with most trailblazers, Foux is not keen on being boxed in by genre.“The term ‘underground’, it’s very restrictive!” Foux calls me, he says from LA, where he’s shooting videos for his forthcoming album. “EsDeeKid is one of the biggest UK artists, so why would you call him underground? This shit is big! YT, Fimi and EsDeeKid have bigger songs than other rappers in the UK. Not to say underground is a bad word – but this is our opportunity to name our sound, and I’m calling it the overground.”View image in fullscreenSpirit of defiance … Jim Legxacy.Photograph: Igoris TarranCrucially, as with mod, punk or Britpop, the scene top-loads on Britishness. The songs are full of British samples – everything from Bizarre Inc’s rave classic Playing with Knives on the track Ayia Napa by west Londoner Feng, to flashes of decades-old Dizzee Rascal vocals on the latest Ceebo record. Jim Legxacy’s latest mixtape is titled Black British Music (2025), and Afrosurrealist’s debut album is called Buy British. In a spirit of defiance against the far-right appropriation of the union jack, artists have been plastering British flags all over their artwork. “I think I would die if I had to leave this country,” rapper Llondon Actress croons on his biggest hit Country, its artwork fringed with more union jacks.Jim Legxacy: Black British Music review | Alexis Petridis’s album of the weekRead moreDirector Lauzza has a YouTube channel featuring music videos he has made for scene leaders Jim Legxacy, YT, Foux and others. He explains that the scene is trying to take control of the meaning of Britishness.“A lot of young people are not the most patriotic,” he says. “They’re not proud of the economic mess of a country that they’re living in. So to be able to reinvent the union jack to mean something new, creating our own Britain and our own culture that we can be proud of, that feels right.” But none of the rappers are using England’s St George’s flag. “English is more ethnicity, whereas British is more of a culture,” Lauzza says. “That’s why Jim [Legxacy] is able to use the flag and talk about being British – he’s representing something.”This played out in the recent video Lauzza and Jim made for the track ‘06 Wayne Rooney. Responding to Legxacy’s attempt to create a nostalgic indie-rock track ready for Match of the Day, Lauzza recreated the aesthetics of a mid-00s Fifa video game, complete with Jim in a pixelated Manchester United kit. It was a heady rush of UK nostalgia, and for the 24-year-old Lauzza, a response to the country’s current misery.“The news is just negative, negative, negative: it can be very draining for the average young person,” he says. “We’re all just reaching for the last time we remember being truly happy, when you could come home from school and slap on Fifa and nothing else mattered. These artists are the same age as a lot of these fans – and their music is about a lot of similar struggles.”Not everyone is as comfortable with the use of flag iconography. Ceebo has just released Blair Babies, his third mixtape in as many years, featuring three tracks produced by the ever-influential Legxacy. On tracks such as Jook, Ceebo grapples with growing up skint in Brixton over a beat that has a soft, magical glow, creating a curious tension between the sweetness of nostalgia and the reality of inner-city life. And as the title Blair Babies suggests, he is exploring Britain’s recent past with a critical eye.“I have a lot of conversations about Britishness,” he says. “A lot of us are children of immigrants. We’re not considered British, but we’re not exactly natives of our parents’ countries. So the idea of being Black British has become more visible in our generation’s minds; the exploration of ‘British’ as a term for children of countries that have been ravaged by British colonialism is the scene’s way of wrestling with an identity that hasn’t really been laid out for them.”Ceebo is ambivalent about the prevalence of the flag in the scene. “A lot of artists want to have their cake and eat it,” he says with a sigh. “But they’re not smart enough to walk the line between reclaiming something and just appropriating it. It’s essentially a symbol of violence.”View image in fullscreenWalking the line … Ceebo.Photograph: Patrick SearHe reflects on the fact that his music is now being listened to by white suburban kids around the country. “Whether or not people from the underground realise it, we are shaping the youth of this country’s thoughts and feelings towards Black Britishness. We have to approach it as a dialogue with the people who are consuming it, and this matters a lot more than hype moments.”But as that hype snowballs, and more and more rappers jump on the kind of distorted rap beats Lancey Foux popularised, on his new record Foux himself is taking a left turn into dance music. His argument for doing so sums up the spirit that has inspired this generation. “Whenever they start loving you too much for how you look and how you sound and how you dress, shake it off. Don’t get too comfortable in satisfaction. Do something new. It’s not as narrow as a style of rap or a style of music; it’s down to the alternative-ness of what you’re delivering.” At the beginning, he says, “No one, including myself, cared about being big – it was more punk.”Bait, ting, certi: how UK rap changed the language of the nationRead moreThis punk aesthetic is most visible now in the way the new generation have embraced live shows. As mainstream acts chase digital streaming and online connections, Foux has built a fanbase through an almost anachronistic route in the streaming age: the hard graft of constant touring.“The music that we make is live music,” he says. “Everyone in this space, your biggest flex is hitting the stage. Streams and all these things other rappers worry about have only become relevant recently. The real crown on the head is knowing you’ve dropped a song that is going to go crazy live. That’s how you get your rank.”I mention the sold-out EsDeeKid show to him, and he’s not surprised. “I know EsDeeKid wants to be a big touring artist – I can see it and feel it. Him, Fimi, YT, whoever: it’s a big shift happening, it’s great. We’re making superstars.”Century by EsDeeKid is out now on XV Records/Lizzy Records. Daytona by Lancey Foux is out now on RCA Records. What’s the Reason? by Ledbyher is out now on Island Records. Blair Babies by Ceebo is out now on Liberation Records.Explore more on these topicsRapGrimeDrillHip-hopfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Local customs officials filed a criminal accusation with the regional prosecutor’s office on Thursday to begin formal charging proceedings against Harris.An official with a police station in Tomigusuku, a city in southern Okinawa, confirmed that Harris remains in custody. The official declined to comment on whether Harris has admitted to the allegations.Harris’s representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment, and it was unclear whether he has retained legal representation in Japan.Harris had arrived in Okinawa for sightseeing purposes, travelling from Britain via Taiwan, where he had a flight layover, the customs spokesperson said. Okinawa is a popular resort destination about 1,500km (932 miles) south-west of Tokyo, known for its beaches and USmilitary bases.Japan maintains strict drug laws with severe penalties for possession and smuggling offences. The country has some of the toughest narcotics regulations among developed nations, with even small amounts of illegal substances resulting in criminal prosecution. Punishments, however, are not as harsh as in other Asian countries such asChinaandSingapore, where drug offenders can face the death penalty.Foreigners arrested in recent years in Japan for suspected drug offences include former Australianrugby league playerBlake Ferguson in December 2021. In 1980, former Beatle Paul McCartney was arrested after arriving in Tokyo with a bag of marijuana and was banned from entering Japan for years.Harris is also known for his acting role in Emily in Paris and for producing the HBO drama series Euphoria.Explore more on these topicsJeremy O HarrisJapanDrugsUS televisionBroadwayUS theaterTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

I’ve been making sandwiches professionally for 11 years and (of course) at home for much longer. In my shop – Max’s Sandwich Shop in north London – we have a sandwich mantra: hot v cold, sweet v sour, crunchy v soft. The presence of these three core contrasts is, I believe, the key to a great sandwich. Also, I have a liberal attitude to mayonnaise.To test Christmas sandwiches, I got stuck in – trying each one thoroughly rather than taking just one bite. It would be a tall order to expect a factory-made supermarket sandwich to perfect the contrasts laid out in my sandwich mantra, but I did look for them to be created with contrasts in mind.I was also on the lookout for festive innovation (not just red cabbage and baby spinach, which appear to be the default bulking agents of many Christmas sandwiches), interesting ingredients mixed into mayonnaise, and crunchiness – though that’s difficult (if not impossible) to achieve in a mass-produced packaged sandwich. Bonus points were awarded for extras such as great packaging or charitable donations for each sandwich sold. Scores for these sandwiches are relative to each other, not based on their positions in any broader sandwich pantheon.The best Christmas sandwiches in 2025View image in fullscreenTo the Max: the sandwich guru begins his Christmas taste test.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianAldi yorkshire pudding wrapView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianRating:5/5Bread:yorkshire puddingFillings:sliced turkey, smoked streaky bacon, pork sausage, sage and onion stuffing, chicken gravy and cranberry sauce, served with a pot of gravyYou have to bake this in an oven yourself, which is obviously a faff in a grab-and-go world. However, it has three types of meat (four if you include the gravy), which I respect enormously. Not only that, but it actually comes with a pot of gravy for dunking! This feels genuinely redolent of a leftovers sandwich; I doubt that was the intention, but I greatly approve. None of the sandwiches I’ve tried have been even faintly as innovative or interesting as this. It’s not particularly delicious – a bit dry and lacking in freshness – but as far as Christmas sandwich innovations go, Aldi has knocked it out the park with this one. It’s also a plus that it doesn’t contain spinach or red cabbage.Pret porchetta and sage baguetteView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianRating:5/5Bread:stone-baked baguetteFillings:slices of porchetta, sage mayo, matured Italian cheese, cranberries, shredded apple and spinachQuite festive, I guess (cranberries, sage mayo et al), and genuinely nice. The porchetta tasted different from all the other Christmas sandwich meats I tried, which was welcome. The apple gives palpable freshness, and I like the chewy little cranberries, which have a slight acidity to them. I can’t detect the cheese – but that’s probably a plus. As so often with Pret, a notch above the rest of the high-street retailers.Aldi beef wellington bloomerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianRating:4/5Bread:malted bloomerFillings:cooked silverside beef, balsamic onion chutney, dijon mustard mayo with sliced, seasoned roasted chestnut mushrooms and spinachMy initial thought was: “When Aldi is doing a beef wellington sandwich, we’ve jumped the shark.” But this is actually nice! It certainly doesn’t look much like a beef wellington, and there’s no pastry. The Co-op’s wellington sandwich looks much better. But there’s a very good mix of sweet and sour flavours (balsamic onion chutney and dijon mayo are great together). The mushrooms taste good, even if they don’t look great, and the beef has a genuinely good flavour. At least the spinach makes a little more sense here: it’s often in a beef wellington, albeit cooked.Pret pigs in blankets hot rollView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianRating:4/5Bread:hot ciabatta rollFillings:British pork sausages wrapped in streaky bacon, caramelised onion chutney, mustard mayoThere’s not too much bread, and the sausages and bacon are good. There’s a nice balance of sweetness (thank you, chutney) and mustard. A simple sandwich, but tasty.Pret roast butternut squash, chestnut stuffing and pistachioView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianRating:4/5Bread:a wrapFillings:roasted butternut squash, peppery rocket with chestnut and herb stuffing. Served with a spoonful of sage mayo, pistachios and crispy onionsThe wrap itself is very dry, but the filling is herby and nice. I have a soft spot for Paxo, and there is a hint of it here, which must be the sage mayo. The flavour is good overall, and I like the sweet chunks of pumpkin, even though they add to the wrap’s overall softness. It’s definitely lacking crunch and freshness – I didn’t even notice the rocket. The crispy onions hadn’t held on to their crispness, and the pistachios added an odd, but not unenjoyable, soft chew.Waitrose vegetable festive feastView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianRating:3.5/5Bread:maltedFillings:vegan mayo, spiced butternut squash and potato, braised red cabbage and spinachSomehow, Waitrose has pulled this off. Even though it shares its fillings with so many of the other sandwiches here, it feels quite festive, if in a largely nut-roast manner. Texturally, this was nice to eat and not as mushy as so many of the other sandwiches.Sainsbury’s turkey feastView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianRating:3.5/5Bread:maltedFillings:cooked turkey breast, mayonnaise, cranberry chutney, beechwood smoked bacon, and sage, onion and oat stuffingNot too bad at all, although it’s lacking in freshness and acidity – a salad and/or a pickle element would have really lifted this. I know it’s not very festive, but I couldn’t help craving something spicy, such as jalapenos or hot sauce. The packaging was festive, too.M&S ho ho ho-ney mustard ham hockView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianRating:3/5Bread:maltedFillings:honey and mustard pulled ham hock, sharp Cornish cove cheddar, cheesy creamy mayonnaise and fresh spinachHam hock is always good and technically slightly festive, I guess, but here it’s far too finely shredded and a bit mushy. The cheese in the mayo is neither detectable nor an innovation that anyone needed. The mustard flavour is strong and nice, but really this is just a (not particularly good) ham and cheese sandwich, with a bit of spinach in it. The packaging is quite festive, and I’ve awarded a bonus point because Marks & Spencer is donating 5% of sales of this sandwich to charity.Co-op beef and truffle wellingtonView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianRating:3/5Bread:maltedFillings:roast beef, braised red cabbage, truffle-flavour mayonnaise, sage and onion stuffing, sage and onion mayonnaise, mushroom duxelles and spinachskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThis looks much better than Aldi’s similar sandwich, and the palpable smell of truffle when you open it is genuinely glamorous. I wonder why they didn’t add any mustard. More red cabbage – I wonder what they really mean by “braised” in this context? Even though duxelles is closer to what you get in a wellington than the mushrooms in Aldi’s version, it has made things mushy, which Aldi managed to avoid by having bigger bits of mushroom. The packaging has a weird, minimal Christmas tree motif, which is more redolent of the tree once it’s been in your house without water for six weeks.Tesco Finest turkey BLTView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianRating:3/5 as a BLT – 2/5 as a Christmas SandwichBread:ryeFillings:turkey BLT with smoked maple-cured bacon, emmental and gherkin mayoDespite “gherkin mayo” sounding like a fun innovation, and the fact that there’s cheese and turkey in here, it somehow still tastes exactly like any other supermarket BLT. That’s no bad thing, though. As a Christmas sandwich,it would only be a 2/5.Morrisons king prawn and seafood cocktailView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianRating:2.5/5Bread:brioche rollFillings:king prawns, surimi and prawns in a marie rose cocktail sauce, lettuceSurimi is what crab sticks are made from. For most people, I don’t suppose this would feel very Christmassy, but we always have prawn cocktail as a starter for Christmas lunch, so it felt festive to me – and I’ve given it half a bonus point for that reason. The packaging wasn’t festive at all, though. There needs to be lashings of filling in a sandwich like this, which there isn’t, and it suffers for it – there’s just too much bread. I wouldn’t say the lettuce was crisp, either. Marie rose typically has Worcestershire sauce and Tabasco and all kinds of things in it, but this tasted only of ketchup and mayonnaise.Leon twisted veggie ChristmasView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianRating:2.5/5Bread:ciabatta bunFillings:baharat-roasted butternut squash, grilled halloumi, apricot and pine nut stuffing, cranberry, pomegranate molasses, aleppo pepper sauce and pickled red cabbageIt all sounds very good – but sadly, the eating just isn’t. The overall feeling is one of stodgy dryness, caused by far too much bread. Despite sounding as if they go together well, all the fillings have homogenised into one big sticky lump. Even with pickled red cabbage and pine nuts, any perceivable crunch is severely lacking. If you’re adding halloumi, I can’t understand why you wouldn’t also add a lick of mayo. It makes everything juicier and moister, which this sandwich desperately needs. I’ve awarded half a bonus pointfor Leon noticing their name is Noel spelled backwards – extremely Christmassy. The paper wrapping may be intended to be reminiscent of a pressie, and there’s a faintly festive sticker, reminiscent of the Vegas sign graffitied by the Grinch.Leon twisted meaty ChristmasView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianRating:2.5/5Bread:toasted ciabatta bunFillings:pulled turkey marinated in buttermilk and baharat spices, apricot and pine nut stuffing, grilled halloumi, pickled red cabbage, honey mustard mayo, cranberry, pomegranate molasses and aleppo pepper sauceThis is essentially the same sandwich as Leon’s veggie twist, with added pulled turkey (more mush) and some honey mustard mayo (woo hoo!). The same homogenisation has taken place, meaning the separate elements of the sandwich are hard to identify. It’s better than the veggie one, thanks to that mayo, but it’s still not very good. I’ve awarded the same half a pointfor the Noel/Leon wordplay, and it looks much more festive than the veggie version.Asda pigs under blanketsView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianRating:2/5Bread:maltedFillings:tender pork sausages, smoky and sweet cured bacon and onion chutney, mayonnaisePigsunderblankets? What a scam! It seems to just mean sausage and bacon, and it’s almost as good as any supermarket sausage and bacon sandwich – which isn’t too bad, but there’s an indiscernible weirdness to it. I assume that’s from the odd choice of mushroominthe sausages, which I found lurking in the ingredients list. It has largely the same ingredients as the Pret pigs in blankets bun, but it’s nowhere near as good: they’re inferior quality, and it lacks the mustard. Would mustard have saved it?Asda festive Boxing Day sandwichView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianRating:2/5Bread:white breadFillings:chicken, oak-smoked ham, coleslaw and balsamic onion chutneyThe only sandwich with coleslaw, which isn’t very festive, but is normally a good thing. However, all I can really taste is coleslaw, and there’s an astringency to it, which isn’t appealing – perhaps there’s some raw onion in it.Sainsbury’s mince pie wrapView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianRating:0.5/5Bread:brioche-style wrapFillings:mincemeat compote, creme fraiche, caramel sauce and shortcake biscuit ballsDisgusting. I cannot see in what way this pallid, flaccid wrap is “brioche-style”. The only plus, which gains it half a point, is that it does smell like a mince pie. It looked creepy, like a cross section of an unhealthy body part, and the little balls of biscuit had gone squidgy and weird. The whole thing is insanely sweet, and the creme fraiche solidified in a horrible way. This is a clickbait abomination.For more, read thebest smoked salmonandthe best Christmas ham jointsMax Halley is a professional sandwicher, the owner ofMax’s Sandwich Shop in London, a cookbook shop (maxscookbookshop.com) and a handful of pubs.

Here, in no particular order, are some of the worst offendersStuart HeritageFri 5 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 5 Dec 2025 07.02 ESTShareIt’s the most wonderful time of the year: the season where British people traditionally complain about spending too much on rip-offChristmasevents. This year’s festivities have already kicked off in earnest, thanks to the malfunctioning Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer drone show in Haywards Heath this week. By all accounts the drone show was a classic of the genre. It made big promises, offering families “a night of magic and wonder” complete with “state of the art production [and] 600 LED drones”. Then it charged big money, with some families paying hundreds of pounds to attend. And then, of course, it comprehensively underdelivered.Reports describe the event as not only being too short – about just 15 minutes – but also, due to the failure of several drones, completely unintelligible. “From the beginning, large numbers of drones were missing, which left huge gaps in the formations and made it nearly impossible to understand what the images were even supposed to represent!” wrote one aggrieved attendee on social media. “The ‘finale’, the moment the entire audience was waiting for, didn’t even happen. Just a black sky.”Honestly, you’d have thought we’d learn by now. The recent past is littered with festive events gone sour due to a variation of bad planning, technical difficulties or plain old fraudulent behaviour. Here are some of the all-time greats from the past decade and a half.2008: Lapland New Forest, RingwoodView image in fullscreenA fake polar bear at Lapland New Forest, which opened in November 2008 at Matchams Leisure Park near Ringwood in Hampshire.Photograph: Chris Ison/PAWhat was promised:According to the BBC, organisers were offering a place “where dreams really do come true”, which included “Hollywood special effects”, a “magical tunnel of light” and log cabins.What wasdelivered:A two-hour queue to see Santa, a broken ice rink, two plastic polar bears and a reindeer with a broken antler. The nativity scene was, according to one visitor, “a large picture far across an inaccessible muddy field” and the tunnel of light turned out to be a 6ft net of lights strung between two trees. “I took my son to the toilet and he saw ‘Santa’ having a cigarette break at the side of a Portaloo,” claimed another visitor.What happened next:Total chaos. Furious at being charged up to £30 a ticket, several of the 40,000 visitors went nuts upon seeing what they’d paid for. An elf reported being screamed at (“I can’t believe you’ve done this. Look what you’ve done to my children. They’re crying, their fingers are blue. You’re rip-off merchants, you’re taking the mickey out of us”), slapped and run over with a buggy. Two dads had a fight in a gingerbread house and one disgruntled employee reportedly told a visitor that “Santa’s fucking dead”. After six days the park closed to visitors. Three years later the organisers were found guilty of eight charges of misleading the public, and jailed for 13 months each. This is still the yardstick by which other Christmas disasters are measured.2013: Winter Wonderland MK, Milton KeynesWhat was promised:A spectacular event offering “the magic of the holiday season” that would cause visitors to “fall under a magical, festive spell”.What wasdelivered:One visitor called it “a whole load of burger vans with a small funfair”. Another called it “a tent with some statues”. One said of Santa that his “beard was falling down and you could see his normal clothes underneath his costume”. Another said it contained “no reindeers, no huskies, no rides, no live music, not even a single bloody light!!!!”. One said it “did nothing but distort and maybe even destroy my child’s belief in the magic of Christmas”. But the most damning visitor comment was: “My little Anais asked, ‘Nanny have we been bad?’”What happened next:WinterWonderland MK closed after a single day of operation. The organiser issued 200 refunds, with PayPal offering to refund everyone else. Nobody knows if little Anais ever recovered.2014: The Magical Journey, Sutton ColdfieldView image in fullscreenLaurence Llewelyn-Bowen designed the Magical Journey in Sutton Coldfield in 2014, which was temporarily closed after a day of complaints.Photograph: Paul Currie Photography Ltd/Cavendish PressWhat was promised:An immersive 90-minute experience – designed by Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen, no less – in which guests would discover a “winter wonderland of magic and drama”.What wasdelivered:A 40-minute queue to see a Santa who handed out cheap plastic unwrapped presents. According to one visitor, there was a small wood full of “people dressed as elves try to slow you down”. According to another, the atmosphere was like “a waiting area at an airport”.What happened next:The event was such a disaster (one attendee claimed that it had “ruined Christmas’) that it closed after a single day. It did eventually reopen, banning the media from attending, only to close permanently nine days before scheduled. Refunds were offered. Llewelyn-Bowen said that the whole affair had left him “not feeling very Christmassy at all”.2019: Christmas Grotto, HarrodsView image in fullscreenSanta has not returned to Harrods after the store received complaints that he was only seeing ‘rich kids’.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyWhat was promised:A “snow-covered woodland filled with sparkling surprises”.What wasdelivered:A snow-covered woodland filled with sparkling surprises … that was only available for children whose parents had spent at least £2,000 at Harrods. Needless to say, the move did not go down well with shoppers. “Harrods is behaving like the Grinch who stole Christmas,” said one angry father. “Visiting Father Christmas shouldn’t be reserved for those that are fortunate enough to frequent the store and spend thousands of pounds.”What happened next:Harrods bit the bullet and decided to allow 160 children whose parents hadn’t spent £2,000 to visit its Santa, although reports calculated that this meant Santa would still devote 96.4% of his time to the rich kids. Santa has not returned to Harrods since 2021.2022: Enchanted Balgone, East LothianWhat was promised:“A family-friendly Christmas experience in a stunning rural setting”.What wasdelivered:The connoisseur’s choice of disappointing Christmas experiences. The centrepiece of Enchanted Balgone was the Santa Train Room; a grain shed, completely empty save for a shop mannequin – glowering and handless, its Santa suit held together with a belt made of electrical tape, standing on a white piece of cloth next to a plastic palm tree. This was signposted by a sheet of plywood with the word “ACTIVITIES” spray-painted across it. Visitors were nonplussed. “It was nothing short of diabolical to say the least,” said one.What happened next:The event was closed, refunds were issued and the estate that hosted apologised. The handless Santa still haunts the dreams of all who encountered him.2024: Elf on the Shelf Experience, BluewaterWhat was promised:According to the ticketing site, a “never-seen-before interactive, theatrical experience will transport you to the north pole on an immersive adventure where you’ll help the Scout Elves spread Christmas cheer by completing a series of magical games and challenges”.What wasdelivered:According to one attendee, “a half-empty blue room with a few ‘activities’”. Pictures of a bare, low-ceilinged, strip-lit retail unit appear to back this up. Another visitor said: “I thought I was in an episode of The Apprentice and this was the team getting fired. I am disgusted that I was charged for such rubbish.”What happened next:The event was pummelled with one-star Tripadvisor reviews (“They are robbing families of money and magic at Christmas”, “There weren’t any elves!!”), and this year it has been replaced by a Bluey Christmas trail.Explore more on these topicsChristmasWinterFamilyChildrenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

With or without alcohol, this pair look good and taste delicious, and should help everyone ease into the December festivities.Fire cider (for a cranberry fire cider fizz)This makes a delicious base to which you can add soda, juice, tonic or any other mixer for a thirst-quenching and delicious alternative to an alcoholic drink in the evening.Prep15 minInfuse1 week+Makes500ml bottleFor the fire cider2 jalapeños, finely sliced seeds and all1 large thumb of ginger, peeled and finely sliced2 branches fresh rosemary1 cinnamon stick3 heaped tbsp honey2 garlic cloves,peeled1 thumb turmeric, peeled and finely sliced (optional)350ml apple cider vinegarFor the cranberry fizz (serves 1)30ml fire cider75ml cranberry juice1 wedge of orangeSparkling water,to topMix all the ingredients for the fire cider in a sterilised 500ml jar, then put in the fridge for at least week, and preferably three to extract the most goodness from the ingredients.Strain the liquid, discard the solids, then transfer the liquid to a sterilised 500ml bottle or jar and put in the fridge, where it will sit happily for at least three months.To serve, either top with sparkling water or make a cranberry fizz by pouring 30ml fire cider and 75ml cranberry juice into a highball glass. Fill the glass with ice, push in the orange wedge and top with sparkling water.Spiced syrup (for a spiced mezcal negroni)The spiced syrup adds a lovely aromatic lilt to a classic negroni, although I confess I always replace gin with the far less melancholic mezcal these days. It’s also wonderful with prunes, particularly if you add a decent slug of oloroso.Prep5 minCook10 minInfuse30 minMakes500ml bottleFor the spiced syrup200g demerara sugar300ml water1smallcinnamon stick3 clovesZest of 2 orangesFor the spiced mezcal negroni (serves 1)25ml Campari25ml red vermouth25ml mezcal10ml spiced syrupA couple of large ice cubesFlamed orangepeel,to garnish (optional)To make the spiced syrup, put the sugar and 300ml water in a small saucepan with the cinnamon stick and cloves. Add the orange zest and simmer until the sugar has dissolved. Turn off the heat and leave to infuse for 30 minutes. Transfer to a 500ml sterilised jar – the syrup will now keep for weeks in the fridge.To make the negroni, measure out the booze and syrup, and stir over ice. Pour into a rocks glass filled with a giant ice cube and serve with a flash of flamed orange peel.Explore more on these topicsCocktailsChristmasFoodChristmas food and drinkChristmas food giftsCiderSoft drinksrecipesShareReuse this content"

Soft, chewy, marshmallow-coated Rice Krispies are studded with pistachios and cranberries, chocolate and ginger, or peppermint candy cane; they’re as fun to make as they are to eat, and they make a perfect little gift. To add a ribbon for hanging, cut small lengths of ribbon, then loop and knot the ends. Push the knotted end gently into the top of each ball while it’s still pliable, then reshape around it, so it holds the knot securely as it sets. Alternatively, wrap each bauble in cellophane, then gather at the top and tie with a ribbon, leaving a long loop for hanging.Edible Rice Krispie baublesPrep10 minCook30 min+Makes10 x 40g ballsFor the pistachio and cranberry baubles50g unsalted butter, cut into 4 or 5 pieces, plus extra for greasing150g mini marshmallowsFinely grated zest of 1 orange½ tsp vanilla extract¼ tsp flaky sea salt90g Rice Krispies70g dried cranberries60g shelled pistachios, plus 50g extra, roughly chopped, for sprinkling30g desiccated coconut80g white chocolate, meltedDeep green or gold ribbon, for tyingFor the chocolate, orange and ginger baubles50g unsalted butter140g mini marshmallows1tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder60g dark chocolate, chopped, plus 100g extra, melted, for dippingFinely grated zest of 1 orange½ tsp vanilla extract¼ tsp flaky sea salt1 tsp ground cinnamon½ tsp ground ginger100g Rice Krispies50g candied ginger, roughly choppedEdible gold dustCopper or rich-red ribbon,for tyingFor the peppermint candy cane baubles50g butter150g mini marshmallows, plus 50g extra to fold in1 pinch fine sea salt1¼ tsp good-quality peppermint extract100g Rice Krispies80g white chocolate, melted50g candy canes, crushed with a rolling pinRed and white stripe or silver ribbon,for tyingFor the pistachio and cranberry baubles, line a large oven tray with baking paper. In a wide, heavy-based saucepan, melt the butter over a low heat, then add the marshmallows and stir gently until smooth. Add the orange zest, vanilla and flaky salt, then, working quickly, fold in the Rice Krispies until evenly coated. Mix in the cranberries and 60g pistachios until evenly distributed, then leave to sit for five to 10 minutes, until cool enough to handle, but still pliable.Lightly oil or butter your hands, then scoop up small handfuls of the mix roughly the size of a mandarin (about 40g each) and drop them on to the lined tray – don’t shape them yet. Once the mixture has firmed slightly, press and roll into balls. (If adding a ribbon, do so now.) Put the coconut in a small bowl and roll each “bauble” in it to cover lightly, then return to the tray. Drizzle or pipe with melted white chocolate and, while still hot, scatter with the chopped pistachios.For the chocolate, orange and ginger baubles, follow the method above, adding the cocoa and chopped chocolate at the same time as the marshmallows. When the chocolate and marshmallows have melted, add the orange zest, vanilla, sea salt, cinnamon and ginger, then fold in the Rice Krispies and candied ginger. Shape them into roughly 40g balls as outlined above. Half-dip each bauble in the melted chocolate and sprinkle with edible gold dust.For the peppermint candy cane baubles,follow the method for the base recipe above, substituting the flaky sea salt for fine salt and the vanilla for peppermint extract. After the five- to 10-minute cooling period (and before scooping up handfuls of the mixture), fold through the 50g extra mini marshmallows. Shape them into slightly smaller (30g) balls, then drizzle or pipe with melted white chocolate and sprinkle with the crushed candy canes.Explore more on these topicsChristmas food and drinkThe sweet spotChristmas food giftsFoodChristmasSnacksCereals and grainsChocolaterecipesShareReuse this content"

For example, for Spain and New Zealand it is 8 December, the US is 12 December, and for France and Ireland, it is 15 December. For Australia, it is Friday 5 December.View image in fullscreenCheck the Christmas deadlines for your parcels.Photograph: Mstock/AlamyMeanwhile, the courier price comparison site Parcel2Go has listed the UK and international deadlines for many of the leading courier companieson its website.Which company?There are dozens of parcel delivery and courier companies, from household names to smaller players, and a dizzying array of options: standard, signed for, next day, tracked, guaranteed, etc. The options may include dropping your parcel at a local shop, leaving it in a locker for collection or having a courier come and collect it.So if you are shopping around, make sure you are comparing like with like.Martin Lewis’s MoneySavingExpert websitesays there are lots of variables, but for a small item weighing less than 1kg: “Royal Mail usually wins.”However, for items heavier than that, it reckons courier comparison websites are usually cheapest. The largest is thought to be Parcel2Go, and other biggies include ParcelHero, ParcelCompare, Parcel Monkey and Worldwide Parcel Services.Try Royal Mail firstA good first step is to consult theprice guideson Royal Mail’s website. For a small parcel weighing up to 2kg, standard second class would cost £3.50 or £3.99. The first figure is the online price and the second is what you will pay at a post office. The equivalent standard first-class prices are £4.40 (online) and £5.09 (post office).View image in fullscreenRoyal Mail staff help out with the thousands of letters arriving into the ‘Santa Mail’ operation at one of the special sorting centres in Edinburgh.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PAThen try the competitionOnce you know what Royal Mail would charge, you may want to get a quote from a courier comparison website. This is generally a much better bet than going to the individual courier companies.Some of the comparison sites are able to offer competitive prices because they buy spare delivery slots from courier companies and then sell them cheaply.Some courier firms will deliver to all postcodes, while others may have more limited coverage.Check their track recordA record 15 million people experienced a problem with a recent parcel delivery,according to Citizens Advice, so choose carefully. “The festive season is the busiest time of year for sending post and deliveries, and many of us will understandably be worried about whether important Christmas post will arrive on time,” says Gurpreet Chhokar, a consumer law expert at Which?.In October,Amazon and FedExjointly took the top spot in the postal regulator Ofcom’s customer satisfaction survey of parcel delivery companies. Meanwhile, Evri and Yodel customers were the “least satisfied” when it came to contacting parcel companies for help.Citizens Advice recently looked at the top five delivery companies by parcel volume (Royal Mail, DPD, Yodel, Amazon and Evri). In its study, Royal Mail bagged the top spot in the league table with an overall score of 3.25 out of five stars, while Yodel was in bottom place with two out of five stars.Can you get free delivery?If you are buying an item from an online retailer to give as a gift, it is “almost always” cheaper to get it sent directly to the recipient, says MoneySavingExpert. Retailers often offer free delivery if you are spending more than a certain amount (£70 at John Lewis and £60 at Marks & Spencer, for example).Some online retailers will let you add a gift message or will wrap the gift (for a few pounds)“This can really help with larger or heavier gifts, as Royal Mail and parcel companies charge by size and weight, while retailers don’t tend to – it’s normally based on the underlying cost of the item,” the site says.Some online retailers will let you add a gift message or will wrap the gift (for a few pounds). It can save time and means you don’t have the hassle of waiting for the item to arrive and then wrapping and posting it yourself.Many, however, will feel this is a bit impersonal, and you may have less control over how long the delivery will take. Also, some retailers such as John Lewis won’t send packages overseas.If it’s small …If it is a smallish or light item such as a slim paperback, a child’s picture book or a notebook, you may be able to get under the wire of Royal Mail’s “large letter” format: an envelope measuring up to 35.3cm x 25cm x 2.5cm and weighing up to 750g.If you are sending it to a UK address, this will cost between £1.55 and £2.50 for standard second class, depending on the weight. For standard first class, it is between £3.05 and £3.30. If you are sending it overseas, large letter untracked standard delivery starts at £3.40.They are the online prices. If you pay at a post office, you may pay a bit more: for example, large letter standard second-class prices for the UK range from £1.55 to £2.70, while for standard first class it is from £3.15 to £3.60.Avoid post office queuesIf you have only one parcel to send, you may opt to pop into a post office. However, if you want to minimise your chances of standing in a long queue, don’t go on Monday 8 December. ThePost Officeexpects this to be the busiest day for sending Christmas parcels and post.It is worth being aware that some Post Office branches can be used to collect or drop off prepaid parcels for delivery by companies such as Amazon, DPD, DHL and Evri.View image in fullscreenThere may be long queues at Post Office branches on 8 December.Photograph: Mr Standfast/AlamyBeware ‘banned’ itemsDelivery and courier companies publish lists of prohibited and restricted items. Some are simply banned (although the rules sometimes vary depending on whether the item is being sent to a UK or overseas address), while others can be sent but the firm won’t provide compensation or cover if they get lost or damaged.The aim is to prevent customers sending illegal, hazardous or fragile substances or submitting huge claims for lost valuables – but you may be surprised about some of the items on the lists. For example, Evri’s prohibited items include nail varnish, perfume, aftershave and secateurs, while DHL’s UK list includes “designer goods (including handbags/footwear/clothing/watches/jewellery)” and antiques.Some companies even warn that if you send a prohibited item and it causes damage to other people’s parcels – for example, it leaks – they will seek to recover the repair or replacement costs from you.Need a customs form?Remember that you will need to fill out a customs form if you are sending gifts from England, Wales or Scotland to anywhere outside the UK. The websites of companies such as thePost Office,Royal MailandParcel2Gohave useful guides on how you do this. For most gifts (those worth less than £270), it is form CN22.View image in fullscreenIt’s worth making the effort to get Christmas cards in the post as early as possible.Photograph: Geoffrey Swaine/ShutterstockCrucially, when describing your items, you need to be specific and detailed, says Parcel2Go. “Avoid general terms like ‘gift’ or ‘clothes’ and aim for something like ‘knitted woollen scarf, clothing’,” it adds.Some gift givers may worry this will spoil the surprise for the recipient – the customs declaration must be physically attached to the outside of the package. “I’m afraid it’s not good news to keep this item a surprise,” Royal Mail told us. “Unfortunately, the description does need to be clear and accurate, as anything ambiguous/generic will be rejected by the customs authority clearing the goods at import.”Get cards off earlyIf you are planning to sendChristmascards, it is well worth making the effort to get them off second class: for UK destinations, the last posting date is 17 December. For first class it is 20 December.A second-class stamp costs 87p and a first-class one is £1.70. So if you are sending 10 letters, you will save £8.30 by sending them second class, and if you are sending 20, the saving is £16.60.Explore more on these topicsPostal serviceMoney hacksCouriers/delivery industryConsumer affairsRoyal MailPost OfficeChristmasStampsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This ancient method requires minimal effortDigging a trench alongside your vegetable bed is an easy way to dispose of food and plant waste, and enrich soil for next year’s cropsClaire RatinonFri 5 Dec 2025 06.30 ESTLast modified on Fri 5 Dec 2025 06.58 ESTShareOn a visit to our friends’ house recently, the subject of food waste came up. They haven’t got a tucked-away spot to set up a compost bin or heap in their garden, and their local council doesn’t collect. They had put their effort intobokashi compostingin the past, but with a baby on the way I suspect they’ll have more than enough to do without taking on the added responsibility of caring for a bucket of fermenting kitchen scraps.But as they’re already accustomed to burying their bokashi-ed vegetable peelings, it got me thinking about how low effort and high impact trench composting can be for those without room for a larger system. Trench composting is the simple process of putting your compostable matter – fruit and vegetable waste, plant material from the garden, grass clippings, leaves, etc – into a trench near where you’re planning to grow your crops next year. Over the coming months, this organic matter will slowly decompose, enriching the soil and improving its structure, making it ready to welcome the following season’s plants. No further effort is required from you to engage in this ancient approach.It’s possible to compost this way in a relatively shallow trench, although some advice suggests digging down to 60cm (2ft) before adding the organic matter and covering the trough. If you take a shallower approach, consider covering your trench in a tarpaulin and pinning it down firmly to prevent your beds from being dug up by the hungry creatures that visit your garden.It’s a simple process of putting your compost into a trench near where you plan to grow your cropsAnother benefit of trench composting is that you won’t be worrying whether you’ve achieved the right proportion of greens and browns. As anyone who has tended to a stagnant or dormant compost heap knows, it can be tricky to get that balance right, but trench composting is more forgiving. It is best to incorporate a mixture of green (nitrogen-rich) material and brown (carbon-rich) material as you would in a traditional composting setup, but you can be looser with the ratios.As a fairly devoted practitioner ofno-dig growing, I wince at the prospect of digging a trench alongside or into my veg beds, but I think it’s possible to excavate a decent amount of earth without entirely disrupting the soil horizons. I would consider trench composting when redoing a perennial bed or doing extensive removal of perennial weeds, as both require me to disrupt the soil anyway. Whenever I am called upon to dig, I’m careful to replace the soil from where it was unearthed as best I can and avoid moving soil when it is saturated.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

If they win too often, their maximum stake is dialled down to zero, or negligible amounts.Sometimes, say insiders, this is a response to a legitimate concern, such as suspicion that a sporting event is rigged, or that – for instance – a stablehand has inside information that a horse has gone lame.Increasingly, however, professional punters have complained that bookies are simply shutting down whoever displays a talent for beating the odds.This, in industry parlance, is known as being “chinned”.They say affordability checks on punters, brought in to prevent vulnerable gamblers and addicts from losing their shirts, are also being used as a smokescreen to close accounts – and even to prevent withdrawals.One solution to being “chinned” is to buy or rent an account owned by someone who the bookies see as a losing customer, preferably a “whale” who bets big.One pro gambler said that bookies were getting better at spotting such tactics but that piggy-backing on third-party accounts had worked well in the past.“A friend of mine made a lot of money … his brother was a student and tons of students in the uni had multiple accounts for him. He’d give them a burner phone, they’d open the account and fund it with money he sent them and they’d operate it. Another guy would send people a laptop and instructions on what to bet on. They’d keep the computer and a share of the winnings.”While bookies are getting wiser to it, “clean” betting accounts are still traded via social media platforms and messaging apps such as Telegram and WhatsApp, according to multiple industry sources.“If it’s just [buying] an ID and a postcode it could be £20,” said one pro punter, who described this marketplace as a “wild west”.“If you offered me the account of a VIP who was a [stake factor of] 50 at Bet365, with a couple of years of history betting, that could be worth tens of thousands,” they said.“For an account that was down a couple of million, it would take a couple of weeks for the company to get rid of a VIP like that. They’re unique.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The case was discontinued, prompting rumours of a financial settlement.People who lend or sell their accounts are sometimes referred to by some in the industry as “beards” or “mules”.Buying accounts is not the only way to get a bet on if you have been shut out by the big companies.Another is to bet via the illicit market, a sector estimated to be worth £1bn and growing.A legion of unlicensed casinos and bookmakers have targeted the UK market.Based overseas, they are easily accessible by the use of software such as a virtual private network (VPN), and many accept payment in cryptocurrency, making it hard for the authorities to track them. Some, aimed at valuable high-rolling whales or VIPs – in other words people who lose a lot of money – are invite-only. Such firms do not pay UK gambling duties and regulated operators have warned thatRachel Reeves’s decision to increase taxes on online betting firmsat last week’s budget will drive more punters into the arms of these underground sites.But the unregulated market may not be solely the domain of foreign actors with no skin in the UK game. Last month, the Guardian revealed that alicensed British bookmaker accidentally disclosed informationsuggesting it may be running an illegal offshore betting operation.One entirely legitimate way to gamble outside the traditional industry is via a betting syndicate, such as Starlizard, run by Bloom, who is the defendant in the lawsuit reported by the Guardian.Such syndicates allow members with enough money to buy in, gaining access to hi-tech statistical modelling used to place wagers with specialist bookmakers around the world who are prepared to lay big bets. Syndicate members share the winnings.In 2023, the Guardianreportedthat Matthew Benham, a protege of Bloom’s who owns Brentford FC, appeared to have made money from bets on football placed in his own name, via a UK-based gambling syndicate called MSPP Admin.Benham said he abided by all Football Association betting rules.As with individual gamblers, those in the know say syndicates often buy third-party beard accounts to hide their involvement from bookmakers who might otherwise turn down their business. Ideally, the beard would be a whale, because the unsuspecting bookie would be happy to allow them to wager large amounts.In Bloom’s case, according to the recent court filing, an arrangement was allegedly reached between Bloom, the syndicate and Cottrell under which Cottrell would receive a 33% share of any wins made when using his account.One punter had little sympathy for the bookies in such cases.“In a world where the companies will shut you down for nothing … well, fuck ’em.”Quick GuideContact Guardian Business about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact the Business team confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Why didn’t governments step in and stop them?Anna MooreFri 5 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 5 Dec 2025 03.23 ESTShareFor Patrizia Schlosser, it started with an apologetic call from a colleague. “I’m sorry but I found this. Are you aware of it?” He sent over a link, which took her to a site called Mr DeepFakes. There, she found fake images of herself, naked, squatting, chained, performing sex acts with various animals. They were tagged “Patrizia Schlosser sluty FUNK whore” (sic).“They were very graphic, very humiliating,” says Schlosser, a German journalist for Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) andFunk. “They were also very badly done, which made it easier to distance myself, and tell myself they were obviously fake. But it was very disturbing to imagine somebody somewhere spending hours on the internet searching for pictures of me, putting all this together.”The site was new to Schlosser, despite her previous high-profile investigations into the porn industry. “I’d never heard of Mr DeepFakes – a porn site entirely dedicated to fake porn videos and photos. I was surprised by how big it was – so many videos of every celebrity you know.” Schlosser’s first reaction on seeing herself among them was to brush it aside. “I tried to push it to the back of my mind, which was really a strategy of not dealing with it,” she says. “But it’s strange how the brain works. You know it’s fake but still you see it. It’s not you but also it is you. There you are with a dog and a chain. You feel violated but confused. At some point, I decided: ‘No. I’m angry. I don’t want those images out there.’”Schlosser’s subsequent documentary for NDR’s STRG_F programme did succeed in getting the images removed. She also tracked down the young man who had created and posted them – even visiting his home and speaking to his mother. (The perpetrator himself wouldn’t come out of his bedroom.) However, Schlosser was unable to identify “Mr DeepFakes” – or whoever was behind the site, despite enlisting the help of Bellingcat, the online investigative journalism collective. Bellingcat’s Ross Higgins was on the team. “My background is investigating money laundering,” he says. “I looked at the structure of the website and it was using the same internet service providers (ISPs) as proper serious organised criminals.” The ISPs suggested links to the Russian mercenary group Wagner, and individuals named in thePanama Papers. The ads it carried included ones for apps owned by Chinese technology companies, which allowed China’s government access to all customer data. “I made the presumption that this was all much too sophisticated to be a site of hobbyists,” says Higgins.It turned out that’s exactly what it was.Anyone wanting deepfakes created of someone they knew could find someone willing to make them to orderThe story of Mr DeepFakes, the world’s largest, most notorious nonconsensual deepfake porn site, is really the story of AI porn itself – the very term “deepfake” is believed to have come from its originator. A “ground zero” for AI-generated pornography, its pages – which have been viewed more than 2bn times – have depicted countless female celebrities, politicians, European princesses, wives and daughters of US presidents, being kidnapped, tortured, shaved, bound, mutilated, raped and strangled. Yet all this content (which would take more than 200 days to watch) was just the site’s “shop window”. Its true heart, it’s “engine room”, was its forum. Here, anyone wanting deepfakes created of someone they knew (a girlfriend, sister, classmate or colleague) could find someone willing to make them to order for the right price. It was also a “training ground”, a technical hub where “hobbyists” taught one another, shared tips, posted academic papers and “problem-solved”. (One recurring problem was how to deepfake without a good “dataset”. This means when you’re trying to deepfake someone you don’t have many pictures of – so not a celebrity, but maybe someone you know whose social media you’ve screengrabbed.)The film-maker and activist Sophie Compton spent many hours monitoring Mr DeepFakes while researching the award-winning 2023 documentary Another Body (available on iPlayer). “Looking back, I think that site played such an instrumental role in the proliferation of deepfakes overall,” she says. “I really think that there’s a world in which the site didn’t get made, wasn’t allowed to be made or was shut down quickly, and deepfake porn is just a fraction of the issue that we have today. Without that site, I don’t think it would have exploded in the way it did.”In fact, that scenario was entirely possible. The origins of MrDeepfakes stretch back to 2017-18 when AI porn was just beginning to build on social media sites such as Reddit. One anonymous Redditor and AI porn “pioneer” who went by the name of “deepfakes” (and is thus credited with coining the term) gave anearly interviewto Vice about its potential. Shortly after, though, in early 2018,Reddit banned deepfake pornfrom its site. “We have screenshots from their message boards at that time and the deepfake community, which was small, was freaking out and jumping ship,” says Compton. This is when Mr DeepFakes was created, with the early domain name dpfks.com. The administrator carried the same username – dpfks – and was the person who advertised for volunteers to work as moderators, and posted rules and guidelines, as well as deepfake videos and an in-depth guide to using software for deepfake porn.“What’s so depressing about reading the messages and seeing the genesis is realising how easily governments could have stopped this in its tracks,” says Compton. “The people doing it didn’t believe they were going to be allowed free rein. They were saying: ‘They’re coming for us!’, ‘They’re never going to let us do this!’ But as they continued without any problems at all, you see this growing emboldenment. Covid added to the explosion as everyone stopped moderating content. The output was violent – it was about degrading someone completely. The celebrities that were really popular were often really young – Emma Watson, Billie Eilish, Millie Bobby Brown.” (Greta Thunberg is another example here.)Who was behind it? From time to time, Mr DeepFakes gave anonymous interviews. In a 2022 BBC documentary,DeepfakePorn: Could You Be Next?, the site’s “owner” and “web developer”, going by the pseudonym “deepfakes”, made the argument that consent from the women wasn’t required as “it’s a fantasy, it’s not real”.Was money their motivation? Mr DeepFakes ran ads and had a premium membership paid in cryptocurrency – in 2020, one forum mentions that it made between $4,000 and$7,000 a month. “There was a commercial aspect,” says Higgins. “It was a side hustle, but it was more than that. It gave this notoriety.”At one point, the site “posted 6,000 pictures of AOC’s [the US politician Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s]face in order that people could make deepfake pornography of her,” says Higgins. “It’s insane. [There were] all these files of YouTubers and politicians. What it’s saying is that if you’re a woman in this world you can only achieve so much because if you put your head above the parapet, if you have the temerity to do anything publicly, you can expect your image to be used in the most degrading way possible for personal profit.“The most affecting thing for me was the language used about women on that site,” he continues. “We had to change it for our online report because we didn’t want it to be triggering, but this is pure misogyny. Pure hatred.”This April, investigators began to believe that they had found Mr DeepFakes and sent emails to their suspect.‘I don’t take no for an answer’: how a small group of women changed the law on deepfake pornRead moreOn 4 May, Mr DeepFakes shut down. A notice on its homepage blamed “data loss” caused by the withdrawal of a “critical service provider”. “We will not be relaunching,” it continued. “Any website claiming this is fake. This domain will eventually expire and we are not responsible for future use. This message will be removed in about a week.”Mr DeepFakes is finished – but according to Compton, this could have happened so much sooner. “All the signs were there,” she says. The previous year, in April 2024, when the UK governmentannounced plans tocriminalise the creation and sharing of deepfake sexual abuse material, Mr DeepFakes responded by immediately blocking access to UK users. (The plans were later shelved when the 2024 election was called.) “It showed that ‘Mr DeepFakes’ was obviously not so committed that there was nothing governments could do,” says Compton. “If it was going to become too much of a pain and a risk to run the site, then they weren’t going to bother.”But deepfake porn has become so popular, so mainstream, that it no longer requires a “base camp”. “The things that those guys prided themselves on learning how to do and teaching others are now so embedded, they’re accessible to anyone on apps at the click of the button,” says Compton.And for those wanting something more complex, the creators, the self-styled experts who once lurked on its forum, are now out there touting for business. Patrizia Schlosser knows this for sure. “As part of my research, I went undercover and reached out to some of the people on the forums, asking for a deepfake of an ex-girlfriend,” says Schlosser. “Although it’s often claimed the site was only about celebrities, that wasn’t true. The response was, ‘Yeah, sure …’“After Mr DeepFakes shut down, I got an automatic email from one of them which said: “If you want anything made, let me know … Mr DeepFakes is down – but of course, we keep working.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

M23 is now in control there.Detonations that shook buildings echoed throughout the morning near Kamanyola, an AFP journalist reported in Bugarama, a border post on the Rwandan side about 2km (1.3 miles) away.On Friday, the M23 accused the Burundian army of firing “without interruption” into the DRC.A Burundian military source told AFP they were reinforcing their positions to ensure they were not overrun by M23 fighters and their Rwandan backers.“The fighting is intensifying,” the source added, speaking on condition of anonymity. “There is a real risk the situation escalates. We are bringing reinforcements to the front because this is a red line for Burundi.”The source said his country could not accept it if “the terrorists of M23 and their Rwandan backers reach Uvira”, a city in DRC less than 30km from Bujumbura, Burundi’s biggest city.Lines of civilians fleeing the fighting crossed the border in the early hours watched by Rwandan police.“The bombs were exploding above the houses,” said one witness, Immaculee Antoinette, from Ruhumba, near Kamanyola. “We were asked to remain locked inside our houses, but that seemed impossible.”Hassan Shabani, an administrative official in Kamanyola, said schools, hospitals and civilian homes were all shelled.On the Rwandan side, some residents were “scouring the hills from where the shots are coming, in small groups”, said a local woman, Farizi Bizimana. “The children and women are very scared and take refuge in houses when the gunfire becomes intense,” she added.In January, M23 backed by Kigali and its army went on the offensive,capturing the major regional cities of Gomain North Kivu province andBukavu in South Kivu.On Thursday in Washington, DR Congo’s president, Félix Tshisekedi, and Rwanda’s president, Paul Kagame, signed an agreement that their host, the US president, Donald Trump, called a “miracle”.Explore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoRwandaBurundiAfricaUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

They are not thought to have left the city, and this grisly development comes amid increasingly gloomy speculation about their fate.Nathaniel Raymond, director of theYale Humanitarian Research Lab, which has been closely analysing satellite images of El Fasher, said the city was eerily empty, with once-bustling markets now desolate.Yale’s latest analysis suggests marketplaces are nowso unusedthat they are becoming overgrown and that all the livestock appears to have been moved out of the city,which had 1.5 million inhabitants before the war began in April 2023.“It’s beginning to look a lot like a slaughterhouse,” said Raymond.No expert or agency has been able to explain the whereabouts of the tens of thousands of residents who have been missing since El Fasher – the army’s last major stronghold in the region – was overrun on 26 October after the RSF’s brutal500-day starvation siege.The Guardian has spoken to sources who describe El Fasher residents being held in detention centres in the city, though the numbers still detained are small.View image in fullscreenSatellite imagery from August 2025, left, shows evidence of market activity and vehicles around El Fasher, while an image taken on 17 November 2025, right, shows no signs of life in the city.Photograph: Courtesy of Humanitarian Research Lab/Yale School of Public HealthRSF officials had pledged to allow the UN into El Fasher to deliver aid and investigate atrocities, but to date the city remains out of bounds for humanitarian organisations as well as UN officials.Aid convoys are understood to be on standby in nearby towns and cities as negotiations for the RSF to give safety guarantees continue. So far the paramilitary group, now in its third year of civil war with Sudan’s armed forces, has refused.A UN source said: “There needs to be a security assessment before we can plan on sending assistance. Right now, there is no guarantee of safe passage or protection of civilians, aid workers or humanitarian assets.”Despite the uncertainty over how many residents might be alive inside El Fasher, the need for help to reach the city is deemed critical, with“staggering” levels of malnutritionreported among those who had escaped. International experts havedeclared the city to be in famine.Whistleblower accuses Foreign Office of ‘censoring’ warning of Sudan genocideRead moreRaymond said some residents, with whom his team had now lost touch, had contacted them within the first two days of the attack alleging that up to 10,000 people had been killed.Human rights experts now believe El Fasher is likely to be the worst war crime of the Sudanese civil war, which is already characterised bymass atrocitiesandethnic cleansing.Over 32 months of ruinous war, the country has been torn apart, with as many as 400,000 people killed and almost 13 million displaced. The conflict has caused the world’sbiggest humanitarian crisis.Meanwhile, there have been renewed calls for a thorough investigation into an RSF attack on theZamzam displacement campseven miles (12km) south of El Fasher six months earlier.A new report byAmnesty Internationaldocuments how the RSF targeted civilians, took hostages, and destroyed mosques and schools during a large-scale attack on Zamzam camp. It has called for the RSF to be “investigated for war crimes”.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentSudanDarfurAfricaMiddle East and north AfricaWar crimesConflict and armsnewsShareReuse this content"

The breeding penguins probably starved to death during the moulting period, according to the paper, which said the climate crisis and overfishing were driving declines.The losses that researchers recorded in those colonies were not isolated,said the paper, which was published in Ostrich: Journal of African Ornithology. “These declines are mirrored elsewhere,” said Dr Richard Sherley, from the Centre for Ecology and Conservation at the University of Exeter. The African penguin species has undergone a population decline of nearly 80% in 30 years.African penguins shed and replace their worn-out feathers every year to protect their insulation and waterproofing. However, during the moulting period, which takes about 21 days, they have to stay on land. To survive this fasting period, they need to fatten up beforehand. “If food is too hard to find before they moult or immediately afterwards, they will have insufficient reserves to survive the fast,” said Sherley. “We don’t find large rafts of carcasses – our sense is that they probably die at sea,” he said.View image in fullscreenA protest last year in Simon’s Town, South Africa.Photograph: ER Lombard/Gallo Images/Getty ImagesFor every year except three since 2004, the biomass of the sardine speciesSardinops sagaxhad fallen to 25% of its maximum abundance off the coast of western South Africa, the study found. The fish are a key food for African penguins. Changes in the temperature and salinity off the west coast of Africa have made the fishes’ spawning less successful. Levels of fishing, however, have remained high in the region.In 2024, African penguins were classified as critically endangered, withfewer than 10,000 breeding pairs left.More sustainable fisheries management could improve the penguins’ chances of survival. Conservationists are taking action on the ground, by building artificial nests to shelter chicks, managing predators and hand-rearing adults and chicks who need rescuing. Commercial purse-seine fishing, which involves encircling a school of fish with a large net and then trapping them by closing the bottom,has been bannedaround the six largest penguin-breeding colonies in South Africa.It is hoped this will “increase access to prey for penguins at critical parts of their life cycle”, said the study co-author Dr Azwianewi Makhado, from the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment in South Africa.Fears for elephant seals as bird flu kills half of population in South AtlanticRead moreLorien Pichegru, a professor of marine biology at Nelson Mandela University in South Africa, who was not involved in the study, said the results were “extremely concerning” and highlighted decades-long mismanagement of small fish populations in South Africa. “The results of the study are only based on penguins’ survival until 2011, but the situation has not improved over time,” she said.Pichegru said addressing extremely low levels of small fish stocks required urgent action, “not only for African penguins but also for other endemic species depending on these stocks”.Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsBirdsThe age of extinctionSouth AfricaMarine lifeFoodFishingFishing industryAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s what we do with it that matters.”The Guardian understands that the warring parties have been told it is highly likely that Trump will use a far broader range of punitive sanctions on groups that he regards as standing in the way of a ceasefire.View image in fullscreenMassad Boulos, left, has been trying for months to persuade the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces to back a ceasefire.Photograph: Julia Demaree Nikhinson/APNorway’s foreign ministry is preparing to invite a broad range of Sudanese society to Oslo in the coming weeks to map out the parameters of how a civilian government could be restored in the event of the conflict ending.According to the UN, the war has killed 40,000 people – though some rights groups say the death toll is significantly higher – and has created the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, with more than 14 million people displaced.Saudi Arabia and Egypt have broadly supported the army, while the RSF has beenbacked by the United Arab Emirates. The effectiveness of Trump’s intervention may lie in privately persuading the UAE that its position – which it denies, despiteevidence compiledby the UN, independent experts and reporters – is counterproductive. It may also require the Saudis to weaken their insistence on the continuance of Sudan’s “legitimate institutions” – diplomatic code for preserving the existing Islamist-influenced army.The belated move of Sudan up the US agenda came as the UN human rights chief warned that since 25 October, when the RSF captured the city of Bara in North Kordofan, there had been at least 269 civilian deaths from aerial strikes, artillery shelling and summary executions.After the intervention of the Saudi crown prince, it is likely the US will be willing to broaden sanctions against the warring parties, as well as take steps to enforce and extend the widely abused UN arms embargo on Darfur. So far US sanctions have been confined to the RSF and army leaderships, a small group of Sudanese Islamists linked to the army, and some UAE-based firms.View image in fullscreenMore than 14 million people have been displaced by the civil war, including those fleeing from El Fasher to camps in Tawila, North Darfur.Photograph: Mohammed Jamal/ReutersOn 21 September the so-called quad – the US,Saudi Arabia, UAE and Egypt – put forward a plan for a three-month humanitarian truce leading to a nine-month political process and resulting in civilian rule.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The army said the proposal entailed the disbandment of the army, the cornerstone of its power base.Norway’s deputy foreign minister, Andreas Motzfeldt Kravik, was in Port Sudan last week meeting the army leadership. “Without a ceasefire, the country will continue to fragment, with serious consequences for the entire region,” Kravik said. “Norway hopes in the coming weeks to bring together civilian society to Oslo to discuss how a civilian government can be prepared.”At the same time, Trump’s threat tolabel the Muslim Brotherhooda foreign terrorist organisation, supported this week by the House foreign relations committee, may weaken the army since it is often accused of having extensive links withthe movement.White House attention on the Sudan crisis will also have been spurred by renewed reports that the army may be willing to provide an extended port lease to Russia, as well as claims that it has denied UN authorities access to evaluate claims it has used chemical weapons.The UAE, which opposes the influence of Islamism in politics, says rooting out theMuslim Brotherhoodmust remain the key factor in the west’s approach to the region.Speaking at the Chatham House thinktank this week, Lana Nusseibeh, the UAE minister of state, said the solution to the conflict laid in returning Sudan to a broad-based civilian government. “We cannot see the political rehabilitation of either warring party,” she said. “Both the RSF and the Port Sudan Authority [her term for the army] have committed grave violations, disgraced themselves, and in the views of the international community neither has a legitimate claim to shape Sudan’s future.”On Thursday the UN’s human rights chief issued a stark warning about Sudan, saying he feared “a new wave of atrocities” amid a surge in fierce fighting in the Kordofan region. Volker Türk urged “all states with influence over the parties to take immediate action to halt the fighting, and stop the arms flows that are fuelling the conflict”.Explore more on these topicsSudanUS foreign policySaudi ArabiaTrump administrationDonald TrumpUnited NationsMuslim BrotherhoodnewsShareReuse this content"

They also appeared to have no idea what had just hit them, or that theUS militarywas weighing whether to finish them off, two sources familiar with the recording told Reuters.The pair desperately tried to turn a severed section of the hull upright before they died. “The video follows them for about an hour as they tried to flip the boat back over. They couldn’t do it,” one source said.The video of the attack on 2 September was seen by senators behind closed doors on Thursday amid growing concern that the US defence secretary,Pete Hegseth, and other officials who ordered the attack may have committed a war crime.chartLater on Thursday, thePentagon announced another deadly strikeon a boat suspected of carrying illegal narcotics, killing four men in the eastern Pacific.This was the 22nd attack the US military has carried out against boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean and took the death toll of the campaign to at least 87 people.Video of the latest incident was posted on social mediaby the US Southern Command, which described it as a “lethal kinetic strike on a vessel in international waters operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization”.Its statement added: “Intelligence confirmed that the vessel was carrying illicit narcotics and transiting along a known narco-trafficking route in the Eastern Pacific. Four male narco-terrorists aboard the vessel were killed.”It was the first publicly announced strike in nearly three weeks and comes as the Pentagon and the White House have struggled to answer questions about the legal basis for the campaign to kill suspected drug smugglers.View image in fullscreenAdm Frank Bradley told lawmakers on Thursday there was no order to kill everyone on board the boat.Photograph: Anna Moneymaker/GettyMuch of the debate has focused onthe first attack on 2 Septemberafter the Washington Post reported thatHegseth had verbally directed the military to “kill them all”.Adm Frank Bradley of the US navy, who commanded the attack, told lawmakers on Thursday there was no such order to kill everyone on board.Donald Trump posted video of the initial strike on his Truth Social platform shortly after the operation, but no footage of the follow-up attack that killed the two remaining crew members has been released. On Wednesday, Trump vowed to make the entire video public, but the Pentagon has not yet done so.Jim Himes, a Democratic congressman who saw the video on Thursday, described it as “one of the most troubling things I’ve seen in my time in public service”.He said: “You have two individuals in clear distress, without any means of locomotion, with a destroyed vessel.”Describing those on board as “bad guys” who “were not in the position to continue their mission in any way”, Himes added: “Any American who sees the video that I saw will see the United States military attacking shipwrecked sailors.”The attack began with an airburst munition exploding above the vessel and killing nine crew members. The two men who survived were then visible floating in the water.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The manual cites firing upon shipwreck survivors as an example of a “clearly illegal” order that should be refused.TheTrump administrationhas argued that the US is at war with drug traffickers and that such strikes are legal under the rules of war, but most legal experts reject that rationale.Rebecca Ingber, a professor at Cardozo School of Law and a former legal adviser to the US state department, told the Guardian this week: “Even if we buy into their framing that the individuals on these vessels are combatants, it would still be unlawful to kill them if they are hors de combat, which means they’re incapacitated …It is manifestly unlawful to kill someone who’s been shipwrecked.”Marcus Stanley, director of studies at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, said the strikes themselves constitute potential war crimes, even before the killing of survivors.“What’s the next step? There’s somebody committing a street crime, or you claim they’re committing a street crime in a United States city, and then you can unleash the military on them without judicial evidence,” he said. “The American people should get as much transparency and information here to judge what’s being done in their name as possible.”Explore more on these topicsUS militaryPete HegsethDrugs tradeTrump administrationVenezuelaAmericasInternational lawnewsShareReuse this content"

Nazzaro and the Base are also suspected of harboring links to Kremlin spy agencies and aiding their broadersabotage efforts.Experts were shocked at the level of organization and the arsenal of weaponry the cell was able to achieve inside ofEurope.How cult leader ‘Commander Butcher’ plotted to sow mayhem across USRead more“This cell was particularly serious,” said Joshua Fisher-Birch, a terrorism researcher at the Counter Extremism Project who keeps tabs on the digital accounts of the Base. “It should be noted that the group’s cell inSpainhad its own public Telegram channel, which is unusual, where they repeatedly called on others to join the group, shared photos of weapons training and urged militant action.”In recent months, the Base has made headlines, claiming the July assassination of aUkrainian officer in Kyivand other acts of terrorism inside Ukraine. Then, last week, a Luxembourg courtimprisoned a Swedish member of the Basefor plotting a mass casualty event at a past Eurovision singing competition.Fisher-Birch says the Spanish cell was openly endorsing the operations of the group in Ukraine as a sort of example and applauding its efforts to start a white ethnostate in the Zakarpattia region of the war-torn country. Similarly, the Spanish cell advocated online for “calculated ruthlessness” against its perceived enemies and to “acquire mountain land to form protected, self-sufficient and self-managed white communities”.A data dump of the Base’s Spanish Telegram activities reviewed by the Guardian contains propaganda videos, photos, and other posts with what appear to be automatic rifles and other firearms. Ted Kaczynski, the legal name of the Unabomber who sent letter bombs and other explosives to American business executives from his Montana shack during the 70s and into the 90s, also appears to be idolized by the cell.“Your liberties aren’t dying,” one message reposted by the Spanish cell reads, “they’re being killed by people with names and addresses.”Several other photos typical of the Base’s internal propagandaof the pastshow masked men holding its black flag in the Spanish countryside and stylized images of armed members in forests, along with posts espousing the benefits ofdrone warfareand survivalism.“It’s very simple,” one of its April posts reads, “we live for combat, we sacrifice ourselves for victory.”The Europolpress releaseon the arrestsshowcasesa confiscated weapons cache – items of which were clearly used in the same propaganda put out by the Base – containing what appears to be multiple firearms, a machine pistol, neo-Nazi paraphernalia, envelopes of cash, ammunition, combat knives, and shirts with Kaczynski’s and Adolf Hitler’s faces. The European law enforcement agency made it clear the cell’s leader was in direct contact with Nazzaro.“The potential ties to Russian sabotage operations in Europe, whether or not the cell members were aware of it, are also incredibly concerning,” said Fisher-Birch. “The fact that the leader of the Spanish cell was allegedly in contact with Rinaldo Nazzaro also underscores his continued role and raises the possibility that he is directing certain aspects of activity in Europe.”Currently believed to be living in St Petersburg with his Russian wife and children, Nazzaro has long been accused ofbeing a Russian intelligenceasset – an allegation that took on more seriousness when his group started offering money for assassinatingUkrainian military and political figuresover the summer in what many saw as direct collaboration with the Kremlin’s objectives.The personal history of the New Jersey native, who formerly worked for the Department of Homeland Security and with American special forces as an analyst targeting jihadist terrorists in Iraq and Afghanistan, has consistently brought with it questions. Nazzaro has denied any associations with Russian intelligence, going so far as to tell a Kremlin-controlled television channel that he had “never had any contact with any Russian security services”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Russian spies areincreasingly payingeither unknowing individuals in pre-established criminal networks or far-right activists to carry out those attacks.Both the Spanish police and Europol declined to comment on questions about the cell’s potential links to Russian intelligence operations in Europe.But stateside, the Base hasn’t lost its footprint, either. While Nazzaro and the organization have leaned on global expansion, the group is still believed to be most active inside of its founding country, even in the face of historical police scrutiny. The Base was the subject of a relentless FBI counter-terrorism investigation that led to more than a dozen arrests of its members, including three who planned a 2020 mass shooting and bombing in Virginia.“What stands out about the Spanish case is how closely it mirrors the patterns we have observed elsewhere,” said Steven Rai, an analyst at theInstitute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD)who has closely studied the Base’s global growth in recent years, “including in the United States, where Base members are pairing their ideological beliefs with offline action, including paramilitary-style training, tactical drills and shooting exercises.”In favor of investigations targeting the Trump administration’s political enemies andanti-fascist activists, and contributing resources to nationwide ICE raids, the FBI has moved away from concerning itself with groups like the Base. Multiple sources have said that the bureau, at the behest of the White House and under its director, Kash Patel, has pulled resources from pursuing cases against rightwing extremists of all stripes.“These behaviors echo the group’s earlier era between 2019 and 2020, when various members planned serious acts of violence before being arrested,” warned Rai.“It is important that law enforcement agencies, platforms, and other stakeholders remain vigilant about the broader threat posed by the Base’s underlying ideology and the online ecosystem which has crystallized around it.”This article was amended on 5 December 2025.

Four male narco-terrorists aboard the vessel were killed,” the statement added.The footage showed a large explosion suddenly overtaking a small boat as it moved through the water, followed by an image of a vessel in flames and dark smoke streaming overhead.It is the 22nd strike the US military has carried out against boats in theCaribbeanSea and eastern Pacific Ocean, bringing the death toll of the campaign to at least 87 people since September, when the strikes began.chartThe first publicly announced strike in nearly three weeks, it comes as the Pentagon and the White House have struggled to answer questions about the legal basis for the campaign to kill suspected drug smugglers. US lawmakershave promised to investigatethe first such attack, in September, in which two survivors clinging to wreckage were killed in a follow-on strike.Hegseth has faced increasing scrutiny over that strike following a report from the Washington Post that the defense secretary had verbally directed the military to “kill them all”. On Thursday, a Democratic lawmaker introduced articles of impeachment against Hegseth, pointing to the boat strike and a report that found he broke rules by sharing information on Slack about another military attack, but such an effort is unlikely to succeed.The US admiral who commanded the 2 September attacktold lawmakerson Thursday that there was no such order to kill everyone onboard the vessel. Still, Jim Himes, a Democratic congressman from Connecticut, described the footage of the strike, which reportedly showed two survivors clinging to the wreckage, as “one of the most troubling things I’ve seen in my time in public service”.“You have two individuals in clear distress, without any means of locomotion, with a destroyed vessel,” Himes said.Tom Cotton, a Republican senator from Arkansas, disagreed, saying the footage showed “two survivors trying to flip a boat loaded with drugs, bound for the United States, back over so they could stay in the fight” and that nearby “narco-terrorists” may have been coming to rescue them.Ryan Goodman, a New York University law professor and former Pentagon lawyer, scoffed at Cotton’s interpretation. “I’d love to know how Senator Cotton … was able to detect these shipwrecked people were trying to ‘stay in the fight’ versus clinging to dear life in an effort to survive,” Goodmanwrote on Bluesky.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Local customs officials filed a criminal accusation with the regional prosecutor’s office on Thursday to begin formal charging proceedings against Harris.An official with a police station in Tomigusuku, a city in southern Okinawa, confirmed that Harris remains in custody. The official declined to comment on whether Harris has admitted to the allegations.Harris’s representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment, and it was unclear whether he has retained legal representation in Japan.Harris had arrived in Okinawa for sightseeing purposes, travelling from Britain via Taiwan, where he had a flight layover, the customs spokesperson said. Okinawa is a popular resort destination about 1,500km (932 miles) south-west of Tokyo, known for its beaches and USmilitary bases.Japan maintains strict drug laws with severe penalties for possession and smuggling offences. The country has some of the toughest narcotics regulations among developed nations, with even small amounts of illegal substances resulting in criminal prosecution. Punishments, however, are not as harsh as in other Asian countries such asChinaandSingapore, where drug offenders can face the death penalty.Foreigners arrested in recent years in Japan for suspected drug offences include former Australianrugby league playerBlake Ferguson in December 2021. In 1980, former Beatle Paul McCartney was arrested after arriving in Tokyo with a bag of marijuana and was banned from entering Japan for years.Harris is also known for his acting role in Emily in Paris and for producing the HBO drama series Euphoria.Explore more on these topicsJeremy O HarrisJapanDrugsUS televisionBroadwayUS theaterTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

He was arrested inside the store minutes after the alleged theft.A photo supplied by police on Friday showed a gloved hand holding the recovered pendant, which was still attached to a long, gold chain with an intact price tag. A spokesperson said the necklace and the man would remain in police custody.The piece was a limited-edition, Fabergé egg pendant inspired by the 1983 James Bond film Octopussy. Central to the film’s plot is a jewel-smuggling operation that involves a fake Fabergé egg.The suspect is due to appear in the Auckland district court on 8 December. At a first appearance on 29 November he didn’t enter a plea to a charge of theft.Since then, officers had been stationed round the clock with the man to wait for the evidence to emerge.On Wednesday, Inspector Grae Anderson said in a statement: “Given this man is in police custody, we have a duty of care to continue monitoring him given the circumstances of what has occurred.”The store’s website says the egg, one of only 50 made, is crafted from gold, painted with green enamel and encrusted with 183 diamonds and two sapphires. The pendant is 8.4cm (3.3in) tall and is mounted on a stand.“The egg opens to reveal an 18ct yellow gold octopus nestled inside, adorned with white diamond suckers and black diamond eyes,” an item description said. “The octopus surprise pays homage to the eponymous antagonist at the centre of the Octopussy film.”Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Accustomed to seeing animals in the pet-friendly bar, co-owner Bella Evans initially assumed the visitor was a dog before she took a closer look.“Everyone was in shock,” Evans said. “Oh my gosh. What do we do? What’s going on?”The creature was apparently lost and curious. Scientists refer to anannual “silly season” for seals and sea lions, a period of months during which they regularly appear in strange places – houses, golf courses or busy roads.A customer grabbed a sweater and tried to usher the seal out of the back door. Evading its pursuers, the creature dashed into a bathroom and then hid under the dishwasher, which was swiftly unplugged.Living with lions: the New Zealand city where humans and sea lions co-existRead moreAnother customer fetched a dog crate from home, and Evans made a plan to lure the visitor out of its hiding place using a pizza topping the pub was offering as a special. “I just went to my fiance, I said, ‘grab the salmon! Grab the salmon!’”Then it was a brief wait for conservation rangers to arrive. It turned out they were already tracking the wandering seal.“It was their fourth call for the day,” Evans said. “They had been driving around this new-build subdivision trying to find this baby seal.”New Zealand’s Department of Conservation (DoC) confirmed it received “numerous” reports from the public about a seal spotted in Richmond on Sunday before it turned up at the pub. Bar staff “did a great job keeping the seal safe” until rangers arrived, said DoC spokesperson Helen Otley.The seal was released on nearby Rabbit Island, considered a safe location because of its dog-free status, Otley said. It’snot unusual for curious young seals to show up in unexpected placesat this time of year, she added, as they follow rivers and streams up to 15 km (9 miles) inland.“They can turn up in unusual places, like this pub, but this is normal exploratory behaviour,” Otley said.Successful conservation programs in New Zealand have resulted in growing seal and sea lion populations, bringing them into closer contact with humans than before.Evans, who has owned the pub with her partner for just a few months, said the baby fur seal was the first patron she’s had to evict. But she said the animal, named Fern by staff, was welcome back.“There’s been the running joke that we’ve got the seal of approval,” she said.Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandAnimalsAsia PacificWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

He said Labor was making a deliberate push to build support in Coalition heartland, such as Queensland’s Sunshine Coast.In a blunt assessment, Swan said local Labor branches can be “too much of a closed-shop from time to time” and the party needed to be better at “engaging with people and talking with them, and not at them”.“We’re not engaged in some pilgrimage espousing the gospel,” he said.“We have to meet people where they are, and we have to meet people in the way in which they interact with people, not in some highly stylised political way.”Is 2026 the year Albanese’s political honeymoon ends? – podcastRead moreProgressive critics have marked down the Albanese government for eschewing major reform, such as winding back negative gearing or re-introducing a carbon tax, in favour of incremental progress on climate, housing, health and education.Swan – who oversaw the response to the 2007 global financial crisis – said the government had a “pretty strong centre-left agenda” that reflected the core of Labor’s mission to “create prosperity so we can spread opportunity”.But he said the party should be prepared to debate more contentious policies, predicting a contest of ideas at Labor’s three-yearly national conference in Adelaide next July.Swan will step down asALP presidentat the conference, with former Labor minister Kate Ellis to assume the role.“I think we’ll have a debate in the Labor party about the extent to which our agenda could go further in some areas,” he said.“There will inevitably be a debate about what particular areas of policy we might want to do more in. Can we afford to do it? Do we have the revenue to do it?“We shouldn’t be afraid of having that debate as we go forward and looking about at the policy alternatives before us, and indeed, that’s what we do through our national conference process.”Asked what risks Labor faced if it failed to evolve at an organisational level and with its policies, Swan was blunt.“We end up looking like the Democrats in the US or any number of once large, proud, centre-right parties around the world that have collapsed,” he said.“I’m not suggesting we are going to die. We can continue to prosper if we are true to our creed … we can continue to succeed where many others have failed.”Explore more on these topicsLabor partyAustralian politicsWayne SwannewsShareReuse this content"

(The influencer did not respond to a request for comment.)View image in fullscreenGLP-1 drugs such as Ozempic and Mounjaro are now among the best known peptides.Photograph: Science Photo Library/AlamyHe is one operator riding the social media-driven boom for injectable peptides in Australia – a market of drugs purported to enhance aesthetic appearance and physical performance. Yet many are experimental and illegal to possess without a prescription.Advertising prescription-only or unapproved drugsto the public, including onsocial media, is also prohibited. But that hasn’t stopped a range of influencers from providing dosing instructions and promoting them as the path to everything from fat loss to tanned skin.The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) declined to comment on specific websites or accounts, but said the agency had requested the removal of more than 13,700 online ads, many involving wellness and beauty therapeutic goods, in the 2024–25 financial year.“In general … prescription medicines and unapproved therapeutic goods cannot be advertised to the public, including via testimonials and endorsements,” a spokesperson said.The peptide market in Australia has two broad entry points. One is direct sales from overseas or from an online retailer such as the one promoted by the influencer. The other is where drugs are obtained via prescription from doctors associated with wellness sites, which is legalin specific circumstancesprovided “all other clinically appropriate options” have been considered.What are peptides?Peptides, the building blocks of proteins, occur naturally but can also be manufactured. They have varied functions in the body – insulin and endorphins being two examples. GLP-1 drugs such as Ozempic and Mounjaro are now among the best-known peptides.Yet there is limited evidence for the safety and efficacy in humans of some of the peptides most often mentioned on social media.Dr Ian Musgrave, a molecular pharmacologist at the University of Adelaide, says injecting many unapproved peptides amounts to “just punching holes in yourself and wasting money”.“Most of these have shown some form of activity in either in vitro models – tissue culture and so on – or animal models, but they haven’t been confirmed in humans clinical trials,” he says.Musgrave gives the example of AOD-9604, which is marketed as a fat burning drug and was injected by Essendon players in the 2013 AFL supplements scandal.“Even though it’s worked in animal models, it failed utterly in humans – it has no effect on weight loss in humans in clinical trials at all,” he says.“Every time you inject yourself with a substance, there is a potential for harm. If you’re injecting peptides then you have a risk of having an immune response to those peptides … which may be dangerous.”‘Laboratory use only’On forums dedicated to GLP-1 weight loss drugs, China-based vendors advertise shipping times to Australia. Price lists shared by Telegram sellers with Guardian Australia advertise 10 vials of retatrutide for $240, while human growth hormone – also a peptide – goes for much less.Guardian Australia has found almost two dozen websites claiming to sell these products to Australians for “research purposes”, yet many also offerindividual dosing calculatorsand display customer testimonials. In some cases, fitness influencers promote discount codes for suppliers that claim to supply laboratories.Business and website records show several of these sites appear to be owned by men in their early 20s based in suburban Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.One company, owned by a 23-year-old in Melbourne, advertises “Premium. Pure. Reta” and ships directly to consumers. Nevertheless, the website says the products are for “laboratory use only”.The TGA spokesperson said medicines imported into and supplied in Australia generally must be included in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods.Unapproved therapeutic goods can only be legally imported for clinical trials or for personal use withstrict conditions, and the TGA hasissued finesfor alleged unlawful import of unapproved peptides.Many unapproved peptides are classified as “poisons for which possession without authority is illegal”.View image in fullscreenPeter Magic estimates that this year the lab has completed almost 3,000 purity reports for the weight loss drug tirzepatide, better known as Mounjaro.Photograph: Niall Carson/PA“You cannot get around those regulations by providing ‘for research purposes’ only,” says Prof Nial Wheate, a medicines researcher at Macquarie University. “Anyone who accepts that compound must have a legal reason to have it, and for most people that means you must have a valid prescription.”Retatrutide, a Lilly GLP-1 drug, is undergoingclinical trialsin Australia but is advertised for sale across “research” sites.A spokesperson for Lilly said no one could legally sell it for human use. “Counterfeit, black-market, and research-use only medicines are untested, unregulated and potentially dangerous,” they said.Peter Magic has seen first-hand the remarkable boom in grey and black market peptides.His company Janoshik was one of the earliest labs to offer a purity testing service for anyone willing to pay and send a sample to the Czech Republic – Janoshik certificates are now displayed as markers of authenticity on the websites of both “research peptide” sellers and major manufacturers in China.Until about 2022, Magic says, anabolic steroids were the most common product sent to the lab for testing. Then GLP-1s “exploded overnight”.He estimates that this year the lab has completed almost 3,000 purity reports (which might include multiple vials) for the weight loss drug tirzepatide, better known as Mounjaro, 2,300 for retatrutide and more than 1,000 for BPC-157 and GHK-Cu.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Magic has found some mislabelling of products – most dangerously, items sold as Ozempic pens that actually contain insulin – but said he has generally seen accurate results for peptide purity.Nevertheless, a vendor’s Janoshik certificate is no guarantee of what is actually sent to consumers.“There’s a saying I like: don’t trust, verify,” Magic said. “I generally advise people against trusting people on the internet.”Dr Timothy Piatkowski, a lecturer at Griffith University, ran a product testing service as part of his research into harm reduction approaches for performance enhancing drugs (IPEDs) such as anabolic steroids obtained from underground markets.He says people also submitted human growth hormone, retatrutide and “every other sort of peptide that I could mention”.His testing ofIPEDsfound mislabelled products and tracesof carcinogenic heavy metals such as lead, arsenic and cadmium.Of almost 300 submitted samples of steroids in one year, he estimates only about one in five had the right steroid in them and about 70% were underdosed.View image in fullscreenA Belgian study that tested peptides acquired from unregulated internet pharmacies – including ipamorelin, melanotan II, pictured, and thymosin β4 – found contamination with lead and arsenic.Photograph: Richard Watkins/Alamy“This is the same market,” he says of peptide products advertised for wellness benefits. “It is a lucrative business for people playing in the grey area, because who are you going to tell [if the product is not what it claims]? There’s no receipt. I can’t go and take this to Fair Trade … There’s nothing you can do.”Sonya Weith is a peer steroid educator with Queensland Injectors Voice for Advocacy and Action (QuIVAA) who talks to IPED users about harm reduction.She says she noticed a rise in the number of questions about peptides from about June, particularly related to safe injecting, often of products mailed from overseas.“We don’t know the dosage,” she says. “We don’t know the strength. And we don’t know if there’s anything else in there that could cause harm.”The ‘Wolverine stack’The rise of so-called research peptide retailers is one side of the peptide boom. The other is wellness clinics, which advertise peptide prescription services, often via compounding pharmacies.Many peptides are classified as prescription-only and, though they are unapproved therapeutic goods, they can be legally accessed under certain circumstances.But there are legal challenges, particularly around health claims. In 2019, Peptide Clinics Australiawas fined $10mfor inappropriate and misleading advertising, including suggesting its peptide products would help with anti-ageing, bodybuilding and tanning, among other issues.Over the past five years, at least eight doctors, health practitioners and pharmacists in New South Wales alone have had licences cancelled or been reprimanded for inappropriately prescribing or dispensing peptides.Over the past five years, eight doctors and pharmacists in New South Wales alone have had licences cancelledWhen a Guardian Australia reporter sent an inquiry to one clinic, they were sent a price list of potential peptides for prescription, including unapproved therapeutic goods, before any consultation had taken place with a nurse or doctor.Speaking generally, the TGA spokesperson said stating prices in reference to prescription-only peptides “is likely to be considered an advertisement for that product, and would therefore be unlawful”.Piatkowski questions the quality of follow-up care, if any, from some online pharmacies.“Do they have medical supervision? Are they doing blood monitoring?” he says. “It’s just a marketing ploy.”Sarah (not her real name) is one of an unknown number of Australians now on a peptide regime for fitness.In her mid-50s, she enjoys high-intensity workouts and was looking for a way to recover more quickly. She found a doctor via a local IV clinic and is now prescribed the “Wolverine stack” – a combination of peptides. Every few months, she cycles in a growth hormone. The products are sent to her chilled in the mail from a compounding chemist.Sarah is a fan, but she can also see the hype cycle at work in the longevity scene.“It’s getting sensationalised,” Sarah says. “And so people will start taking advantage of people … I would think, be wary. I mean, this is something that you’re injecting into your body.”Do you know more?

In its complaint, Comms Declare said describing gas as clean and green was false and misleading as it suggested the fuel had a neutral or positive impact on the environment and was less harmful than alternatives.Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletterIt said in reality gas was mostly composed of methane, a short-lived but potent fossil fuel.The Ad Standards panel agreed the ads breached three sections of its environmental claims code. It said the claim was “misleading and unsubstantiated, was vague, and did not communicate a genuine environmental benefit”.The panel said CNG buses were originally introduced to provide more environmentally responsible transport than diesel buses, but transport solutions had evolved dramatically over the past 20 years and now included cleaner electric, hydrogen and hybrid alternatives.Comms Declare said multiple studies from across the globe had found buses that ran on CNG resulted in a roughly similar amount of greenhouse gas emissions being released into the atmosphere as buses that ran on diesel. It highlighted Adelaide Metro wasnow replacing its bus fleetwith electric vehicles that it described as “better for the environment”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After a winter storm brought 20-30cm of snow across Wisconsin, and even up to 35cm in placeslast weekend, the focus of the winter weather hazards shifted elsewhere early this week.A storm system moving south-east over Wyoming andColoradobrought a continuous period of snowfall until Thursday morning. Central Colorado and northern New Mexico bore the brunt of the snowfall with accumulations reaching 30cm in places. The heavy snowfall across the Denver region was its first of the winter and caused widespread disruption to flights into and out of Denver on Wednesday and Thursday. Almost 1,000 flights were delayed or cancelled as a result of the treacherous conditions.An area of dense fog helped to worsen conditions in northern Colorado on Thursday morning. The National Weather Service issued a dense fog advisory for Thursday, warning of visibilities down to 100-200 metres in places.With snowfall from this week’s system easing, another winter storm is set to move in this weekend. Heavy snowfall will resume across the Rocky Mountains from Friday, and along with strong winds will create drifting snow and blizzard conditions. Abnormally cold weather will continue across large swathes of central and northern US this early winter.View image in fullscreenA person walks a dog on a slushy street after a winter snow storm in Pottsville, Pennsylvania.Photograph: Matt Rourke/APTo start Australia’s summer season, the country has experienced contrasting weather – freezing temperatures and settling snow over mountainous parts of the south-east, and a widespread heatwave to the west with temperatures rising above 40C. Temperatures will continue to increase this week, with daytime temperature maximumsexpected to reach the mid-40sin central Australia by the weekend.Through this week and into next, the heatwave is expected to spread through the rest of the country. The intense heat will affect residents and tourists, particularly the most vulnerable. The wildfire risk has sharply risen, with the Australian Bureau of Meteorology issuing a fire weather warning for southern New South Wales for Friday. People have been advised to stay indoors and to keep air conditioning running, as warnings for many places will remain into next week.Explore more on these topicsSnowWeather trackerWisconsinColoradoWyomingDenveranalysisShareReuse this content"

It adds: “Should present trends continue, the continent will be unrecognisable in 20 years or less.”US policies must therefore include “cultivating resistance to Europe’s current trajectory within European nations” as well as enabling Europe to “take primary responsibility for its own defence” and “opening European markets to US goods and services”.Responding to the strategy document on Friday, Germany’s foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, said the US remained a vital ally on security but “questions of freedom of expression or the organisation of our free societies” did not fall into that category.“We see ourselves as being able to discuss and debate these matters entirely on our own in the future, and do not need outside advice,” he said.View image in fullscreenGermany’s Johann Wadephul rejected the need for ‘outside advice’ from the US.Photograph: Tobias Schwarz/AFP/Getty ImagesThe policy document, released by the White House late on Thursday, underscores the Trump administration’s clear alignment with Europe’s far-right nationalist parties, whose policies centre on attacking supposed EU overreach and excessive non-EU migration.In language that will appear extraordinary to close allies, it says the US should “stand up for genuine democracy, freedom of expression and unapologetic celebrations of European nations’ individual character and history”, adding that Washington “encourages its political allies in Europe to promote this revival of spirit”.With far-right parties in government, supporting rightwing coalitions or leading in the polls in several EU member states, the document says the “growing influence of patriotic European parties … gives cause for great optimism”.The Trump administration has repeatedly sought to foster closer ties with Europe’s nationalist parties, including Germany’s far-right Alternative für Deutschland. In September a senior AfD party figure visited the White House for meetings with senior officials.On immigration, the strategy document appears to endorse the “great replacement” conspiracy theory, which claims ethnic white European populations are deliberately being replaced by people of colour. It says it is “more than plausible” that “within a few decades at the latest” some EuropeanNatomembers “will become majority non-European”.It claims Europe must “remain European, regain its civilisational self-confidence and abandon its failed focus on regulatory suffocation”, arguing that the continent’s lack of assurance is evident in its relationship with Russia.As Trump seeks an end to the Ukraine war that would most likely favour Russia gaining territory, the document accuses Europeans of showing weakness. Despite a “significant hard power advantage”, it says, many on the continent “regard Russia as an existential threat”.It argues it is a “core interest of the US to negotiate an expeditious cessation of hostilities in Ukraine” but that Washington “finds itself at odds with European officials who hold unrealistic expectations for the war perched in unstable minority governments, many of which trample on basic principles of democracy to suppress opposition”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It also says the US “needs a strong Europe to help us successfully compete and to work in concert with us to prevent any adversary from dominating Europe”.It adds that Washington wants to “work with aligned countries that want to restore their former greatness”.The top Democrat on the US Senate foreign relations committee, Jeanne Shaheen, said: “This plan, and the administration’s approach, is riddled with contradictions. President Trump rightly wants our European allies to step up on their own defense but undercuts their ability to do so by actively promoting far-rightwing, pro-Russian political parties.“By drawing an equivalence between our European allies and murderers in the Kremlin, this strategy at least explains why President Trump has been so inept at ending the war in Ukraine.

Broadcasters voted only to introduce new rules designed to stop governments and third parties from disproportionately promoting songs to influence voters.“A large majority of members agreed that there was no need for a further vote on participation and that the Eurovision song contest 2026 should proceed as planned, with the additional safeguards in place,” the EBU said in a statement.This “large majority” amounted to 65% of delegates voting in favour of the changes to the song contest and no further discussion on participation of Israel, while 23% voted against and 10% abstained.Some countries had raised concerns over undue promotion methods after Israel topped the public vote at the contest in May, finishing second overall when the jury votes were taken into consideration. InIreland, the broadcaster RTÉ has called for an audit of the public vote.RTÉ said on Thursday it would be “unconscionable” to participate in the 2026 contest if Israel also took part “given the appalling loss of lives and the humanitarian crisis” in Gaza.The Slovenian broadcaster RTV SLO said it would be boycotting the contest “on behalf of the 20,000 children who died in Gaza”.View image in fullscreenVoting result on voting reform to Eurovision song contest at EBU general assembly 4 December 2025.Photograph: Lisa O’CarrollOf the boycotting countries, the Netherlands participated in the song contest’s inaugural edition in 1956. Ireland shares with Sweden the record for most Eurovision wins, with seven.Ireland’s prime minister, Micheál Martin, said on Friday he “fully understands” his country’s withdrawal from the song contest, describing it as an “act of solidarity”.So far, no further countries have joined in the boycott. Sweden’s national broadcaster SVT confirmed on Friday it would take part in the 2026 contest, after speculation that it might pull out over Israel’s confirmed participation.“The new rules mean, among other things, that governments refrain from campaigns, fewer votes per participant and that professional jury panels are once again introduced in the semi-finals”, SVT said.“Technical security is also being strengthened to avoid vote fraud. This – combined with the result of the vote – is in line with the conditions that SVT has set for participating in Eurovision: a broad European support and a competition that is as apolitical as possible.”Nordic countries including Finland, Norway, Denmark and Iceland expressed support for the EBU’s public voting changes on Thursday.The Icelandic broadcaster RUV, which had previously reserved the right not to participate, said it would consider its position at a board meeting on Wednesday.The BBC has until spring to decide if it will participate as it is holding a selection process through the music industry rather than a public runoff.Explore more on these topicsEurovisionAustriaIsraelSpainIrelandSloveniaNetherlandsnewsShareReuse this content"

However, the pictures and audio have been reworked so that the speakers are encouraging women going through menopause to buy products such as probiotics and Himalayan shilajit from the company’s website.The revelations have prompted calls for social media giants to be much more careful about hosting AI-generated content and quicker to remove content that distorts prominent people’s views.“This is certainly a sinister and worrying new tactic,” said Leo Benedictus, the factchecker who undertook the investigation, which Full Fact published on Friday.‘It was about degrading someone completely’: the story of Mr DeepFakes – the world’s most notorious AI porn siteRead moreHe added that the creators of deepfake health videos deploy AI so that “someone well-respected or with a big audience appears to be endorsing these supplements to treat a range of ailments”.Prof David Taylor-Robinson, an expert in health inequalities at Liverpool University, is among those whose image has been manipulated. In August, he was shocked to find that TikTok was hosting 14 doctored videos purporting to show him recommending products with unproven benefits.Though Taylor-Robinson is a specialist in children’s health, in one video the cloned version of him was talking about an alleged menopause side-effect called “thermometer leg”.The fake Taylor-Robinson recommended that women in menopause should visit a website called Wellness Nest and buy what it called a natural probiotic featuring “10 science-backed plant extracts, including turmeric, black cohosh, Dim [diindolylmethane] and moringa, specifically chosen to tackle menopausal symptoms”.Female colleagues “often report deeper sleep, fewer hot flushes and brighter mornings within weeks”, the deepfake doctor added.The real Taylor-Robinson discovered that his likeness was being used only when a colleague alerted him. “It was really confusing to begin with – all quite surreal,” he said. “My kids thought it was hilarious.View image in fullscreenBlack cohosh supplement pills.Photograph: Julie Woodhouse/Alamy“I didn’t feel desperately violated, but I did become more and more irritated at the idea of people selling products off the back of my work and the health misinformation involved.”The footage of Taylor-Robinson used to make the deepfake videos came from a talk on vaccination he gave at a PublicHealthEngland (PHE) conference in 2017 and a parliamentary hearing on child poverty at which he gave evidence in May this year.In one misleading video, he was depicted swearing and making misogynistic comments while discussing menopause.TikTok took down the videos six weeks after Taylor-Robinson complained. “Initially, they said some of the videos violated their guidelines but some were fine. That was absurd – and weird – because I was in all of them and they were all deepfakes. It was a faff to get them taken down,” he said.Full Fact found that TikTok was also carrying eight deepfakes featuring doctored statements by Duncan Selbie, the former chief executive of PHE. Like Taylor-Robinson, he was falsely shown talking about menopause, using video taken from the same 2017 event where Taylor-Robinson spoke.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It wasn’t funny in the sense that people pay attention to these things.”Full Fact also found similar deepfakes on X, Facebook and YouTube, all linked to Wellness Nest or a linked British outlet called Wellness Nest UK. It has posted apparent deepfakes of high-profile doctors such as Prof Tim Spector and another diet expert, the late Dr Michael Mosley.View image in fullscreenMichael Mosley.Photograph: TT News Agency/AlamyWellness Nest told Full Fact that deepfake videos encouraging people to visit the firm’s website were “100% unaffiliated” with its business. It said it had “never used AI-generated content”, but “cannot control or monitor affiliates around the world”.Helen Morgan, the Liberal Democrat health spokesperson, said: “From fake doctors to bots that encourage suicide, AI is being used to prey on innocent people and exploit the widening cracks in our health system.“Liberal Democrats are calling for AI deepfakes posing as medical professionals to be stamped out, with clinically approved tools strongly promoted so we can fill the vacuum.“If these were individuals fraudulently pretending to be doctors they would face criminal prosecution. Why is the digital equivalent being tolerated?“Where someone seeks health advice from an AI bot they should be automatically referred to NHS support so they can get the diagnosis and treatment they actually need, with criminal liability for those profiting from medical disinformation.”A TikTok spokesperson said:“We have removed this content [relating to Taylor-Robinson and Selbie] for breaking our rules against harmful misinformation and behaviours that seek to mislead our community, such as impersonation.“Harmfully misleading AI-generated content is an industry-wide challenge, and we continue to invest in new ways to detect and remove content that violates our community guidelines.”The Department of Health and Social Care was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsHealthDeepfakeSocial mediaTikTokArtificial intelligence (AI)MedicineInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

She’d feel more at home there.”After days of pressure,Reform UKsaid on Friday it had revoked Cooper’s party membership. He is also no longer the leader of Staffordshire county council, a local authority responsible for more than a million people.A Reform UK spokesperson said: “Following an investigation into the failure to declare social media accounts during the candidate vetting process, Cllr Ian Cooper has had his membership of Reform UK revoked.”Cooper, who has not responded to the allegations, was Reform’s parliamentary candidate for Tamworth in a byelection in 2023 and again in last year’s general election.He was elected as leader of Staffordshire county council in May as Reform won swathes of local authority seats acrossEnglandand he is listed as the interim chair of the party’s Tamworth branch.Nine Labour MPs from across the region called for Cooper to resign over the posts, which were first revealed by the anti-fascist group Hope Not Hate andshared with the Guardian.Cooper and Staffordshire county council have not responded to repeated requests for comment.In posts shared with the Guardian this week, Cooper allegedly told the broadcaster Sangita Myska this year that she was English “only in your dreams”, adding: “You are neither ethnically, culturally or historically English. Your diaspora isn’t NW European. All you have is a piece of paper entitling you to British citizenship.”In another post a year ago, he allegedly said it was “a lie” that diversity was Britain’s strength and claimed that migrants from the “global majority south” were “intent on colonising the UK, destroying all that has gone before”.He is also alleged to have said diversity, equity and inclusion schemes were disguising “oppression” and enabling a situation “where indigenous people are actively removed or excluded and not allowed to complain”.Two otherReform UKpoliticians were suspended last month over offensive messages. Laura Anne Jones, the sole Reform UK member of the Senedd, hadused a racial slurin a discussion about the potential threat of China using TikTok for espionage.In Lancashire, the councillor Tom Pickupwas suspendedfor calling Keir Starmer a “dicktaker” in a post to a WhatsApp group where members allegedly called for “mass Islam genocide”.Reform UK said Martin Murray, previously Staffordshire county council’s deputy leader, had been appointed interim leader until the group elected a new permanent leader.A spokesperson for Staffordshire county council said: “Reform UK has confirmed this evening that they have revoked the party membership of Ian Cooper, the leader of Staffordshire county council.“Reform UK has announced that Martin Murray will be the interim leader of the council’s Reform UK group. Any proposals to nominate a new leader of the council will need to be agreed at a meeting of full council.

It’s an investment in the future of the children who are affected by poverty,” he said.McFadden added that further changes to the welfare system to encourage work were important for improving children’s lives, arguing that getting people into jobs will make families better off and save money on the benefits bill.The flagship policy in the strategy is the government’s pledge to end the two-child limit on universal credit, at a cost of £3bn to the Treasury. The move is expected to lift 450,000 children out of poverty by 2031.Other measures in the package include helping parents choose cheaper baby formula, getting families out of temporary accommodation faster, establishing breakfast clubs and extending free school lunches.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer visits a children’s centre in Cardiff on Friday.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PALabour MPs are delighted with the move to scrap the two-child limit, and won a victory in July whenthey forced ministers to abandon plans to cut disability benefits.However, McFadden said it would be a “mistake” for anyone to think the government was not aiming for further changes to the welfare system.“I think because of what happened in July, there’s been a conclusion that no reform is happening. That’s a mistake. Reform is happening. But I think we will need more in the future, too,” he told the Guardian as he toured aLittle Village baby bankin north London that has supported more than 11,000 families with the cost of living.In a sign he will pursue further significant changes, McFadden said: “I don’t think the right thing to do with the welfare system is just to circle the wagons around a system that is not delivering as well as it should and has such significantly rising costs.“We should see this system as not just about the distribution of benefits but ask ourselves: does it do everything it can to help people into work? I don’t think it does right now, and so there is a case for further reform to the system and there’s also reform happening [now].”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Finally, this government has found its mission | Polly ToynbeeRead moreThe chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has also saidthe benefits bill cannot “remain untouched”. Two reviews are under way:the Timms reviewlooking at the disability benefits system, and another headed byAlan Milburn, examining youth inactivity.Asked whether he was planning to cut people’s payments or reduce eligibility for benefits, McFadden said: “I can’t say yet and I don’t want to start ruling things in or ruling things out.“What it will involve is us asking the question: how do we deal with rising inactivity among the young and what can we offer to enhance people’s opportunity and the chance to get into work right across different government departments?”He said it was wrong to look at taking out costs from the welfare system without considering how changes would help people back into work – improving their finances and prospects as well as generating tax revenue for the Treasury.“If a young person gets on to benefits and stays on them, they will lose out about a million pounds in earnings over the course of their life and it will cost the state about a million pounds too,” he said.“Rather than approaching this the way that it has [been] done in the past, where people say: ‘I’m going to take a figure of X billion, and then retrofit a policy on to that,’ think about that million pounds.“Every person we can get into work and not have them on benefits for years is earning and paying tax. That does save money on the benefits bill and I think that’s a good thing if that’s the way that we save money on the benefits.”McFadden also firmly rejected the Conservative’s claim that last month’s budget would help those on benefits more than those in work. He said the two-child limit brought in by the Conservative government in 2017 was “never really about saving money on the benefits bill”.“It has always been seen in part as a political dividing line with children used as the weapon of choice,” he added. “I think setting this up as some sort of division between the working and the non-working is just factually wrong.”Explore more on these topicsWelfareBenefitsChild benefitsPovertyChildrenPat McFaddenLabournewsShareReuse this content"

However, it’s disappointing that we had not previously been told about this, despite regular engagement with the Home Office and police bodies as part of our wider work to hold government and the public sector to account on how data is being used in their services.“While we appreciate the valuable role technology can play, public confidence in its use is paramount, and any perception of bias and discrimination can exacerbate mistrust. The ICO is here to support and assist the public sector to get this right.”Police and crime commissioners said publication of the NPL’s finding “sheds light on a concerning inbuilt bias” and urged caution over plans for a national expansion, which could include cameras being placed at shopping centres, stadiums and transport hubs, without putting in place adequate safeguards.The findings were released on Thursday, hours after Sarah Jones, the policing minister, had described the technology as the “biggest breakthrough since DNA matching”.Facial recognition technology scans people’s faces and cross-references the images against watchlists of known or wanted criminals. It can be used while examining live footage of people passing cameras, comparing their faces with those on wanted lists, or to enable officers to target individuals as they walk by mounted cameras.Police officers can also retrospectively run images of suspects through police, passport or immigration databases to identify them and check their backgrounds.Analysts who examined the police national database’s retrospective facial recognition technology tool at a lower setting found that “the false positive identification rate (FPIR) for white subjects (0.04%) is lower than that for Asian subjects (4.0%) and black subjects (5.5%)”.The testing found that the number of false positives for black women was particularly high. “The FPIR for black male subjects (0.4%) is lower than that for black female subjects (9.9%),” the report said.Responding to the report, a Home Office spokesperson said the department took the findings “seriously”, and had already taken action, including procuring and testing a new algorithm “which has no statistically significant bias”.“Given the importance of this issue, we have also asked the police inspectorate, alongside the forensic science regulator, to review law enforcement’s use of facial recognition. They will assess the effectiveness of the mitigations, which the National Police Chiefs’ Council supports,” the spokesperson said.Explore more on these topicsFacial recognitionData visualisationsPoliceRegulatorsHome OfficeRacenewsShareReuse this content"

For example, someone could ask the AI platform to generate a song about a boozy night out in the style of a Britpop band, and it would draw on songs with similar sounds and themes to create its own.In recent weeks, Universal and Warner have partnered with the AI platforms Udio and Suno respectively, so that anyone can make their own music based on the work of the artists signed to those labels, or manipulate and remix existing songs.“Everybody should be selling or licensing their voice and their skills to these companies,” Stewart said. “Otherwise they’re just going to take it anyway.”That is countered by the companies and big labels, which have said their artists would have to opt into the services and would then receive royalties from the use of the work by AI companies.Stewart, who had nine UK Top 10 albums and as many singles with Eurythmics, forecast big upheavals in the music industry from AI and other forces, even after the ructions of piracy and streaming in recent years. “There’s going to be a disintegration of giant corporations controlling their artists,” he said.He was speaking as he launched Rare Entity, a new venture hoping to be part of that disintegration.Stewart said artists tended to be “right at the bottom” in a corporate structure, and made to feel thankful for a deal that was “usually terrible”. Rare Entity aimed to give creatives across disciplines total control and ownership of their work, rather than them giving up their rights to record labels or other companies. And in the fast-moving world of digital technology, the speed at which AI has taken hold is a clear warning to artists about the importance of owning their work and therefore being in control of how – and whether – it was used by AI platforms and others.Set up with the entrepreneurs Dom Joseph and Rich Britton, Rare Entity offers to financially support projects being developed, as well as ideas that may need creative and commercial help. Rare Entity does not seek to own the underlying intellectual property but instead to take a share in the earnings generated by the funded venture. Examples of projects up and running include Planet Fans, a platform for artists and their teams to communicate with fans about ticketing, merchandise and more.Stewart said the idea was initially inspired in the early 1980s by him and Annie Lennox having to get a £5,000 bank loan to get Eurythmics going. It began properly percolating in 2002 when he organised a gathering in the boardroom of Deutsche Bank in New York.“I invited various people,” Stewart said. “Lou Reed, Stevie Wonder, Dr Dre, Dr Dre’s lawyer. I was explaining, with the advent of the internet that artists better start thinking in a different way, create their own world and take control back of whatever they could take control back of.”As someone fighting for creative autonomy as well as an evangelist for the transformative power of technology, Stewart says he is not as anxious as other musicians about generative AI. In the right hands, just like his first drum machine, it should be wielded as a creative tool – but never as a total replacement for creativity.He says people in creative sectors should all studyGilbert and George’s Ten Commandmentsfor artists. “My favourite one is: ‘Thou shalt not know exactly what thou dost, but thou shalt do it.’”Explore more on these topicsDave StewartArtificial intelligence (AI)Pop and rockIntellectual propertyMusic industrynewsShareReuse this content"

By the time she arrived, she said, the protesters had “stopped” a squadron of dozens of mostly masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.The protesters, Grijalva said, were “afraid that they were taking people without due process”.A second video shared by Grijalva’s official account on social mediashowsa chaotic standoff between federal agents in tactical gear and protesters carrying anti-ICE signs. In the footage, Grijalva, a progressive Democratic representative, who has been sharply critical of the Trump administration’s immigration policy, can be seen approaching the officers, as an agent sprays an orange chemical in the direction of the protesters alongside her. She then urges the officers to “calm down” and “get out” as she coughs. The agent holding a spray can orders the group to “get out of the way” as protestors yell.US citizen chased by ICE in New Orleans says she was targeted because ‘I’m brown’Read moreIn a video clip taken from another angle, a projectile lands behind Grijalva, producing a cloud at the her feet as she steps toward an officer.“When I presented myself as a Member of Congress asking for more information, I was pushed aside and pepper sprayed,” she wrote.In a statement, DHS said immigration agents’ actions were not aimed at the representative.“If her claims were true, this would be a medical marvel,” the DHS spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, said. “But they’re not true. She wasn’t pepper sprayed. She was in the vicinity of someone whowaspepper sprayed as they were obstructing and assaulting law enforcement.”McLaughlin said two law enforcement officers were “seriously injured” during the clash.“Presenting one’s self as a ‘Member of Congress’ doesn’t give you the right to obstruct law enforcement,” she added, promising “more information forthcoming”.In a statement, Fernando Burgos, an ICE spokesperson, said special agents as well as officers from the agency’s homeland security investigations were “executing 16 search warrants” across southern Arizona as part of a “years-long investigation into immigration and tax violations”. Multiple individuals were taken into custody during the operation, he said.In a video filmed shortly after the incident, Grijalva, still coughing, says she arrived on the scene because she believed it was “important for me to have eyes on what’s happening here”.“I literally was not being aggressive, I was asking for clarification, which is my right as a member of Congress,” she said, adding: “I just can only imagine if they’re going to treat me like that, how they’re treating everybody else.”Grijalva and other local officials praised the Tucson police department for helping to calm the situation.In ajoint statement, Regina Romero, the Tucson mayor and Lane Santa Cruz, the vice-mayor, both Democrats, said the enforcement operation in Tucson had “rapidly escalated into violence against the public”.“Their disproportionate use of force, smoke grenades and pepper balls against the public, including our own Representative Adelita Grijalva, is not justified and cannot be tolerated,” they wrote, encouraging bystanders to share video and photographs of the incident for “potential investigation and follow-up”.Arizona Democrats rallied around Grijalva. The representative Greg Stantondenouncedthe incident as “outrageous” while the representative Yassamin Ansari called it “absolutely unacceptable”. Senator Ruben Gallegowrote: “Pepper-spraying a sitting member of Congress is disgraceful, unacceptable, and absolutely not what we voted for. Period.”At a town hall in Tucson later that day, senator Mark Kelly called it “horrific”.Grijalva was elected to Congress in September, winning a special election to fill the seat left vacant by the death of her father, the late representative Raúl Grijalva. However, she was not sworn in as a member of Congress until last month, after the House returned from a weeks-long recess during the federal government shutdown.“If federal agents are brazen enough to fire pellets directly at a Member of Congress,” Grijalva wrote on Friday, “imagine how they behave when encountering defenseless members of our community.”Explore more on these topicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)ArizonaHouse of RepresentativesnewsShareReuse this content"

Gouvea said he was using a pellet gun to hunt rats nearby, according to a police report.He reached a deal last month to resolve a charge that he illegally discharged a pellet gun under which he would serve six months of pre-trial probation and pay $386.59 in restitution. Other charges he faced for disturbing the peace, disorderly conduct, and vandalism were dismissed as part of the deal.Despite the Trump administration’s claims, the Temple Beth Zion has previously told its community members that the incident did not appear to have been fueled by antisemitism, a view shared by the Brookline police department, which investigated the matter.The temple has said that police informed it that Gouvea was “unaware that he lived next to, and was shooting his BB gun next to, a synagogue or that it was a religious holiday”.Explore more on these topicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Harvard UniversityUS politicsUS immigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

The state quickly filed a lawsuit, with Newsom calling the move unprecedented and illegal, and the case has been unfolding in the courts for months.During a hearing in San Francisco on Friday, Judge Charles Breyer appeared skeptical of the federal government’s case, according to a report from the Associated Press. He argued the situation inLos Angeleshad changed since the troops were first deployed, and questioned whether the administration could command the state’s national guard indefinitely.“No crisis lasts forever,” he said. “I think experience teaches us that crises come and crises go. That’s the way it works.”He pressed an attorney for the government for any evidence that state authorities were either unable or unwilling to help keep federal personnel and property in the area safe and noted Donald Trump had access to tens of thousands of active-duty troops inCalifornia.Trump’s LA national guard deployment cost taxpayers $120m, Newsom saysRead moreCalifornia has asked the judge to issue a preliminary injunction in order to return control of the remaining national guard troops in Los Angeles to the state, but Breyer did not immediately rule. He has previously ruled that the deployment was illegal, and ruled the administration must return control of the troops to California, but a ruling by an appeals court panel put the decision on hold.The justice department attorney Eric Hamilton said federal law gave the president the power to extend control of state guard troops as long as he deems necessary.The remaining troops in Los Angeles were allowing immigration agents to continue their mission and protecting federal property, he said, noting someone threw two incendiary devices into a federal building on Monday.The court did not have the authority to review how the president manages a guard mission that is in progress, but even if it could, it had to consider the violence this summer, Hamilton said.“We cannot turn a blind eye to what happened in Los Angeles in June of this year,” he said.Trump’s call-up of the California national guard was the first time in decades that a state’s national guard was activated without a request from its governor and marked a significant escalation in the administration’s efforts to carry out its mass deportation policy. They were stationed outside a federal detention center downtown where protesters gathered, and later sent on to the streets to protect immigration officers as they made arrests.California sued, and Breyer issued a temporary restraining order that required the administration to return control of the guard troops to California. An appeals court panel, however, put that decision on hold. Breyer was nominated to the bench by President Bill Clinton, a Democrat.California argued that the president was using guard members as his personal police force in violation of a law limiting the use of the military in domestic affairs.The administration said courts could not second-guess the president’s decision that violence during the protests made it impossible for him to execute US laws with regular forces and reflected a rebellion, or danger of rebellion.In September, Breyer ruled after a trial that the deployment violated the law. Other judges have blocked the administration from deploying national guard troops to Portland, Oregon, and Chicago.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaWest CoastLos AngelesUS militarynewsShareReuse this content"

What Netflix hopes to achieve by buying Warner Bros | Andrew PulverRead more“A Netflix-Warner Bros would create one massive media giant with control of close to half of the streaming market – threatening to force Americans into higher subscription prices and fewer choices over what and how they watch, while putting American workers at risk,” she said.Her views were also shared by Pramila Jayapal, co-chair of the House Monopoly Busters caucus.“It would mean more price hikes, ads and cookie cutter content, less creative control for artists, and lower pay for workers,” she said. “The media industry is already controlled by a few corporations with too much power to censor free speech. The government must step in.”The deal, which would bring titles including Harry Potter, The White Lotus, Superman and Game of Thrones, into the streamer’s already vast library was also criticised by the Directors Guild of America.In a statement, the group said it raised “significant concerns” and they would be arranging a meeting withNetflixas soon as possible.The Writers Guild of America also released a statement, calling for it to be stopped.“The world’s largest streaming company swallowing one of its biggest competitors is what antitrust laws were designed to prevent,” the statement read. “The outcome would eliminate jobs, push down wages, worsen conditions for all entertainment workers, raise prices for consumers, and reduce the volume and diversity of content for all viewers. Industry workers along with the public are already impacted by only a few powerful companies maintaining tight control over what consumers can watch on television, on streaming, and in theaters. This merger must be blocked.”Ted Sarandos, a co-chief executive of Netflix, has said he is “highly confident” that the merger will go through without problems and called the deal “pro-consumer, pro-innovation, pro-worker, pro-creator” on an investor call earlier this week.James Cameron had already criticised the purchase earlier this week before it was made official. On the industry podcast The Town, hesaidit “would be a disaster”.The announcement comes after a number of other interested parties, including Paramount and Comcast, also entered discussions.This year has seen a number of theatrical success stories for Warner Bros including Sinners, Superman, A Minecraft Movie, Weapons and Final Destination: Bloodlines.“Netflix expects to maintain Warner Bros’ current operations and build on its strengths, including theatrical releases for films,” a statement from the streamer read this morning.Sarandos added: “I think over time, I think the windows will evolve to be much more consumer friendly, to be able to meet the audience where they are, quicker … I’d say right now, you should count on everything that is planned on going to the theater through Warner Bros will continue to go to the theaters through Warner Bros.”Explore more on these topicsWarner BrosNetflixFilm industryElizabeth WarrennewsShareReuse this content"

That Americans need to get better at enjoying a scandal | Marina HydeRead moreFor weeks, questions surrounded the fate of Nuzzi’s contract after the magazine was made aware ofjournalistic transgressionsnewly alleged by her former fiance, journalist Ryan Lizza. He claimed Nuzzi’s connection toKennedy’spresidential campaign was more extensive than she had previously admitted – and further accused her of another relationship with a person she was reporting on.Nuzzi had joined Vanity Fair under a short-term deal set to conclude at the end of 2025, according to theWall Street Journal. At the time, the magazine said she would focus on “events, industries, and culture of the Pacific region, as well as writing for the magazine”.Her position became uncertain after Lizza began publishing a series of personal exposés about her in November. In the first installment, he accused her of multiple professional breaches, including an affair with the former South Carolina governor Mark Sanford, a 2020 Republican presidential candidate whom she was covering.Initially, Vanity Fair did not respond to Lizza’s claims, waiting four days before issuing a brief statement: “We were taken by surprise, and we are looking at all the facts.”Staff members at the magazine had also reportedly received little information about the internal review concerning her situation, as previouslyreportedby the Guardian.A memoir by Nuzzi, American Canto, was released on Tuesday. In advance of publication, she appeared in a New York Times profile and photoshoot – and an excerpt from the book ran in Vanity Fair. Critical response to the book, which does not name Kennedy but addresses her entanglement with him, has been largely negative.During a recent videointerview, Nuzzi shared sparse information about her professional future, saying she did not intend to return to campaign reporting and was not expected to do so in her role as west coast editor at Vanity Fair.“I think shame is really important and I had fucked up,” she told the Bulwark’s Tim Miller. “I did something wrong.“Those ethics rules exist for a reason – they’re really good rules.

The fact that it was authored by scientists from outside the company, from seemingly independent researchers, gave it added validity.But over the last decade, internal company documents, thatcame to lightin litigation brought by plaintiffs in the US suffering from cancer, revealed Monsanto’s influence on the paper. The documents included an email from a company official discussing the research paper and praising the “hard work” of several Monsanto scientists as part of a strategy Monsanto called “Freedom to Operate” (FTO).The corporate files showed how company officials celebrated when the paper was published.In oneemailfollowing the April 2000 publication of the Williams paper, Lisa Drake, then Monsanto government affairs official, described the toll the work of developing “independent” research papers took on multiple Monsanto employees.“The publication by independent experts of the most exhaustive and detailed scientific assessment ever written on glyphosate … was due to the perseverance, hard work and dedication of the following group of folks,” Drake wrote. She then listed seven Monsanto employees. The group was applauded for “their hard work over three years of data collection, writing, review and relationship building with the papers’ authors”.Drake further emphasized why the Williams paper was so significant for Monsanto’s business plans: “This human health publication on Roundup herbicide and its companion publication on ecotox and environmental fate will be undoubtedly be [sic] regarded as ‘the’ reference on Roundup and glyphosate safety,” she wrotein the emaildated 25 May 2000.“Our plan is now to utilize it both in the defense of Roundup and Roundup Ready crops worldwide and in our ability to competitively differentiate ourselves from generics.”Ina separate email,a company executive asked if Roundup logo polo shirts could be given to eight people who worked on the research papers as a “token of appreciation for a job well done”.Monsanto’s Hugh Grant, who at that time was a senior executive on his way toward being named CEO and chairman, added his own praise,writing in an email: “This is very good work, well done to the team, please keep me in the loop as you build the PR info to go with it.”In 2015, William Heydens, a Monsanto scientist, suggested that he and colleagues “ghost-write” another scientific paper. Monsanto could pay outside scientists to “edit & sign their names” to the work that he and others would do,Heydens wrote in an email.“Recall that is how we handled Williams Kroes and Munro 2000.”The emails were spotlighted in jury trials in which plaintiffs suffering from cancer won billions of dollars in damages from Monsanto, which was bought by Bayer AG in 2018.Gary Williams, one of the authors of the now retracted 2000 research paper, could not immediately be reached for comment. In 2017, Williams’s former employer New York Medical Schoolsaid it found “no evidence”that a faculty member violated the school’s prohibition against authoring a paper ghostwritten by employees of Monsanto. The two other authors of the paper, Robert Kroes and Ian Munro, are deceased.In explaining the decision to retract the 25-year-old research paper, Van den Berg wrote: “Concerns were raised regarding the authorship of this paper, validity of the research findings in the context of misrepresentation of the contributions by the authors and the study sponsor and potential conflicts of interest of the authors.”He noted that the paper’s conclusions regarding the carcinogenicity of glyphosate were solely based on unpublished studies from Monsanto, ignoring other outside, published research.Van den Berg did not respond to a request for comment.When asked about the retraction, Bayer said in a statement that Monsanto’s involvement was adequately noted in the acknowledgments section of the paper in question, including a statement that referred to “key personnel at Monsanto who provided scientific support”. The company said the vast majority of thousands of published studies on glyphosate had no Monsanto involvement.“The consensus among regulatory bodies worldwide that have conducted their own independent assessments based on the weight of evidence is that glyphosate can be used safely as directed and is not carcinogenic,” the company said.An EPA spokesperson said that the agency was aware of the retraction but “has never relied on this specific article in developing any of its regulatory conclusions on glyphosate”.The spokesperson said the EPA has “extensively studied glyphosate, reviewing more than 6,000 studies across all disciplines, including human and environmental health, in developing its regulatory conclusions”.The updated human health risk assessment the agency is currently conducting for glyphosate is “using gold standard science”, the spokesman said. That assessment should be released for public comment in 2026 and will not rely on the retracted article.“The retraction of this study is a long time coming,” said Brent Wisner, one of the lead lawyers in the Roundup litigation and a key player in getting the internal documents revealed to the public.Wisner said the Williams, Kroes and Munro study was the “quintessential example of how companies like Monsanto could fundamentally undermine the peer-review process through ghostwriting, cherrypicking unpublished studies, and biased interpretations”.“This garbage ghostwritten study finally got the fate it deserved,” Wisner said. “Hopefully, journals will now be more vigilant in protecting the impartiality of science on which so many people depend.”News of the retraction of the study came in the same week the Trump administrationurged the US supreme court to take up Bayer’s bid to curtail thousands of lawsuitsclaiming Roundup causes cancer.In a brief filed at the court, the solicitor general, D John Sauer, said the company was correct that the federal law governing pesticides pre-empts lawsuits that make failure-to-warn claims over the products under state law.Plaintiffs have said they developed non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and other forms of cancer due to using Roundup and other glyphosate-based herbicides sold by the company, either at home or on the job.This story is co-published with theNew Lede, a journalism project of the Environmental Working Group.Explore more on these topicsUS newsMonsantoHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Earlier,it said a separate issue had been reportedwith its application programming interfaces.The issue, which affected 28% of its traffic, lasted for half an hour and was resolved shortly after 9am GMT, it said. This follows a far larger Cloudflare outage in mid-November that hit sites such as X, OpenAI and Spotify as well as multiplayer games such as League of Legends.That was caused by “a configuration file that is automatically generated to manage threat traffic” growing beyond its expected size and triggering a crash in the software system that handles traffic for a number of Cloudflare services.“We have spoken directly with hundreds of customers following that incident and shared our plans to make changes to prevent single updates from causing widespread impact like this,” Cloudflare said in its post.Friday’s error appeared far more minor, affecting sites including Canva, Shopify, the Indian-based stockbroker Groww, as well asLinkedIn, Zoom and Downdetector, a site used to monitor online service issues. The Downdetector website recorded more than 4,500 reports related to Cloudflare after returning online.Given the high-profile series of internet outages in the past months, it could cause some companies to reflect on how they use Cloudflare’s services.Steven Murdoch, a professor of computer science at University College London, said: “I think people will start asking questions now that there have been these two outages in a short period of time. They’re not very happy, and Cloudflare isn’t very happy either – they’re apologetic. But it’s too early to say whether there’s a systemic problem, such as bad software practices, or it’s just bad luck.”He said Cloudflare, aglobal cloud services and cybersecurity firm, marketed itself on the basis of its reliability. Companies use it because it offers a level of immunity to certain kinds of cyber-attacks and can improve the performance of websites, making them faster and more resilient to server crashes.Its recent outages in the past months, as well as anAmazon Web Services outage in Octoberthat affected more than 2,000 companies, have fuelled conversation among experts about whether key internet services are too centralised and thus vulnerable.“There’s a huge amount of centralisation,” Murdoch said. “Cloudflare do have a good product, that’s why so many people use them, but it leads to vulnerabilities.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is the fourth major global outage, large enough to be noticed by non-technical media and affect regular people around the world, since 20 October.”Cloudflare claims that about 20% of all websites use some form of its services. It has nearly 300,000 customers operating in 125 countries, and claims to block billions of cyber-attacks for these users daily. It makes more than $500m (£440m) each quarter.Woźniak said recent outages called into question Cloudflare’s marketing, based on its reliability and resilience, and the broader narrative that large companies were safer partners than smaller infrastructure providers. “These companies have become too big to not fail. And because they handle so much traffic, when they do fail, this immediately becomes a massive problem,” he said.Murdoch, however, said there could be an upside to this outage for Cloudflare. “When AWS went down, their share price went up, because people realised how many people are using them. In some ways [the outage] is great marketing, because you see how many people are using Cloudflare.”Explore more on these topicsInternetLinkedInZoomnewsShareReuse this content"

The 0.001% are so unpopular these days that when tech billionaire Michael Dell and his wifeannouncedthe donation of $6.25bn into the “Trump Accounts” of 25 million children, one of the largest single philanthropic donations in American history, Dell had to hurry to assure us that his was not at all about currying favor with Donald Trump.“I don’t think this is in any way a partisan activity,” Delltold the New York Times.Perhaps. Still, the gargantuan contribution to Trump’s pet program – a federal payment included in his Big Beautiful Bill Act of $1,000 into an account bearing his name for every kid born during his presidency – does nothing to dispel the creeping feeling that philanthropy is not quite the do-gooder thingy it’s long been billed to be but rather a tool to curry favor with those in power.One can’t but recallTimothy Mellon, one of Trump’s big backers whodonated $130mto help the government pay troops during the shutdown, earning himself the presidential title of “patriot”. There’s also the gaggle of techies who contributeda cool $1ma piece toward Trump’s inauguration shindig. And there’s the collection of crypto billionaires, tech giants, media companies, sports team owners, etc, whochipped in to financeTrump’s $300m ballroom where the East Wing of the White House used to be.If there is something positive about this moment, it is that the eagerness with which rich individuals and their companies have lavished money on the president’s priorities is shining a light on philanthropists’ longstanding practice of dressing up self-serving objectives – from making friends with politicians to getting their descendants into the Ivy League – as investments in the public good.Trump didn’t invent this.A studya few years ago by economists at the University of Chicago, Boston University and the University of British Columbia found that the charitable contributions by many of the nation’s largest companies – either among the Fortune 500 or part of the S&P 500 stock index – were strategically directed to charities sponsored by members of Congress.The study was titled Tax-Exempt Lobbying: Corporate Philanthropy as a Tool for Political Influence. It included nuggets like the Exelon Corporation’sdonation of $25,000to an effort to build a Boys and Girls Club spearheaded by Joe Barton, the top Republican member of the House energy and commerce committee.The foundations of JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo all donated to the Washington State Farmworker Housing Trust,which Patty Murray, the senior senator from Washington state, helped establish. In 2010, the Walmart Foundation gave $6,000 to theJoe Baca Foundation, when Representative Baca was sitting on the House financial services committee and Walmart was battling Visa and Mastercard over credit card fees.These things might all have been coincidences. But the research detects fishy patterns: corporate foundations tend to make philanthropic donations in the same congressional districts where their political action committees (Pacs) make political contributions to their favoured candidates. They donate more to charities in districts represented by members with seats on a committee relevant to the company. And they trim their giving when the member leaves Congress. A non-profit is more than four times more likely to receive grants from a corporate foundation if a politician sits on its board.None of this should be surprising given the way philanthropy is set up in the US, as a tax break for the rich and their corporations to funnel money into pet projects that may not be profitable, in a narrow sense of the word, but clearly provide a return, whether it’s the beneficiary’s name in gilded letters on the facade of the public library, points toward corporate social development goals or the favor of a member of Congress.Charity in the US last year added up to over $592bn – about 2% of GDP, the same it has been for years. As a believer in taxation and government redistribution, it rubs me the wrong way that taxpayers are subsidizing this largesse, which can be spent free of democratic checks and balances.The public subsidy of philanthropy looks increasingly ridiculous as giving becomes the province of the very, very rich, who are directing their charity to increasingly outlandish propositions.Consider Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, who has formally repositioned his philanthropic arm, axing work it was doing in housing and education for low-income students to focus pretty much exclusively on the intersection of biology and AI, with the stated objective of one day curing all disease.Launched around the reasonable idea that charity should be designed to maximize benefits, regardless of whether they materialize in Africa or one’s own neighborhood, the principle of“effective altruism”embraced by the tech aristocracy from Silicon Valley has taken a deep sci-fi turn, to favor investments that provide benefits far away in the future. Investing to save a few million from malaria, in this view, is a waste compared with, say, saving humanity from apocalypse a hundred or a thousand years from now.Dell may not be that invested in science fiction. Still, his $250 contribution to 25 million children is as unlikely to be life-changing as the $1,000 the federal government is supposed to deposit into the Trump Accounts of all kids. (A much better idea would be toamend the child tax creditto ensure America’s poorest families could benefit.)At least his money is going to children in the present, you might say. But the multibillion-dollar gift from this one-time adviser to President Trump and his wife (“two special people”, in Trump’s words) will probably mostly benefit the donor.Explore more on these topicsBusinessUS politicsPhilanthropyDonald TrumpanalysisShareReuse this content"

In a response postMusk wrote: “Much appreciated.”Before Musk took over Twitter, blue ticks were only awarded to verifiable account holders, including politicians, celebrities, public bodies and verified journalists in mainstream media and established new media, such as bloggers and YouTubers. After the takeover, users who subscribed to X Premium were theneligible for blue tick status.Henna Virkkunen, who is the executive vice-president at the European Commission responsible for tech regulation, said: “With the DSA’s first non-compliance decision, we are holding X responsible for undermining users’ rights and evading accountability.“Deceiving users with blue checkmarks, obscuring information on ads and shutting out researchers have no place online in the EU.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last week the US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, said the EU must consider its tech regulations in order to get 50% tariffs on steel reduced.His threats were branded “blackmail” by Teresa Ribera, the EU commissioner in charge of Europe’s green transition and antitrust enforcement.Senior EU officials said the ruling was independent of any pleadings by the US delegation in Brussels last week to meet trade ministers. They said the EU retained its “sovereign right” to regulate US tech companies, with 25 businesses including non-US companies such as TikTok coming under the DSA.Musk – who ison a path to become the world’s first trillionaire– has 90 days to come up with an “action plan” to respond to the fine but ultimately he is also free to appeal against any EU ruling, as others, such as Apple, have done in the past, taking their case to the European court of justice.At the same time, the EU has announced it has secured commitments from TikTok to provide advertising repositories to address the commission concerns raised in May about transparency.The DSA requires platforms to maintain an accessible and searchable repository of the ads running on their services to allow researchers and representatives of civil society “to detect scams, advertisements for illegal or age-inappropriate”.Senior officials said the phenomenon of fake political adverts or ads with fake celebrities cannot be studied unless the social media companies stick to the rules.X has been approached for comment.

The governing body has not disclosed details of the selection process, although a Guardian investigation found that a new “social responsibility” committee chaired by the controversial Myanmar tycoon Zaw Zawwill propose the processfor future awards.Trump, who has long sought international validation, attended the ceremony on Friday and accepted the award in front of Fifa officials, diplomats and invited guests.Accepting the award, Trump called it “one of the great honours of my life”, before claiming to have “saved millions and millions of lives – the Congo is an example, over 10 million people killed and it was heading for another 10 million very quickly. India and Pakistan, so many different wars we were able to end, in some cases just before they started.”He went on to praise Infantino for “setting new records on ticket sales” and said the 2026 tournament would be “an event the likes of which maybe the world has never seen”. Trump concluded: “The world is a safer place now … we’re the hottest country anywhere in the world.”Trumphas made questionable claimsabout the number of conflicts he has “ended” as well as launching a number of military actions,some with controversial justification– even as he has insisted he should be awarded the Nobel peace prize. His interventions as a self-professed peacemaker in the Gaza conflict and in the war in Ukraine have also been heavilycriticised for being one-sided and ineffective.Among the wars Trump claims to have “ended” is Gaza, where the two-year-long conflict, albeit at a lower level, is still continuing, including regular Israeli strikes and the continued occupation of a substantial area of the ruined coastal strip.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump speaks to the attendees at the World Cup draw.Photograph: ANP/ShutterstockTrump also claims to have ended the Israel-Iran war, a 12-day conflict in which the US was an active participant on Israel’s side, launching its own long-range airstrikes against Iranian nuclear sites.The US president has also professed to playing a significant role in ending a brief flare-up in long-running tensions between India and Pakistan in May, although India has denied Trump’s involvement was particularly meaningful.Trump, or the US at least, appears to have had a more significant role in mediating conflicts between Armenia and Azerbaijan and Thailand and Cambodia. Claims to have ended fighting between Rwandan backed rebels and the DRC have been confounded by continuing clashes. His peacemaking claims about Serbia and Kosovo and Egypt and Ethiopia are best described as imaginary, there being no active conflicts.Trump’s actions closer to home also contradict his claims to be a peacemaker, not least his use of deadly military strikes against small boats in the Caribbean on the basis of dubious legal claims regarding threats posed by “narco terrorists” against the US that has also seen him threaten Venezuela.The decision to give Trump the inaugural Fifa honour is likely to intensify scrutiny of the organisation’s close alignment with his political orbit. Trump has regularly used sporting platforms to bolster his image abroad and has aggressively campaigned for the Nobel laureate. After this year’s award went to the Venezuelan opposition leaderMaría Corina Machado, senior Republicansdenounced the decisionas “politics over peace”, while the US House speaker, Mike Johnson, vowedto help marshal a global nominationfor Trump next year.Infantino’s relationship with Trumphas grown increasingly visibleahead of the expanded 2026 World Cup, which will be co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico. The pair appeared together at a summit in Egypt in October shortly after a ceasefire came into effect in Gaza, and Infantino has repeatedly argued that football can “invest in happiness” and carry “a message of peace” even if it “cannot solve conflict”.Fifa has also strengthened its ties with Trump’s inner circle. Earlier this year, the organisation appointed Trump’s daughter Ivanka to the board of a $100m education initiative funded in part by 2026World Cupticket revenues.The 2026 tournament, which begins on 11 June and will feature a record 104 matches across 16 host cities, has been promoted by Fifa as an opportunity to “unite the world”.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026World CupUS sportsDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The paddock positively hums with a febrile, pulsing excitement and sense of expectation that is impossible to ignore. Amid all of which the title favourite,Lando Norris, finds himself at the moment he has dedicated his life toward, destiny lying in his own hands.After a gruelling 23-race trek around the world, the conclusion of all the work, sacrifice and effort will be decided in just an hour and a half on Sunday afternoon in Abu Dhabi.McLaren will use team orders in quest for F1 world drivers’ title in Abu DhabiRead moreNorris has been fascinating to observe across a season during whichhe opened on top, was then eclipsed by his McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri before mounting a comeback in the final third to retake the lead. Entering the final rubber at the Yas Marina Circuit, he holds a 12-point advantage over Red Bull’s Max Verstappen and 16 over Piastri.Back in April at Suzuka, Norris was as forthright and honest as ever whenwe discussed his title hopes. At the time a potential championship decider was a world away but he was already adamant about how he would like to win it.“I feel like there is a very prescribed version of how people say a world champion needs to be – overly aggressive,” he said. “I’ll do whatever I can to win a championship but maybe I won’t sacrifice in my life as much as some others, in terms of who I am as a person and have the ‘fuck you’ mentality people say you’ve got to have. I still believe I can be a world champion but doing it by being a nice guy.“I want to just enjoy my life. That’s kind of the attitude that’s maybe not as much of a killer instinct. I just don’t think you have to have that to be a world champion. I want to prove you can be a world champion and not have it. I’ll still take risks and I’ll still do whatever I know I can do to be a world champion but without losing the liberty ofwhoI am.”This weekend will present the acid test of how Norris copes with maintaining that sense of self. Thus far, true to his word, he has played a straight bat. The British driver has got his elbows out on occasion as he didagainst Piastri in Singaporebut has kept a good relationship with his teammate as the title race has fluctuated between them and as Verstappen charged back into the reckoning.It was instructive that as he composed himself preparing for the decisive race, Norris still had that sense of perspective. “If it doesn’t go my way, then I try again next year,” he said. “It’ll hurt probably for a little while but then that’s life. I’ll crack on and try and do better next season.View image in fullscreenLando Norris in relaxed mood in the pit lane.Photograph: Clive Mason/Getty Images“I also feel like I have the mentality of ‘I have nothing to lose’ because it’s just a race for a championship. In 30 years’ time, I probably won’t think of it that much either way. So, I’m not too bothered.”Such nihilist analysis is surely a mechanism to allow him to focus simply on the job at hand, rather than the import which hangs so heavy over it.Of the many permutations of what might happen on Sunday, if Norris does not seal it the criticism he is most likely to receive is that he is not ruthless enough and that he may well have been beaten by Verstappen who has no such qualms.Indeed, the most ominous sign going into the weekend washow entirely relaxed the defending world champion was. Observing him laughing and joking about the task ahead and his repeated observations that he had nothing to lose, must have given Norris and the outsider Piastri pause for thought.Verstappen has closed out four consecutive drivers’ championships. His nerves are certainly not jangling, he feels no pressure. He noted in Abu Dhabi that his parents were not attending as he had no expectation to be in the title fight at the finale.“I have four of those [trophies] at home, so it’s nice to add a fifth,” he said to laughter when asked about his ambition going into the race. “I’ve already achieved everything that I wanted to achieve in F1 and everything is just a bonus. I just keep doing it because I love it and I enjoy it. That’s also how I go into this weekend, have a good time out there, try to maximise the result.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The first title is always the hardest and any error in this race might make the difference. Verstappen was so nervous on the final laps of his controversial first championship winhere in Abu Dhabi in 2021that his calf muscles began cramping.The mathematics of this decider have many permutations but put simply, Norris will win if he finishes in front of both his rivals or claims third place or better. Verstappen would need to win and hope Norris finishes outside the podium places while Piastri would need to win and have the Briton finish sixth or lower.View image in fullscreenDefending champion Max Verstappen (left) is the closest challenger to Lando Norris (centre) while Oscar Piastri (right) can also win the title if events go his way in Abu Dhabi.Photograph: ANP/ShutterstockOther factors might yet also be in play but will not become clearer until after qualifying. In terms of performance the track in Abu Dhabi is finely balanced between McLaren andRed Bull, with both enjoying sectors that will suit their car. Equally, Mercedes and Ferrari will expect to be strong at least in fighting to be the third and fourth fastest cars and drivers from both teams might project themselves into the title fight.All four of whom drivers will pursue their goal of finishing as well as possible with no thought for how it affects the protagonists around them. On recent form George Russell and Charles Leclerc might expect to be in the mix, especially if there is an upset in qualifying. Neither will yield a place easily.View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen can take the title if he wins in Abu Dhabi and Lando Norris fails to make the podium.Photograph: Antonin Vincent/DPPI/ShutterstockHowever, one advantageMcLarendoes enjoy is that both their drivers will be in said mix. Verstappen’s teammate Yuki Tsunoda is highly unlikely to play any part in the Dutchman’s charge given how far off the pace he has been this season .Indeed, unless Norris or Piastri suffers a cataclysm in qualifying the three protagonists will probably be duking it out at the front for the championship on Sunday and that is what everyone wants to see.

Mexico have won one knockout game at theWorld Cup, beating Bulgaria last time they hosted, in 1986. Their manager, Javier Aguirre, was a forward in that side and will be targeting their third quarter-final as hosts. South Africa, coached by the veteran Belgian Hugo Broos, qualified for their first World Cup since hosting, finishing above Nigeria and Benin, despite having a game against Lesotho they appeared to have won awarded against them for fielding a suspended player.This will beSouth Korea’s 11th consecutive World Cup. Hong Myung-bo played in four of those, and came third in the voting for the Golden Ball when South Korea reached the semi-final in 2002. He is now their coach and led them unbeaten through a far from straightforward qualifying group. The fourth team in Group A will be aEuropean playoff winnerfrom the Czech Republic, Denmark, North Macedonia or Republic of Ireland.View image in fullscreenMexico and South Africa will once again meet in a World Cup opening game.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianGroup BCanadahave qualified for the World Cup twice and although Qatar 2022 brought their first goal in a finals, it did not bring their first point. Jesse Marsch is manager of probably the best squad in their history, with Jonathan David playing for Juventus and Alphonso Davies for Bayern. How kind the draw looks depends largely whether Italy make it through theUefa playoff(the other three teams are Bosnia and Herzegovina, Northern Ireland and Wales).After failing to qualify in 1998 and 2002,Switzerlandhave got through the groups in four of the past five World Cups and were quarter-finalists at the past two Euros. Murat Yakin’s side qualified unbeaten from probably the easiest of the Uefa groups and, in Ricardo Rodriguez and Granit Xhaka, have two players hoping to play at their fourth World Cups. Having finished fourth in their third-round qualifying group,Qatarwere handed a significant advantage by being chosen as a host for the fourth round and secured progress with a 2-1 win over the UAE. Julen Lopetegui’s squad is entirely drawn from the Qatari league.Group CView image in fullscreenScott McTominay and his Scotland teammates will be hoping to progress to the knockout stages for the first time.Photograph: Andy Buchanan/AFP/Getty ImagesScotland’s first World Cup in 28 years looks a lot like the last one, when they lost toBrazilandMorocco;Haititake the place of Norway. Their aim will be to make it through to the knockout phase for the first time after eight group-stage exits. Haiti’s only previous World Cup, in 1974, was notable less for their three defeats than for the fate that befell the midfielder Ernst Jean-Joseph who, after failing a drugs test, was beaten by Haitian army officers at the Munich Sheraton before being sent back to Port-au-Prince. They will have limited support because Haiti is on the USA’s travel ban list.Carlo Ancelotti became Brazil’s third managerin a qualifying campaign that included a run of three successive defeats, but there is little jeopardy in Conmebol qualifying these days. He has overseen a clear improvement. Semi-finalists in Qatar in 2022, Morocco look the best of the north African sides, capable both of overwhelming opponents and playing on the counter, qualifying with a 100% record.Group DView image in fullscreenThe form and fitness of Milan forward Christian Pulisic will be key for the hosts.Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty ImagesEarly last year, theUSAseemed in a dismal state, losing to Panama and Canada in the Concacaf Nations League and to Turkey and Switzerland in friendlies. But over the past year, Mauricio Pochettino has seemingly begun to get his message across and in November the USA beat Paraguay before thrashing Uruguay 5-1 in friendlies. They will start againstParaguay, who are playing in their sixth World Cup. They have won one game at each of the previous five, a record that has led to both group-stage exits and a quarter-final. The familiar defensive mindset hasn’t changed: they scored only 14 goals in their 18 games in Conmebol qualifying.This is not the most fluentAustraliaand their squad lacks obvious stars, but despite an iffy start to the third round of AFC qualifying, Tony Popovic’s side made it through by beating Japan at home and Saudi Arabia away under intense pressure in their final two matches. The group’s fourth team will come from the winner ofEurope’s playoff C(Kosovo, Romania, Slovakia or Turkey).Group EAfter successive group-stage exits,Germanyare no longer the bogeymen of old. The shift to a more progressive style has brought a vulnerability and the draw initially looked like presenting a huge challenge to Julian Nagelsmann’s side.Ecuadorwere the revelations of qualifying, finishing second behind Argentina in Conmebol. Although they scored only 14 goals in 18 games, a defence featuring Willian Pacho of Paris Saint-Germain and Piero Hincapié of Arsenal, protected by Chelsea’s Moisés Caicedo, conceded a paltry five.View image in fullscreenNick Woltemade will be a danger man for Germany.Photograph: Omar Havana/ReutersCôte d’Ivoirelive in a state of permanent declinism, where nothing is ever quite as good as the golden squad of 15-20 years ago. But since taking charge during the 2023 Cup of Nations, the head coach, Emerse Faé, has proved inspirational.After an implausible Afcon success on home soil, Côte d’Ivoire were ruthless in qualifying, scoring 25 without reply.The smallest country ever to qualify,Curaçao, were the fourth team drawn, though, making the group look a lot less daunting than it might have been.Group FRonald Koeman’sNetherlandsperhaps lack the star quality of previous Dutch generations, but they qualified unbeaten and Memphis Depay, who scored eight goals in qualifying, always looks a more reliable player with his national side than at club level. They open againstJapan, who will play in their eighth successive World Cup, and were by some way the most impressive of the Asian sides in qualifying, losing one of their 16 games across the two groups, with a combined goal difference of 54-3.Tunisiamade sure of a third consecutive World Cup appearance by dominating a straightforward qualifying group, picking up 28 points of a possible 30. Sami Trabelsi’s squad are perhaps not as dour as certain previous Tunisian sides; they had a remarkable 14 different scorers in qualifying. If Graham Potter’s Sweden make it through theUefa playoff(against Ukraine in the semi, then either Poland or Albania in the final), that will set up a repeat of the group game in Dortmund in 1974 when Johan Cruyff first performed the Cruyff Turn.Group GView image in fullscreenEgypt and Mo Salah will hope to impress in North America, after missing out on Qatar in 2022.Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty ImagesBelgiumandEgyptare emerging from the shadow of golden generations.

Mohamed Salah and Omar Marmoush give them cutting edge, but it was a defence that conceded twice in 10 games that meant they qualified unbeaten.A guaranteed place for Oceania effectively meant a spot at the finals forNew Zealand, who cruised through qualifying, winning five games out of five, scoring 29 goals, nine of them by Chris Wood, but they are the lowest-ranked side to have secured their place in North America next summer.Iran, who lost once in a tricky third-round qualifying group, are on Donald Trump’s travel ban list, potentially presenting a range of logistical problems.Group HView image in fullscreenSpain will undoubtedly be one of the teams to beat next summer.Photograph: Kevin Voigt/Getty ImagesSpain, the European champions, are the No 1 side in the Fifa rankings and with good reason. Blending the technical quality and patient possession game that has defined recent Spanish football with direct wingers comfortable running with the ball, Luis de la Fuente’s side dropped only two points and averaged 3.5 goals per game in qualifying.Uruguaystarted extremely promisingly under Marcelo Bielsa, but performances have declined and, aftera humiliating 5-1 defeat by the USA last month, there were reports of a divided dressing room.The rise ofCape Verdehas been remarkable. They did not reach their first Africa Cup of Nations until 2013, and have not qualified for this year’s tournament in Morocco. Their stingy defence, though, was enough to eliminate Cameroon. Back under the management of Hervé Renard,Saudi Arabialurched through qualifying, forced into the fourth-round repechage, conveniently held in Jeddah, and avoiding a further playoff for a place in the inter-confederational playoff on goals scored.Group IThe headline will be the meeting of Kylian Mbappé and Erling Haaland asFrancefaceNorwayin their final group game, but before that France take onSenegal,who beat them in the opening game in 2002. France have absurd depth in every position yet seem less than the sum of their parts. Mbappé is not an easy player to fit in a coherent system and there is a growing sense that Didier Deschamps, who captained them to glory in 1998 and managed them to glory 20 years later, with his fixation on Aimé Jacquet-style solidity, is holding them back. Norway qualified with a 100% record as top scorers in Europe: 37 goals in eight games.Senegal, managed by Pape Thiaw, a squad member in 2002, have been the best sub-Saharan African team for a while now. Sadio Mané remains the main threat, but their strength is the midfield, with Ismaïla Sarr, Pape Matar Sarr, Habib Diarra and Iliman Ndiaye all capable of contributing goals. The fourth team in the group will come fromplayoff 2(Bolivia, Suriname or Iraq)Group JView image in fullscreenWill it be one last hurrah Lionel Messi?Photograph: Natacha Pisarenko/APOnce the drought broke forArgentina, the rain has not stopped. They went 28 years without winning anything, but in the past four years under Lionel Scaloni they’ve lifted not onlythe World Cupbut also two Copas América, while finishing first in Conmebol qualifying. The only question is whether Lionel Messi, who will turn 39 during the tournament, is still worth his place in the starting lineup.Vladimir Petkovic’sAlgeria, in their fifth World Cup, are more open and entertaining than the team that won theCup of Nations in 2019. Ralf Rangnick’sAustriawere one of the most watchable sides at the last Euros and although they had to come from behind against Bosnia and Herzegovina in their final game to secure automatic qualification, they have largely maintained that form, thanks to a dynamic midfield in which Konrad Laimer is key.Jordan’s coach, the former Morocco midfielder Jamal Sellami, favours a 3-4-3 that proved particularly effective away from home, absorbing pressure and striking on the break.Group KCristiano Ronaldo,two games of his suspension for violent conduct mysteriously suspended, will be available for start of the tournament – although that is a mixed blessing for Roberto Martínez, who has made clear he will select the 40-year-old come what may. Without him,Portugal’s fleet of gifted attacking midfielders scored nine against Armenia in the final qualifier and there is a clear sense that his lack of mobility gums the mechanisms. DR Congo could offer a testing start if they progress through theplayoff(against either New Caledonia or Jamaica).The tendency is to hold upUzbekistanas one of the beneficiaries of the expansion of the tournament, but they had the fourth-best record in Asian qualifying and on that logic would have qualified for a 32-team tournament. Only Japan let in fewer goals in the third phase of Asian qualifying.Colombiareached the final of the last Copa América, held in the US. The evergreen James Rodríguez and Luis Díaz ensure plenty of attacking options.Group LThomas Tuchel was appointed with a specific brief: to win the World Cup. And for the second time in a row,Englandgo to a World Cup not just with hope but expectation. They qualified without conceding a goal and Tuchel had perhaps the greatest array of creative talent any England manager has been able to choose from. They really need Harry Kane to stay fit, though. For the third time in five tournaments they will face Zlatko Dalic’sCroatia. The highest-ranked of the pot two sides, they qualified with the minimum of fuss, dropping two points in the group.Ghana’s failure to reach this winter’s Africa Cup of Nations was almost inexplicable given the attacking talent available – Antoine Semenyo, Mohammed Kudus, Iñaki Williams, Abdul Fatawu, Jordan Ayew – and, with Otto Addo back as head coach they made their point by winning eight of 10 matches in qualifying.Panamapassed unbeaten through the final round of Concacaf qualifying to reach their second World Cup; England put six past them in Russia.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026World CupanalysisShareReuse this content"

And in the moment, he didn’t care.The right play was to pass the ball – so he did. And with that, his streak ended.James’s run of 1,297 consecutive double-digit regular-season scoring efforts ended Thursday night, when the NBA’s career points leader was held to eight points in the Los Angeles Lakers’ 123-120 win over the Toronto Raptors. He had the game-winning assist, setting up Rui Hachimura’s three-pointer as time expired.Afterward, he was asked what thoughts he had about the streak ending.“None,” James said. “We won.”Bucks’ Giannis Antetokounmpo reportedly out for two to four weeks with calf strainRead moreJames could have tried to win the game – and extend the streak – on the final possession, but he instead passed to Hachimura in the left corner. Hachimura connected, and James threw his hands in the air in celebration.“Just playing the game the right way. You always make the right play,” James said. “That’s just been my M.O. That’s how I was taught the game. I’ve done that my whole career.”“LeBron is acutely aware of how many points he has at that point,” Lakers coach JJ Redick said. “He did it like he’s done so many times.”James checked back into the game for the final time Thursday with 5:23 left, the outcome and the streak hanging in the balance. He had six points on 3-of-15 shooting at that point.He scored with 1:46 left to tie the game and missed a 14-footer with 1:01 left that would have gotten him to double digits.He didn’t take another shot – but could have. Austin Reaves gave James the ball with a few seconds left, but James opted to make the pass instead.“The basketball gods, if you do it the right way, they tend to reward you,” Redick said.James’s streak started on Jan. 6, 2007. It was, by far, the longest such streak inNBAhistory: Michael Jordan had 866 consecutive double-digit scoring games, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar had 787 and Karl Malone had the fourth-longest run at 575.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They remain outside the playoff picture with four games left, but they improved their odds considerably.“They don’t get panicked,” Detroit coach Dan Campbell said. “We played our best game that we played all year.”Detroit’s playoff probability is now 54% and Dallas’ fell to 7%, according to theNFL.The Cowboys (6-6-1) had surged into postseason contention with a three-game winning streak. But against the Lions, the NFL’s top-ranked offense had to lean on powerful kicker Brandon Aubrey too much and Dallas’ revitalized defense was humbled.“It seemed like every time we got some momentum, they hit another explosive play,” Cowboys coach Brian Schottenheimer said. “They have a lot of speed, and they can make big plays.”Goff went 25 of 34 for 309 yards with a 12-yard touchdown pass to rookie receiver Isaac TeSlaa that put Detroit ahead 27-9.Dallas pulled within three points twice in the fourth quarter, including with 3:42 left when Aubrey matched a career high with his fifth field goal.Tom Kennedy returned the ensuing kickoff to midfield and Goff threw a 37-yard pass to Amon-Ra St. Brown to set up Gibbs’ third score.Gibbs had seven catches for 77 yards and 43 yards rushing on 12 carries.“He’s unique,” Campbell said. “He’s special.”Williams had seven catches for the second straight game and finished with 96 yards. St Brown, who had been listed as questionable with an ankle injury, left no doubt of his value with six catches for 92 yards and a lot of key blocks for teammates.“He was going and nobody was going to talk him out of it,” Campbell said.Detroit’s Al-Quadin Muhammad had a career-high three sacks and Jack Campbell had a sack and forced a fumble for a team that hadn’t been generating much pressure on quarterbacks.Prescott wished that trend continued.He was sacked five times and pressured many more times as he was 31 of 47 for 376 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions. He lost his top target in the third quarter when CeeDee Lamb suffered a concussion after he had six catches for 121 yards.George Pickens didn’t pick up the slack, catching just five of the nine passes thrown his way for 37 yards.Dallas settled for too many field goals from their extraordinary kicker.The 30-year-old Aubrey converted from 63, 57, 55, 42 and 29 yards, becoming the first in NFL history to make three field goals or 55 yards or more in a game, according to Sportradar.“These guys aren’t deflated right now, they are pissed off,” Prescott said. “We just need to use that the right way – as fuel for the rest of the season.”Explore more on these topicsNFLDetroit LionsDallas CowboysUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Mikel Arteta’s side squandered a two-goal lead at the Emirates Stadium when theteams last met, in January, Arsenal dropping two points, their title charge dented. With such little margin for error, it was the kind of day that boosted Liverpool and crystallised the sense that the Gunners would come up short. Villa also defeated Arsenal in 2023-24, abruptly halting a six-game winning streak. Now Arsenal are in a different position, at the summit with a five-point lead – and six clear of Unai Emery’s team. Victory at Villa Park on Saturday, against a side that have lost only once in the league since August, would offer another significant indication that this could be the season Arsenal take the crown.Ben FisherAston Villa v Arsenal, Saturday 12.30pm (all times GMT)View image in fullscreenOllie Watkins earned a point for Aston Villa at the Emirates in January as the visitors stalled Arsenal’s title tilt.Photograph: Hannah McKay/Reuters2Unal can freshen up Bournemouth’s attackBournemouth have looked tired recently andTuesday night’s loss to Evertonmeant they have collected one point from their past five games. Andoni Iraola did his best to freshen his side up by leaving Evanilson and Marcus Tavernier out of the starting lineup for that match but it was seemingly detrimental. Eli Junior Kroupi has failed to score in the past five matches, while Evanilson has only one goal all season. It may be time to re-energise the attack by bringing Enes Unal in for a first start in almost a year, after a long period out with his second cruciate ligament injury. The former Manchester City youngster scored a minute after coming on in the 2-2 draw with West Ham last month and the only way he will rediscover his form is by getting into a rhythm, which requires minutes. Saturday against Chelsea could be ideal, even if Iraola deems him fit enough only for the first 45, allowing him to unleash Kroupi or Evanilson after the break.Will UnwinBournemouth v Chelsea, Saturday 3pm3Dyche deserves credit on Everton returnThe end for Sean Dyche at Everton camewith his team one point above the relegation zoneafter defeats by Nottingham Forest and Bournemouth extended a dismal run to one win in 11 games. He departed only in January but it already feels much longer ago. Everton’s first Premier League winat Bournemouthin midweek was a necessary response to the home mauling by Newcastle and another demonstration of the club’s improvement under David Moyes. The Friedkin Group were clearly correct to part company with Dyche but, when he faces his former club for the first time with in-form Forest, there surely will be appreciation for his considerable achievement of keeping Everton afloat before things turned sour. As Everton manager Dyche had to deal with two points deductions for financial breaches that preceded his reign,an absentee owner and board, takeover distractions, a negative net spend on transfers and reduced wage bill – plus the threat of administration had the club been relegated on his watch in 2023 and 2024. When he sets foot inside a completed Hill Dickinson Stadium for the first time on Saturday, Dyche’s role in enabling Everton to enjoy an ambitious new era must be recognised.Andy HunterEverton vNottingham Forest, Saturday 3pm4Can City tighten up against Sunderland?Manchester City cannot stop scoring – 32 league goals so far this season – and in Tuesday’s helter-skelter5-4 victory at Fulhamcould barely stop conceding. Yet while Pep Guardiolafound it an unenjoyable watch, their overall defensive record of 16 conceded is broadly fine. While the manager might wish the number let in to be nearer to Arsenal’s seven, Aston Villa, who are third, have shipped 14, Chelsea (fourth) 15, and Crystal Palace (fifth) 11. Sunderland arrive having been breached only 14 times and Wednesday’s 1-1 draw with Liverpool underlined why they have the same points total (23) as Palace. A good test, then, for both sides awaits on Saturday.Jamie JacksonManchester City v Sunderland, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenSamuel Chukwueze’s quickfire double for Fulham exposed Manchester City’s defensive frailties.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian5Van de Ven will be needed to tame ThiagoMicky van de Van was left out for the2-2 draw at Newcastleon Tuesday, with Thomas Frank eager to manage his workload over a hectic period for Tottenham. The head coach’s thinking may have centred on the prospect of facing Igor Thiago at the weekend. Few centre-backs are quicker in world football and the Dutchman will need all his pace and physicality to deal with the Brazilian, who has 11 league goals this season, second only to Erling Haaland inthe Premier League scoring charts. With Slavia Prague coming up on Tuesday, 90 minutes for Van de Ven against Brentford could be more important to Tottenham than a Champions League match they will be favourites to win. Thiago was also only a substitute in midweek, coming on for the final half-hour against Arsenal, with Keith Andrews possibly thinking he could play a significant role in the weekend’s more winnable clash.WUTottenham vBrentford, Saturday 3pm6Wissa to herald Newcastle tactical rejig?Given Eddie Howe is a former Burnley manager and his Turf Moor counterpart, Scott Parker, is a one-time Newcastle midfielder, old memories will certainly be revived when the teams meet at St James’ Park. Howe hopes to welcome a new face at last, with Yoane Wissa, his £55m summer signing from Brentford, believed to be aiming for a seat on the home bench. Wissa has finally recovered from the knee injury sustained on international duty with the Democratic Republic of the Congo in September that delayed his Newcastle debut. He has not been included in the DRC squad for this month’s Africa Cup of Nations, leaving him free to help revive Newcastle’s inconsistentPremier Leaguecampaign. Might his arrival herald a change of formation, with Nick Woltemade dropping back from a No 9 to a No 10 role? If Parker’s Burnley strugglers could do without facing Wissa, they will also doubtless be hoping that Sandro Tonali fails to recover from injury in time to anchor the home midfield.Louise TaylorNewcastle vBurnley, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenMore than three months after his arrival, Yoane Wissa could finally make his Newcastle debut on Saturday.Photograph: Serena Taylor/Newcastle United/Getty Images7Should Slot start both Isak and Ekitiké?After Sunday’s win over West Ham, Liverpool endured another difficult 90 minutesagainst Sunderlandin midweek. Mohamed Salah was brought on at half-time in an attempt to bring inspiration to a struggling side, but did not change much about the performance. Arne Slot is doing his best to turn the situation around but finding the answers is not straightforward. Opponents are losing the fear of facing the Premier League champions and Leeds’s confidence will be boosted afterseeing off Chelseaon Wednesday, with Elland Road sensing blood when Liverpool visit. Slot may want to give Daniel Farke something to think about, and an intriguing proposal would be to start Alexander Isak and Hugo Ekitiké; the Frenchman can play off one of the wings, with the ability to cut in and provide greater support for the Sweden striker, offering a little surprise for Leeds’s defence in the process.WULeeds vLiverpool, Saturday 5.30pm8Brighton must be more ruthlessFor half an hour of Brighton’s home game against Aston Villa, it seemed as if everything had clicked for Fabian Hürzeler. Unai Emery’s side had no answer to their hosts’ intensity as Brighton took charge thanks to two slightly fortunate goals. But Villa showed their experience to find a way back as Brighton suffered afirst home defeatin the Premier League since losing to the same opponents in April. Hürzeler acknowledged his team will have to be much more ruthless – starting with struggling West Ham’s visit to the Amex on Sunday – if they are to mount a serious challenge to qualify for Europe next season. “A game takes 90 minutes and that’s what we have to do better. Thirty minutes is not enough,” Hürzeler said. “We can fight these kind of battles but it’s about doing the small margins right.” West Ham’s late point at Old Trafford on Thursday showed they can punish teams who do not finish them off.Ed AaronsBrighton v West Ham, Sunday 2pmView image in fullscreenFabian Hürzeler was left frustrated by Brighton’s collapse against Aston Villa.Photograph: Stephen Flynn/ProSports/Shutterstock9Chukwueze deserves a Fulham startFulham did not enjoy hosting Crystal Palace last season. Palace won 2-0 at Craven Cottage in the league and returned a month laterto claim a 3-0 victoryin a one-sided FA Cup quarter-final. Fulham should be full of optimism for their latest meeting, though, after almost pulling off a comeback for the ages against Manchester City on Tuesday. They are playing well at home and fans will be hoping that Marco Silva starts Samuel Chukwueze. The Nigeria winger has made telling impacts from the bench in Fulham’s past two home games. He came on to create thewinner against Sunderlandwith a brilliant cross and was influential after his introduction at half-time against City, scoring twice. Silva should consider finding space for Chukwueze in his starting XI.Jacob SteinbergFulham vCrystal Palace, Sunday 4.30pm10Cunha a painful sight for toothless WolvesThis time last season Southampton were haemorrhaging goals, shipping five against Chelsea and Tottenham in consecutive weeks. Wolves have the worst defence in the division this campaign – conceding 29 so far – but since Rob Edwards took charge they have made things tougher for opponents, even if all three matches have ended in defeat. If Leeds back up their victory over Chelsea with a win over Liverpool on Saturday, Wolves could be 15 points from the last safe spot by the time Manchester United come to town on Monday, when Matheus Cunha could face his former club for the first time. The Brazilian had his flaws, moments of ill-discipline or petulance chequering his Molineux story, but he troubled opposition defences in a way that Wolves have failed to do so this season, including United when he scoredin this fixture last season. Wolves have been timid opponents, scoring just seven goals in 14 games; that must change against United if they are to avoid further ignominy.BFWolves vManchester United, Monday 8pmPosTeamPGDPts1Arsenal1420332Man City1416283Aston Villa146274Chelsea1410245Crystal Palace147236Sunderland144237Brighton144228Man Utd141229Liverpool1402210Everton14-22111Tottenham Hotspur1451912Newcastle1411913Brentford14-11914AFC Bournemouth14-31915Fulham14-31716Nottm Forest14-81517Leeds14-101418West Ham14-121219Burnley14-131020Wolverhampton14-222Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen things to look out for this weekendLeeds UnitedLiverpoolBournemouthChelseaTottenham HotspurBrentfordfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The adrenaline of Aston Villa’s 4-3 comeback win at Brighton on Wednesday has probably only just faded. He made cinematic viewing and triggered memories of Mario Balotelli struggling to put on a warm-up bib and Tim Sherwood, while Villa manager a decade ago, launching his club-branded jacket towards the turf after Christian Benteke equalised against QPR.By the end, Emery was hoarse and Villa had chalked up an eighth victory in nine Premier League matches, 12 out of 14 in all competitions. Across the past 10 league matches, Villa have accrued a division-high 25 points and in that time onlyManchester City have scored more goalsandArsenal conceded fewer. This is the same team that failed to win any of their opening six matches and took three points from their first five league games. At that point Emery was concerned and shared his feelings with his squad, insisting his players raise their performance levels at training and in matches. Belief within an experienced squad – at 27.4 years, the average age of players selected in the league this season is the joint-oldest, with Fulham – did not waver.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreNow Villa will move within three points of Arsenal if they extend their winning streak to seven matches when they host the leaders on Saturday. Villa qualified for the Champions League 18 months ago and last season missed out on goal difference after anagonising final‑day defeatat Manchester United. But is this Villa squad at its peak? Might their experience be their superpower?Nine Villa players who featured in Emery’s first match, a 3-1 victory against United in November 2022, are key cogs in this machine. Emiliano Martínez, despite a moment of madness at Old Trafford in May, is the undisputed No 1, Ezri Konsa has evolved into an automatic pick for club and country, John McGinn and Boubacar Kamara are midfield monsters, and Lucas Digne, Matty Cash and Emiliano Buendía appear reloaded. Ollie Watkins leads from the front and Tyrone Mings was a regular until he was injured.The scary thing for Villa’s rivals is that while their top-flight record has been peerless since rallying against Fulham at the end of September, they have not necessarily been entirely convincing. They have not been blowing away teams, bar their 4-0 rout of a Bournemouth side in the midst of a five-game winless streak. October brought four wins in five matches, the highlights surely Cash, Digne and Buendía combining to devastating effect to earn acomeback victory at Tottenham, and a statement win over Manchester City, in which the right-back Cash scored the only goal with a wicked left-foot strike. November brought five wins in six matches. And yet, until scoring twice in midweek, Watkins, Villa’s only bona-fide striker, had scored only once across 19 matches.View image in fullscreenUnai Emery could not contain himself when Aston Villa came from behind to beat Brighton.Photograph: Sean Ryan/IPS/ShutterstockThe slow-burn emergence of the former Arsenal youngster Donyell Malen has helped, the Netherlands forward signed from Borussia Dortmund in January last year is Villa’s leading goalscorer after stepping out of the shadows. Emery recently explained Watkins had been managing knee pain since the start of last season. If his double against Brighton can spark a goalscoring run, Villa will surely be an even stronger proposition. The England forward, 30 at the end of December has hit double figures in each of his five previous seasons at the club, scoring 19 and 16 goals, respectively, in the 2023-24 and 2024-25 campaigns.Villa’s home form has been a foundation for success. They have been formidable at Villa Park since Emery took charge, the Basque losing eight of 58 league games there and only two since the start of last season:Crystal Palace’s 3-0 win in Augustthat heightened those early concerns and Arsenal’s last visit – just over 15 months ago. Since that Palace defeat, Villa have won their eight home matches across all competitions, conceding three goals.This season Digne, Cash, Kamara, McGinn and Morgan Rogers, an inspired Emery-driven signing last year, have agreed new contracts after an unsettling summer. The £40m sale of Jacob Ramsey to Newcastle to help comply with profitability and sustainability regulations (PSR) demoralised several of the squad and led some players to question their futures.

Most presumed that was a given considering Elliott arrived fresh from winning the player of the tournament asEngland retained the Under-21 European Championship, but he has not featured since 2 October. Sancho, borrowed from United, is yet to start a league match.Last month McGinn, the likable Villa captain, spoke of the “hangover” from missing out on the Champions League. “It was a big wake-up call to everyone how important these rules are,” he said of PSR. “It was a lot of uncertainty for players that left, players that stayed, and it certainly did affect us. It was tricky, but my job was to keep the players as focused as possible.

He denies betting on his own teamsAnna IsaacandRob DaviesFri 5 Dec 2025 12.17 ESTLast modified on Fri 5 Dec 2025 13.59 ESTShareTony Bloom, the billionaire owner of Brighton & Hove Albion FC, is facing questions over claims he was an anonymous gambler behind $70m (£52m) in winnings – which allegedly included bets on his football teams.Bloom – one of the world’s most successful professional gamblers – is claimed to be the “John Doe” referred to in a US legal case that tried to unmask who has benefited from the lucrative winning streak.Approached by the Guardian, Bloom declined to answer whether he was the “John Doe” in the court filing issued earlier this year. Bloom denied betting on his own teams or competitions that involve them, and a source close to him described the allegations as “entirely false”.MPs, including the former shadow sports minister Clive Efford, called on the Football Association (FA) to investigate the allegations.The Guardian revealed this week that Bloom faces a separate UK court claim that heuses frontmen to place substantial bets for a gambling syndicate he controls– including allegations he used Nigel Farage’s former aide and Reform UK insider George Cottrell.The US court case, which has not previously been linked to Bloom, also centres on claims that a gambling syndicate has been using a frontman to mask its role in winning vast sums of money.Bloom’s syndicate was publicly accused of placing bets on his own football teams by the co-founder of the online gambling company Rollbit, which brought the US legal action.Its co-founder, known as Razer, posted the claim on X on 14 November, alleging that Bloom’s syndicate placed bets on his own teams on Rollbit via a frontman. Since that time, other sources have also made the same claims: that Bloom’s syndicate bet on his own teams and competitions they participate in. That would breach FA rules.The US legal action was brought in order to seek information that would clarify that the “John Doe”, identified as Bloom’s syndicate on X, received winnings from bets placed by a frontman. The initial application was denied by a judge, but the dispute is ongoing.Bloom is already under scrutiny because of the separate lawsuit in England, which alleged he was using frontmen to place substantial bets for a gambling syndicate he controlled. Frontmen include “footballers, sportsmen and businessmen”, as well as Cottrell, the UK court document alleges.This syndicate bet “predominantly” on football, the UK document claims.Razer’s X post, and other sources who have spoken to the Guardian, go further, and claim Bloom’s syndicate bet on his own teams with his knowledge and participation. Bloom declined to answer questions about his involvement with his syndicate.As well as Brighton, Bloom has a financial interest in Royale Union Saint-Gilloise in Belgium.A source close to Bloom denied he and his betting syndicate had placed bets on his football clubs and competitions involving them, and said his betting activities were audited by a leading accountancy firm annually.This process was “to check and confirm that such bets have not taken place” and had shown Bloom had fully complied with the FA’s betting policies. Bloom follows the same audit procedure in Belgium, the source said.Bloom is one of a handful of club owners who was given in 2014 a “carve-out” to allow him to carry on gambling, but not on any of his own teams or competitions they take part in. If the allegations made are proved, this could be a breach of FA rules.Efford, a Labour MP, questioned this controversial exemption and said the FA should investigate.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Severe sanctions have been imposed on players for gambling on matches and owners are covered by the same rules so this cannot be ignored.”Clive Betts, the chair of the all-party parliamentary group on football, said: “It demonstrates a potentially very serious problem and could just be the tip of the iceberg. It needs a thorough and comprehensive investigation from the FA and transparency around the regulations that govern this in the future.”Iain Duncan Smith, a former leader of the Conservative party, added: “The FA must be much more transparent about their lax policy concerning the use of gambling money in the running of their clubs.”Bloom is regarded as one of the world’s most successful gamblers, and is known in the industry by the moniker of “The Lizard”.His gambling collective, the Starlizard Betting Syndicate, is alleged to make about £600m each year, according to the UK court filing.The claim in England has been started by a former business partner, who has alleged that Bloom owes him his share of gambling profits estimated in the region of $250m.A source close to Bloom has said he intends to file a defence to the high court claim in due course.Cottrell did not respond when asked for comment.Explore more on these topicsBrighton & Hove AlbionGamblingnewsShareReuse this content"

The midfielder was referred to an independent regulatory commission after spitting in the direction of visiting fans at Turf Moore around the 67th minute as Burnley won 2-0, the Football Association said.An FA statement said: “An independent Regulatory Commission has sanctioned Burnley’s Hannibal Mejbri for misconduct during their Premier League match against Leeds on 18 October. It was alleged that the player acted in breach of the laws of the game and/or in an improper manner and/or used abusive and/or indecent behaviour by spitting at or in the direction of Leeds United supporters around the 67th minute.“Mejbri subsequently admitted the charge, and the Regulatory Commission imposed a four-match suspension and £15,000 fine following a hearing. The Regulatory Commission’s written reasons for its decisions will be published in due course.”Burnley, 19th in the table, have lost five matches in a row and visit 12th-placed Newcastle on Saturday.Guardian sport2.Maresca admits Chelsea toil when they rotateEnzo Maresca has raised questions over Chelsea’s ability to compete for the title by admitting their quality drops when they rotate and bring in squad players.Although the club’s hierarchy and recruitment team are supportive of their head coach’s attempts to manage the demands of a busy schedule, the drawbacks of shuffling the pack so much were evident when the youngest side in the Premier Leaguelost 3-1 at Leedsand fell nine points below Arsenal on Wednesday night.Maresca, who suggested his rotation policy was partly down to wanting to protect key players such as Reece James and Wesley Fofana from injury, watched a poor display after making five changes at Elland Road. Andrey Santos replaced the suspended Moisés Caicedo in midfield, Tosin Adarabioyo and Benoît Badiashile started in central defence and Jamie Gittens and Liam Delap came into the attack but the performance has led to doubts over whether Maresca’s squad is strong enough.“I try always to be honest with you,” the Italian said. “But in football, in life, in any job, there is a level. Andrey unfortunately is not Moi. Tosin is not Wes. They have different skills. They are different. If I say to you that Andrey is like Moi, you can understand for yourself that I am a liar. There is a level. Like me. Plenty of managers are better than me. Some not. But there is a level at all jobs. For me it is the reality. Even the players know they are all different.”Maresca will hope that resting James, Fofana and Pedro Neto will pay off when Chelsea visit Bournemouth on Saturday. He said Cole Palmer was ready to start but unlikely to play 90 minutes after making his comeback from injury with a cameo against Leeds. Caicedo remains unavailable after his red card against Arsenal.The Ecuadorian’s absence leaves a big hole in Chelsea’s midfield. Maresca said he would like to play James, who was outstanding in the middle against Arsenal, all the time but must be wary of the captain’s fitness record. Chelsea have been stretched by playing in the Champions League.“I love all the players that I have,” Maresca said. “But if I play players that have a high risk of injury, that means that I don’t want them or love them, because I would want them to be injured and out for a long time.”Chelsea are a fearsome proposition with their strongest side. That, though, is not always possible. John Terry reacted to the Leeds game by saying Maresca should ditch his rotation policy and stick with a core of 14 players.Asked about the former Chelsea captain’s comments, Maresca said: “We are trying to understand and to learn why we were not good enough. I don’t know if the solution is to have 12 or 14 players and the rest just play some minutes. But we are trying to understand. If you play every three days, two days with the same 11, I don’t know.”View image in fullscreenTosin Adarabioyo struggled against Leeds and was singled out for his poor performance by Enzo Maresca.Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty ImagesMaresca was adamant that a lack of leadership did not contribute to the performance against Leeds. The Italian, who admitted regret over not starting Josh Acheampong in defence, pointed out that Tosin, Chelsea’s oldest player at 28, had a poor game in defence.“We always talk about experience when we drop points,” Maresca said. “The reason why we didn’t win against Leeds is not because of experience. Who is the oldest one for us in the pitch? Tosin. Did he play good? So, it’s not about experience.”Maresca indicated that he was not enjoying having to make so many changes because of the schedule. “It’s the most difficult thing for me this season,” he said.Jacob Steinberg3.Rodri still ‘a few weeks’ away from City returnPep Guardiola has stated Rodri’s recovery from a hamstring injury will rule him out for a “few weeks”, with the manager confident that the midfielder’s return will solve Manchester City’s faulty defence.City have conceded six goals in their past two matches; two against Leeds and four against Fulham. Rodri sustained his latest injury in City’s 1-0 win at Brentford on 5 October. Since then he has played only for a few minutes after coming on as an 89th-minute substitute in the 3-1 victory over Bournemouth at the start of last month.“The process of recovery is going well. He starts to make training sessions on the pitch,” said Guardiola of the Spanish midfielder. “Hopefully in a few weeks, it can start [return].” “Do you know what it means to play without the best player in the world? Rodri is another level of player. If Rodri came on in the last 20 minutes against Fulham, put right in the middle, do you know the effect? Not even touching the ball? The other 10 players feel safe. They play better.“There are irreplaceable players, not just for how good they play but for what they do for others. They say: ‘Oh I have Rodri there’ and they give him the ball and know he won’t lose [it]. He knows when the space is free, to switch play, he’s unique. He is suffering, struggling, he wants to come back but I want to protect him, be sure to minimise the risk.”Rodri’s hamstring problem was a latest setback in his recovery from the anterior cruciate ligament injury he sustained against Arsenal in September 2024. “When he comes back, he has to make a pre-season. He cannot play 90 minutes, 90 minutes, 90 minutes,” said Guardiola. “When you injure your ACL, your body is completely different.”View image in fullscreenPep Guardiola gestures to the City midfielder Savio during a chaotic match at Fulham.Photograph: Sally Rawlins/Every Second Media/ShutterstockCommenting on England’s World Cup prospects, Guardiola said: “If you see the quality of the manager, if you see the quality of the players, the moment they believe it, they can do it [win]. Thomas [Tuchel] will convince them that they can do it.“I’ve not been manager of a national team and these tournaments are so special – a short competition. One half bad afternoon, you are home – British Airlines [and] come back. The most important thing is to create a real team – in that month and a-half you are there. Because everyone is from Aston Villa, Chelsea, Arsenal, City, United, Liverpool, and all together, you are able to create something unique, something special. That is more important than the tactics.”Jamie Jackson4.Newcastle focus on Livramento and Botman dealsNewcastle’s new sporting director, Ross Wilson, has placed contract negotiations with the key defenders Tino Livramento and Sven Botman at the top of his to do list at St James’ Park. Wilson arrived from Nottingham Forest in October and was reassured to learn the club’s Italy midfielder Sandro Tonali has a deal extending to 2029 and, potentially, 2030.That has left Wilson free to prioritise talks with Livramento and Botman’s agents, but with the former’s agreement set to expire in 2027 and the latter’s a year later, Newcastle’s talks have assumed a certain urgency.“My first three or four days in the job was when I found that Sandro’s contract situation as significantly better than the one I was expecting,” said Wilson, who does not want the club’s players running down their contracts down.View image in fullscreenNewcastle want to tie up Tino Livramento after his deal expires in 2027.Photograph: Craig Cowan/ProSports/Shutterstock“But it’s no secret that we would want to extend Tino’s contract and we would want to extend Sven Botman’s too. Those discussions are ongoing. Some discussions are more difficult than others, but the desire would be to keep those players. Will they agree those contracts? At the moment, I think it’s too early to say.”Eddie Howe will be without Botman at home to Burnley on Saturday and the defender is likely to be sidelined for at least another week. More positively, Newcastle’s manager hopes Yoane Wissa could make his long awaited debut. The £55m signing has been working his way back to fitness after sustaining a knee injury on international duty with DR Congo in early September.Louise Taylor5.Nuno says Paquetá will start for West HamNuno Espírito Santo has confirmed Lucas Paquetá will return for West Ham to face Brighton on Sunday after serving his suspension for the red card he received against Liverpool. “It is in the past. I am positive it will not happen again because he personally admitted his mistake,” the West Ham manager said. “We spoke about it in the dressing room. I am positive it is over and it will not be repeated.”View image in fullscreenMateus Fernandes tries to play the peacemaker and stop Lucas Paqueta from confronting the referee.Photograph: Alexander Canillas/SPP/ShutterstockNuno also understandsthe intense pressure on his side,who are 18th before the weekend fixtures. “We cannot avoid it,” he said. “It is a reality. We have to face it. We are fighting for survival. We cannot hide it. The results of other teams we cannot control. It is up to us.”Nuno hopes the injured Crysencio Summerville will return soon and said the left-back Oliver Scarles is expected to return to the squad after should he pass a medical on Monday. He added: “We are going to need him because we lose our full-backs to Afcon.”Aaron Wan-Bissaka will join up with DR Congo and El Hadji Malick Diouf with Senegal for the tournament in Morocco, which starts on 21 December.Jamie Jackson6.Moyes eager to keep Grealish despite high feeDavid Moyes has confirmed that he wants Jack Grealish to remain at Everton beyond this season but admits the attacking midfielder would be out of the club’s reach at £50m.Grealish is thriving at Everton and delivered the club’s first league win at Bournemouth in midweek with his second goal of the season. Under the terms of the season’s loan from Manchester City, Everton have an option to buy the 30-year-old for £50m next summer, when Grealish will have 12 months remaining on his contract at the Etihad Stadium.Asked whether he saw Grealish playing for Everton next season, Moyes said: “Yes I do. I am still giving him the electric prod – keep going – and making sure I am getting more out of him every week. He is not too old but he is getting to the wrong age. He has to keep showing what he is capable of. The biggest thing for me is that he has been getting through the games. I have not been feeling like I need to take him off.“I am sure we would have to alter that [£50m fee]. I don’t think we would be in that ball game and, let’s be fair, adding everything into it, such as his age, it would be very difficult to pay that sort of money.”Grealish declared his love for Moyes following the Bournemouth win and has established a similar rapport with the Everton crowd. For his part, Moyes believes the enjoyment Grealish is getting out of his loan move could convince him to stay beyond this season. “I use the example of Jesse Lingard,” said the Scot. “I took him to West Ham and nearly begged Jesse to come again because he scored nine goals in 16 games and got himself back in the England squad.“They are different players and different situations but Jesse probably thought he was going back to play for Manchester United. We tracked him throughout the summer but couldn’t get him back because he had been told he was going to play for Manchester United again. And he didn’t.“Sometimes you have to make brave decisions,” Moyes added. “It is easy to say the grass isn’t always greener but it is only when you get older that you think: ‘What did I do that move for? Why did I not stay and enjoy it?’ They are lording Jack here and I am sure they do at Manchester City as well but maybe in a different way. He certainly was at Aston Villa. But he is enjoying it and the connection he has got with the supporters is fantastic. It is helping with the rebuild of the club here.”Andy HunterExplore more on these topicsFootballThe talkPremier LeagueBurnleyChelseaManchester CityNewcastle UnitedWest Ham UnitedShareReuse this content"

Buta spirited performance at Newcastle in midweekin which Cristian Romero equalised with an overhead kick in added time has lifted spirits after three successive losses.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreFrank has increasingly tinkered with his lineup as he attempts to juggle the demands of two matches a week, with only Chelsea and Wolves having made more changes this season. In particular, he seems undecided over the left of his attack, having rotated between Brennan Johnson, Mathys Tel and Wilson Odobert for most of the season. The £51m signing Xavi Simons has not started the past four matches.Asked whether he was still searching for his best team, the head coach said: “Yes, I think it’s fair. I’ve got an idea of quite a few positions. I also think there’s competition so it’s not that easy all the time to say: ‘OK, it’s just those 11,’ because you need more than 11 players. It’s a combination also with the amount of games and that rotation, so definitely for the rest of the season if we do well in the Champions League there will be rotations. But it will be closer and closer until you see the main nine or 10 players that we go with.”Frank spent nine years atBrentfordbefore replacing Ange Postecoglou at Spurs in the summer and he insisted old friendships would be put on ice on Saturday. Keith Andrews’ side have lost six of their seven league away games but Tottenham’s only home league victory came against Burnley on the opening day. Frank is confident his players are not mentally scarred by their disastrous start against Fulham.“It was a freak six minutes, but that of course happens when things are not perfect,” he said. “I think it’s about talking about it. You can’t run away from it … No matter what happens, stick to the plan. No matter what happens, be calm. And then encourage each other. And then like with everything, it’s one step at a time. Then we know every game you will have a bit of momentum. And then it’s about taking that.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I think he’s got a very big potential to be that playmaker. I have a big belief that he’ll be very good for us … As long as the player trains well, keeps the right attitude, keeps doing the right thing, step by step, we will see him flourish. I’m not in doubt of that. We’re always so good to judge him now, but probably after a year or two: ‘Oh, how good is he?’ Now everyone is talking about Damsgaard.

Isak had another quiet game. Slot has repeatedly defended the Swede’s slow start as an inevitable consequence of missing pre-season with Newcastle, when he in effect went on strike to force his exit, but Liverpool’s head coach admits his team are also culpable for the player’s problems.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead more“He is not the only No 9 who suffers in some games from not getting many chances,” said Slot, who has Conor Bradley back from injury for Saturday’s trip to Leeds. “At this level it’s not like the No 9 is involved in eight, nine, 10 chances every single half. But it is obvious and clear that we want to bring him into more threatening situations.“Before we went to only one goal conceded in two games [West Ham and Sunderland] we had a lot of chances. Because we are a little bit more compact and not taking as many risks, we have not been able to create as many chances as all of the games before. It is definitely one of the things on my list of things to improve to get our No 9 more involved in the game and more involved in the final third.”Isak has averaged only 14 touches per game in his last three starts forLiverpoolbut Slot insists it is where he touches the ball, not how often, that counts. “Do you know how many times he touched the ball at Newcastle on average? Twenty-two,” he said (it was 36.8 last season according to Opta). “In this league strikers don’t touch the ball that much but a few times they do touch it, it’s quite nice if they finish it off. I have no clue what the stats of Haaland are but I wouldn’t be surprised if he doesn’t touch it 100 times a game, but he does score a lot. It is more important that they touch the ball in the right times than to touch it so many times. Haaland touches it much more where it matters and that’s where we need to improve. It is clear and obvious.”Isak’s match fitness remains an issue problem and Slot admitted it is still “unrealistic” to expect the Sweden international to complete three 90-minute games in a week. He played 68 and 86 minutes against West Ham and Sunderland respectively. “That’s not the way you want to start your career at Liverpool,” he said the Dutchman. “It is far, far from an ideal situation but, again, this club doesn’t buy a player for half a year. We bought him for six years.”Slot believes the absence of an orthodox winger at Liverpool and the rising trend of Premier League teams defending in a low block have added to Isak’s difficulties at his new club. “With Jeremie Frimpong being injured and Conor Bradley being out it is not like we have so many options on the right-hand side, and it is a bit similar on the left,” he added the head coach. “Alex could benefit maybe from a Conor or a Jeremie type of player who goes outside, instead of both wingers we have who come inside and full-backs who can come in with crosses.“But the main difference for him is that we are facing a low block many times. It is not that it never happened at Newcastle but not as much, I think. This season the league has changed, we see so many more low blocks than last season. But I see this not only against us, I see this in many games. It makes it harder for him compared to his time at Newcastle but I think it is also him adjusting to his teammates and his teammates adjusting to him. But it is obvious and clear that we have not the profile of [Newcastle’s] Jacob Murphy, for example, available at this moment at this time.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolArne SlotnewsShareReuse this content"

The announcement of the deal in June was led by lengthy remarks from Rehal, who described the takeover as “more than a business venture” and “a long-term commitment, rooted in respect, responsibility, and a genuine love for the game”.Morecambe are 22nd in the National League, having gone into pre-season with five registered players.The Independent Football Regulator (IFR), which was not in place when the takeover went through, said it would “urgently” assess the situation at the club. “We are working with relevant authorities and using our statutory information gathering powers to look into this matter urgently,” a spokesperson said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I don’t shy away from saying that we want to play for promotion,” Eckert said.Quick GuideBoro stride clear in second with rout of HullShowMiddlesbrough ran riot at a wet and windy Hull to continue their perfect start to life under their new head coach, Kim Hellberg, and consolidate second spot in the Championship.The miserable conditions, which led to a 15-minute delay to an 8pm kick-off, threatened to wreak havoc on this contest but Boro handled them considerably better as David Strelec put them ahead early on.Alex Gilbert, Morgan Whittaker and Riley McGree all struck within a 12-minute window before half-time and although Joe Gelhardt pulled one back from the spot after the hour, the damage was done as Boro claimed a 4-1 win that puts them five points clear of third-placed Millwall ahead of the weekend.Boro have won both fixtures since last month's appointment of Hellberg, who was vindicated in giving Gilbert his first league start for the club since May 2024 as he scored and provided the assist for Whittaker.Hull could have moved up to third with a win but their leaky defence - only crisis club Sheffield Wednesday have conceded more than the Tigers' 34 goals this season - was their undoing.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Southampton’s technical director, Johannes Spors, said Eckert’s “empathy for the playing group and the clarity with which he communicates his ideas have been central to the team’s improvement since he took charge”.Eckert has never worked as a first-team manager but has been assistant manager at Barnsley and Genoa.Southampton are 14th in the table with 24 points from 18 matches, five points off the playoff spots.

But defeats on their home turf on the outskirts of Salford have been a rarity in recent seasons under Sanderson; now they have suffered two inside a week.The Sale director of rugby, whose side lost 27-26 at home to Exeter after leading 26-6, said: “I’m not concerned – I’ve been on longer runs of losses in 20 years of coaching.“I understand that at times it gets hard, but that’s the way sport goes and it’s about finding a way to work your way out of it. Weirdly, some part of me enjoys that aspect of the job. You have to otherwise you’ll spend 30-40% of your life in abject misery.”Smith, Glasgow’s head coach, could not hide his delight after another notable victory over Sale, who they thumped 38-19 at Scotstoun last December. The South African said: “Sale were on a revenge path after last year, but I’ve got a lot of confidence and trust in my boys. We often fight back, but to score 26 points after you’ve been down 14 was important. Now it’s on to the next challenge.”View image in fullscreenMarius Louw dives over for Sale’s third try to bring them back into the match in the second half.Photograph: David Rogers/Getty ImagesIt was a bitterly cold, windswept evening, the kind that can test the soul, but Sale quickly warmed to their task. With the wind at their backs, they led when their captain, Ernst van Rhyn, outmuscled the visiting defence to squeeze over from close range and Rob du Preez converted.Sale lost the centre Rekeiti Ma’asi-White to injury in the 16th minute but his replacement Ollie Davies, 19, scored on his Champions Cup debut soon after following excellent work from the full-back Arron Reed.Du Preez’s second conversion put Sale 14-0 ahead but Glasgow steadied themselves and began to go through the phases in home territory. Their pressure finally told in the 32nd ­minute when the hooker Gregor ­Hiddleston was driven over in the left corner.Moments before the interval, ­the Scotland flanker Rory Darge dived over from close range and Adam Hastings’s conversion cut Sale’s lead to two points.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A poor box kick from Sale’s scrum-half, Raffi Quirke, was seized on by Steyn and he showed impressive speed and strength to break away, outpace a leaden-footed home defence and score.It was awful defending and Hastings added the conversion to put Glasgow 21-14 in front before his side grabbed a fourth try in the 54th minute. This time the impressive McDowall capitalised on more dreadful defending to canter over from close range on his 100th appearance for the Warriors, who had now scored 26 points without reply.In the 64th minute, Marius Louw scored Sale’s third try after good work by Tom O’Flaherty. Du Preez converted to cut Glasgow’s advantage to five points.Could Sanderson’s men, with Ben Curry having been introduced, rouse themselves once again to find a match-winning score? The answer was no as Sale were left with a now familiar sinking feeling.Sanderson, a positive person by nature, said: “We lost by a point last week and five points tonight, so it’s not a big step to start turning things around and getting wins. I’m ­encouraged by that, but there are some things we can do better.”Explore more on these topicsChampions CupSaleGlasgow RugbyRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

That curtain raiser will be played in either Boston or the MetLife Stadium near New York.The Brazil game, which will be played in Miami or Atlanta on 24 June, will evoke memories of the opening match of France 98. Back then,Scotlandheld their own but were narrowly defeated 2-1 at Stade de France by the eventual runners-up through a heartbreaking Tommy Boyd own goal. The countries have met only once since then, in a 2011 friendly that Brazil won 2-1 at the Emirates Stadium, but the fixture used to be a regular occurrence at World Cup level. They were also drawn together in 1974, 1982 and 1990; Scotland were beaten in all of those games except a goalless draw in 1974.World Cup 2026 draw: USA to face Australia and Paraguay in group stageRead moreMorocco, who were semi-finalists in 2022, also conjure up images of a meeting in the 1998 tournament although Scotland will not want to hark back to a 3-0 defeat that confirmed they would finish bottom of the group. This time the teams, who have not played each other since, will meet in Philadelphia or Boston on 19 June. The match against surprise qualifiers Haiti, whose only finals appearance was in 1974, will be the countries’ first meeting.Scotland qualified thrillingly with an emotionallate win against Denmarkbut their midfielder Ryan Christie, speaking after the draw, said they have no intention of stopping there. “We have to go over there wanting to try and prove a point,” he said. “We’re not just there to make up the numbers. We’re wanting to go and compete and get through the group phase.“Two out of the three games are going to be massively tough and even Haiti, nobody gets to a World Cup without being a decent team. [They are] teams we’re not used to playing.”Although they flopped at Euro 2024, Christie believes Scotland can aim higher next summer. “Hopefully, we can go this one step further this time,” he said. “We go into that tournament a little bit as the underdogs. It suits us. Hopefully, these other teams don’t know what to expect and we can surprise them a little bit.”Wales and Northern Ireland ­discovered their possible ­opponents, although only one of them can qualify because they will compete in the same playoff quartet. Canada, ­Switzerland and Qatar await in Group B should either side progress.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The winners of those games will then meet on 31 March for a place at the World Cup.Australia have never played Kosovo in an international fixture of any kind and only previously played friendlies against their other three potential European opponents – the most recent coming in 2013 when a Holger Osieck-led side lost 3-2 to Romania in Marbella, Spain.Conversely, led by the former Argentina international Mauricio Pochettino,USA will prove familiar opposition for the Australians, it being just two months since thetwo played in a friendly in Denver, Colorado. Jordan Bos opened the scoring for the Socceroos in that contest, but it was the Americans who won 2-1 after goals from Haji Wright on either side of the half-time break.View image in fullscreenSocceroos defender Cameron Burgess and the United States’ Chris Richards have a word during the international friendly in Colorado.Photograph: Andrew Wevers/USSF/Getty ImagesLaying the seeds of narrative for their coming rematch, that was also a game in which physicality was a major theme; the American star Christian Pulisic was injured by a Jason Geria challenge in the first half, and US defender Chris Richards told media post-game that: “They’re lucky it was a friendly. I was ready to go. And if [the referee] didn’t give me a shit yellow in the corner, I probably would’ve killed somebody.”Popovic expects more of the same in the reunion with the US next year. “The game was played in a very competitive spirit,” he said. “There was nothing friendly, really, about the match.“We played well in the match, and we get to do it again, and this time, with a lot more at stake, at a World Cup against a host nation. So it’s quite special, and I’m sure it’ll be a fantastic match.”Reaction to the draw from the American side has been quick to declare Group D as the “Group of Life” with one analysis describing the Socceroos as a “lay up” opponent from pot 2.“I’m sure every Australian would disagree with that, and so we should, but I’m not surprised by those comments,” said Popovic. “If you’re the US and you look at the draw, you’re the host nation, you’re playing at home, and you want to fancy yourself to be able to get through.“But that shouldn’t stop us from believing [we can] get through the group as well. We’ll go into it with a lot of optimism and confidence; I’m sure the boys are looking at the draw and can’t wait to get over there.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And I think anyone that underestimates us will get a rude shock when it comes to those group games.”Australia have never lost to Paraguay in their five previous fixtures, recording two wins and three draws, but, as is the case with their potential European opponents, their meeting in North America will mark the first time they’ve playedLos Guaraníesin a competitive contest.World Cup 2026: a look at the United States’ group-stage opponentsRead moreThe two nations last faced off in 2010, when a goal from David Carney led a Socceroo outfit coached by Pim Verbeek to a 1-0 win in Sydney.

Piastri is a further four points back. Having spent all season allowing their drivers to race and attempting to be scrupulously fair to both, Brown announced at the Yas Marina circuit that if circumstances rendered it ­necessary, they would use orders.Max Verstappen beats Piastri to take F1 title race to Abu Dhabi GP as Norris faltersRead more“Yes, of course. We’re realistic, we want to win this drivers’ championship,” the McLaren chief executive said. “If we get into the race and it’s becoming pretty clear that one has a chance and the other doesn’t, we’re going to do what we can to win. It would be crazy not to.”With Norris requiring third place or better to seal his first championship, the most likely scenario involving team orders would require Piastri to give up a place to Norris to ­guarantee him a podium spot in the event of ­Verstappen leading the race.Brown said he was confident both drivers would acquiesce to any instruction from the team, when asked if he believed Piastri would willingly move over for Norris.“Yes, our drivers have always complied with team wishes just as we comply with their wishes,” he said. “So I’ve got no doubt either of our drivers will continue to race, as they’ve done brilliantly, in the best interests of the team.”On Thursdayin Abu Dhabi Norris and Piastri said they had yet to have any discussion about orders with the team but the team principal, Andrea Stella, had been clear after the last round in Qatar that they would address the issue and come to clear, agreed plans with their drivers. McLaren’s approach to being fair to both drivers has come under considerable scrutiny this season but Brown denied the team were going back on their principles.“I don’t think it’s a U-turn,” he said. “We’re going to start the weekend like we have the other 23, which is going in giving both drivers equal opportunity. We’ll use common sense. We’re not going to throw away a drivers’ championship over a sixth and a ­seventh place, a third and a fourth place, a fifth and a sixth place, if one of our drivers doesn’t have the ­opportunity. We’re just going to stay true to our racing principles. So we’ll see how the race plays out.”View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen talks to Laurent Mekies (left).Photograph: ANP/ShutterstockNorris remains favourite but ­Verstappen goes into the finale with four consecutive drivers’ champion­ship titles under his belt and has recovered from a 104‑point deficit at the Dutch GP in late August. His team principal, Laurent ­Mekies, paid tribute to him and the team’s achievements.“Max just never does a mistake,” he said. “He keeps surprising us every day. You throw him out there. ­Sometimes, the car is great. ­Sometimes it’s a touch less great than what we would hope and he doesn’t miss a start. He doesn’t miss tyre management, he doesn’t miss an overtake.“He’s just the way he is. It is true that it gives a lot of confidence to the whole team. It is true that it fits so well with, in general, the approach that this team has on how you go racing, ­taking maximum risk, ­accepting the pain when the risk went over the edge.”Norris topped the time sheets in first practice in Abu Dhabi but by only eight-thousandths of a ­second. ­Piastri did not run in the first ­session, as he had to take his mandatory ­second time sitting out practice to allow a young driver a chance in the car. Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc was third, only a hundredth of a second off Verstappen.Norris was once more on top in the second session, appearing ­confident and dialled in at the Yas Marina ­circuit. He was three-tenths up on Verstappen in second with ­Mercedes’ George Russell third and Piastri only in 11th, apparently ­suffering from ­balance issuesExplore more on these topicsFormula One 2025Formula OneMotor sportMcLarenLando NorrisOscar PiastrinewsShareReuse this content"

Here’s what to know about the co-host’s opponents.AustraliaFifa ranking26How they qualifiedThe Socceroos qualified automatically by finishing second in AFC group C, four points behindJapan. They won five, drew four and lost once while maintaining the second-best defensive record in the group.World Cup 2026 draw: USA to face Australia and Paraguay in group stageRead moreRecent World Cup historyThey made their World Cup debut in 1974, finishing in the group stage. Australia have played in each of the past five World Cups, reaching the Round of 16 in 2006 and 2022. The Australians were the lowest-ranked team in Pot 2, meaning their presence was the first step toward making this a very favorable draw for the home side.History against the United StatesAs will become a theme, it’s pretty recent. The USdefeated the Soccerroos 2-1in a friendly back in October.Best-known playersUS fans may be familiar with NYC FC midfielder Aiden O’Neill. Goalkeeper Matthew Ryan has over 100 caps for his country and plenty of experience throughout European soccer.What they’re saying“I think friendly games are very different, and I’m sure their squad will change, and it has changed since they’ve played us. We’ve changed players as well since then, and I’m sure that will continue for the next six months.” – Tony Popovic, Australia head coachParaguayFifa ranking39How they qualifiedParaguay finished sixth in Conmebol World Cup qualifying, getting the last automatic spot in the tournament with an eight-point gap above Bolivia, but tied on points with Brazil, Colombia and Uruguay.Recent World Cup historyThere hasn’t been much! Paraguay last qualified in 2010, the tournament in South Africa where they advanced to the quarter-finals. That was their best-ever finish at a World Cup, and capped a run of four straight appearances in the finals.History against the United StatesAt the very first World Cup in 1930, the United States beat Paraguay 3-0 to clinch their spot in the semi-final, still the best US performance at a men’s World Cup. More recently, theUS beat Paraguayin a friendly in November that marked the return of Gio Reyna in top form to the team.Best-known playersMiguel Almirón turned an MVP season with Atlanta United in MLS to a big-money move to Newcastle United, and then a return to Atlanta this past offseason. Diego Gómez of Brighton & Hove Albion boosted his profile playing with Lionel Messi at Inter Miami. Gustavo Gómez is the team’s captain and primary goal-scoring option, and is a fixture for Brazilian side Palmeiras.What they’re saying“It’s an even group, I have the feeling that beyond the pots, there’s a pretty good level of parity and competitiveness … While Paraguay has secured its qualification to next year’s World Cup, if we just leave it at that because we’ve qualified and we fall asleep, it’s most likely that another episode like the one that happened will occur, of not qualifying for 16 years.” – Gustavo Alfaro, Paraguay head coachTurkey / Romania / Kosovo / SlovakiaThese are the four teams that will compete in a playoff for the final spot in Group D, and each one presents a potentially intriguing matchup for the US. Turkey will be the favorite based on their recent history in World Cups and owning the highest Fifa ranking. Should they be the ones to advance out of this group, the US will have the advantage (or perhaps disadvantage) of having every World Cup group opponent be a team they have played in a friendly the year before. The US played Turkey in apre-Gold Cup friendly in June, losing 2-1.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026USAUS sportsanalysisShareReuse this content"

Venues and kick-off times will be announced from 5pm GMT on Saturday but the group’s matches are split across four US cities – Dallas, Boston, New York/New Jersey and Philadelphia – and Toronto.World Cup 2026 draw updates: England to meet Croatia, Brazil await Scotland, USA will face Australia – liveRead moreCroatia beat England 2-1 in extra timeto end an unexpected run for Gareth Southgate’s side in Russia. England beat Panama handily, though, winning 6-1 in the group stage. They have never faced Ghana at the World Cup.“Difficult group, difficult opener,” Thomas Tuchel said. “Difficult group with Croatia and Ghana, two regulars in World Cups and two proud and strong nations. Panama, I don’t know much about Panama but we will find out about it before the tournament starts, of course.”At the draw in Washington DC, which lasted more than two hours after 90 minutes of preamble, there were a number of strong groups selected. Scotland will also face a partial repeat of their last World Cup campaign in 1998 after they weredrawn alongside Brazil and Morocco, as well as Haiti, in Group C.The most prominent candidate for the title of “Group of Death” is Group I, where the seeds France are joined by Senegal and Erling Haaland’s Norway alongside the winner of an international playoff.USA faceAustralia, Paraguay and a European playoff winner.If England win their group they will face a third-placed team from groups E, J, I, H or K in the last 32. Victory would probably then bring a match against the winners of Group A, where Mexico are drawn alongside South Africa, South Korea and the winner of the playoff section involving the Republic of Ireland. Win that and there is the potential for a mouthwatering quarter-final against Brazil.After seeding changes by Fifa, England would be in line to face Argentina in the semi-finals.Although Croatia will be strong opponents for England, their golden generation has mostly retired, with the remaining stars Ivan Perisic and Luka Modric 36 and 40 respectively. England have beaten Croatia at a tournament since the chastening defeat in Moscow,winning 1-0 in their opening matchof the 2021 European Championship.Ghana have featured in four of the past five ­tournaments but have fallen some way from the team that reached the quarter-finals in 2010. Their squad includes familiar faces from English football, Tottenham’s Mohammed Kudus and Antoine Semenyo of Bournemouth among them. Panama are ranked 30th in the world, one place behind Norway, and were unbeaten through two rounds of qualifying, despite an absence of household names.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A further complication was added by the recent decision by Fifa to prevent their four highest-ranked sides – Spain, Argentina, France and England – from playing each other before the semi-finals.The draw served as the climax to a glitzy, stilted event dominated by theaward of a new Fifa peace prize to Donald Trumpon behalf of “the billions of people who love this game and want peace”. Trump acknowledged the award as one of the “great honours of my life” and gave a speech that praised the scale of World Cup ticket sales and stuck precisely to his allocated time of two minutes.Gianni Infantino was also a recurring presence on the stage, the Fifa president not only awarding the peace prize but acting as moderator of an added part of the draw where the leaders of the three host countries, Trump, president Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico, and the prime minister of Canada, Mark Carney, were invited to draw the balls featuring their own nations. He also performed in a recorded skit with Rio Ferdinand, the former England international acting as conductor for the draw.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026EnglandWorld CupScotlandUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Games against Australia, Paraguay, and one of Turkey, Romania, Slovakia and Kosovo will await the US in the 2026 World Cup, which they will co-host with Mexico and Canada, after the draw for the competition at the Kennedy Center on Friday.The United States’ opening game in the competition is set for 12 June in Los Angeles, with subsequent group games in Seattle on 19 June and in Los Angeles again on 25 June. Fifa will announce the order of opponents and the kickoff times for those games on Saturday at 5pm ET.As a co-host of the tournament, the US were placed into Pot 1 of theWorld Cupdraw, which took place in a lavish and at times ridiculous ceremony on Friday afternoon. Former England defender Rio Ferdinand presided over the draw, with help from a procession of US sports stars: former NFL quarterback Tom Brady, New York Yankees slugger Aaron Judge, basketball hall-of-famer Shaquille O’Neal, and NHL great Wayne Gretzky.Australia were drawn in the US’s group out of Pot 2. The two sides have not before in a men’s World Cup, though they did play a friendly in Colorado earlier this year, which was won 2-1 by the US. The Socceroos qualified by finishing second in their World Cup qualifying group in Asia, behind Japan.Paraguay are the Pot 3 representative. They finished sixth in South American World Cup qualifying, in the last automatic spot. They, too, recently played the US in a friendly – a 2-1 win by the US in Chester, Pennsylvania.The Pot 4 representative will be one of Turkey, Romania, Slovakia and Kosovo. Those teams are involved in a playoff, which will take place in March, for a qualifying spot from Europe, with the winner advancing to the World Cup finals. Should Turkey win the tournament, all three US group opponents will be teams they played in friendlies in 2025.If the US win their group, they will face a third-placed team from one of Groups B, E, F, I or J, depending on how they rank at the conclusion of the group stage. Notably, this sets up a potential cross-border clash with co-host Canada, who will compete in Group B along with Qatar, Switzerland and the winner of European play-off B (Ukraine, Poland, Albania, and Sweden). Notable teams from the other groups include Germany, Netherlands, France and Argentina. Regardless of opponent, the US winning their group would set up a Round of 32 match on 1 July in Santa Clara, California.If the US finish as group runner-up, their Round of 32 game will be at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, on 3 July. There, they will play the runner-up from Group G, which features Belgium, Egypt, Iran and New Zealand.If they finish as one of the best third-placed teams among multiple groups, the US face three possible options for a knockout round debut: 29 June at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts against the winner of Group E (Germany, Curaçao, Ivory Coast, and Ecuador)); 30 June at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey against the winner of Group I (France, Senegal, Norway, or a European play-off winner), or 3 July at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City against the winner of Group K (Portugal, Uzbekistan, Colombia, or another European play-off winner)Elsewhere in Friday’s draw, holders Argentina received a forgiving path in Group J, opening their title defense against Algeria before meeting Austria and debutants Jordan. European champions Spain were also handed a manageable assignment in Group H alongside Cape Verde, Uruguay and Saudi Arabia.England will fancy their chancesof progressing from Group L, which includes 2018 finalists Croatia as well as Ghana and Panama. France face a more complicated route in Group I after drawing Senegal and Erling Haaland’s Norway, with the group completed by an intercontinental play-off winner from Iraq, Bolivia or Suriname.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It can be used while examining live footage of people passing cameras, comparing their faces with those on wanted lists, or be used by officers to target individuals as they walk by mounted cameras.Images of suspects can also be run retrospectively through police, passport or immigration databases to identify them and check their backgrounds.Analysts who examined the police national database’s retrospective facial recognition technology tool at a lower setting found that “the false positive identification rate (FPIR) for white subjects (0.04%) is lower than that for Asian subjects (4.0%) and black subjects (5.5%)”.The testing went on to find that the number of false positives for black women was particularly high. “The FPIR for black male subjects (0.4%) is lower than that for black female subjects (9.9%),” the report said.The Association of Police and Crime Commissioners said in a statement that the findings showed an inbuilt bias. It said: “This has meant that in some circumstances it is more likely to incorrectly match black and Asian people than their white counterparts. The language is technical but behind the detail it seems clear that technology has been deployed into operational policing without adequate safeguards in place.”The statement, signed off by the APCC leads Darryl Preston, Alison Lowe, John Tizard and Chris Nelson, questioned why the findings had not been released at an earlier opportunity or shared with black and Asian communities.It said: “Although there is no evidence of adverse impact in any individual case, that is more by luck than design. System failures have been known for some time, yet these were not shared with those communities affected, nor with leading sector stakeholders.”The government announced a 10-week public consultation that it hopes will pave the way for the technology to be used more often. The public will be asked whether police should be able to go beyond their records to access other databases, including passport and driving licence images, to track down criminals.Civil servants are working with police to establish a new national facial recognition system that will hold millions of images.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With thousands of searches a month using this discriminatory algorithm, there are now serious questions to be answered over just how many people of colour were falsely identified, and what consequences this had.“This report is yet more evidence that this powerful and opaque technology cannot be used without robust safeguards in place to protect us all, including real transparency and meaningful oversight. The government must halt the rapid rollout of facial recognition technology until these are in place to protect each of us and prioritise our rights – something we know the public wants.”The former cabinet minister David Davis raised concerns after police leaders said the cameras could be placed at shopping centres, stadiums and transport hubs to hunt for wanted criminals. Hetold the Daily Mail: “Welcome to big brother Britain. It is clear the government intends to roll out this dystopian technology across the country. Something of this magnitude should not happen without full and detailed debate in the House of Commons.”Officials say the technology is needed to help catch serious offenders. They say there are manual safeguards, written into police training, operational practice and guidance, that require all potential matches returned from the police national database to be visually assessed by a trained user and investigating officer.A Home Office spokesperson said: “The Home Office takes the findings of the report seriously and we have already taken action. A new algorithm has been independently tested and procured, which has no statistically significant bias. It will be tested early next year and will be subject to evaluation.“Given the importance of this issue, we have also asked the police inspectorate, alongside the forensic science regulator, to review law enforcement’s use of facial recognition. They will assess the effectiveness of the mitigations, which the National Police Chiefs’ Council supports.”Explore more on these topicsFacial recognitionPoliceHome OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

Earlier,it said a separate issue had been reportedwith its application programming interfaces.The issue, which affected 28% of its traffic, lasted for half an hour and was resolved shortly after 9am GMT, it said. This follows a far larger Cloudflare outage in mid-November that hit sites such as X, OpenAI and Spotify as well as multiplayer games such as League of Legends.That was caused by “a configuration file that is automatically generated to manage threat traffic” growing beyond its expected size and triggering a crash in the software system that handles traffic for a number of Cloudflare services.“We have spoken directly with hundreds of customers following that incident and shared our plans to make changes to prevent single updates from causing widespread impact like this,” Cloudflare said in its post.Friday’s error appeared far more minor, affecting sites including Canva, Shopify, the Indian-based stockbroker Groww, as well asLinkedIn, Zoom and Downdetector, a site used to monitor online service issues. The Downdetector website recorded more than 4,500 reports related to Cloudflare after returning online.Given the high-profile series of internet outages in the past months, it could cause some companies to reflect on how they use Cloudflare’s services.Steven Murdoch, a professor of computer science at University College London, said: “I think people will start asking questions now that there have been these two outages in a short period of time. They’re not very happy, and Cloudflare isn’t very happy either – they’re apologetic. But it’s too early to say whether there’s a systemic problem, such as bad software practices, or it’s just bad luck.”He said Cloudflare, aglobal cloud services and cybersecurity firm, marketed itself on the basis of its reliability. Companies use it because it offers a level of immunity to certain kinds of cyber-attacks and can improve the performance of websites, making them faster and more resilient to server crashes.Its recent outages in the past months, as well as anAmazon Web Services outage in Octoberthat affected more than 2,000 companies, have fuelled conversation among experts about whether key internet services are too centralised and thus vulnerable.“There’s a huge amount of centralisation,” Murdoch said. “Cloudflare do have a good product, that’s why so many people use them, but it leads to vulnerabilities.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is the fourth major global outage, large enough to be noticed by non-technical media and affect regular people around the world, since 20 October.”Cloudflare claims that about 20% of all websites use some form of its services. It has nearly 300,000 customers operating in 125 countries, and claims to block billions of cyber-attacks for these users daily.

And because they handle so much traffic, when they do fail, this immediately becomes a massive problem,” he said.Murdoch, however, said there could be an upside to this outage for Cloudflare. “When AWS went down, their share price went up, because people realised how many people are using them. In some ways [the outage] is great marketing, because you see how many people are using Cloudflare.”Explore more on these topicsInternetLinkedInZoomnewsShareReuse this content"

Why didn’t governments step in and stop them?Anna MooreFri 5 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 5 Dec 2025 03.23 ESTShareFor Patrizia Schlosser, it started with an apologetic call from a colleague. “I’m sorry but I found this. Are you aware of it?” He sent over a link, which took her to a site called Mr DeepFakes. There, she found fake images of herself, naked, squatting, chained, performing sex acts with various animals. They were tagged “Patrizia Schlosser sluty FUNK whore” (sic).“They were very graphic, very humiliating,” says Schlosser, a German journalist for Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) andFunk. “They were also very badly done, which made it easier to distance myself, and tell myself they were obviously fake. But it was very disturbing to imagine somebody somewhere spending hours on the internet searching for pictures of me, putting all this together.”The site was new to Schlosser, despite her previous high-profile investigations into the porn industry. “I’d never heard of Mr DeepFakes – a porn site entirely dedicated to fake porn videos and photos. I was surprised by how big it was – so many videos of every celebrity you know.” Schlosser’s first reaction on seeing herself among them was to brush it aside. “I tried to push it to the back of my mind, which was really a strategy of not dealing with it,” she says. “But it’s strange how the brain works. You know it’s fake but still you see it. It’s not you but also it is you. There you are with a dog and a chain. You feel violated but confused. At some point, I decided: ‘No. I’m angry. I don’t want those images out there.’”Schlosser’s subsequent documentary for NDR’s STRG_F programme did succeed in getting the images removed. She also tracked down the young man who had created and posted them – even visiting his home and speaking to his mother. (The perpetrator himself wouldn’t come out of his bedroom.) However, Schlosser was unable to identify “Mr DeepFakes” – or whoever was behind the site, despite enlisting the help of Bellingcat, the online investigative journalism collective. Bellingcat’s Ross Higgins was on the team. “My background is investigating money laundering,” he says. “I looked at the structure of the website and it was using the same internet service providers (ISPs) as proper serious organised criminals.” The ISPs suggested links to the Russian mercenary group Wagner, and individuals named in thePanama Papers. The ads it carried included ones for apps owned by Chinese technology companies, which allowed China’s government access to all customer data. “I made the presumption that this was all much too sophisticated to be a site of hobbyists,” says Higgins.It turned out that’s exactly what it was.Anyone wanting deepfakes created of someone they knew could find someone willing to make them to orderThe story of Mr DeepFakes, the world’s largest, most notorious nonconsensual deepfake porn site, is really the story of AI porn itself – the very term “deepfake” is believed to have come from its originator. A “ground zero” for AI-generated pornography, its pages – which have been viewed more than 2bn times – have depicted countless female celebrities, politicians, European princesses, wives and daughters of US presidents, being kidnapped, tortured, shaved, bound, mutilated, raped and strangled. Yet all this content (which would take more than 200 days to watch) was just the site’s “shop window”. Its true heart, it’s “engine room”, was its forum. Here, anyone wanting deepfakes created of someone they knew (a girlfriend, sister, classmate or colleague) could find someone willing to make them to order for the right price. It was also a “training ground”, a technical hub where “hobbyists” taught one another, shared tips, posted academic papers and “problem-solved”. (One recurring problem was how to deepfake without a good “dataset”. This means when you’re trying to deepfake someone you don’t have many pictures of – so not a celebrity, but maybe someone you know whose social media you’ve screengrabbed.)The film-maker and activist Sophie Compton spent many hours monitoring Mr DeepFakes while researching the award-winning 2023 documentary Another Body (available on iPlayer). “Looking back, I think that site played such an instrumental role in the proliferation of deepfakes overall,” she says. “I really think that there’s a world in which the site didn’t get made, wasn’t allowed to be made or was shut down quickly, and deepfake porn is just a fraction of the issue that we have today. Without that site, I don’t think it would have exploded in the way it did.”In fact, that scenario was entirely possible. The origins of MrDeepfakes stretch back to 2017-18 when AI porn was just beginning to build on social media sites such as Reddit. One anonymous Redditor and AI porn “pioneer” who went by the name of “deepfakes” (and is thus credited with coining the term) gave anearly interviewto Vice about its potential. Shortly after, though, in early 2018,Reddit banned deepfake pornfrom its site. “We have screenshots from their message boards at that time and the deepfake community, which was small, was freaking out and jumping ship,” says Compton. This is when Mr DeepFakes was created, with the early domain name dpfks.com. The administrator carried the same username – dpfks – and was the person who advertised for volunteers to work as moderators, and posted rules and guidelines, as well as deepfake videos and an in-depth guide to using software for deepfake porn.“What’s so depressing about reading the messages and seeing the genesis is realising how easily governments could have stopped this in its tracks,” says Compton. “The people doing it didn’t believe they were going to be allowed free rein. They were saying: ‘They’re coming for us!’, ‘They’re never going to let us do this!’ But as they continued without any problems at all, you see this growing emboldenment. Covid added to the explosion as everyone stopped moderating content. The output was violent – it was about degrading someone completely. The celebrities that were really popular were often really young – Emma Watson, Billie Eilish, Millie Bobby Brown.” (Greta Thunberg is another example here.)Who was behind it? From time to time, Mr DeepFakes gave anonymous interviews. In a 2022 BBC documentary,DeepfakePorn: Could You Be Next?, the site’s “owner” and “web developer”, going by the pseudonym “deepfakes”, made the argument that consent from the women wasn’t required as “it’s a fantasy, it’s not real”.Was money their motivation? Mr DeepFakes ran ads and had a premium membership paid in cryptocurrency – in 2020, one forum mentions that it made between $4,000 and$7,000 a month. “There was a commercial aspect,” says Higgins. “It was a side hustle, but it was more than that. It gave this notoriety.”At one point, the site “posted 6,000 pictures of AOC’s [the US politician Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s]face in order that people could make deepfake pornography of her,” says Higgins. “It’s insane. [There were] all these files of YouTubers and politicians. What it’s saying is that if you’re a woman in this world you can only achieve so much because if you put your head above the parapet, if you have the temerity to do anything publicly, you can expect your image to be used in the most degrading way possible for personal profit.“The most affecting thing for me was the language used about women on that site,” he continues. “We had to change it for our online report because we didn’t want it to be triggering, but this is pure misogyny. Pure hatred.”This April, investigators began to believe that they had found Mr DeepFakes and sent emails to their suspect.‘I don’t take no for an answer’: how a small group of women changed the law on deepfake pornRead moreOn 4 May, Mr DeepFakes shut down. A notice on its homepage blamed “data loss” caused by the withdrawal of a “critical service provider”. “We will not be relaunching,” it continued. “Any website claiming this is fake. This domain will eventually expire and we are not responsible for future use. This message will be removed in about a week.”Mr DeepFakes is finished – but according to Compton, this could have happened so much sooner. “All the signs were there,” she says. The previous year, in April 2024, when the UK governmentannounced plans tocriminalise the creation and sharing of deepfake sexual abuse material, Mr DeepFakes responded by immediately blocking access to UK users. (The plans were later shelved when the 2024 election was called.) “It showed that ‘Mr DeepFakes’ was obviously not so committed that there was nothing governments could do,” says Compton. “If it was going to become too much of a pain and a risk to run the site, then they weren’t going to bother.”But deepfake porn has become so popular, so mainstream, that it no longer requires a “base camp”. “The things that those guys prided themselves on learning how to do and teaching others are now so embedded, they’re accessible to anyone on apps at the click of the button,” says Compton.And for those wanting something more complex, the creators, the self-styled experts who once lurked on its forum, are now out there touting for business. Patrizia Schlosser knows this for sure. “As part of my research, I went undercover and reached out to some of the people on the forums, asking for a deepfake of an ex-girlfriend,” says Schlosser. “Although it’s often claimed the site was only about celebrities, that wasn’t true. The response was, ‘Yeah, sure …’“After Mr DeepFakes shut down, I got an automatic email from one of them which said: “If you want anything made, let me know … Mr DeepFakes is down – but of course, we keep working.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

So why do I have a Spotify ‘listening age’ of 86?Many users of the app were shocked, this week, by this addition to the Spotify Wrapped roundup – especially twentysomethings who were judged to be 100Donna FergusonFri 5 Dec 2025 10.07 ESTLast modified on Fri 5 Dec 2025 10.08 ESTShare“Age is just a number. So don’t take this personally.” Those words were the first inkling I had that I was about to receive some very bad news.I woke up on Wednesday with a mild hangover after celebrating my 44th birthday. Unfortunately for me, this was the daySpotifyreleased “Spotify Wrapped”, its analysis of (in my case) the 4,863 minutes I had spent listening to music on its platform over the past year. And this year, for the first time, they are calculating the “listening age” of all their users.“Taste like yours can’t be defined,” Spotify’s report informed me, “but let’s try anyway … Your listening age is 86.” The numbers were emblazoned on the screen in big pink letters.It took a long time for my 13-year-old daughter (listening age: 19) and my 46-year-old husband (listening age: 38) to stop laughing at me. Where did I go wrong, I wondered, feeling far older than 44.But it seems I’m not alone. “Raise your hand if you felt personally victimised by your Spotify Wrapped listening age,”wrote one useron X. Anotherpost, with a brutal clip of Judi Dench shouting “you’re not young” at Cate Blanchett, was liked more than 26,000 times. The 22-year-old actor Louis Partridge best mirrored my reaction when he shared his listening age of 100 on Instagram stories with the caption: “uhhh”.“Rage bait” – defined as “online content deliberately designed to elicit anger or outrage” in order to increase web traffic – is the Oxford English Dictionary’s word of the year. And to me, that cheeky little message from Spotify, warning me not to take my personalised assessment of my personal listening habits personally, seemed a prime example.“How could I have a listening age of 86?” I raged to my family and friends, when the artist I listened to the most this year was 26-year-old Sabrina Carpenter? Since I took my daughter to Carpenter’s concert at Hyde Park this summer, I have spent 722 minutes listening to her songs, making me “a top 3% global fan”.The only explanation Spotify gave for my listening age of 86 was that I was “into music of the late 50s” this year. But my top 10 most-listened to songs were all released in the past five years and my top five artists included Olivia Dean and Chappell Roan (who released their debut albums in 2023).Admittedly, Ella Fitzgerald is in there too. But her music is timeless, I raged; surely everyone listens to Ella Fitzgerald? “I don’t,” my daughter said, helpfully. “I don’t,” added my husband.It’s also true that I occasionally listen to folk music from the 50s and 60s – legends such as Pete Seeger, Bob Dylan and Joan Baez. But when I analysed my top 50 “most listened to” songs, almost all of them (80%) were released in the last five years.What’s particularly enraging is that Spotify knows my taste is best described as “eclectic” – because that’s how Spotify has described it to me. I have apparently listened to 409 artists in 210 music genres over the past year.None of it makes sense, until you see the extent to which inciting rage in users like me is paying off for Spotify: in the first 24 hours, this year’s Wrapped campaign had500 millionshares on social media, a 41% increase on last year.According to Spotify, listening ages are based on the idea of a “reminiscence bump”, which they describe as “the tendency to feel most connected to the music from your younger years”. To figure this out, they looked at the release dates of all the songs I played this year, identified the five-year span of music that I engaged with more than other listeners my age and “playfully” hypothesised that I am the same age as someone who engaged with that music in their formative years.In other words, no matter how old you are, the more unusual and idiosyncratic and out of step your musical taste is compared with your peers, the more likely it is that Spotify will poke fun at some of the music you enjoy listening to.But now that I understand this, rather than rising to the bait, I know exactly what to do. I walk over to my dusty, ancient CD player. I insert an old CD I bought when I was a teenager. I turn the volume up to max. And then I play one of my favourite songs, a classic song that everyone who has a listening age of 86 or over will know, like I do, off by heart: You Make Me Feel So Young by Ella Fitzgerald.Explore more on these topicsSpotifyDigital music and audiofeaturesShareReuse this content"

In a response postMusk wrote: “Much appreciated.”Before Musk took over Twitter, blue ticks were only awarded to verifiable account holders, including politicians, celebrities, public bodies and verified journalists in mainstream media and established new media, such as bloggers and YouTubers. After the takeover, users who subscribed to X Premium were theneligible for blue tick status.Henna Virkkunen, who is the executive vice-president at the European Commission responsible for tech regulation, said: “With the DSA’s first non-compliance decision, we are holding X responsible for undermining users’ rights and evading accountability.“Deceiving users with blue checkmarks, obscuring information on ads and shutting out researchers have no place online in the EU.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last week the US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, said the EU must consider its tech regulations in order to get 50% tariffs on steel reduced.His threats were branded “blackmail” by Teresa Ribera, the EU commissioner in charge of Europe’s green transition and antitrust enforcement.Senior EU officials said the ruling was independent of any pleadings by the US delegation in Brussels last week to meet trade ministers. They said the EU retained its “sovereign right” to regulate US tech companies, with 25 businesses including non-US companies such as TikTok coming under the DSA.Musk – who ison a path to become the world’s first trillionaire– has 90 days to come up with an “action plan” to respond to the fine but ultimately he is also free to appeal against any EU ruling, as others, such as Apple, have done in the past, taking their case to the European court of justice.At the same time, the EU has announced it has secured commitments from TikTok to provide advertising repositories to address the commission concerns raised in May about transparency.The DSA requires platforms to maintain an accessible and searchable repository of the ads running on their services to allow researchers and representatives of civil society “to detect scams, advertisements for illegal or age-inappropriate”.Senior officials said the phenomenon of fake political adverts or ads with fake celebrities cannot be studied unless the social media companies stick to the rules.X has been approached for comment. The EU said the company had been informed of the decision.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskXEuropean CommissionEuropean UnionSocial mediaDigital mediaDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

The move follows thelaunch of a lower-priced Model Y SUV, Tesla’s bestselling model, in Europe and the US.The cheaper Model 3 and Model Y cars drop some premium finishes and features of the more expensive versions, but still offer driving ranges above 300 miles (480km).Tesla sales haveslumped across Europeas the company faces increasingly tough competition from its Chinese rival BYD, which outsold the US electric vehicle maker across the region for the first time in spring.Sales across the EU have also been hurt by a buyer backlash against Musk’s support for Trump’s election campaign and period working in the president’s administration.In his role running the “department of government efficiency”, or Doge, the tech billionaireled sweeping job cuts, butquit in Mayand after falling out with Trump over the “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill.Musk has also alienated customers through other controversial political interventions, includingappearing to give a Nazi saluteat Trump’s victory rally,showing support for Germany’s far-right AfD party, and accusing Keir Starmer and other senior UK politicians ofcovering up the scandal about grooming gangs.New taxes on electric cars in last month’s budget could undermine UK demand, critics have said. UK electric car sales grew at their slowest rate in two years in November, at just 3.6%, according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).“[This] should be seen as a wake-up call that a sustained increase in demand for EVs cannot be taken for granted,” said Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the SMMT. “We should be taking every opportunity to encourage drivers to make the switch, not punishing them for doing so.”The chancellor’s new pay-per-mile road tax on EVs will charge drivers 3p for every mile from April 2028, costing motorists about £250 a year on average.Explore more on these topicsTeslaElon MuskUS politicsTrump administrationEuropeElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsnewsShareReuse this content"

In recent weeks a few of his colleagues have began to emulate him, including the Leeds East MP Richard Burgon.No 10 turns to influencers to reach audiences beyond mainstream mediaRead more“I feel like I should apologise for having started this!” McKee joked – before arguing that digital comms and campaigning was now essential for politicians.He said he aimed to produce a couple of such videos a week and was focused onInstagram, TikTok and YouTube Shorts, which unlike X reach audiences beyond the politically hyper-engaged.“I spoke at a high school in my constituency last week and I asked how many people read a newspaper every day – one put their hand up. When I asked how many are on Instagram, they all did,” he said.“The way people consume information has changed enormously in the last 10 years but the way politicians and MPs communicate with their constituents hasn’t as much.”There are signs that the Labour party machine is cranking into gear. Keir Starmer emailed Labour MPs on 21 November announcing a “significant investment” from the party in “new comprehensive training programme” in digital campaigning.Internally, the party has unveiled what it calls “Operation Second Term” to modernise its campaign operation – using social media and an app called Labour One – on the basis that “the way we campaigned in 2024 won’t be how we win again in 2029”.MPs are also increasingly taking the initiative. Burgon used 200 packets of Sainsbury’s fusillito demonstratejust how much £1bn is compared with the average UK salary of £33,000. His video has garnered nearly 650,000 views on X.“I was going around the church fairs in the constituency this weekend – it was amazing how many people had seen the video,” Burgon said. “I’ve been campaigning for a wealth tax for a while and it seemed a fun way of communicating that.”The 106kg mountain of pasta, which Burgon’s parliamentary researcher bought the weekend before last, could not feasibly be transported to Leeds and so has been donated to food banks in London.Jeevun Sandher, the MP for Loughborough and an economist,made a James Bond-themed video during budget weekexplaining the various factors that affect government bond rates. “I’d love it if people read my 2,000-word essays but they don’t. You have to find a way of being engaging,” he said.He relies on his existing team of parliamentary staffers – armed with a smartphone and ring-light mounted on to a tripod in the corner of his office – to produce online content.Social mediaplanning is part of his office’s regular weekly catchup meeting.Asked whether the government should be doing more to encourage MPs to modernise their communication, Sandher thinks that would risk becoming too regimented.“It works quite well when it’s more organic and people understand what the government’s message is and take it on in different ways,” he said. “When you have a unified vision, everyone should be able to read off that script.”Several junior ministers are also experimenting with social media, including the Treasury exchequer secretary, Dan Tomlinson, who filmed a chatty pre-budget clip on his way to Gregg’s for a doughnut atWestminster tube station, and the AI minister Kanishka Narayan whoshot a video on his iPhoneabout the technology’s growth in the UK.Some of the cabinet are also getting involved – Steve Reed, the housing secretary, did an “ask me anything” session on Reddit about a policy to reopen local pubs in September, and Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, who is a longtime vertical video enthusiast,used ASMR to promote a government announcementon small modular reactors (SMR).“During the general election we had a big old team to support people doing this stuff and now they’re having to do that within their own offices,” said a Labour source. “It’s harder when you’re not attacking and instead having to defend and make a positive story about something, which is why you’ve got to be even more creative. It’s a difficult skill to learn but it’s an absolutely essential one.”McKee argued that the challenge was especially acute for the left because rightwingers such as Farage and Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, are skilful at communicating very clear and simple stories on and off social media.“The task from progressives is to articulate a complex argument that is realistic and ambitious but also real and deliverable – and to do that in an interesting, engaging way,” he said.Explore more on these topicsLabourSocial mediaTikTokInstagramEconomic policyMetaDigital medianewsShareReuse this content"

Now it’s out, all the drama surrounding it seems superfluousAlyssa MercanteFri 5 Dec 2025 10.04 ESTLast modified on Fri 5 Dec 2025 10.08 ESTShareOn 25 November, award-winning Italian developer Santa Ragione, responsible for acclaimed titles such as MirrorMoon EP and Saturnalia,revealed that its latest project, Horses, had been banned from Steam - the largest digital store for PC games. A week later, another popular storefront, Epic Games Store, also pulled Horses, right before its 2 December launch date. The game was also briefly removed from the Humble Store, but was reinstated a day later.The controversy has helped the game rocket to the top of the digital stores thatareselling it, namely itch.io and GOG. But the question remains – why was it banned? Horses certainly delves into some intensely controversial topics (a content warning at the start details, “physical violence, psychological abuse, gory imagery, depiction of slavery, physical and psychological torture, domestic abuse, sexual assault, suicide, and misogyny”) and is upsetting and unnerving.View image in fullscreenControversial … Horses.Photograph: Santa RagioneThe plot is fairly simple, though it turns dark fast. You play as Anselmo, a 20-year-old Italian man sent to spend the summer working on a farm to build character. It’s revealed almost immediately (so fast in fact, that I let out a surprised “Ha!”) that the farm Anselmo has been sent to is not a normal one. The “horses” held there are not actually horses, but nude humans wearing horse heads that appear to be permanently affixed.Your job is to tend to the garden, the “horses” and the “dog” (who is a human wearing a dog head). Anselmo performs menial, frustratingly slow everyday tasks across Horses’ three-ish hour runtime, like chopping wood and picking vegetables. These monotonous tasks are, however, interspersed with horrible and unsettling jobs. On day one, you find a “horse” body hanging from a tree and have to help the farmer bury it.It’s disturbing, yes, but Horses doesn’t show most of these horrors playing out, and when it does, the simplistic, crude graphics dull its edges (when you encounter the farmer whipping a human “horse” and have to throw hydrogen peroxide on her back, the marks crisscrossing her skin are blurry and unreal).View image in fullscreenUnsettling … Horses.Photograph: Santa RagioneThe “horses’” genitals and breasts are blurred out. The enslaved are forbidden from fornicating, but you’ll find that they do that anyway (a simplistic, animalistic depiction of sex), and though you’re forced to “tame” them by putting them back in their pen, it’s just a button press to interact, with no indication of what you’ve actually done to them.Valve, the company that owns Steam,told PC Gamerthat Horses’ content was reviewed back in 2023. “After our team played through the build and reviewed the content, we gave the developer feedback about why we couldn’t ship the game on Steam, consistent with our onboarding rules and guidelines,” the statement read. “A short while later the developer asked us to reconsider the review, and our internal content review team discussed that extensively and communicated to the developer our final decision that we were not going to ship the game on Steam.”According toIGN, Epic Games Store told developer Santa Ragione: “We are unable to distribute Horses on the Epic Games Store because our review found violations of the Epic Games Store Content Guidelines, specifically the ‘Inappropriate Content’ and ‘Hateful or Abusive Content’ policies.” Santa Ragione alleges that “no specifics on what content was at issue were provided.”Horses’ gameplay is grotesque, not gratuitous. The horror is psychological and lies in the incongruity of performing menial tasks in a veritable hellscape, while having no idea why any of this is going on. There is barely any sound aside from the constant whirring of a film camera (the game is presented like a mostly silent Italian arthouse film), super-up-close shots of mouths moving as they talk or chew, unsettling character models, the occasional cut to a real-life shot of water pouring in a glass or slop filling up a dog bowl.There is no explicit gore or violence. You are uncomfortable, frustrated and unnerved throughout, and the horrors of humanity are on full display, but nothing ever threatens to upend your lunch. It is an interesting meditation on violence and power dynamics, but it is by no means a shocking or radical game. The conversation that has ignited around it – about video games as art and the censorship of art – is proving to be more profound than the actual content of the game.Explore more on these topicsGamesIndie gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Though even that may be too generous a description.On Thursday, word came that the US military had launched yet another deadly strike on a small boat moving through international waters. This timethe attack killed four people, bringing to at least 87 the number of people the US has killed in a series of 22 such strikes on what it says are drug boats – vessels carrying illicit narcotics in the Caribbean or eastern Pacific.This has been happening for months, but the issue has only just drawn political heat thanks toa Washington Post investigationof the first such attack on 2 September.The paper reportedthat US forces hit the targeted boat once, then hit it again – the second strike killing two survivors clinging to the wreckage. According to the Post, the defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, had issued a verbal command to “kill them all”.Now that incident is under congressional scrutiny, with even some Republicans uneasy about what appears to be a clearcut case of a war crime. The defence department’s own Law of War manual forbids precisely this kind of action, spelling it out in black and white onpage 448: “Members of the armed forced and other persons … who are wounded, sick or shipwrecked, shall be respected and protected in all circumstances.” Not that you should need a manual to tell you that. The law of the sea demands that you rescue those at risk of drowning; basic human decency demands that you don’t fire on them.Trump loyalists have denied that Hegseth gave an explicit order that everyone on board be killed and have tried to argue that the two men in the water were legitimate targets because they had proved themselves to be still “in the fight”, perhaps by calling in help from fellow “narco terrorists” nearby. Democrats who have seen the same classified footage of the incident say that, on the contrary, the video shows the killing of men in distress, their vessel destroyed and posing no threat.That would constitute a war crime, but for one thing: there is no war. The Trump administration says that the boats in its sights are ferrying drugs – fentanyl and the like, which kill Americans – from Venezuela to the US and that the traffickers are part of a “designated terrorist organisation”. In effect, it argues that the “war on drugs” is an actual war, in which theUS militaryhas the right to act as it would against any other armed enemy.But the laws of war don’t work like that. As Sarah Yager of Human Rights Watchexplained to the Guardian, a US president “can’t just make up a conflict”. Of course, Donald Trump would dismiss the demand that for a war to be legal it has first to be declared by a congressional vote, but harder to brush off is the fact that the supposed enemy in this case poses nothing that could reasonably be described as a military threat. These are small boats that may or not be carrying drugs, with no serious means of defending themselves. The right way to deal with the danger they represent is the way they were dealt with under previous administrations – as a policing operation involving interception and arrest.All the president’s millions: how the Trumps are turning the presidency into richesRead moreIn other words, the problem here is not just the “double tap” incident that killed those two shipwreck survivors. It is the entire, months-long operation which has killed 87. In Yager’s words: “Nobody on those boats can be killed legally by the United States military.” Viewed like this, we are not contemplating a war crime on 2 September so much as a string of crimes: extrajudicial killings that, simply put, look like murder.There could hardly be a graver charge, yet how has Hegseth himself responded? By posting a mocked-up cover of a children’s book, depicting the much-loved character Franklin the Turtle apparently aiming a rocket launcher at a group of boats, under the imagined title,Franklin Targets Narco Terrorists. AsLogan Roymight put it, this is not a serious person.There is no need to pretend that Hegseth’s actions amount to the sullying of a previously clean reputation; no one is under any illusions as to the long and appalling record of the US in Latin America. Even so, the Trump administration is somehow managing to plumb new depths – and not only in that part of the world.Europeans have long been alarmed at Trump’s lopsided approach to the Ukraine war, evinced most recently by his unveiling of a supposed peace plan that the White House was compelled to deny had originated in Russia, so closely did it resemblea Kremlin wishlist. Thesixth and latest visit to Moscowof Trump’s golfing buddy and personal envoy, Steve Witkoff, this week, and his chumminess with Vladimir Putin, did little to dispel that impression.For a while, this closeness to Russia intrigued observers. Could the explanation really be that Putin helddamaging kompromat on the US president? It seems the answer centres on a lust that is almost as basic: not sex, but money.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

According toa major probe by the Wall Street Journal, what Witkoff andKirill Dmitriev, Putin’s handpicked envoy, have been negotiating in closed-door meetings in Miami and elsewhere is a grand bargain that would “bring Russia’s $2tn economy in from the cold”, while giving the US a slice of the action, whether access to $300bn or so of Russian central bank assetsfrozen in Europeor joint US-Russian ventures to exploit the enormous mineral wealth of the Arctic. Russia would end its isolation, Americans would get even richer and – an added bonus for Moscow – those pesky Europeans would be cut out. In the words of the Polish prime minister Donald Tusk: “We know this is not about peace. It’s about business.”And to be clear, that business motive is not solely about enlarging the coffers of the US Treasury to benefit the hard-pressed US taxpayer. Note how Jared Kushner, who joined Witkoff in Moscow this week, saw his investment fund, Affinity Partners, enjoybillion-dollar cash infusionsfrom the very Gulf monarchies with whom he negotiated as a White House official during his father-in-law’s first term. In Trump world, the boundary between public and private does not exist: what profits the US profits Trump and his circle.A favourite example, if only for its vivid clarity, wasthe meeting this summeron board a superyacht moored off the coast of Sardinia. Present was Witkoff and a member of the ruling family of the United Arab Emirates in charge of $1.5tn of the UAE’s sovereign wealth. The two men had much to celebrate. In May, it had been announced that one of the sheikh’s investment firms would deposit $2bn into World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency outfit founded by the Witkoff and Trump families. Two weeks later, the White House granted the UAE access to specialist AI computer chips that had previously been off-limits, thanks to national security fears that the chips might find their way to China. What a happy coincidence it was that those two unrelated events followed each other so swiftly, and how convivial that encounter in Sardinia must have been.The word corruption can be used in two ways. In its legal sense, it can refer to dishonest conduct by those in power, typically involving bribery. But it can also have a deeper meaning, referring to the corrosion of standards, the decline of norms and the removal of moral restraints. If and whenDonald Trumpand those who serve him, and themselves, are eventually called to account, they will be confronted by that single word, in all its shades – and all its force.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistGuardian newsroom: Year One of Trumpism: Is Britain Emulating the US?On Wednesday 21 January 2026, join Jonathan Freedland, Tania Branigan and Nick Lowles as they reflect on the first year of Donald Trump’s second presidency – and to ask if Britain could be set on the same path.Book ticketshereor atguardian.liveExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionPete HegsethUS militaryDonald TrumpRussiaUkraineUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Ridicule ensuesEmma BrockesDefenders rally to Olivia Nuzzi amid book mockery, while rakish David Dimbleby channels his inner DickensFri 5 Dec 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 5 Dec 2025 11.52 ESTShareMondayIt’s publication week for American Canto, the hastily turned around memoir by the former New York magazine journalist Olivia Nuzzi, who took on the challenge of explaining what it was about Robert F Kennedy Jr she found so alluring, a task for which no upper word limit is adequate. Nuzzi, if you’ve fallen behind, developed romantic feelings for the then presidential candidate, now Trump health minister, while profiling him for the magazine and since I’ve had to read this sentence, you do too: “He was exhausted, and he threw himself onto the bed, his pink shirt unbuttoned, revealing my favorite parts of his chest.” If you have a favourite part of RFK Jr’s chest, or consider chests in general subject to preference by localised area, this may be the book for you.As mockery in the press rose to a shriek on Monday, so Nuzzi’s defenders started to rally. Monica Lewinsky, who along with Amanda Knox has become the most ubiquitous figure of our age, reached out to Nuzzi to offer sympathy. Lisa Taddeo, author of Three Women, praised Nuzzi for writing what she called on Instagram a “scintillating love story” and posted a sentence seemingly caught in the undertow effect of reading Nuzzi at length. (From Taddeo: “All across the internet little boys and girls are wielding poison darts they didn’t even check the constitution of before lobbing in the direction of somebody who has achieved enough intrigue and intelligence in their life and … ”)Nuzzi, who was a good writer at New York magazine before all this happened, appears to have fallen prey to the combination of a tight deadline, the destabilising effect the words “book contract” can have on even sensible writers, and the need to dignify an otherwise embarrassing story with paragraph-long sentences feverishly hoping for flight. It’s easily done. While CNNunkindlysent a reporter to several Manhattan bookstores to see if the title was selling (not really), the rest of us joined Nuzzi in trying to use the story to say something trenchant about the world at large, a noble – if ultimately doomed – reflex.TuesdayQuick, someone tell Nuzzi to reach out to the Emirates airline festival of literature, which is a woman down this week after the novelist R F Kuangpulled outof the lineup. The festival, which takes place annually in the United Arab Emirates, is organised under the state patronage of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, vice-president and prime minister of the UAE and ruler of Dubai, and attracts many laudable and liberal-identifying writers from the west – including, over the years, Bonnie Garmus, Jacqueline Wilson and Ian Rankin.Kuang, who is promoting her most recent novel Katabasis, pulled out of the festival in answer to a call from the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, the Palestinian-led campaign more commonly associated with calls to boycott Israel, which has urged a boycott on the UAE for allegedly supplying weapons to the paramilitary group behind ongoing violence in Sudan. As Kuang said in her statement, she has “always respected organised calls for cultural boycotts against genocide from communities directly affected and in particular, guidelines set forth by the BDS movement”.Very laudable. But, as with the fierce defenders of free speech whoappearedrecently at the Riyadh comedy festival, one has to wonder at the decision to say yes in the first place. In the UAE, homosexuality is illegal, women live under male guardianship, and for anyone who remembers theNew Yorker’s 2023 investigation into the disappearance of the fugitive princesses of Dubai, the overwhelming impression is not that they are alive and well and enjoying life in a system that welcomes the free exchange of ideas.WednesdayHere’s David Dimbleby, look, not a day over 87 and appearing rather rakish and fierce in his dotage. The first episode of What’s the Monarchy For?, his new series about the royals, dropped on the BBC this week and it’s a great watch, mainly for the magnetism of Dimbleby’s no-monkeys-left-to-give presenting style and, in this his super-age, a sly new aspect that gives him the outline of a character from Dickens.We see him tease a surprised David Cameron by impersonating Queen Elizabeth II and asking him if he really thinks calling a referendum was a good idea; suggest that King Charles’s handwriting is so bad that when he signs his name it looks like “Mary”; and grin devilishly when Ash Sarkar accuses him of representing the class system as much as the royals. Ostensibly the programme offers a sceptical look at the value of monarchy, but – until we get to the episode about Andrew, at least – I think we all know where we are with this. The story Dimbleby tells of the late queen nipping behind a shrub in the gardens of Buckingham Palace to avoid having to speak to Nicolae Ceaușescu leaves one with as warm a glow for “the firm” as one ever has.ThursdayI was in an earthquake last year – the New Jersey quake of 24 that caused the glass in my kitchen cabinets briefly to shake in their sockets – and have vivid memories of how enjoyable the aftermath: joining the neighbours in the hallway to squeal; hearing my children’s tales of being grouped on the rug in their classroom by Ms Wu while one enterprising child dived under her desk; and of course being condescended to endlessly by people from California.To survivors ofThursday’s 3.3-magnitude quake in Lancashire and the southern Lake District, therefore, I wish the same pleasures.Footage shared from the CCTV of a car park in Lancashirecaptured the drama of a split second camera-shake followed by an upstairs light going on in the window of a house, a sequence – “Earthquake, 2025” – that could admirably play on a loop in Tate Modern.FridayBeing prime minister looks like a mostly terrible gig at the moment and so I’m happy for Keir Starmer, caught beaming this week after being seated beside 90s supermodel Claudia Schiffer at the German state banquet hosted at Windsor Castle. Other guests, who dined on a heavy sounding menu of hot smoked trout with langoustines, quail eggs and a take on black forest gateau, included the German footballer Thomas Hitzlsperger and the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier – suggesting that, for once in his ill-starred premiership, Sir Keir emphatically drew the long straw.Digested week in picturesView image in fullscreenVladimir Putin, left, and Narendra Modi as the Russian president struggles to unlearn the KGB’s ‘no hugging’ rule.Photograph: Grigory Sysoyev/AFP/Getty ImagesView image in fullscreen‘Judean People’s Front?!

While her brave act brought national attention to the civil rights movement and triggered student sit-ins to end segregation across the south, it also subjected her and her husband, Raymond, to constant death threats. Consequently, like many other Black families fleeing Jim Crow south’s racial violence, in August 1957, Rosa and Raymond moved up north toDetroit.When the Parks arrived in Detroit, they and other Black people did not have to sit at the back of the bus. Nonetheless, the city was permeated by a quieter but no less pernicious type of racism: racist policies, which are any written or unwritten laws and processes that produce or sustain racial inequity. In my book Plundered: How Racist Policies Undermine Black Homeownership in America, I demonstrate how racial covenants, redlining, urban renewal, blockbusting, predatory mortgage lending and racialized property tax administration have stymied the Black community.What Rosa Parks can teach us about resistance today | Jan-Werner MuellerRead moreWith access to the nation’s most lucrative blue-collar jobs, Black people in Detroit were thriving. By 1950, the median Black household income in Detroit had reached $2,298, whereas the national median for Black households was $952. Most Black families could not, however, translate this triumph into better housing because of racist policies.For instance, racial covenants – private legal agreements that prevented Black people from residing in certain neighborhoods – kept them confined to ghettos. These covenants also prevented Black people from moving to the suburbs where the schools and other amenities were superior and the homes were cheaper, bigger and higher quality.Beginning in the 1930s, the FederalHousingAdministration drew a red line around the neighborhoods where racial covenants corralled Black people, depriving these areas of mortgages, home repair loans and other valuable investment. Redlining turned Black people into pariahs, their very presence diminishing housing prices.In a practice known as blockbusting, real estate agents advised white homeowners that the arrival of Black residents would cause their home values to plummet, inducing panic sales throughout the neighborhood. After purchasing the homes at fire sale prices, the agent would then resell them to Black families at much higher prices, reaping morally dubious profits.Urban renewal programs, prevalent in the 1950s and 1960s, demolished entire communities in an attempt to erase the blight and disorder manufactured by redlining. But alongside the dilapidated buildings, these programs also demolished lucrative Black businesses, intact properties, cultural institutions and most importantly, the social ties that held the communities together. Because displaced Black families could only relocate to a limited number of Black neighborhoods, these spaces became crowded with strangers suffering from “root shock”, a term Dr Mindy Fullilove created to describe “the traumatic stress reaction to the destruction of all or part of one’s emotional eco-system”. Unsurprisingly, crime and disorder thrived in these newly reconfigured communities.Rosa and Raymond Parks were able to rent a home in Detroit at 3201 Virginia Park Street, where they resided from 1961 to 1988. But because of racist policies, today, the home is vacant and worth less than $50,000. It is surrounded by vacant lots and other homes in equally bad shape.Even worse, the City of Detroit is overvaluing the former Parks home along with many others. How did this happen? Due in large part to predatory lending by banks, which spurred the Great Recession and the mortgage foreclosure crisis in 2008, housing prices in Detroit and other majority Black cities dropped precipitously and did not quickly recover. In the midst of the largest municipal bankruptcy in US history, the City of Detroit did not have the capacity to reduce the value of its homes, leading to systematic overvaluation.The City of Detroit proceeded toovertax up to 84% of its homesin violation of the Michigan constitution, which states that no home can be assessed at more than 50% of its market value. As a result, aDetroit News exposé found, the City of Detroit overtaxed Detroit homeowners by at least $600m. The Parkses’ former home on Virginia Park Street was overtaxed by $2,058.More importantly, Detroit is not alone. Recentresearchhas found that, on average, Black and Hispanic people pay a 10% to 13% higher property tax rate than white people for the same bundle of goods, which equals about $300 to $400 more a year.On this 70th anniversary of the Montgomery bus boycott, we should indeed memorialize the heroic work of civil rights leaders like Parks, but we should also expand our notions of racism beyond the cross burnings and segregated lunch counters and buses they faced in the Jim Crow south. We need to focus on the racist policies, hiding in plain sight, that continue to ravage the Black community today.Bernadette Atuahene is the Duggan professor at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law, the executive director of the Institute for Law and Organizing, and the author of Plundered: How Racist Policies Undermine Black Homeownership in AmericaExplore more on these topicsCivil rights movementOpinionRaceDetroitHousingcommentShareReuse this content"

For example: who on earth would watch Liz Truss?Marina HydeEveryone’s favourite former PM is back! Her mission? To save Britain from its current ‘doomloop’ with, you guessed it, a YouTube talkshowFri 5 Dec 2025 08.46 ESTLast modified on Fri 5 Dec 2025 13.56 ESTShareWill you be seeing a pantomime this year? Birmingham’s got Gok Wan and Biggins in Robin Hood, Bradford has Sinitta in Snow White, while Bromley landed Su Pollard for Beauty and the Beast. And at the end of YouTube’s infinite pier, there’sThe Liz Truss Show, starring She’s-Behind-You herself. Curtain up on that one is tonight at 6pm.According to the producers, Liz’s show “confronts the issues that others tiptoe around”. Wow. The lives, loves, and clinical explanations? Let’s just say I’d watch that. Sadly, this doesn’t seem to be the format. Instead, like all seasonal entertainment, TheLiz TrussShow is based on a fairytale. “The deep state and their allies in the media and politics tried to destroy me,” madam explains in a statement, “now I’m back.” Are the gilt markets the deep state now? Honestly, I can’t keep up. You’ll remember that the irony of Truss’s flameout at the hands of market forces was particularly acute given that she had spent an entire career explaining that free markets were the greatest judge of absolutely everything. Small ideological adjustment: free markets are now the greatest judge of everything except the ideas and personage of Liz Truss.Anyhow, Liz says her new show, also available on other platforms such as Spotify, X and Substack, is for people who are “tired of experts who get everything wrong, elites who refuse to listen, and weak leaders”. Amazing. Liz famously ticked each of those three boxes, yet somehow regards herself as the antidote. It’s a sort of political homeopathy, I guess, where a very small amount of the thing is also the cure for the thing. Furthermore, it confirms the notion that the modern political wilderness truly is a wilderness, in that absolutely no one even goes there any more, let alone stays there.Primarily, our host says, this new punditry and debate show is about “the cultural battles reshaping the west”. Like me, many of you will feel you missed the meeting where Liz Truss was elected as the standard-bearer of “the west”. Yet it seems to have become the most inescapable element of her post-premiership LinkedIn profile. Her flop book was entitled Ten Years to Save the West, which is arguably not route one to appealing to a book-buying public whose mortgages you’ve just hiked. If Liz were capable of saving any west, you’d have thought South West Norfolk would have been a start, but the voters there had other ideas,overturning her 26,000 majorityin the general election last year. (Incidentally, the save-the-west book was subtitled: Lessons From the Only Conservative in the Room. Which is one way of spinning the fact that you’re the onlypersonin the room, because everyone else suddenly remembered they need to talk to someone in the kitchen.)The new show tries once again for a new start, with Truss tweaking the origin story quite spellbindingly. Try to imagine the Family Fortunes researchers going down any British high street, asking 100 people, “Why did Liz Truss get ditched as PM?” and getting the following answer from even one of them: “I was deposed as prime minister for trying to save Britain from the doomloop we are in.” Picture the host with his arm around Truss, wincing comically at the board and saying: “If it’s up there, I’ll give you the money myself.”Speaking of giving money to Liz, we must move on, because – amazingly – this new media venture is not even my favourite Truss announcement of the past fortnight. That honour has to go to the unveiling ofa new private London club, spearheaded by Liz, who wants members to give her – are you ready for this? – £500,000 each to join. I know! But it’s true! She’s recorded a personal invitation video message and everything, in which she seeks recruits for a new kind of private members’ club. So, no shit coke or proud dad sexual harassers claiming to be film producers? Truly, end of a very long era. But apparently, this is one for “pro-growth leaders”, which is certainly something you can imagine being droned in your ear at 2am by an experiential marketing agency boss who’s missed the last train to Beaconsfield.Sorry, where was I? Oh yes, it’s called The Leconfield, and I think you can officially regard the search for the most cursed private members’ club in Mayfair as over. What seems to be being offered is a shared office, or as Liz would have it, “a secure ecosystem” and “unique business centre” for people “at the forefront of technology, policy, and capital”. I want to call it “a WeWork for arseholes” but I think that’s just a WeWork. But with something this much of a joke, what a miss not to call it HoHo House.Instead, black lacquer boxes have arrived at the offices of solicited members. These contained the personal message from Truss and the information that she was seeking to sign up no fewer than 700 people at that price point. “Join me,” she coaxed, “as we build this new reality of collaboration, innovation and prosperity together.”Join her? JOIN HER? Now that I’ve perused the introductory offer – and, indeed, now that I know about The Liz Truss Show – I am struck by the fact that there is in fact a certain coherence to these two seemingly absurdist projects. If, after everything, Liz Truss genuinely is able to find 700 people to pay her half a million quid, then fine – I will agree with her. Because how could you not? How could you draw anything other than the conclusion that not just this country, but the entire west, has actually fallen?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Leaked messages froma WhatsApp groupcontaining several senior members of Reform UK in Wales seemed to suggest that the party’s director of communications called me a bad word in January this year. I won’t say the word, but it’s the bad one beginning with C.Personally I don’t have any issue with being called that inside a private group. I would have considered it a stain on my professionalism if any political party’s comms chief had given me a glowing review. Mates of mine have actually suggested that it’s perhaps the most accurate thing to come out ofReform UKHQ. However, it is symbolic of behaviour from Reform in Wales that makes me far more concerned about what the party would be like in power, and which should worry voters both here in Cymru and in the wider UK. The first concern has to be its attitude to scrutiny.The message thread in which Reform treated me with such warmth was discussing a social media post where I’d suggested that the fact the party hasn’t named a Welsh leader was disrespectful toWales. I had posted: “They are telling the people of Wales: ‘Vote for us, but if you do, you’ll only find out who your first minister will be after we win.’” Former Conservative MP Mark Reckless posted in the chat:“My inclination would be to ignore it.” This has been Reform’s attitude to Wales ever since it put the Senedd in its crosshairs – it offers almost nothing specific to Wales, and having no Welsh leader it therefore avoids the scrutiny that comes with the position.Last year I went to Reform UK’s Wales conference in Newport. Nothing sums up its attitude to a free and independent media like this bizarre experience. First I was denied an interview withNigel Faragebecause I was a Guardian columnist. When I explained that the vast majority of my work was as an independent reporter scrutinising the decisions made by the Welsh Labour government, party officials relented and granted me “two minutes” with the chief. By contrast, they gave 15 minutes to GB News, whose interviewer still only found time to ask one question about Wales.Just before my encounter began, one of Farage’s righthand men came up to me and said: “I have never worked with you before, and it will depend on how this goes whether I ever work with you again.” The message seemed clear to me: if you ask hard questions, you won’t get access. I can see why this threat may have worked in the past. Farage is a huge driver of newspaper sales and online clicks, so denying a journalist access to him is a powerful stick.It’s not hard to extrapolate what it would be like if the party were ever to get its hands on the levers of state. Much like in Trump’s US, access would be predicated on support for the regime. We have already seen this in Reform-run councils such as Nottinghamshire, whichbanned the local paperover a disagreement about a story it ran on local government reorganisation. It meant that none of the paper’s journalists or those covering the council for the BBC-fundedLocal Democracy Reporting Servicewere able to attend council events or interview councillors, as well as being taken off distribution lists for press releases. The ban was only lifted in October, after more than a month, following a legal challenge from the paper. That will be the party’s famous love of free speech in action. In Kent, another council the party controls, it was revealed last month that Reformplanned to drastically cutthe number of committees scrutinising its work.Another lesson the rest of the UK can take about Reform’s actions in Wales is that its members are really bad at turning up for the jobs they claim to want. The party only had one Senedd member, Laura Anne Jones, who defected from the Tories. She waslabelled a “part-timer”after declining a place on a Senedd committee, making her the only MS who isn’t a member of any of the parliament’s 16 committees.One councillor recently elected in the Vale of Glamorgan is namedBrandon Dodd. He won a byelection in September on the basis of being “a real local voice on the Vale council” who would “speak up” for local residents. In the first two council meetings held there since he was elected, the “local voice” failed to speak.He didn’t show up for the thirdone this week, when a key vote affecting a development in his ward was happening.In that WhatsApp group is encapsulated perhaps the most defining trait of Reform – and its precursor, Ukip – in Wales: bitter infighting. Of the seven Ukip candidates elected to the Senedd in 2016, only one of them was still a member by the end of the five-year term because of internal disagreements. One of them, Gareth Bennett, defected and became the first ever Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party MS (though not beforehe claimed £10,000on an office that never opened).We can already see the cracks forming within Reform UK in Wales. The very fact that someone within the inner circle was willing to leak internal messages, just to do over a rival, shows that the tension is there even before the Welsh elections next May. Back in summer, in the space of six weeks,seven of the 15 Reform branch heads were removed. Three of these were women, meaning that there is only one woman in any position of power left within the Welsh party.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Finally, this government has found its missionPolly ToynbeeThe new strategy lays out Britain’s social disgrace in painful detail. But it also offers hope and a clear way forward that is worthy of a leftwing partyFri 5 Dec 2025 07.13 ESTLast modified on Fri 5 Dec 2025 12.51 ESTShareOnce Labour set up a child poverty taskforce, it was predestined that the two-child benefit limit would be abolished. Every authority consulted confirmed it as the fastest way to rescue the most children from a life of direst poverty. Every authority, that is, except the general public, who oppose removing the capby 56% to 31%, YouGov finds. This was an unpopular act knowingly taken for good reasons. Not many will read thetaskforce’s findings, but if they did, even the meanest mind might soften: the dismal facts of a child’s life in poverty are, as ever, shocking.All the many measures in this far-reaching policy willlift 550,000 childrenabove the poverty line by 2030 – the most achieved within one parliament. But that leaves behind about4 million poor childrenliving without the basics. That still makes us among themost unequal andmost poverty-strickenof similar European countries. This is a major factor in why British five-year-olds have now becomeup to 7cms shorterthan children of the same age in Europe.Streams of reports emerge from thinktanks and charities describing the plight of desperate people. It’s a story so familiar that it’s easy to be numbed into accepting thata third of the children around usare poor, often without adequate food or heating, many without a home, with no internet connection for homework and no joining in what classmates take for granted: “my holiday”. Labour governments don’t hide these brutish facts of British life. The government’s new strategy lays bare our social disgrace in painful detail, promising annual updates on all the causes, effects and remedies. In 1999, Tony Blair stunned experts with his promise toeliminate child povertywithin 20 years: by the halfway mark in 2010 good progress had been made, but the countrywas not quite there. There’s never time to get enough done, before the right takes over to reverse and vandalise everything. Think of the 3,500 Sure Starts mostly closed or left without the people and services to provide families with the support that changed lives.One of the lucky survivors, a model to remember, is the Jubilee children’s centre in Brixton, south London: beautiful, spacious and purpose-built with every kind of children’s activity and support for adults. On Thursday, parents were in a sewing-machine class, while outsidea food bus projectwas selling fruit and veg at low cost as it travelled round local estates. Two of the ministers, Liz Kendall and Alison McGovern, who together with Bridget Phillipson were lead authors of the strategy chose this location to share their findings, promoting a long list of initiatives across departments from health to housing and transport: getting children out of squalid temporary accommodation that is several bus journeys away from their school is a key promise. Strings of policies designed to root out disadvantage count the ways poor children “do less well in school, are more likely to be unemployed when older and earn less throughout their lifetimes”. Billed as a decade-long strategy, this “is just the first step on our journey to drive down child poverty”, it says. Will Labour get the time?For the contrast between right and left governments, just look at child poverty graphs to know who was in power when. George Osborne’s savage benefit cuts, mostly targeted at families, came with toxic messages pitting the strivers against the skivers, the familysleeping behind the blindsin the morning while next door leave for work. His poison was taken up by programmes such asBenefits Street, which selected choice feckless cases to pillory as examples of everyone on social security. The message accompanying the new strategy is emphatic: almost three-quarters of children in poverty now come from working families. Jobs don’t guarantee escape from poverty – a word the Tories never used, preferring the description “low-income”. On it goes, with Kemi Badenoch labelling this “a budget for Benefits Street” 10 years after the programme ended, stirring up moral panic without admitting that total benefit costs arenotspiralling: non-pensioner benefits have stayed at4-5% of GDP for the past 40 years.Are we by nature nastier? Belief that the criteria needed to qualify for benefits aren’t strict enough has grown in the past few years,says Patrick English of YouGov. Gideon Skinner of Ipsos tells me that younger people in Britain are the most generous, with 18- to 24-year-olds most in favour of abolishing the two-child cap and older people most strongly against. Asked what spending should be cut,voters put welfare top.Never underestimate the life-long foghorn influence of the rightwing media both on- and offline. Here are the Sun’s responses to the budget: “Jobless mums hail Reeves’ ‘Benefits Street’ budget as ‘dream come true’ and vow to cash-in by having more kids”; “Families will foot handout bill for skivers”; “Labour is layabouts party”. Arguing against that is an uphill task. The Blair government ducked persuasion, doing good by stealth instead, rebadging benefits as “working tax credits” to sound better. Successful back-to-work programmes for young people emphasised stick not carrot in public, though kindly, well-attuned help was what worked, not threats.“You have to make the case about poverty time and again, for every generation,” Kendall says, recalling what it took for Harriet Harman to steer the Blair-Brown government towards nurseries. She quotes the theme of the strategy’s foreword: beyond pity for lives wasted, it warns of “the cost of inaction that our economy – and future generations – cannot afford … in poorer health, worse educational attainment, lower skills and lower earnings”.It was a sadness to see one of the remaining Sure Start centres; a reminder of what might have been everywhere by now. This government is rolling out newBest Start hubs, aiming forone in every council area in Englandby 2028. Pressing on means making children every department’s priority. It helps that Phillipson and Wes Streeting themselves come from poor backgrounds, in the most working-class cabinet ever, which is likely to prevent this child poverty strategy from becoming a one-day policy. A government lacking a coherent theme would do well to make children the focus and the purpose of everything from now on.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Edward Snowden taught us that. Every week, it seems, some giant corporation sees its system collapse at the touch of a button in an attic.The government this weekopened a consultationon its plan for nationwide facial recognition and surveillance. You would need only put your face outdoors and walk down the street and authorities will know and record it. Of course we will be assured that all will be kept secure. It will not. Cash or conspiracy will find it out and it will leak.Already, the consultation is a lie. Facial surveillance is already up and running. London’s Met police claims it hascaughtmore than 100 sex offenders breaking their licence conditions.At least sixforces have their town centres plugged in and Whitehall has admitted that it intends the technology to be used nationwide. The policing minister, Sarah Jones,calls facial surveillance“the biggest breakthrough for catching criminals since DNA matching”. It will “help free up police time”. What’s not to like?Every year sees a new advance of state and corporate intrusion into individual privacy. It does not always succeed. In 2013, the governmenttried to introducea nationalised NHS data system that amassed all local GP records of personal health. This, it intended, would help supply A&E departments with possibly life-saving information, and aid research. The data would be surrounded with safeguards against abuse. Thecollected materialwould be ostensibly anonymised and sold to industry to help cover costs.A sceptical public felt the safeguards were not to be trusted. Sooner or later every insurance company in the land would know from personal data how much to charge for insurance. Every employer would know whom not to hire. Since the scheme was voluntary, over a million opted out. The projectcollapsedthree years later.At much the same time, the former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden’s revelations of internet surveillance by American and British intelligence servicesbroke cover. Two lessons followed. One was that the services regard any behaviour on their part, however outrageous, as valid for reasons of “national security”. The other was that no computer data was truly safe. With American and British services sharing material hacked from personal archives, safeguards could be ignored and lied about. America was the land of the free, including a government wishing to do what it liked with anyone’s secrets.The result of a digital free-for-all wassatirised in Dave Eggers’ novelThe Circle. First many politicians, and then citizens, were encouraged to carry a body camera that recorded and transmitted in real time where they were and what they were doing. It was said to promote political accountability and personal integrity. You could refuse, but those who refused could be identified and hounded down.Even Eggers did not envisage a state in which every human face seen in public could be instantly identified. Computers can then match it against a national “hitlist” of individuals who have, at some point, crossed the behavioural line, and trace and record their movements. It would be similar to the data that enables banks to rule out, as a suitable customer, anyone who defaults on a payment or steps out of line.Of course we can see the benefits of facial recognition. In potential hotspots there may be a case for some version of it. Intruding on privacy always sings the best tunes. Surveillance could apparentlyreplace a probation tag. Police forces report that live facial recognition hasled to over 1,000 arrestsfor offences including rape and burglary. It has captured an illegal immigrant; the Home Office says it can be used to find missing children. Jones says it also creates a “hostile environment for prolific sexual offenders”. Who can object when the innocent have nothing to fear? This has long been the slogan of state power.During the controversy over the NHS database, I shall not forget the cackle of laughter from a computer expert when I asked him about Whitehall’s safeguards. “If there is one thing we know,” he said, “it is that no modern safeguard can beat the modern hacker.” As for when the safeguarder – the state – is also the hacker, there is no stopping it. During the Snowden revelations, the NSA was using the Prism systemto gain illicit accessto Google, Apple, Microsoft and Yahoo, and even inducing Microsoft to circumvent its own encryption.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’ve been thinking about that for days, since reading the Local Government Association’s recent report on a growing crisis in early childhood. We’ve known for a while about children starting schoolstill in nappies, orspeaking in Americanismsabsorbed from hours stuck in front of YouTube, or even struggling to sit uprightbecause they’ve spent too long slumped over an iPad to develop core muscles. So sadly, it’s not surprising to read of early-years workerstelling the LGAthey see more and more pre-schoolers who can barely speak, play with others or contain their rage when things don’t go their way. But it was the practitioner who noted that some children“don’t seem to respond to their name” who got to me. You have to wonder how often that child hears a loving adult trying to get their attention. Too often, another practitioner said, “children are not spoken to at home, but offered screens all day” – at mealtimes, out shopping, or in the car – with parents seemingly scared of provoking tantrums if they take the phone away.The report describes a complex puzzle with multiple causes: poverty, and the parental exhaustion that comes of a hardscrabble life; growing up in a pandemic; changes in early-years provision; and way too much screen time. It can’t be solved by money alone, but certainly won’t be solved without it. So a two-pronged strategy of lifting the two-child limit on children’s welfare payments – as Rachel Reeves did last week – and intervening early wheretoddlers aren’t meeting their milestones makes sense. The Best Start family hubs rolling out gradually nationwide will, we learned this week, getSend (special educational needs and disabilities) co-ordinators, focusing particularly on speech and language. They’ll promote the upcomingNational Year of Readingto wean kids off screens and on to books,and more generally attempt, on a shoestring, to mimic the support that their predecessor programme Sure Start once offered parents. There’s not enough funding – there never is – but there are the beginnings of joined-up thinking, accepting that tackling problems in nursery rather than in primary school is easier, cheaper and kinder on everyone involved.Let’s not tempt fate, given this government’s unparalleled ability to take one step forward and three back. But for the record: taxing the better-off in the budget to invest in tackling child poverty, telling some home truths about the economic damage done by Brexit (as Keir Starmer alsodid this week), and striking azero-tariff dealon pharmaceuticals with Donald Trump to save a lot of jobsisn’t a terrible week at the office. More surprisingly, for the first time in ages Labour is talking about things its supporters actually like. Jobs! Europe! Children not going hungry! Evidently there has been a disturbance in the force.Westminster rumour has it that the Morgan McSweeney tendency inside government – focused on wining voters back from Reform – is currently being out-argued by those more worried about losing them to the Liberal Democrats and the Greens. Who knows whether this will last, or what this will do to their electoral fortunes, so for once let’s stay focused on those at the sharp end.Thebiggest budget winnersin terms of net income, the Resolution Foundation thinktank notes, were the poorest 10%; the biggest losers were the richest 10%. Strip away all the fuss about who leaked what to whom, and there’s the gist: Reeves raised money mostly from the better off and spent it mostly on poorer families. She got there inelegantly but she got there, and now there will be children waking up tomorrow who won’t suffer the lifelong harms of early deprivation. At the time of writing, the government’s imminent child poverty strategyis still under wraps, but children’s charities were unanimous that it would be pointless without scrapping the two-child limit. That’s done. What remains is to tell a compelling human story about how children’s lives will change as a result of all that public money, to make people feel it’s worth it.Of course Nigel Farage will say Labour is whacking up taxes for no good reason. But he backed the lifting of the cap this summer, and Reform has problems of its own. For all its meteoric rise in the polls, it has struggled tobreak the 30% ceiling– a nice problem to have, admittedly, when you’re still miles ahead of the two supposedly big parties, but 30% isn’t enough to win an election. Hence renewed speculation that Reform will merge with the Tories, which would indeed make sense electorally – if only so many of those involved didn’t hate each other.Meanwhile both Labour and Tory strategists have noticed that Reform’s vote share seeminglyfalls a bitwhen the economy is uppermost in people’s thoughts, and rises when immigration is. When the battle is over tax and how to spend it, or where new jobs are coming from, Reform isn’t clear what it wants to say and so loses ground to the Tories. The striking thing about watching Kemi Badenoch pummel Rachel Reeves in parliament last week was how it left Farage oddly out in the cold.Let’s not get carried away here. The chancellor’s path remains strewn with landmines – including a revolt brewing among ruralLabourMPsover the increasingly toxic farm inheritance tax – and this administration’s capacity for self-destruction is prodigious. But when a Labour government actually delivers some of what its supporters were screaming for, it’s churlish not to acknowledge it. Sometimes, you just have to take yes for an answer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Then came a eureka moment – and the birth of the Earth Rover ProgramReport: Experts say seismic waves can check soil health and boost yieldsFri 5 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 5 Dec 2025 12.51 ESTShareIt felt like walking up a mountain during a temperature inversion. You struggle through fog so dense you can scarcely see where you’re going. Suddenly, you break through the top of the cloud, and the world is laid out before you. It was that rare and remarkable thing: a eureka moment.For the past three years, I’d been struggling with a big and frustrating problem. In researchingmy book Regenesis, I’d been working closely with Iain Tolhurst (Tolly),a pioneering farmerwho had pulled off something extraordinary. Almost everywhere, high-yield farming means major environmental harm, due to the amount of fertiliser, pesticides and (sometimes) irrigation water and deep ploughing required. Most farms with apparently small environmental impacts produce low yields. This, in reality,means high impacts, as more land is needed to produce a given amount of food. But Tolly has found the holy grail of agriculture: high and rising yields with minimal environmental harm.He uses no fertiliser, no animal manure and no pesticides. His techniques, the result of decades of experiment and observation, appear to enrich the crucial relationships between crops and microbes in the soil, through which soil nutrients must pass. It seems that Tolly has, in effect, “trained” his soil bacteria to release nutrients when his crops require them (a process called mineralisation), and lock them up when his crops aren’t growing (immobilisation), ensuring they don’t leach from the soil.So why the frustration? Well, Tolly has inspired many other growers to attempt the same techniques. Some have succeeded, with excellent results. Others have not. And no one can work out why. It’s likely to have something to do with soil properties. But what?Not for the first time, I had stumbled into a knowledge gap so wide that humanity could fall through it. Soil is a fantastically complex biological structure, like a coral reef,built and sustainedby the creatures that inhabit it. It supplies99% of our calories. Yet we know less about it than any other identified ecosystem. It’s almost a black box.Many brilliant scientists have devoted their lives to its study. But there are major barriers. Most soil properties cannot be seen without digging, and if you dig a hole, you damage the structures you’re trying to investigate. As a result, studying even basic properties is cumbersome, time-consuming and either very expensive or simply impossible at scale. To measure the volume of soil in a field, for example, you need to take hundreds of core samples. But as soil depths can vary greatly from one metre to the next, your figure relies on extrapolation. This makes it very hard to tell whether you’re losing soil or gaining it. Measuring bulk density (the amount of soil in a given volume, which shows how compacted it might be), or connected porosity (the tiny catacombs created by lifeforms, a crucial measure of soil health), or soil carbon – at scale – is even harder.So farmers must guess. Partly because they cannot see exactly what the soil needs, many of their inputs – fertilisers, irrigation, deep ploughing – are wasted. Roughly two-thirds of thenitrogen fertiliser they apply, andbetween 50%and80%of their phosphorus, is lost. These lost minerals cause algal blooms in rivers,dead zones at sea, costsfor water usersandglobal heating. Huge amounts of irrigation water are also wasted. Farmers sometimes “subsoil” their fields – ploughing that is deep and damaging – because they suspect compaction. The suspicion is often wrong.Our lack of knowledge also inhibits the development of a new agriculture, which may, as Tolly has done, allow farmers to replace chemical augmentation with biological enhancement.So when I came to write the book, I made a statement so vague that it reads like an admission of defeat: we needed to spend heavily on “an advanced science of the soil”, and use it to deliver a “greener revolution”. While we know almost nothing about the surface of our own planet, billions are spent on theMars Rover programme, exploring the barren regolith there. What we needed, I argued, is an Earth Rover programme, mapping the world’sagricultural soilsat much finer resolution.I might as well have written “something must be done!” The necessary technologies simply did not exist. I sank into a stygian gloom.At the same time, Tarje Nissen-Meyer, then a professor of geophysics at the University of Oxford, was grappling with a different challenge. Seismology is the study of waves passing through a solid medium. Thanks to billions from the oil and gas industry, it has become highly sophisticated. Tarje wanted to use this powerful tool for the opposite purpose – ecological improvement. Already, with colleagues, he had deployed seismology tostudy elephant behaviour in Kenya. Not only was it highly effective, but his team also discovered it couldidentify animal specieswalking through the savannah by their signature footfall.By luck we were both attached, in different ways, to Wolfson College, Oxford, where we met in February 2022. I saw immediately that he was a thoughtful man – a visionary. I suggested a pint in The Magdalen Arms.I explained my problem, and we talked about the limits of existing technologies. Was seismology being used to study soil, I asked. He’d never heard of it. “I guess it’s not a suitable technology then?” No, he told me, “soil should be a good medium for seismology. In fact, we need to filter out the soil noise when we look at the rocks.” “So if it’s noise, it could be signal?” “Definitely.”We stared at each other. Time seemed to stall. Could this really be true?Over the next three days, Tarje conducted a literature search. Nothing came up. I wrote to Prof Simon Jeffery, aneminent soil scientistat Harper Adams University, whose advice I’d found invaluable when researching the book. I set up a Zoom call. He would surely explain that we were barking up the wrong tree.Simon is usually a reserved man. But when he had finished questioning Tarje, he became quite animated. “All my life I’ve wanted to ‘see’ into the soil,” he said. “Maybe now we can.” I was introduced to a brilliant operations specialist, Katie Bradford, who helped us build an organisation. We set up a non-profit called theEarth Rover Program, to develop what we call “soilsmology”; to build open-source hardware and software cheap enough to be of use to farmers everywhere; and to create, with farmers, a global, self-improving database. This, we hope, might one day incorporate every soil ecosystem: a kind of Human Genome Project for the soil.We later found thatsome scientistshad in fact sought toapply seismology to soil, but it had not been developed into a programme, partly because the approaches used were not easily scalable.My role was mostly fixer, finding money and other help. We received $4m (£3m) in start-up money from the Bezos Earth Fund. This may cause some discomfort, but our experience has been entirely positive: the fund has helped us do exactly what we want. We also got a lot of pro-bono help from the law firm Hogan Lovells.Tarje, nowat the University of Exeter, and Simon began assembling their teams. They would need to develop an ultra-high-frequency variant of seismology. A big obstacle was cost. In 2022, suitable sensors cost $10,000 (£7,500) apiece. They managed to repurpose other kit: Tarje found that a geophone developed by a Slovakianexperimental music outfitworked just as well, and cost only $100. Now one of our scientists,Jiayao Meng, is developing a sensor for about $10. In time, we should be able to use theaccelerometers in mobile phones, reducing the cost to zero. As for generating seismic waves, we get all the signal we need by hitting a small metal plate with a welder’s hammer.On its first deployment, our teammeasured the volumeof a peat bog that had been studied by scientists for 50 years. After 45 minutes in the field, they produced a preliminary estimate suggesting that previous measurements were out by 20%. Instead of extrapolating the peat depth from point samples, they couldseethe wavy line where the peat met the subsoil. The implications for estimating carbon stocks are enormous.We’ve also been able tomeasure bulk densityat a very fine scale; totrack soil moisture(as part of a wider team); to start building the AI and machine learning tools we need; and to see the varying impacts of different agricultural crops and treatments. Next we’ll work on measuring connected porosity, soil texture and soil carbon; scaling up to the hectare level and beyond; and on testing the use of phones as seismometers. We now have further funding, from the UBS Optimus Foundation, hubs on three continents and abig international team.Eventually, we hope, any farmer anywhere, rich or poor, will be able to getan almost instant readoutfrom their soil. As more people use the tools, building the global database, we hope these readouts will translate into immediate useful advice. The tools should also revolutionise soil protection: the EUhas issuedasoil-monitoringlaw, but how can it be implemented? Farmers are paid for their contributions “to improve soil health and soil resilience”, but what this means in practice is ticking a box on a subsidy form: there’s no sensible way of checking.We’re not replacing the great work of other soil scientists but, developing our methods alongside theirs, we believe we can fill part of the massive knowledge gap. As one of the farmers we’re working with,Roddy Hall, remarks, the Earth Rover Program could “take the guesswork out of farming”. One day it might help everyone arrive at that happy point: high yields with low impacts. Seismology promises to shake things up.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsSoilOpinionFarmingFoodcommentShareReuse this content"

For one thing, she is Slovenian – and she is also a diplomat, not a news anchor. But there she was, announcing that Moldova had made more progress in the last three years than it had in the previous 30, and that negotiations for our country to join theEuropean Unionwould open soon.It was equally surprising to spot Kos in the Instagram stories of leading Moldovan influencer siblings Emilian and Nina Crețu at the end of August – she hadinvited them to her house in Brusselsfor a Moldovan pie-making workshop. Kos even brought together the two heads of Moldova’s biggest Orthodox churches for a meeting, in spite of their mutual animosity. This is not the way we are used to EU officials communicating.The departure from stiff, technocratic speeches is part of EU efforts to involve civil society and the public in the EU’snext enlargement process– a difference from the last phase of expansion, from 2004 to 2013, where only the political elites were involved. If the EU is to create a more harmonious kind of European integration, it needs to meet its citizens on the terrain of everyday life like this.In candidate countries such as Albania, Montenegro andMoldova, EU membership feels like a lifeline. But becoming a member is also an arduous, technical process full of reports and negotiation clusters – it is not easy to make it sexy. In the western Balkans, the process has already been going on for years. At the first meeting of a new EU Enlargement Forum in Brussels in November, the Albanian prime minister, Edi Rama, observed that he had been talking about EU accession for so long that he could track the process in the anatomy of his receding hairline. More than 90% of Albanians are keen to join the EU, while in Moldova the figure has varied between 53% and 65% throughout the years.For the majority of Moldovans, EU integration promises peace, prosperity, the rule of law and hope that their children could have a better future. The fears of EU-sceptic Moldovans, rooted in unease about the unknown, are boosted by Russian propaganda saying that EU membership means the loss of tradition, identity and sovereignty, or that local companies will not be able to compete against European giants. One other Kremlin-coined narrative is that the EU is about to collapse, just as the USSR did in 1991, or that the EU simply does not want to integrate Moldova. Why would it need a country of2.4 million people?In the EU itself, enlargement is probably not especially on the minds of ordinary citizens. Overall, 56% of people within the EUsaid they believetheir country would benefit from further enlargement. Tellingly, the same Eurobarometer survey found about two-thirds of EU citizens said they did not feel well informed about the process. Among their concerns, migration was at the top.With an ageing population, the EU continues to need more migrant workers: a labour force often drawn from poorer EU members or candidate states. If we are going to create a more perfect union, we cannot see these people as mere economic units, just human resources to be exploited. If the EU wants the free movement of people to lead to genuine cultural exchanges and human connections, and to stronger European identity and solidarity, it must ensure workers have help to learn the language of their host countries.It is hard to feel fully comfortable living in a country where you don’t speak the language. One theory about the Romanian diaspora’s drift to the far right attributes it to their cultural isolation in their new homes – where social lives exist only through smartphones and sometimes in local Romanian churches. Instead of leaving integration to the labour market and the individual, the EU should encourage people changing countries to take on language classes, perhaps through their employers.One thing more Europeans should do, in the season of Christmas parties, is to invite cleaners, security staff and everyone else working in our offices who may feel invisible to celebrate together, to have a drink and ask them about their lives. These people are usually left out, they are often from other countries, and a small gesture like this can make them feel so much more respected and welcome.Beyond the better integration of migrant workers, if the EU wants to create a stronger and more inclusive European identity, it needs to learn from and compete with Russia’s use of soft power through the entertainment industry. Russian comedy shows like KVN (in which the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy once starred), or the weekly figure-skating programme Ice Age, have been hugely popular – not just inRussia, but across the former Soviet world.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Man Like Mobeen star talks about interfaith Christmas … and why he refuses to go back to LaplandStuart HeritageFri 5 Dec 2025 08.00 ESTShareGuz Khan is developing something of a reputation as Mr Christmas. The comedian and actor is about to release Stuffed, a Lapland-set one-hour comedy co-starring Morgana Robinson. This time last year, he voiced a reindeer in the Richard Curtis animation That Christmas. Two years before that, he made a festive special with James Acaster testing the scientific validity of Home Alone.“It sounds like, based on all the projects you’ve just listed there, Christmas paid for the extension on my house,” Khan booms down the phone. “Christmas is way better than Eid, bro, based on the facts that you’ve just given me.”But if Stuffed represents Khan’s latest endeavour to become the face of Christmas, it’s one he seems slightly apprehensive about. If you’re familiar with his work, you’ll know how successfully he uses his garrulous personality and clusterbombing of the term “bro” (I count 46 uses in our interview) to camouflage a much more thoughtful intellect.And Stuffed is definitely a departure. At this stage, Khan is best known forMan Like Mobeen, the peerless sitcom about life around Birmingham’s criminal underbelly he co-created with writer Andy Milligan. And despite being written by Milligan, Stuffed has a lot less bite. The story of a hard-up dad who uses his Christmas bonus to take his family on the holiday of a lifetime, only to realise that it was paid in error and has to be returned, is a broad, big-hearted family affair. Like all good Christmas shows, it balances humour with a sweet undercurrent of melancholy.View image in fullscreenLooks like reindeer … Khan with Morgana Robinson as Hannah in Stuffed.Photograph: Janne-Pekka Manninen/BBC/Baby Cow“Was it all right?” he asks, nervously. “You never know when you make something. I never thought we’d ever be in this kind of slot. There’s lots of things that come along with doing a Christmas special.”How so? “A lot of the work I get asked to do is like: ‘Come in and do your thing.’ I just did season two ofThe Gentlemen, and it was such a fun week. There’s no rules. You can go absolutely crazy,” he explains. “But this was a little bit different. You have to follow some guidelines. And so it was a really good challenge for me. Where I’d usually express myself with dialogue, I had to try and get the same feeling with an expression.”Getting to film in Lapland must have been special, though. “Most of it was made just off a roundabout in Reading, bro,” he replies, breaking the spell somewhat. “But when we did go to Lapland, I realised that somewhere deep down within me, my genetics were warning me about going to a country so cold. It’s everything you can imagine: really beautiful, lovely people. But my brown arse will never enter that place ever again. Unless the sequel is changed to somewhere warm with a beautiful beach, I’m out.”What Stuffed does achieve, however, is something quietly groundbreaking. “I don’t know if at Christmastime there have been many depictions of interfaith couples,” he says. The central relationship in Stuffed is the marriage between Robinson’s Hannah (who celebrates Christmas) and Khan’s Arslan (who, as a Muslim, participates with a detached bewilderment). This element is buried deep inside the show, but it’s definitely there.View image in fullscreenBro life … Khan as Mobeen with Tolu Ogunmefun as Nate  and Salman Akhtar as Saj in Man Like Mobeen.Photograph: Paul Husband/BBC/Tiger Aspect“It’s a really interesting dynamic,” says Khan. “They just live a normal life. There’s nothing aggy, nothing stressful. It’s all the stuff that any couple would go through. And for me and Andy, especially on Man Like Mobeen, so many people would say: ‘Isn’t that groundbreaking?’ We were like, ‘Not really.’ It’s just normal life. I suppose a lot of the country will tune in and be like: ‘OK, maybe that’s the first time I’ve seen it.’ Maybe it’ll piss some people off. And you know, that’s also part of the journey.”It’s smart that you’re not underestimating the British public’s ability to be pissed off, I say. “Like my old mate Stephen Yaxley-Lennon,” he booms. “I’m gonna send him a link! I’m going to send him an early viewing link! I talk to him a lot on Instagram, so I might be like: ‘Steve, this one’s for you, baby boy.’”Outside of his ongoing Christmas fixation, this has been another big year in a long succession of big years for Khan. In May, he released the final season of Man Like Mobeen, the show that made his name. And it’s testament to the show’s quality that it went out with the best run of episodes yet. Over the years, what started as a street-smart, silly sitcom about a former drug dealer gradually sharpened its edges. Life got harder for the characters. There was a death. By the end, the show resembled a thriller as much as a comedy.View image in fullscreenBling bling … Khan as Chucky in The Gentlemen.Photograph: TCD/Alamy“I feel like a personal responsibility that it wasn’t like Only Fools, right?” he says of the ending. “You don’t all end up with winning the lottery. In Small Heath and the West Midlands, we have some of the most dangerous levels of crime that we’ve seen on record. And to present Mobeen as like: ‘Oh yeah, what an amazing guy,’ you can’t do that. It’s a bad life. It’s a life that will ruin you, and you’ll lose the people closest to you, so we always wanted to keep that sense. I never want a kid to watch the show and be like: ‘I want to be like Mobeen.’ I want you to have the friendships that they’ve got, but I certainly don’t want you to have the lifestyle.”Is this definitively the end? “It feels right for me personally, because that was based on one stage of my life from 20 years ago,” he says. “But now, with the size of my waist and all the good food that comes along with this game, I don’t feel like I’m the right guy to be telling the stories of Small Heath or any inner-city, working-class area. I want to see Girl Like Mobeen. I want to see that next generation. I still feel like bringing it to an end is the right thing. But we can never say never. I’d love to see what those characters look like in their late 50s, if we’re all still alive. So, yeah, definitely a special out there, but you never want to outstay your welcome.”If anything, 2026 looks like it might be a bigger year still. As well as The Gentlemen, and an unscripted show entitled Guz Khan’s Custom Cars, there is one project he seems especially excited about:Riz Ahmed’s upcoming Prime Video comedy Bait.“Riz is very excited about it, too,” he says. A show about a struggling actor thrust into an existential crisis after landing the role of a lifetime, the series was created by Ahmed, and at first glance sounds fairly autobiographical. “It’s the first time he’s created a show in nearly 27 years of acting, and it’s dropping next year,” continues Khan, who will play Ahmed’s cousin. “It’s his life story, and it’s an absolute honour to be part of it. He’s so proud that he gets to tell his story. And it blew my mind, bro, because when we were filming it, I was just talking about the context of making a show. And he turned to me, put his hand on my shoulder, and he went: ‘Bro, I’ve been doing this for 27 years, and until now no one has ever asked me to do my own show. Just remember how lucky you were.”View image in fullscreenForest life … Khan with Judi Love in Outsiders.Photograph: Steve Peskett/UKTVLooking at Khan’s career so far, it’s hard to get a full sense of scale. He’s made his own show, and balanced it with roles in ever bigger international projects, such as Andy Samberg’s animated comedy Digman! and Rebel Wilson’s upcoming movie Girl Group. And, as previously stated, he has now become the walking image of Christmas incarnate. Does he even have any ambitions left?“You know, fundamentally, what I have to do is raise these kids,” he says of his five children, who range from 11 months to 14 years old. “Now you mention it, though, you got me thinking. I worked with Idris Elba after only performing for a couple of years, and Pedro Pascal. I got tospend a week in a forestwith Judi Love. Bro, my life is beyond crazy. But for as long as it lasts, for as long as this crazy rollercoaster we’re all on continues to go, I just want to work with good people and catch good vibes. And I’ve been very lucky so far, whether it’s stuff that I’ve created or whether I’ve been asked to go and do it. Just keep having fun with it, bro. And that’s the biggest thing. I’m not worried about Hollywood. We’re just trying to have fun, bro, for however long this theme park carries on.”Stuffed is on BBC One on 23 December at 9pm.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionGuz KhanDramaTV comedyComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now it’s out, all the drama surrounding it seems superfluousAlyssa MercanteFri 5 Dec 2025 10.04 ESTLast modified on Fri 5 Dec 2025 10.08 ESTShareOn 25 November, award-winning Italian developer Santa Ragione, responsible for acclaimed titles such as MirrorMoon EP and Saturnalia,revealed that its latest project, Horses, had been banned from Steam - the largest digital store for PC games. A week later, another popular storefront, Epic Games Store, also pulled Horses, right before its 2 December launch date. The game was also briefly removed from the Humble Store, but was reinstated a day later.The controversy has helped the game rocket to the top of the digital stores thatareselling it, namely itch.io and GOG. But the question remains – why was it banned? Horses certainly delves into some intensely controversial topics (a content warning at the start details, “physical violence, psychological abuse, gory imagery, depiction of slavery, physical and psychological torture, domestic abuse, sexual assault, suicide, and misogyny”) and is upsetting and unnerving.View image in fullscreenControversial … Horses.Photograph: Santa RagioneThe plot is fairly simple, though it turns dark fast. You play as Anselmo, a 20-year-old Italian man sent to spend the summer working on a farm to build character. It’s revealed almost immediately (so fast in fact, that I let out a surprised “Ha!”) that the farm Anselmo has been sent to is not a normal one. The “horses” held there are not actually horses, but nude humans wearing horse heads that appear to be permanently affixed.Your job is to tend to the garden, the “horses” and the “dog” (who is a human wearing a dog head). Anselmo performs menial, frustratingly slow everyday tasks across Horses’ three-ish hour runtime, like chopping wood and picking vegetables. These monotonous tasks are, however, interspersed with horrible and unsettling jobs. On day one, you find a “horse” body hanging from a tree and have to help the farmer bury it.It’s disturbing, yes, but Horses doesn’t show most of these horrors playing out, and when it does, the simplistic, crude graphics dull its edges (when you encounter the farmer whipping a human “horse” and have to throw hydrogen peroxide on her back, the marks crisscrossing her skin are blurry and unreal).View image in fullscreenUnsettling … Horses.Photograph: Santa RagioneThe “horses’” genitals and breasts are blurred out. The enslaved are forbidden from fornicating, but you’ll find that they do that anyway (a simplistic, animalistic depiction of sex), and though you’re forced to “tame” them by putting them back in their pen, it’s just a button press to interact, with no indication of what you’ve actually done to them.Valve, the company that owns Steam,told PC Gamerthat Horses’ content was reviewed back in 2023. “After our team played through the build and reviewed the content, we gave the developer feedback about why we couldn’t ship the game on Steam, consistent with our onboarding rules and guidelines,” the statement read. “A short while later the developer asked us to reconsider the review, and our internal content review team discussed that extensively and communicated to the developer our final decision that we were not going to ship the game on Steam.”According toIGN, Epic Games Store told developer Santa Ragione: “We are unable to distribute Horses on the Epic Games Store because our review found violations of the Epic Games Store Content Guidelines, specifically the ‘Inappropriate Content’ and ‘Hateful or Abusive Content’ policies.” Santa Ragione alleges that “no specifics on what content was at issue were provided.”Horses’ gameplay is grotesque, not gratuitous. The horror is psychological and lies in the incongruity of performing menial tasks in a veritable hellscape, while having no idea why any of this is going on. There is barely any sound aside from the constant whirring of a film camera (the game is presented like a mostly silent Italian arthouse film), super-up-close shots of mouths moving as they talk or chew, unsettling character models, the occasional cut to a real-life shot of water pouring in a glass or slop filling up a dog bowl.There is no explicit gore or violence. You are uncomfortable, frustrated and unnerved throughout, and the horrors of humanity are on full display, but nothing ever threatens to upend your lunch. It is an interesting meditation on violence and power dynamics, but it is by no means a shocking or radical game. The conversation that has ignited around it – about video games as art and the censorship of art – is proving to be more profound than the actual content of the game.Explore more on these topicsGamesIndie gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This is a takeover. Not only has this Jack and the Beanstalk gone from fairy story to panto to musical, but Jack has been relegated to second billing. To be accurate, this “new moooosical” by Jonathan O’Neill and Isaac Savage should be called Caroline and the Beanstalk, Caroline being the name of the highland cow who is adopted by Jack’s family and becomes sole supplier of milk for their Glen and Sherry’s brand of ice-cream.Played by an excellent Suzie McAdam, all ginger hair and stoicism, she is treated as an equal until the business fails. Then, it only takes a few magic beans for her to wind up in the Happy Smiles Petting Zoo, being prodded by unseen children while trying to hatch an escape plan with a hen, a llama and a pig. After some sub-Wallace and Gromit shenanigans, she is back home and ready to sort out the fickle Jack (Ronan O’Hara) and his troublesome beanstalk.In Stephen Whitson’s production, it is done with much pizzazz by a 10-strong cast (plus the giant voice ofBrian Cox), but the shift in emphasis is at the expense of the fable’s archetypal pull.Gone is any sense of the wonderment of a magical land, of the terror of being a child in an adult world and of the David and Goliath struggle between good and evil. In its place, a hazily dramatised caper about a single-minded cow, marred by the cynicism not only of Jack’s mum Sherry (Laura Lovemore), which you would expect, but of Jack himself, which feels all wrong.The story meanders away from its own heart, relying on expository dialogue to spell out the lessons learned: telling not showing. It does not help that many of the songs only delay the action.And yet those songs, an Americana-influenced collection that go from Broadway to vaudeville to rap, build the showbiz illusion that something greater is at stake: McAdam’s power ballad Udderly Alone being a case in point, key change and all. With crisp choreography by Lisa Darnell and some gorgeous harmonies under Savage’s musical direction, it is superficially lively but emotionally in the clouds.AtDundee Repuntil 30 DecemberExplore more on these topicsPanto seasonTheatreDundee RepMusicalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Armenia refused to take part when the 2012 event was held in Baku, Azerbaijan.Ironically, it was Spain, whose broadcaster RTVE has been the most outspoken of the four boycotters, that was a target of the first boycott call in the competition’s history. At Eurovision’s ninth edition, in Copenhagen in 1964, a young Danish leftwing activiststormed the stagewith a placard that read “Boycott Franco & Salazar”, to protest against Spain and Portugal being allowed to compete in spite of them being run by military dictatorships.View image in fullscreenA protester holds a placard that says ‘Boycott Franco & Salazar’ at the Eurovision song contest in Copenhagen in 1964Photograph: Keystone Pictures USA/Zuma Press/ShutterstockSpain won Eurovision in 1968 and got to host the 1969 contest, which was boycotted in protest against the Franco regime by Austria – which will be the 2026 hosting nation and is one of the countries now most scandalised by the breakaway four’s boycott.You might say all this means Spain’s activist stance smacks of hypocrisy, or you could say the country is in a stronger position to gaze through the dry fog and glitter and see what Eurovision is really all about.“Spain entered Eurovision just after it was blocked from joining the European Economic Community – it was about ending its ostracism and entering an elite club”, said Duncan Wheeler, the chair of Spanish studies at the University of Leeds. “Its own history in Eurovision has made it acutely aware of how pop culture can function as a soft power.”Given the “Euro” in the title, some will ask what right Israel ever had to a starting place in the song contest in the first place. That would be to misunderstand the origins of Eurovision, which was never designed as a top-down vehicle for building a common European culture, but as a fairly mundane experiment in cross-border broadcasting that gained political meaning almost by accident.MapOne frequently overlooked fact is that not only Israel but also north African and other Middle Eastern countries including Algeria, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia are full members of the European Broadcasting Union, which organises the spectacle.Israel was the first to enter the contest, in 1973, but Morocco took part once, in 1980, when Israel withdrew due to a religious holiday falling on the same evening, and Lebanon was due to field a contestant in 2005 but withdrew its artist when told it would be required to broadcast the event in full, including the Israeli entry.You could say that these states have boycotted Eurovision over Israel’s participation from the beginning, it’s just they have been so consistent in their stance that barely anyone one has noticed.However, Ireland, Spain,Sloveniaand the Netherlands boycotting Eurovision does mark a turning point in Eurovision’s history, and creates a problem that could take years to solve.But given that the song contest has so few genuine articles of faith that were intrinsic to its inception, its crisis may not be existential. Eurovision’s values are the sum of those brought to the contest by participating nations. And whenever the boycotting four return, they may well inject it with a new lease of life.Explore more on these topicsEurovisionIsraelSpainIrelandNetherlandsSloveniaEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

The warm-up DJ drops Fetty Wap’s 2014 smash Trap Queen, and the young crowd, a fair portion of whom were in primary school when the tune first came out, roar every word. They’re clad in baggy skatewear, with distressed, monochromatic union jacks plastered across hats and jackets. A coat sails across the room: someone is going home chilly tonight, but that’ll be the last thing on their mind as Liverpool rapper EsDeeKid, one of the fastest-rising musicians in the world, explodes on to the stage.Wrapped in a hooded cloak and spinning like a twig in a hurricane, he grabs the mic and snarls: “Are you ready for rebellion?”, his distinctive scouse accent battling a storm of apocalyptic bass and John Carpenter-esque horror synths. Behind him, projections flash in stark black and red – tower blocks, eyeballs, dot-matrix geometries – more like the ragged photocopy aesthetic of 80s post-punk than any luxury rap branding. The teenagers in the room are ecstatic, borne aloft by the palpable sense, thrumming from stage to pit, that this is A Moment.They are right. Two weeks after the show, EsDeeKid’s breakthrough single Phantom, one minute and 50 seconds of gothic inner-city pressure, crashes into the UK Top 20. Despite having only started to release music in 2024, the masked, anonymous rapper has more than 10m monthly Spotify listeners. By the end of November, his debut album, Rebel, was Spotify’s most streamed hip-hop album in the world; his latest single, Century, reached the UK Top 10. As he maintains silence in the press, wild conspiracy theories have circulated, including one suggestinghe was the US actor Timothée Chalametmoonlighting as a self-proclaimed“council house rat”from Liverpool. EsDeeKid has neither confirmed it, nor denied.To the outside world his rise seemed to happen overnight. But EsDeeKid is part of a new movement that has been gradually emerging – with a recent rush in momentum – from all corners of the UK. After grime shifted to road rap in the mid-00s, and the rise ofUK drill and Afroswingin the mid-2010s, this is the latest evolution of homegrown rap culture. And while UK rappers such as Dave, Stormzy and Central Cee still sell out arenas, and Aitch charms the masses on I’m a Celebrity, these new artists are starting to rival them for popularity while having considerably more edge.The kids at Electric Ballroom are friendly and eager to talk, and they all call the new sound “underground” rap. I chat with Billy, one of three lads who have come down from Birmingham, and he reels off a list of artists who are pushing the scene forward: “Lancey Foux, Fimiguerrero, Len, EsDeeKid, Rico Ace, Fakemink, Jim Legxacy. Underground is exciting – it keeps getting more and more experimental.”Pinning down the underground sound is tricky. Upcoming rapper Ceebo describes it as capturing the zeitgeist: “Constant stimulation – dopamine overload.” Fizzing, lo-fi tracks come and go in under two minutes, with everything cranked into the red. Crucially, Britishness is in the foreground, with older UK tracks used for samples, regional accents flourishing, and lyrics as likely to concern getting messy in small market towns as they are to imitate US gangster rap.View image in fullscreenPushing the scene forward … Fakemink.Photograph: PR IMAGEThe scene has spread through TikTok, Discord groups, Instagram and, most importantly, live shows of increasing size, something police forces often made impossible for earlier generations of drill and grime artists. (Many would argue the reason the underground scene hasn’t been similarly policed is because there is a higher proportion of white and/or middle class kids involved, both as artists and punters.) Promoters such as Aux (who also runs EsDeeKid’s label) have become serious players in the live space, packing out regular showcases with hordes of young fans who, numbed by the overwhelming flood of social media, crave the chaotic, tangible joy of mosh pits and massive speakers.Now, with US rap in the doldrums – in October there were no rap songs on the US Hot 100 for the first time since 1990 – fans across the Atlantic are starting to pay attention to this maxed-out music. We may be witnessing the start of a new British Invasion: another star of the UK underground, Fakemink, was pictured hanging with Clipse and Andre 3000 in Los Angeles in November, and played Tyler, the Creator’s festival there. “I’m a huge advocate of what’s going on in the underground,” says Kenny Allstar, the BBC’s chief rap DJ and arguably the foremost authority on British rap. “The next generation are here.”While the scene’s biggest shows have taken place in London, the sound has spread rapidly across the country, drawing in kids from suburban towns in much the same way as punk did in the 1970s. Ledbyher, one of the few rising female artists in the scene, grew up in a council house in Norfolk, and listened to US rap until she was introduced to UK drill by a school friend and learned you could rap convincingly in an English accent.“Where drill might have been a very niche aspect of London life, the underground is commenting on a life that more of us find ourselves in,” she says, while on tour around the UK. “The underground now, its lyrics relate to people growing up in High Wycombe or wherever – it’s a commentary on British life.” Originally coining the phrase “bedroom drill” for her sound, her tracks deal with relationships, dreams and depression – “Step into my wreck of a ship / I don’t even know whose wreckage it is,” she raps on her Bad News freestyle, a hazy, rainy cut that nods as much to trip-hop as trap.“The producers might be from Scotland, Ireland; you have people from Canterbury,” she says, and points out that YT, another of the scene’s leading lights, attended an institution not generally known as an engine room for British rap: the University of Oxford. “There’s not one place the scene is from.”But everyone acknowledges one artist who has been fundamental to its growth. “Lancey Foux is a trailblazer,” says Allstar. “He started in 2015, and couldn’t be boxed in: not drill, or Afroswing, or trap. He was more outlandish with his approach to the music, using heavy melodic vibes with distorted beats. It created a new wave.”He points to Foux’s skittering, chiming 2015 track About It. “It was like nothing we’d seen before. At that stage it didn’t have its own genre – you just knew which artists fitted the sound as they didn’t fit into any other mould. But if you went up to these artists and said, ‘Are you underground?’ they’d probably say no.”View image in fullscreenPunk aesthetic … Lancey Foux.Photograph: Elissa SalasRaised in Stratford, London by Ugandan parents, Foux, who turned 30 this week, agrees. He has consistently worked with the kind of woozy Day-Glo rap beats used by US megastars such as Playboi Carti and Travis Scott, with injections of UK slang, rhythms and bass, making a druggy-sounding, nocturnal music at odds with much of UK rap’s social realism. In 2024 he started collaborating with a raft of new talent, on singles such as the 15m-streaming Black & Tan with YT, and the Conglomerate mixtape with Fimiguerrero and Len, which reached the UK Top 30. These projects signalled a shift away from the nihilism of drill to a weirder space, but as with most trailblazers, Foux is not keen on being boxed in by genre.“The term ‘underground’, it’s very restrictive!” Foux calls me, he says from LA, where he’s shooting videos for his forthcoming album. “EsDeeKid is one of the biggest UK artists, so why would you call him underground? This shit is big! YT, Fimi and EsDeeKid have bigger songs than other rappers in the UK. Not to say underground is a bad word – but this is our opportunity to name our sound, and I’m calling it the overground.”View image in fullscreenSpirit of defiance … Jim Legxacy.Photograph: Igoris TarranCrucially, as with mod, punk or Britpop, the scene top-loads on Britishness. The songs are full of British samples – everything from Bizarre Inc’s rave classic Playing with Knives on the track Ayia Napa by west Londoner Feng, to flashes of decades-old Dizzee Rascal vocals on the latest Ceebo record. Jim Legxacy’s latest mixtape is titled Black British Music (2025), and Afrosurrealist’s debut album is called Buy British. In a spirit of defiance against the far-right appropriation of the union jack, artists have been plastering British flags all over their artwork. “I think I would die if I had to leave this country,” rapper Llondon Actress croons on his biggest hit Country, its artwork fringed with more union jacks.Jim Legxacy: Black British Music review | Alexis Petridis’s album of the weekRead moreDirector Lauzza has a YouTube channel featuring music videos he has made for scene leaders Jim Legxacy, YT, Foux and others. He explains that the scene is trying to take control of the meaning of Britishness.“A lot of young people are not the most patriotic,” he says. “They’re not proud of the economic mess of a country that they’re living in. So to be able to reinvent the union jack to mean something new, creating our own Britain and our own culture that we can be proud of, that feels right.” But none of the rappers are using England’s St George’s flag. “English is more ethnicity, whereas British is more of a culture,” Lauzza says. “That’s why Jim [Legxacy] is able to use the flag and talk about being British – he’s representing something.”This played out in the recent video Lauzza and Jim made for the track ‘06 Wayne Rooney. Responding to Legxacy’s attempt to create a nostalgic indie-rock track ready for Match of the Day, Lauzza recreated the aesthetics of a mid-00s Fifa video game, complete with Jim in a pixelated Manchester United kit. It was a heady rush of UK nostalgia, and for the 24-year-old Lauzza, a response to the country’s current misery.“The news is just negative, negative, negative: it can be very draining for the average young person,” he says. “We’re all just reaching for the last time we remember being truly happy, when you could come home from school and slap on Fifa and nothing else mattered. These artists are the same age as a lot of these fans – and their music is about a lot of similar struggles.”Not everyone is as comfortable with the use of flag iconography. Ceebo has just released Blair Babies, his third mixtape in as many years, featuring three tracks produced by the ever-influential Legxacy. On tracks such as Jook, Ceebo grapples with growing up skint in Brixton over a beat that has a soft, magical glow, creating a curious tension between the sweetness of nostalgia and the reality of inner-city life. And as the title Blair Babies suggests, he is exploring Britain’s recent past with a critical eye.“I have a lot of conversations about Britishness,” he says. “A lot of us are children of immigrants. We’re not considered British, but we’re not exactly natives of our parents’ countries. So the idea of being Black British has become more visible in our generation’s minds; the exploration of ‘British’ as a term for children of countries that have been ravaged by British colonialism is the scene’s way of wrestling with an identity that hasn’t really been laid out for them.”Ceebo is ambivalent about the prevalence of the flag in the scene. “A lot of artists want to have their cake and eat it,” he says with a sigh. “But they’re not smart enough to walk the line between reclaiming something and just appropriating it. It’s essentially a symbol of violence.”View image in fullscreenWalking the line … Ceebo.Photograph: Patrick SearHe reflects on the fact that his music is now being listened to by white suburban kids around the country. “Whether or not people from the underground realise it, we are shaping the youth of this country’s thoughts and feelings towards Black Britishness. We have to approach it as a dialogue with the people who are consuming it, and this matters a lot more than hype moments.”But as that hype snowballs, and more and more rappers jump on the kind of distorted rap beats Lancey Foux popularised, on his new record Foux himself is taking a left turn into dance music. His argument for doing so sums up the spirit that has inspired this generation. “Whenever they start loving you too much for how you look and how you sound and how you dress, shake it off. Don’t get too comfortable in satisfaction. Do something new. It’s not as narrow as a style of rap or a style of music; it’s down to the alternative-ness of what you’re delivering.” At the beginning, he says, “No one, including myself, cared about being big – it was more punk.”Bait, ting, certi: how UK rap changed the language of the nationRead moreThis punk aesthetic is most visible now in the way the new generation have embraced live shows. As mainstream acts chase digital streaming and online connections, Foux has built a fanbase through an almost anachronistic route in the streaming age: the hard graft of constant touring.“The music that we make is live music,” he says. “Everyone in this space, your biggest flex is hitting the stage. Streams and all these things other rappers worry about have only become relevant recently. The real crown on the head is knowing you’ve dropped a song that is going to go crazy live. That’s how you get your rank.”I mention the sold-out EsDeeKid show to him, and he’s not surprised. “I know EsDeeKid wants to be a big touring artist – I can see it and feel it. Him, Fimi, YT, whoever: it’s a big shift happening, it’s great. We’re making superstars.”Century by EsDeeKid is out now on XV Records/Lizzy Records. Daytona by Lancey Foux is out now on RCA Records.

Actually, Tarantino mostly finished the business of re-integrating two volumes of Kill Bill into a single feature as early as 2006, just a couple of years after the release of Kill Bill: Vol 2. But while that version played at Cannes and had a few more recent runs at Tarantino-owned theaters in Los Angeles, it never reached home video (though some bootlegs attempted to recreate it) or a wide theatrical release. That’s all changed with this weekend’s debut of Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair, a four-and-a-half-hour version of the movie hitting over 1,000 screens across North America.Quentin Tarantino weighs in on one of cinema’s big questions: what is the best Tarantino movie?Read moreTarantino made long movies before and after Kill Bill; features that run over two and a half hours make up the vast majority of his filmography. But in the early 2000s, Kill Bill represented a major pivot for the film-maker, away from his then-signature crime dramas with healthy helpings of black comedy. Tarantino and his Pulp Fiction starUma Thurmancooked up the character of the Bride – “Q & U” are named as providers of the source material in the credits – as a pregnant ex-assassin who becomes the victim of a vicious wedding-eve attack from her ex-boss/lover (that would be Bill) and their lethal colleagues (those would be the other four on her “death list five”, a phrase whose rhythm recalls Fox Force Five, the fictional TV pilot Thurman’s character in Pulp Fiction once starred in). The Bride unexpectedly survives the shooting, goes into a coma, and wakes up years later desperate for revenge, forming the backbone of a movie that pays extensive tribute to the kung fu, exploitation and revenge movies of Tarantino’s youth – and his dreams, if the vividly colorful look of the film is any indication.When Kill Bill went over budget and started approaching the four-hour mark, Tarantino’s producer – since-disgraced and jailed sex criminal Harvey Weinstein – suggested splitting the movie into two parts, rather than either gambling on a four-hour movie or forcing the film-maker to cut his opus way down. So instead, the film was sliced down the middle. The gambit worked financially, to the tune of $330m worldwide between the two movies, and hardcore fans assuming a “full” version was probably just around the corner. It was not. But now it’s finally here, more than 20 years later.So what’s different in this supersized version that you can’t get from playing the two movies back-to-back at home? In several cases, it’s actually less a question of making additions than undoing them. To give the two-movie version a little more shape, a major revelation once intended for the movie’s final chapter was shifted to a cliffhanging tease at the end of volume one. Though The Whole Bloody Affair does throw to a 15-minute intermission after the events of volume one, it eliminates dialogue from Bill revealing that the Bride’s daughter is alive and well. In both versions, The Bride herself finds out about her daughter in the film’s final stretch; now the audience (or at least, the hypothetical audience who hasn’t seen the movie before) learns of the daughter’s existence alongside the heroine. Volume two also loses a brief black-and-white introduction delivered directly to the camera by Thurman; it’s the only noticeable change to the back half of the movie.Some first-film material, however, has been expanded, mostly to accommodate additional arterial spray. The animated chapter depicting the backstory of O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu in live-action form) has an additional action sequence depicting a young O-Ren battling with another killer. And the gorgeous House of Blue Leaves sequence, which has The Bride slicing her way through dozens of O-Ren’s henchmen in flesh and blood, has been slightly expanded and now proceeds in full color. The volume one version switched to black-and-white after a few minutes, and cut some of the gnarliest carnage, to avoid an NC-17 rating. The sequence was already magnificent, but it does gain even greater power with the full extent of Robert Richardson’s primary colors on display: the yellow of the Bride’s Bruce Lee-like tracksuit; the blue glow of overhead lights and the wintry night sky; and, of course, the bright red of all that blood.The single deleted scene from the volume two DVD – the only time we’d really see Bill in martial-arts action – hasn’t made it back into the longer cut. However, the release does feature a different, non-canonical bonus scene that exists apart from the feature. After the credits, viewers can watch an animated “lost” chapter of the story, deleted from an early draft well before anything was shot, where Yuki, the twin sister of schoolgirl-ish assassin Gogo, seeks revenge on the Bride. It was made for the video game Fortnite, and non-fans of the game will probably wish it hadn’t been. Seeing this inconsequential but elaborate action sequence done up as proper anime probably would have been a kick; as an uncanny bit of Fortnite-engine weirdness, complete with game-character cameos, it, well, captures a moment in time, let’s say. No movie fan is likely to find it essential. Some may not even find it watchable. At the showing I attended, it had the additional oddity of being a computer-animated Fortnite short projected as part of a 70mm celluloid print.View image in fullscreenUma Thurman and Lucy Liu.Photograph: Cinetext/Miramax/AllstarAn ill-fitting Fortnite chapter does, however, stay true to the digressive nature of Tarantino’s biggest, wildest movie. Watching a single 270-minute version really drives home the fact that in pure story terms, the “important” stuff that happens in Kill Bill could be pretty easily depicted in 95 minutes or less. By design, this is not one of Tarantino’s best screenplays. (I’m pretty sure that at one point, the Bride says “entropy” when she means “atrophy”.) Yet the writer-director was right to resist cutting it. Without the largely extraneous bits – O-Ren’s baroque origin; a long scene where the Bride meets a legendary sword-maker and engages in some shtick at his tiny restaurant; Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) reading poisonous snake facts she dutifully copied down from a website; Bill’s eventual monologue ruminating on Superman – the movie is about a woman having five different fights. With all of that material, it transcends its roots and becomes a brilliant cross between a cinematic DJ set, half a dozen different types of exploitation films and a sprawling novel.In fact, the movie works shockingly well as two discrete volumes, with tonal differences that apparently came naturally before the split was even conceived. You don’t really need to see The Whole Bloody Affair to truly appreciate Kill Bill – though, again, that House of Blue Leaves sequence only gets better and more colorful with the extra blood, and fans who live near any of the70mm engagementswill be understandably excited. Even without that lure, though, it’s a great opportunity to immerse yourself in Tarantino’s sensibility or, if that doesn’t appeal, a true powerhouse performance from Thurman. In the longer version, it’s even easier to appreciate how gracefully she moves from physical, technical demands to movie-star charm to raw emotionality as motherhood throws her off her axis and imbues her with an even greater sense of purpose. Some have found later-period Tarantino overly arch and referential, starting with this precise four-hour indulgence. Yet it’s hard not to take the movie at least somewhat seriously, even at its silliest, when the Bride is on-screen. More than any particular tinkering, it’s the fullness of Thurman’s performance that turns Kill Bill into a genuine epic.Explore more on these topicsQuentin TarantinoKill Bill: Volume 1Kill Bill: Volume 2Action and adventure filmsUma ThurmanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sharp business practices and evidence of its deleterious effect on the quality and variety of new music abound: the worst thing is that Pelly can’t really come up with a viable alternative in a world where convenience trumps all.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

But it’s elevated to unmissable status by Mossman’s writing, which is so sparkling, witty and shrewd that your personal feelings about her subjects are rendered irrelevant amid the cocktail of self-awareness, affection and sharp analysis she brings to every encounter. In a world of music books retelling tired legends, Men of a Certain Age offers that rare thing: an entirely original take on rock history.Only God Can Judge Me: The Many Lives of Tupac ShakurJeff Pearlman(HarperCollins)Some posthumous accounts of rapper Tupac Shakur’s life have tended towards the hagiographic: better known as a writer on sport than music, Jeff Pearlman has written an incisive biography that reveals someone infinitely more complicated and contradictory than either the “thug” he was wont to portray himself as, or the saintly figure of the 2003 documentary Tupac: Resurrection. It suggests the persona he projected was carefully constructed: the young Shakur was actually a sensitive, geeky ballet student, albeit one from a very turbulent background. But his aspirations to a career in hip-hop coincided with the dominance of gangsta rap and he altered his approach accordingly: the saga of the mask gradually eating the face makes for grimly compelling reading.View image in fullscreenThe Tremolo DiariesJustin Currie(Simon & Schuster)The Tremolo Diaries opens with Del Amitri’s frontman in a dark place: diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, his partner in a care home following a stroke, his band bottom of the bill on a tour of the US – a country they once looked set to break – alongside an artist whose music he loathes. What follows is an extraordinarily frank exploration of illness, depression and life in a band whose members know that, while hardly struggling, their commercial heyday has long passed. Currie is perceptive, funny, winningly cantankerous company, disinclined to pull punches or graft a happy-ever-after narrative on to his story; you don’t have to know a note of his music to find The Tremolo Diaries richly rewarding.Love and Fury: The Extraordinary Life, Death and Legacy of Joe MeekDarryl W Bullock(Omnibus)Darryl Bullock died at the end of last year: the book he had just completed underlines what an authoritative chronicler of pop’s LGBTQ+ history he was. His biography of groundbreaking producer Joe Meek returns him to the territory of 2021’s fascinating The Velvet Mafia: The Gay Men Who Ran the Swinging Sixties, in which Meek featured heavily. The tragic figure behind the Tornados’ transatlantic chart-topper Telstar warrants deeper exploration not merely because he was a sonic genius but because he was so profoundly singular: openly gay, mentally unstable, mixed up with the Krays, obsessed with the occult and the extraterrestrial. Love and Fury proves that exhaustive research doesn’t preclude page-turning drama.To browse all music books included in the Guardian and Observer’s best books of 2025 visitguardianbookshop.com.

It all makes for a smartly unexpected festive story. It’s 1999, ticking down to the millennium. At the Woolworths staff party in Oxford (paper hats, sensible shop-floor shoes), Zoya (Gurjot Dhaliwal) chirrups about the wonder of Woolies and her scathing colleague Iqra (Prabhleen Oberoi) scoffs that she has been radicalised. Both Pakistani-born – Iqra is a politics student, Zoya a young wife – they bop and plan their futures, until they are joined by Faiza (Hannah Khalique-Brown), a mysterious holiday temp who knows more about them than seems plausible.Iqra initially describes the newcomer as “BBCD” (“British-born confused desi”). “British Pakistanis are fascinating specimens,” she sighs. But who is Faiza? A management stooge or spy for Zoya’s in-laws? Or something far stranger? Even as the friends share secrets of the Pic ’n’ Mix, simple questions open up a chasm of anxiety – on the tight square stage, the space between the three actors is tense and watchful. Secrets and surprises start to spill like a scatter of toffees.View image in fullscreenSupernatural stylings … Gurjot Dhaliwal, Hannah Khalique-Brown and Prabhleen Oberoi.Photograph: Alex BrennerAs in his award-winningBrown Boys Swim, Khan upends the dreaming spires version of Oxford usually favoured in fiction.

Faiza has spent her whole life in Oxford, but, she says, “it never really felt like my city”.Sparkily performed and staged beneath a trio of bauble wreaths (design by Maariyah Sharjil), Adam Karim’s production swoops on the supernatural stylings: spooky lighting, woozy yule tunes, snowglobes that oddly lack snow.In Dickens, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come is the decisive figure in Scrooge’s transformation.

In Andrea Arnold’s 2011 adaptation of the novel,James Howson became the first black actor to play the role. Robbie said of Elordi: “I saw him play Heathcliff, and he is Heathcliff. I’d say, just wait. Trust me, you’ll be happy.”She added: “It’s a character that has this lineage of other great actors who’ve played him, from Laurence Olivier to Richard Burton and Ralph Fiennes to Tom Hardy. To be a part of that is special. He’s incredible and I believe in him so much. I honestly think he’s our generation’s Daniel Day-Lewis.”There has also been some disquiet over Robbie’s casting. In the novel, Cathy is described as dark-haired and is in her late teens; Robbie is in her mid-30s andthe early trailer releasesshow her with blond hair.The film’s casting director Kharmel Cochrane said earlier this year: “There was one Instagram comment that said the casting director should be shot. But just wait till you see it, and then you can decide whether you want to shoot me or not. But you really don’t need to be accurate. It’s just a book. That is not based on real life. It’s all art.”In the same Vogue interview Robbie outlined her interest in the character: “I both understood her and didn’t, in a way that drew me to her. It’s this puzzle you have to work out.”Fennell also defended her decision to cast Robbie in the role, saying: “Cathy is a star. She’s wilful, mean, a recreational sadist, a provocateur. She engages in cruelty in a way that is disturbing and fascinating. It was about finding someone who you would forgive in spite of yourself, someone who literally everyone in the world would understand why you love her.”She added: “It’s difficult to find that supersized star power. Margot comes with big dick energy. That’s what Cathy needs.”View image in fullscreen‘A big epic romance’ … Elordi and Robbie in Wuthering Heights.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyFennell has built her directing career on constructing outrageous, social media-friendly narratives with strongly provocative elements. While making her mark as an actor, notably as Camilla Shand in the TV series The Crown, Fennell moved into writing and showrunning on the TV series Killing Eve before making her film directing debut with Promising Young Woman, starring Carey Mulligan, for which Fennell won the best original screenplay Oscar. She followed this up with Saltburn, which attained notoriety for scenes in which Barry Keoghan’s character Oliver drinks bathwater containing semen and dances naked through the stately home of the title.Fennell appears to be employing similarly audience-baiting tactics in Wuthering Heights, withreports emerging from an early test screening in Augustthat the film was “aggressively provocative and tonally abrasive”, and includes a scene of a public hanging in which the “condemned man ejaculates mid-execution”.Robbie, who recently starred in and produced the blockbuster Barbie adaptation, also acts as a producer on Wuthering Heights, having been a producer on both of Fennell’s previous feature films. Robbie’s production company LuckyChap, which includes her husband, Tom Ackerley, among its principals, has emerged as an entertainment industry force, with production credits on I, Tonya, Birds of Prey and My Old Ass alongside Barbie and Fennell’s films.At the Brontë Women’s Writing festival last year, Fennell defended her approach to Wuthering Heights, saying that Brontë’s novel, originally published in 1847, meant a huge amount to her: “I’ve been obsessed. I’ve been driven mad by this book. I know that if somebody else made it, I’d be furious. It’s very personal material for everyone. It’s very illicit. The way we relate to the characters is very private.”View image in fullscreen‘Epic romances and period pieces aren’t often made by women’ … Wuthering Heights.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyShe added: “[It is] an act of extreme masochism to try and make a film of something that means this much to you. There’s an enormous amount of sado-masochism in this book. There’s a reason people were deeply shocked by it.”Of the film’s erotic content, Robbie told Vogue: “Everyone’s expecting this to be very, very raunchy. I think people will be surprised. Not to say there aren’t sexual elements and that it’s not provocative – it definitely is provocative – but it’s more romantic than provocative. This is a big epic romance.”She and Fennell discussed this on the set: “What reads to us as hot or exciting or sexy? And it’s not just a sex position or someone taking their shirt off.” A scene in which Elordi’s Heathcliff shelters Cathy from the rain “almost made me weak at the knees”, Robbie said, adding: “It was the little things that we loved as two women in our 30s, and this movie is primarily for people in our demographic. These epic romances and period pieces aren’t often made by women.”Robbie said that Fennell’s ambition was to make “this generation’s Titanic” and Fennell told her: “I went to the cinema to watch Romeo & Juliet eight times and I was on the ground crying when I wasn’t allowed to go back for a ninth. I want it to be that.”Explore more on these topicsFilmMargot RobbieJacob ElordiEmerald FennellWuthering HeightsFilm adaptationsEmily BrontënewsShareReuse this content"

Local customs officials filed a criminal accusation with the regional prosecutor’s office on Thursday to begin formal charging proceedings against Harris.An official with a police station in Tomigusuku, a city in southern Okinawa, confirmed that Harris remains in custody. The official declined to comment on whether Harris has admitted to the allegations.Harris’s representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment, and it was unclear whether he has retained legal representation in Japan.Harris had arrived in Okinawa for sightseeing purposes, travelling from Britain via Taiwan, where he had a flight layover, the customs spokesperson said. Okinawa is a popular resort destination about 1,500km (932 miles) south-west of Tokyo, known for its beaches and USmilitary bases.Japan maintains strict drug laws with severe penalties for possession and smuggling offences. The country has some of the toughest narcotics regulations among developed nations, with even small amounts of illegal substances resulting in criminal prosecution. Punishments, however, are not as harsh as in other Asian countries such asChinaandSingapore, where drug offenders can face the death penalty.Foreigners arrested in recent years in Japan for suspected drug offences include former Australianrugby league playerBlake Ferguson in December 2021. In 1980, former Beatle Paul McCartney was arrested after arriving in Tokyo with a bag of marijuana and was banned from entering Japan for years.Harris is also known for his acting role in Emily in Paris and for producing the HBO drama series Euphoria.Explore more on these topicsJeremy O HarrisJapanDrugsUS televisionBroadwayUS theaterTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

In September it was announced the pair would be teaming up again for a belated sequel to that film, in which Caine plays a priest who assists Diesel’s immortal warrior to stop a plague ravaging the planet.Caine, 92, first retired in 2009, after gang crime drama Harry Brown and then again, 24 films later, in 2021, after starring as novelist in Best Sellers. He returned for little-seen Czech historical drama Medieval in 2022 and, the following year, starred in The Great Escaper as a D-day veteran who travels to Normandy solo from his care home for the 70th anniversary.Caine gave mixed messages about his retirement while promoting that film, telling BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I’ve figured, I’ve had a picture where I’ve played the lead and had incredible reviews. The only parts I’m likely to get now are old men, 90-year-old men, maybe 85. And I thought, ‘Well, I might as well leave with all this – I’ve got wonderful reviews. What have I got to do to beat this?’”View image in fullscreenMichael Caine and John Standing photographed in 2023.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianSpeaking to the Guardian to promote that film, however, Caine indicated some appetite to continue working, saying that the following year, he would be shooting a new movie in which he played Charles Darwin. “And that’ll be it. I won’t do another one after.”When questioned whether he was certain, Caine said: “No! But the point is,canyou do it? Can you remember all the lines? I’ve got used to not working and staying in bed till 11am and staying out late at night. I love it.”Anthony Hopkins has since been announced as the star of the Darwin film, which will begin shooting next year.In Jeddah, Saudi Arabia,Caine was joined on stage by his three grandchildren, Taylor, Miles and Allegra, while his wife, Shakira, and two daughters, Dominique and Natasha, watched from the stalls.‘I’m 90. I worry if I’m gonna make it to lunch’: Michael Caine and John Standing on wives, war and feeling like the QueenRead more“My name is Michael Caine,” the actor said, to considerable applause as he was handed the microphone. “It’s not my real name but it’s a realistic name. It’s the one that made all the money. I was born a cockney in London, which is very poor working class, and I grew up to be what I am which is, well, I am not multiple rich, but I’ve got enough money for an evening out, even an evening in.”Caine, who has been nominated for six Academy Awards, and won two, for Hannah and Her Sisters (1986) and The Cider House Rules (1999) added: “I’m here to get an award, which doesn’t surprise me. I won two Oscars.”He continued: “I’ve been married for 52 years. I have loads of photographs but none are of any of the movies I am in, it’s just family, because that’s my life.”“I have a fabulous family that I adore beyond belief. I’ve had a fairly fabulous movie family, some who’ve let me down, and I love them beyond belief, including the failures.”“But one of the biggest lucky things is tonight to turn up here. I’ll tell you why, because I had never been here. I’ve seen it on the television, but I thought I’d never win with anything there. And I have won something, so I’m happy, and you’ve surprised me.“I want to thank you for the surprise, because in show business, you never get many surprises, but you get a couple of shocks. So thank you.”Caine published his first novel, a thriller called Deadly Game, in 2023, and is believed to be working on a follow-up. His latest memoir, Don’t Look Back, You’ll Trip Over: My Guide to Life, was published in 2024.Explore more on these topicsFilmMichael CainenewsShareReuse this content"

The overall bill is estimated to be £451m.A mammoth task awaits her. During a behind-the-scenes look the Guardian is shown the inner workings, including the central services plant room: a maze of concrete corridors lined by green pipework that is a third of the size of Wembley stadium.Inside, five tanks, including one that can hold 250,000 litres – that once provided hot water for heating – sit dormant and need to be replaced. The issue is that the Barbican was built around them, meaning they need to be chopped up and removed.View image in fullscreenThe drab carpets and confusing signage will be replaced.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianThe task is something that Richard McQuilliam, the head of engineering, calls “a messy, risky job”, which could work as a description of the whole project. The Barbican was divisive when it opened (described by the Guardian as “the world’s most bewildering arts centre”) but it is celebrated by many today as an iconic part of London’s skyline and creative life.Opened in 1982, the Barbican arts centre is a unique cultural institution. Built in the middle of the city of London on a former bomb site, the centre’s cultural offering was primarily dreamed up as entertainment forthe 4,000 residents of the flatsthat tower above it. Today, more than 1.5 million people walk through its doors every year, making it one of themost popular cultural attractionsin the UK.Part of the challenge is its age – or lack of. Compared with the Young V&A, which has a building that dates back to the 1870s and has already been through several retrofits, it is a very young building. The Barbican has never been given a major facelift.“We have these extraordinary civic spaces in the heart of the Square Mile,” says Simpson. “But how do you make them usable for everybody? How do you make them fully permissive, fully open, fully inclusive?”View image in fullscreenRichard McQuilliam, the Barbican’s head of engineering, says replacing central heating tanks is a ‘messy, risky job’.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianComprising a theatre, concert space, art gallery and conservatory, the Barbican has been celebrated as a well-executed vision of mid-century communal living. But it is severely lacking by modern design standards.The conservatory is inaccessible to wheelchair users and is only opened to the public for a few hours over the weekend; its lakeside area – replete with leaky tiles – looks worn out; and its foyers, which should be a welcoming area that give visitors pertinent information, are disorientating spaces.“People coming in and out of the main lakeside doors often miss the lifts,” says Jaymi Sudra, a partner atthe Turner prize-winning architecture collective Assemble, who is part of the design team overhauling the wayfinding at the institution. “They completely walk past them.” New lightbulbs will brighten the foyer spaces, and the notoriously grotty carpets will be torn out and replaced.It is not only the tiles that are porous at the Barbican; Sudra says there are about 40 different entrances to the building. “Because there are so many points of entry it adds to this sense of people being slightly disoriented, not really having a clear idea of what level they’ve actually entered on to,” she says.The history of the arts centre explains some of the confusion. It had to be constructed around other elements, such as the lake and primarily the flats, meaning there is little consistency in the design and the entrances are not where you would expect to find them.View image in fullscreenPhilippa Simpson, who is leading the renewal project, shows Lanre Bakare the conservatory, which is currently only open to the public for a few hours at the weekend and is inaccessible by wheelchair.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianThe Silk Street entrance, which for many is the “front” of the building, is actually the back; while the huge doors that face the lakeside are technicallythe front entrance. Walkways loom over spaces. There are secret corridors for residents. Even for seasoned visitors, there is little rhyme or reason.The Barbican’s labyrinthine layout has caught out many visitors over the years. Stanley Tucci and David Dimbleby got lost, while the explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes once clambered over a wall to get in. Brian Eno was found wandering on the fourth floor trying to find the Fountain Room, which is on the ground floor. Fiona Shaw hated performing in the building and complained of actors being “lost on the staircases and the inhospitable corridors”.One of Sudra’s biggest jobs is creating a new signage scheme to replace the four in use now. They often clash and accessibility groups say they are hard for people to follow. Now all but the original (and listed) Ken Briggs signs are being removed.The organisation has historically made hay with the difficulty visitors have when trying to find it. Posters printed shortly after it opened feature the film critic Barry Norman holding a map next to a confused looking police officer with a caption: “If Barry Norman can find the new Barbican Centre before it opens in March he’ll review the season of classic English films”.At one point the shop sold a T-shirt that read: “I found the Barbican Centre.” Simpson hopes that when construction starts in 2027, a new – more accessible – era begins.Explore more on these topicsBarbicanLondonMuseumsHeritagenewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a role right in the centre of Clooney’s comfort zone, and he inhabits it perfectly; imagine the heightened knowingness of Hail, Caesar! twinned with the easy charm of his Nespresso adverts. Plus, it helps that he’s backed by a couple of Baumbach all-timers in Adam Sandler and Laura Dern.

Her self-titled 2012 debut was produced by Tame Impala’s Kevin Parker. On second album Bon Voyage (2018) she teamed up with Swedish psychedelic rock band Dungen, whose guitarist Reine Fiske popped up again on 2022’s Emotional Eternal and now features on Unclouded. Prochet’s fourth album is produced and partly co-written by composer Sven Wunder, and its dizzying array of contributors also includes Josefin Runsteen (opulent strings) and DJ Shadow collaborator Malcolm Catto (percussive fizz).View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Unclouded.Photograph: Domino Recording Company/PAStill, somehow Prochet retains her own singular vision. Borrowing a title from a quote by Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki – “You must see with eyes unclouded by hate. See the good in that which is evil, and the evil in that which is good” – Unclouded takes her airy vocals and baroque dreampop into brighter terrain. Some tracks have a 90s vibe, reminiscent of Saint Etienne or Lush. Others have a feel that can only be accurately described in horticultural terms: the blooming strings of the really lovely Broken Roses, or the sprinkles of xylophones that make Burning Man sound like, well, a Japanese garden.The balmy reverie is only briefly disrupted by Into Shadows’ brisker pace and mellifluous guitar runs, while Memory’s Underground brings another gentle tempo shift and Beatles-y strings. Unclouded is short on genuinely standout tracks, but it’s a becalming place to visit.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

A veteran explorer of the season (in 2020’s sparkling Winter Rituals EP with cellist Kate Ellis, and 2022’s starker New Christmas Rituals, with amplified fiddle-playing from André Bosman), Laura Cannell sets out on her best and darkest journey yet here, exploring the time of year when, as she writes on the liner notes, “joy and heartache try to exist together”.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Laura Cannell’s Brightly Shone the MoonNamed after the line in Good King Wenceslas before the cruel frosts arrive, Brightly Shone the Moon begins at the organ – a nod to Cannell’s childhood Christmases in the Methodist chapels and churches of Norfolk. Cannell’s fiddle then quivers around the 16th-century folk melody of O Christmas Tree/O Tannenbaum, as if the carol is swirling in a snowglobe, trying to settle in memory. All Ye Faithful follows, full of murky repetitions of the pre-chorus passages, where choirs usually sing “come let us adore him”. But here, love feels stuck, rooting around like an animal in the ground, a sonic reminder of how smothering and strenuous the winter can be for many.Beauty does appear elsewhere. The high melodies of Lost in a Merry Christmas seem to flurry around each other prettily in the air, then melt together. Bleak Midwinter has an urgent, icy rush to it, replacing melancholy with a frisky kind of hope. The apocalyptically titled Angels Falling from the Realms is the warmest of the lot, full of flickers of long-forgotten hymns magically appearing and disappearing. This is an album not for the party or the tree decorations, but one that carries you, hauntingly, through the passing of time, slips of ancient songs lighting the way like Christingles.Also out this monthAnna Pidgorna’s Invented Folksongs (Redshift) is the fascinating result of the Ukrainian-Canadian singer travelling to Ukraine to study with traditional music practitioners, then adopting folk idioms into her freewheeling, avant garde style. The album ranges from fabulous, feral power on tracks such as Drown in the Depth to urgent longing in What Else Can I Give Him?Released in time for Hanukkah,Michael WinogradPlays Tanz! (Borscht Beat) is a spirited live performance by virtuoso clarinettist Winograd of the long-celebrated 1955 klezmer album by Dave Tarras and the Musiker Brothers, which fused traditionally Ashkenazi Jewish instrumental music with jazz.Winter Wonderband’s Joy Illimited (self-released) brings together folk musicians Jennifer Crook, Maclaine Colston, Saul Rose and Beth Porter in the making of a mixed grab-bag of festive tunes. The best are takes on Shepherds Are the Cleverest Lads, learned from the Watersons, and Boo Hewerdine’s New Year’s Eve.Explore more on these topicsFolk musicFolk album of the monthreviewsShareReuse this content"

Yet the band had actually been plugging away for seven years before their 2023 breakthrough. Amos’s solo project This Is Lorelei has been going even longer, only gaining proper traction with last year’s belated debut album Box for Buddy, Box for Star.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Holo BoyNow Amos is capitalising on this recent momentum with another release, this time a compilation of re-recorded songs dredged from his extensive Bandcamp back catalogue. Unlike his WFYE output, these tracks are mainly gentle folk-rock numbers that deal in honeyed melancholy. They tend to be brief and narratively vague, glancing at regret, disappointment and darkness (“you don’t want to know what my dreams are about,” he claims on But You Just Woke Me Up). His most obvious stylistic counterpart is indie-rocker Alex G, but while Amos can’t rival him for lyrical punch, he can match his knack for pleasingly diverting detail: see Name the Band’s chunky pop-punk bassline or the bright guitar twang on Dreams Away.This Is Lorelei isn’t quite as compelling as Amos’s other project (whose spirit is detectable on outlier Mouth Man, an eclectic rush of dead-eyed sprechgesang and awkward synth blasts over a four-on-the-floor beat), but this collection of sweet-sad acoustic fare is certainly enjoyable enough to justify its opportunistic repackaging.Explore more on these topicsIndiealbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Smith’s name lives on in the newsagent chain, while English National Opera’s laugh-out-loud staging looks elsewhere for its targets in an energetic show that takes the idea of the running gag to a whole new level.Rooted in its original period,Cal McCrystal’s 2021 stagingis a homage to the slyly transgressive world of the Victorian music hall which, like love in Gilbert’s libretto, really did “level all ranks”. With additional material by McCrystal and Toby Davies, it also displays a good-natured affection for 1970s British comedy and the Carry On films in particular.A prologue, delivered with deft comic timing by John Savournin, introduces an idea new to this revival. A reciprocal arts swap scheme, it seems, has shipped out an ENO chorus member to work on a travelogue with Michael Portillo, while Mel Giedroyc of Bake Off fame has been drafted in to take her place. In true Eric and Ernie fashion, she finds herself taking on two roles in a show she has barely rehearsed to frequently hilarious effect.View image in fullscreenFrequently hilarious … Mel Giedroyc, centre, as Aunt Melanie in HMS Pinafore at English National Opera.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe revolving ship and vibrant costumes – smartly designed by Takis, slickly lit by Tim Mitchell – could have emerged from a D’Oyly Carte time capsule. What brings it up to date is McCrystal’s blizzard of physical comedy and a hard-working cast prepared to follow where he leads. There’s a host of double entendres, from poop decks and bulwarks to mermaid’s love pockets, breaststroke and stiff ones. At one point, with a spot-on Charles Hawtrey impression, a bespectacled sailor emerges from below deck to announce he’s just been finishing off Three Men in a Boat. Not every joke lands perfectly, but the hit rate is impressively high.It’s a strong cast. Neal Davies’ impeccably sung Sir Joseph is a louche soak who struggles to pronounce his r’s (cue jokes about his exalted “rank”). Savournin’s amiable Capt Corcoran pals up nicely with Rhonda Browne’s matronly Buttercup. Henna Mun’s pert, brightly sung Josephine is the perfect foil for Thomas Atkins’ muscular, floppy haired Ralph, with Trevor Eliot Bowes as a deliciously hammy Dick Deadeye (cue an avalanche of dick jokes). The tireless Giedroyc is an engagingly anarchic presence throughout.Matthew Kofi Waldren serves up the score with plenty of punch and the ENO chorus is on outstanding form, taking the considerable challenges thrown at them by Lizzi Gee’s gleeful choreography in their stride. When it’s firing on all cylinders, as in the barnstorming company hornpipe, this gloriously daffy Pinafore is a real crowd-pleaser.AtLondon Coliseumuntil 7 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicEnglish National Opera (ENO)reviewsShareReuse this content"

The simple, elegant exterior that reflects the surrounding scenery and evokes traditional Sami dwellings is matched by an interior that has the most comfortable pews I have ever sat on. The stunning glass mosaic titled the Return of Christ at one end may not be to everyone’s taste, but to me had power and majesty. Exiting this magnificent building after an organ recital to be met by the northern lights flickering overhead was awe-inspiring.Bruce HortonViews over Nice from Matisse’s graveView image in fullscreenMonastère Notre Dame de Cimiez.Photograph: E Fesenko/AlamyI never understood what people get out of churches. TheMonastère Notre Dame de Cimiezis different. The flower and herb filled gardens offer a stunning view over Nice, and the cemetery contains Matisse’s grave, but it is the small chapel that truly captures what a church should be. Although it would never compare with grander establishments, that is the point. It has unostentatiously soaked up belief for centuries. Sitting there I couldn’t quantify the feeling I had. Peace? Tranquillity? Serenity? Yes, all of that, but something more, something that finally made me understand what people get out of churches.Robert StroudProfileReaders' tips: send a tip for a chance to win a £200 voucher for a Coolstays breakShowGuardian Travel readers' tipsEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

However, the highlight of the complex is the Duomo Vecchio, completed in the 12th century. A romanesque rotunda with an underground crypt, the cathedral is brimming with history and charm. Brescia’s cathedrals serve as a microcosm of Italy’s architectural evolution.Daniel BakerGlass and concrete masterpiece in GermanyView image in fullscreenMaria, Königin des Friedens (also known as Mariendom) was built in the 1960s.Photograph: Joern Sackermann/AlamyIn the Ruhr, south of Essen, is the town of Neviges in which stands one of the most breathtaking and individual cathedrals in the world. Maria, Königin des Friedens (Mary, Queen of Peace) is a modernist masterpiece built between 1966 and 1968 at the behest of Archbishop Frings of Cologne, a brave opponent of the Nazis during the second world war. Asymmetric galleries of concrete and stunning stained glass create a lofty space of light and warmth that belies any attempt to pigeonhole this design as “brutalist”. And if that’s not enough for a visit to this tourist-free location, then just down the road is the 8-mile Wuppertaler Schwebebahn – an amazing suspension railway.RichardViews of the Swiss Alps from LausanneView image in fullscreenLausanne Cathedral’s spectacular setting.Photograph: Guven Ozdemir/Getty ImagesLausanne Cathedral sits up high, with views stretching from the picturesque old town all the way down to the lake and the towering Alps in the distance. The cathedral is free, but for a small fee you can also climb the bell tower. As well as its impressive gothic architecture and breathtaking city views, the cathedral, which dates back to the 12th century, hosts a varied programme of free performances, exhibits and events as a popular venue in Switzerland’s most vibrant and artistic city.AmyOrkney shrine built by Italian prisoners of warView image in fullscreenThe Italian Chapel was built from Nissen huts in the mid-1940s.Photograph: Kevin Elsby/AlamyEach time I visit theItalian Chapelin Orkney, I feel humbled by the craftsmanship and faith of the Italian prisoners of war who built it. After a request from the camp priest, artist Domenico Chiocchetti and his fellow prisoners were allowed to use two Nissen huts joined together to provide a chapel. Using scraps of metal, wood, paint and anything else they could find, they created a beautiful chapel full of love and peace during a time of war – an inspiring place to visit 80 years later.Carol Haydenskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Set on a hill high above the River Aveyron, this huge fortress-like medieval marvel has endured centuries of construction, plague and the hundred years war. The interior is a gasp-inducing chamber of vaulted ceilings and towering pillars, all framing the colossal organ that greets you on entry. The pews and misericords are intricately carved and polished with time. It’s a bewildering feat of engineering that can only be enjoyed if you manage to draw your gaze from the hypnotic leer of the hundreds of writhing gargoyles that seem to burst out of the stonework outside. They don’t look carved, they look fossilised, long dead guardians of this beautiful basilica.Gareth RobertsMysterious beauty in a field in OxfordshireView image in fullscreenElements of St Oswald’s go back to Saxon and Roman times.Photograph: Wirestock /AlamyAlthough it’s easy enough to find, St Oswald’s in Widford sits in a remote field and the only access to it is via a rough footpath. Widford itself is a hamlet with only a few houses. Park on a nearby grass verge, walk over the cattle grid and head for what looks in the distance more like a barn than a church. The building is clearly mostly from the 13th century, but once you’re inside parts of an earlier church (Saxon or early Norman) become visible. Excavations of the site revealed Roman floor mosaics and partially uncovered wall paintings from the 14th century. Box pews from the 1700s are still in place. Mysterious, beautiful and powerful.Michael HStunning paint job, BulgariaView image in fullscreenThe Church of the Nativity, Arbanasi.Photograph: Peter Ptschelinzew/AlamyThe village of Arbanasi near Veliko Tarnovo surprised us with one of the most magnificent churches we had ever seen. From the outside, bar the braces that now protect it from earthquakes, theChurch of the Nativityis rather unassuming, possibly to not raise suspicions with the Ottomans then ruling. But the inside more than makes up for it. Every conceivable surface is painted with Orthodox icons and biblical scenes. It is truly overwhelming.MarcusWinning tip: beautiful windows in KentView image in fullscreenStained glass window by Marc Chagall at All Saints Church, Tudeley, Kent.Photograph: Pjr Windows/AlamyA couple of years ago, I went to All Saints Church in Tudeley, near Tonbridge in Kent. It’s a tiny church founded in the 12th century and restored over time. The church itself is quite ordinary, but all thewindows are by the brilliant French and Russian artist Marc Chagall. In 1963, a local couple commissioned Chagall to design a stained glass window for the church inmemory of their daughter. The artist liked the church so much he also designed the other 11 windows, in collaboration with glass-worker Charles Marq in Reims. The final windows were installed in 1985 shortly before Chagall’s death. The colours – a whole spectrum of blues – are magnificent. Being surrounded by all the blues in a peaceful place was blissful.

I am open to the lively and new-fangled too, but I must admit some of the combinations that came in sounded unhinged and were more novelty than novel. I tasted them so you don’t have to. You’re welcome.The best supermarket Christmas crispsBest overall:Waitrose turkey and stuffing tortilla chipsView image in fullscreen£1.60 for 200g at Waitrose (80p/100g)★★★★☆These tortilla chips are toasty and meaty without being heavy. They are nostalgic of the warm plate of a family roast dinner drizzled with a deeply savoury gravy.Best bargain:Morrisons the Best pigs in blanket crispsView image in fullscreen£1 for 125g at Morrisons (80p/100g)★★★★☆These are quite clever: they somehow capture the irresistible flavour of singed, crisp bacon and the extra dark bits of sausage skin. They are thick, deeply ridged and addictive – best eaten with a Christmas hangover.And the rest …Co-op Irresistible hand-cooked duck and clementine crispsView image in fullscreen£1.80 for 150g at Co-op (£1.20/100g)★★★☆☆I wouldn’t say I think duck when I eat these, but there is a background citrus note that’s surprisingly pleasant.

I probably wouldn’t go out of my way to buy them.M&S butter-basted roast turkey crispsView image in fullscreen£1.80 for 150g at Ocado (£1.20/100g)★★★☆☆Good crunch, a nice herbal flavour reminiscent of a sage and onion stuffing, but heavily salted.

These did not. They start off tasting of sour cream and chive and end on an over-sweet note (not a whiff of camembert here). They get one star as I am a fan of ridged crisps and they were quite crunchy.Lidl lobster cocktail crispsView image in fullscreen£1.15 for 150g at Lidl (77p/100g), in store only★☆☆☆☆Nothing luxe about these – I was hoping they might at best taste like a good prawn cocktail flavour, but actually they taste like sucking on a packet of tomato ketchup: sour and unpleasant.Tesco Finest roast turkey and herb butter flavour crispsView image in fullscreen£1.50 for 150g at Tesco (£1/100g)★☆☆☆☆The claim on the front of this packet is that these limited-edition crisps are “made with British turkey”, but the only poultry the packet has seen is the turkey powder listed second from last on the ingredients.

However, a good drinks recipe that you can prep in advance is a lovely thing to dazzle your friends with and to gift over Christmas. With or without alcohol, this pair look good and taste delicious, and should help everyone ease into the December festivities.Fire cider (for a cranberry fire cider fizz)This makes a delicious base to which you can add soda, juice, tonic or any other mixer for a thirst-quenching and delicious alternative to an alcoholic drink in the evening.Prep15 minInfuse1 week+Makes500ml bottleFor the fire cider2 jalapeños, finely sliced seeds and all1 large thumb of ginger, peeled and finely sliced2 branches fresh rosemary1 cinnamon stick3 heaped tbsp honey2 garlic cloves,peeled1 thumb turmeric, peeled and finely sliced (optional)350ml apple cider vinegarFor the cranberry fizz (serves 1)30ml fire cider75ml cranberry juice1 wedge of orangeSparkling water,to topMix all the ingredients for the fire cider in a sterilised 500ml jar, then put in the fridge for at least week, and preferably three to extract the most goodness from the ingredients.Strain the liquid, discard the solids, then transfer the liquid to a sterilised 500ml bottle or jar and put in the fridge, where it will sit happily for at least three months.To serve, either top with sparkling water or make a cranberry fizz by pouring 30ml fire cider and 75ml cranberry juice into a highball glass. Fill the glass with ice, push in the orange wedge and top with sparkling water.Spiced syrup (for a spiced mezcal negroni)The spiced syrup adds a lovely aromatic lilt to a classic negroni, although I confess I always replace gin with the far less melancholic mezcal these days. It’s also wonderful with prunes, particularly if you add a decent slug of oloroso.Prep5 minCook10 minInfuse30 minMakes500ml bottleFor the spiced syrup200g demerara sugar300ml water1smallcinnamon stick3 clovesZest of 2 orangesFor the spiced mezcal negroni (serves 1)25ml Campari25ml red vermouth25ml mezcal10ml spiced syrupA couple of large ice cubesFlamed orangepeel,to garnish (optional)To make the spiced syrup, put the sugar and 300ml water in a small saucepan with the cinnamon stick and cloves. Add the orange zest and simmer until the sugar has dissolved. Turn off the heat and leave to infuse for 30 minutes. Transfer to a 500ml sterilised jar – the syrup will now keep for weeks in the fridge.To make the negroni, measure out the booze and syrup, and stir over ice.

Soft, chewy, marshmallow-coated Rice Krispies are studded with pistachios and cranberries, chocolate and ginger, or peppermint candy cane; they’re as fun to make as they are to eat, and they make a perfect little gift. To add a ribbon for hanging, cut small lengths of ribbon, then loop and knot the ends. Push the knotted end gently into the top of each ball while it’s still pliable, then reshape around it, so it holds the knot securely as it sets. Alternatively, wrap each bauble in cellophane, then gather at the top and tie with a ribbon, leaving a long loop for hanging.Edible Rice Krispie baublesPrep10 minCook30 min+Makes10 x 40g ballsFor the pistachio and cranberry baubles50g unsalted butter, cut into 4 or 5 pieces, plus extra for greasing150g mini marshmallowsFinely grated zest of 1 orange½ tsp vanilla extract¼ tsp flaky sea salt90g Rice Krispies70g dried cranberries60g shelled pistachios, plus 50g extra, roughly chopped, for sprinkling30g desiccated coconut80g white chocolate, meltedDeep green or gold ribbon, for tyingFor the chocolate, orange and ginger baubles50g unsalted butter140g mini marshmallows1tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder60g dark chocolate, chopped, plus 100g extra, melted, for dippingFinely grated zest of 1 orange½ tsp vanilla extract¼ tsp flaky sea salt1 tsp ground cinnamon½ tsp ground ginger100g Rice Krispies50g candied ginger, roughly choppedEdible gold dustCopper or rich-red ribbon,for tyingFor the peppermint candy cane baubles50g butter150g mini marshmallows, plus 50g extra to fold in1 pinch fine sea salt1¼ tsp good-quality peppermint extract100g Rice Krispies80g white chocolate, melted50g candy canes, crushed with a rolling pinRed and white stripe or silver ribbon,for tyingFor the pistachio and cranberry baubles, line a large oven tray with baking paper. In a wide, heavy-based saucepan, melt the butter over a low heat, then add the marshmallows and stir gently until smooth. Add the orange zest, vanilla and flaky salt, then, working quickly, fold in the Rice Krispies until evenly coated. Mix in the cranberries and 60g pistachios until evenly distributed, then leave to sit for five to 10 minutes, until cool enough to handle, but still pliable.Lightly oil or butter your hands, then scoop up small handfuls of the mix roughly the size of a mandarin (about 40g each) and drop them on to the lined tray – don’t shape them yet. Once the mixture has firmed slightly, press and roll into balls. (If adding a ribbon, do so now.) Put the coconut in a small bowl and roll each “bauble” in it to cover lightly, then return to the tray. Drizzle or pipe with melted white chocolate and, while still hot, scatter with the chopped pistachios.For the chocolate, orange and ginger baubles, follow the method above, adding the cocoa and chopped chocolate at the same time as the marshmallows. When the chocolate and marshmallows have melted, add the orange zest, vanilla, sea salt, cinnamon and ginger, then fold in the Rice Krispies and candied ginger. Shape them into roughly 40g balls as outlined above. Half-dip each bauble in the melted chocolate and sprinkle with edible gold dust.For the peppermint candy cane baubles,follow the method for the base recipe above, substituting the flaky sea salt for fine salt and the vanilla for peppermint extract. After the five- to 10-minute cooling period (and before scooping up handfuls of the mixture), fold through the 50g extra mini marshmallows. Shape them into slightly smaller (30g) balls, then drizzle or pipe with melted white chocolate and sprinkle with the crushed candy canes.Explore more on these topicsChristmas food and drinkThe sweet spotChristmas food giftsFoodChristmasSnacksCereals and grainsChocolaterecipesShareReuse this content"
