It instantly causedan uproar online– most notably among Carpenter’s young fans, who weren’t on Tumblr in 2015, or weren’t aware of the way the Sun newspaper wrote about Madonna every day of the 1990s and 2000s, and therefore didn’t realise that discourse around whether pop stars should or shouldn’t be allowed to sexualise themselves is older than pop music itself, and almost always inane.Anyone hitting play on Man’s Best Friend in search of another barrel-full of ragebait might be alarmed, not because it is particularly provocative, but because it is strangely old-fashioned. Carpenter is fond of blue turns of phrase (“Gave me his whole heart and I gave him head”), and the wordiness of her lyrics is indicative of someone who grew up in an era of constant stimulus. But Man’s Best Friend makes it clear that she regards pop music as a craft as much as it is an art.View image in fullscreenDogged by uproar… the cover art for Man’s Best Friend.Few A-list albums released in recent years are as tightly stitched and locked-in as this one; played almost entirely with live instruments and packed with so many hooks that it feels as if it might burst at the seams, it seems a true creative arrival for Carpenter. The most significant provocation here may be a newly minted star, beloved by gen Z, going against industry orthodoxy and packing an album with unusual instruments, including clavinet, sitar and agogo, and making distinct allusions to Abba and Fleetwood Mac’s Tusk.To date, Carpenter has been known for hits such as Nonsense and Espresso, which largely succeeded off the back of solid hooks and whip-smart wordplay. Man’s Best Friend feels like a rejoinder to anyone who suggested Espresso was simplistic froth: these songs are disarmingly complex, almost weaselly in their ability to make intricate, unconventional structure sound effortless. Lead single Manchild is the kind of pop song that super-producer Max Martin might call “incorrect”: its second verse has a completely different melody than the first, which is different again from the bridge; the whole thing gallops along to a rumbling, country-fried groove and all the while Carpenter is rhyming things like “hard to get” and “incompetent” and trilling her way through the phrase “fuck my liiiiiiiife!”Carpenter’s music has always been smarter than she gets credit for, but Manchild is astounding in its construction and stickiness. It’s also a song that requires active listening. The first few times I heard it, I thought it was a dog’s breakfast, simply because it is so busy; it really only clicked for me after a few listens, when I had enough time to process all the seemingly counterintuitive moving parts. The same goes for My Man on Willpower, a lush Eurodisco song that pairs lyrics about sexual frustration and rejection with Boney M-esque schmaltz, and House Tour, which takes the quotidian brilliance of Diana Ross’s It’s My House to its natural extreme with the lyric “The couch is really comfy, comfy / Got some Chips Ahoy if you’re hungry?”Although there are sonic allusions to Abba across Man’s Best Friend, Carpenter and her collaborators –Jack Antonoff, Amy Allen and John Ryan – seem to have taken a kind of metaphysical lesson from the Swedes: even bubbly, daytime radio-friendly songs deserve to be treated with care and attention to detail. Carpenter’s main lyrical concern on this record is right there in the title – men treat the women they date like dogs – and she treats it with a lightheartedness that matches her tongue-in-cheek, Betty Boop-esque image. But these songs are expansive and durable in their execution: Antonoff drafted the members of his band Bleachers, in-demand session musicians in their own right, to play across these songs, and their presence elevates them greatly, turning stellar pop tracks into teeming productions you wish you could hear the individual stems of.We Almost Broke Up Again Last Night, about the kind of generically rocky relationship that many of my friends seem to be in, is a small scale epic, cresting with a grand guitar solo and skyward-soaring strings. After producing such a sustained run of records with the likes of Taylor Swift, Lorde, Lana Del Rey and many more, Antonoff seems to bepersona non grataamong pop fans right now who see him as overexposed and predictable, but Man’s Best Friend makes a strong case for his continued presence. He, Carpenter, Allen and Ryan work together like a finely tuned machine; Man’s Best Friend, to me, feels like a producer/artist pairing on par with his work with Del Rey on her instant-classic Norman Fucking Rockwell!. The tolerances between her writing and his production on this album are minuscule, and makes its predecessor, the solid Short’n’Sweet – which spent 49 weeks in the UK Top 10 and produced three No 1 singles – sound practically rudimentary in comparison.‘I’m a tyrant!’ Pop superstar Sabrina Carpenter on freakish fame, fighting Disney and writing the song of the summerRead moreThe trade-off, when Carpenter is this much in the zone, is that everything about her music that rankles with people – the over-reliance on profane language, the overstuffing of songs with innuendo, the vaudevillian hamminess – is here in spades. That stuff could get tiresome across previous albums, but the difference on Man’s Best Friend is that everything else is so finely tuned, and so delightfully detailed, that it is easy to get over the occasionally lazy, internet-worn line (“I get wet at the thought of you / being a responsible guy”) or the fact that many of these songs cover noticeably similar ideas. Then again, there’s a Trojan horse quality to Man’s Best Friend: it’s so distinctly Carpenter that you might not even realise it’s one of the year’s singular, musically provocative pop records.Explore more on these topicsSabrina CarpenterPop and rockJack Antonoffalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

But now it’s time to call it what it isFri 29 Aug 2025 12.30 EDTLast modified on Fri 29 Aug 2025 21.39 EDTShareIf this were happening somewhere else – in Latin America, say – how might it be reported?Having secured his grip on the capital, the president is now set to send troops to several rebel-held cities, claiming he is wanted there to restore order. The move follows raids on the homes of leading dissidents and comes as armed men seen as loyal to the president, many of them masked, continue to pluck people off the streets …Except this is happening in the United States of America and so we don’t quite talk about it that way. That’s not the only reason. It’s also because Donald Trump’s march towards authoritarianism is so steady, taking another step or two every day, that it’s easy to become inured to it: you can’t be in a state of shock permanently. And, besides, sober-minded people are wary of sounding hyperbolic or hysterical: their instinct is to play down rather than scream at the top of their voice.There’s something else, too. Trump’s dictator-like behaviour is so brazen, so blatant, that paradoxically, we discount it. It’s like being woken in the night by a burglar wearing a striped shirt and carrying a bag marked “Swag”: we would assume it was a joke or a stunt or otherwise unreal, rather than a genuine danger. So it is with Trump. We cannot quite believe what we are seeing.But here is what we are seeing. Trump has deployed the national guard on the streets of Washington DC, so that there are now 2,000 troops, heavily armed, patrolling the capital. The pretext is fighting crime, but violent crime in DC was at a30-year lowwhen he made his move. The president haswarned that Chicago will be next, perhapsBaltimore too. In June he sent the national guard and the marines intoLos Angeles to put down protestsagainst his immigration policies, protests which the administration said amounted to an “insurrection”. Demonstrators were complaining about the masked men of Ice, the immigration agency that, thanks to Trump, now has a budget to matchthat of the world’s largest armies, snatching people from street corners or hauling them from their cars.Those cities are all run by Democrats and, not coincidentally, have large Black populations. They are potential centres of opposition to Trump’s rule and he wants them under his control. The constitution’s insistence that states have powers of their own and that the reach of the federal government should be limited – a principle that until recently was sacred toRepublicans– can go hang.Control is the goal, amassing power in the hands of the president and removing or neutering any institution or person that could stand in his way. That is the guiding logic that explains Trump’s every action, large and small, including his wars on the media, the courts, the universities and the civil servants of the federal government. It helps explain why FBI agents last week mounted a 7am raid on thehome and office of John Bolton, once Trump’s national security adviser and now one of his most vocal critics. And why the president hinted darkly that the former New Jersey governorChris Christie is in his sights.View image in fullscreenMembers of the national guard patrol near the White House in Washington DC, 29 August 2025.Photograph: Shawn Thew/EPAIt’s why he has broken all convention, and possibly US law, by attemptingto remove Lisa Cookas a member of the board of the Federal Reserve on unproven charges of mortgage fraud. Those charges are based on information helpfully supplied by the Trump loyalist installed as federal housing director and who,according to the New York Times, has repeatedly leveraged “the powers of his office … to investigate or attack Mr Trump’s most recognisable political enemies”. The pattern is clear: Trump is using the institutions of government to hound his foes in a manner that recalls the worst of Richard Nixon – though where Nixon skulked in the shadows, Trump’s abuses are in plain sight.And all in the pursuit of ever more power. Take the firing of Cook.With falling poll numbers, especially on hishandling of the economy, he craves the sugar rush of an interest rate cut. The independent central bank won’t give it to him, so he wants to push the Fed out of the way and grab the power to set interest rates himself. Notethe justification offered by JD Vancethis week, that Trump is “much better able to make those determinations” than “unelected bureaucrats” because he embodies the will of the people. The reasoning is pure authoritarianism, arguing that a core principle of the US constitution, the separation of powers, should be swept aside, because all legitimate authority resides in one man alone.Of course, the greatest check on Trump would come from the opposition winning power in a democratic election, specifically Democrats taking control of the House of Representatives in November 2026. Trump is working hard to make that impossible: witness this month’sunabashed gerrymander in Texas, where at Trump’s command, Republicans redrew congressional boundaries to give themselves five more safe seats in the House. Trump wants more states to follow Texas’s lead, because a Democratic-controlled House would have powers of scrutiny that he rightly fears.Meanwhile, apparently prompted by his meeting with Vladimir Putin, he is once again at war againstpostal voting, baselessly decrying it as fraudulent, while also demanding a new census that would exclude undocumented migrants – moves that will either help Republicans win in 2026 or else enable him to argue that a Democratic victory was illegitimate and should be overturned.In that same spirit, the Trump White House now argues that, in effect, only one party should be allowed to exercise power in the US. How else to read the words of key Trump adviser Stephen Miller, who this weektold Fox Newsthat “The Democrat party is not a political party; it is a domestic extremist organisation.”It’s the same picture on every front, whether it’s plans for anew military parade in Trump’s honouror thefiring of health officialswho insist on putting science ahead of political loyalty. He is bent on amassing power to himself and being seen to amass power to himself, even if that means departing from economic conservative orthodoxy to have the federal government take astake in hitherto private companies. He wants to rule over every aspect of US life. As Trump himselfsaid this week, “A lot of people are saying, ‘Maybe we’d like a dictator.’” The former Obama adviser David Axelrod is not alonewhen he says, “We have gone from zero to Hungary faster than I ever imagined.”The trouble is, people still don’t talk about it the way they talk about Hungary, not inside the US and not outside it. That’s partly theIt Can’t Happen Heremindset, partly a reluctance to accept a reality that would require, of foreign governments especially, a rethink of almost everything. If the US is on its way to autocracy, in a condition scholars might call “unconsolidated authoritarianism”, then that changes Britain’s entire strategic position, its place in the world, which for 80 years has been predicated on the notion of a west led by a stable, democratic US. The same goes for the EU. Far easier to carry on, either pretending that the transformation of the US is not, in fact, as severe as it is, or that normal service will resume shortly. But the world’s leaders, like US citizens, cannot ignore the evidence indefinitely. To adapt the title of that long-ago novel, it can happen here – and it is.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

She also went on to become a surrogate for twins born in 1991, which she describes as a beautiful experience.She has spent decades running the surrogacy agency Cots (Childlessness Overcome Through Surrogacy), facilitating more than 1,000 pregnancies. But in September she is closing its doors as soaring demand and a lack of surrogates is making the job more stressful than ever before.“The pressure I feel to try to find people surrogates now, it’s just overwhelming,” Cotton says. “I get phone calls every day from couples, often in tears. The desperation is just heartbreaking. It’s terrible.”View image in fullscreenKim Cotton, with the twins she carried.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyThere are now about 400 children a year born through surrogacy to UK parents, up from about 50 a year before 2008, and more than half are now born through international surrogacy arrangements.Pro-surrogacy campaigners have blamed the stringent laws in the UK for pushing more people to seek surrogacy arrangements abroad, sometimes in countries with lax or nonexistent regulations. Waiting lists at many British surrogacy agencies are now years long.“As soon as same-sex parents could go for a parental order, demand doubled, but supplies remained the same,” Cotton says. “There’s also just more infertility around. There’s so much cancer. And it’s affecting young women now, they’re having a hysterectomy in their 20s or 30s.“It is very difficult. It is very frustrating. And it’s like trying to run an agency with your hands behind your back.”The UK’s surrogacy laws have changed little since they were first introduced in 1985, when they were rushed through parliament as a direct response to Cotton’s pregnancy.In 2023 the Law Commission published a report with suggested changes, including the creation of a national surrogacy register, and ensuring intended parents in domestic surrogacy arrangements can become parents from the child’s birth.Under current laws, intended parents have to apply for a parental order after birth, which can take months and create issues over who makes decisions about the baby’s healthcare in the first weeks of life.“In 1985 I said yes, I’m the birth mother, but my husband is not the father – he’s had a vasectomy. But I still have to put him down as the father on the birth certificate. Back then it was bad, and nothing has changed,” Cotton says.“The laws are so antiquated, they’ve not changed since 1985 when I was a surrogate, but it was a kneejerk law that was passed. It’s fossilised. It’s a dinosaur. And it’s just on the back burner now. It’s a damn shame.”Campaigners were hopeful the Law Commission report would lead to reform, but the change of government in 2024 has pushed surrogacy to the bottom of the agenda.There is also strong opposition from those who are concerned that relaxing the laws could lead to people being coerced into surrogacy by financial need, or wealthy people outsourcing pregnancy because they have the resources to do so.Cotton says: “We don’t want people doing it for the wrong reason. We don’t want anyone just thinking, oh, that might be a great way of earning money. There really needs to be altruism involved because it’s priceless what they do.“I’m sure things will change in the future, but it’s politics. It’s too slow for me. And that’s why I have to back out, because I really thought we were going to get change with the Law Commission, and then suddenly the government changed and that was it, end of.”As well as parental rights from birth, Cotton said she would like to see reform of the expenses system for surrogates. As commercial surrogacy is banned in Britain, advertising for surrogates is not permitted and only “reasonable expenses” are allowed to be paid.Cotton says this seems to have been accepted as about £15,000-£20,000, although there is no official guidance around what is permitted.“If the surrogate baby has been living with a couple since the baby was born, how are they going to say, well, no, actually I can’t give you a parental order because you paid a bit too much to the surrogate?” Cotton says. “So we need more clarity.”Although she is closing down Cots, Cotton is reluctant to leave the world of surrogacy behind completely, and says she will continue to offer advice to people through asurrogacy advice line.“I’m as passionate about surrogacy as I was 40 years ago. I think it’s the most amazing area to work in,” she says. “The couples are the most determined people I’ve ever come across in my life.“And it’s an absolute honour to work with the surrogates. It really is. When I listen to them talk, I think: what a wonderful soul you are. Some of them express milk for six weeks, or three months sometimes, to help the baby get started. Isn’t that amazing?”Explore more on these topicsSurrogacyParents and parentingFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What do I get out of it?” an exasperated Francis Ford Coppola asks Shia LaBeouf on the set ofMegalopolis. “I don’t get money. I don’t get fame; I already have fame. I don’t get Oscars, I already have Oscars. What do I get that I want?” LaBeouf eventually gives up. “Fun!” Coppola says. “I wanna have fun!”MakingMegalopolisdoesn’t look like most people’s idea of fun as Coppola attempts to corral actors, crew, costumes, locations, lavish sets and special effects all in service of a sprawling sci-fi-meets-ancient-Rome story that no one fully understands. Throw in the fact that the film-maker spent $120m of his own money on the passion project by selling off part of his winemaking business to raise funds, having spent nearly 50 years trying to get it made, and that the production was beset with delays, technical headaches and bust-ups, and you feel this is more than most 83-year-olds should have to go through.But watching Coppola making Megalopolis oftenisrather fun – perhaps more fun than the end product, to be honest. Just as the documentaryHearts of Darknesscaptured the chaos and strife behind the making of Coppola’s legendary Apocalypse Now back in 1976, so Mike Figgis’s new film Megadoc takes us on to the set of Coppola’s latest, grandest adventure. If we don’t quite get heart attacks and typhoons this time round, we do get as raw and intimate a portrait of an auteur at work as we’ve had for some time.That’s partly down to the nature of the project and the personalities behind it – but it is also a testament to Figgis’s skill as an intuitive, self-effacing, and observant film-maker. “I have a huge problem with the way documentaries are shot now; they’re shot like bad B-movies,” says Figgis, just before Megadoc’s premiere at the Venice film festival. “I know from my own experience that in order to get funding for a documentary, you have to kind of submit a script, which seems to me the antithesis of what a documentary should be; it should be a journey of discovery.”Figgis says he has known Coppola for decades. They first met in the 1990s, after he cast Nicolas Cage – Coppola’s nephew – in his hit movie Leaving Las Vegas. When he heard Coppola was about to start work on Megalopolis at last, Figgis wrote to congratulate him. “Almost as a little afterthought, a bit of a joke, I said: ‘If you need a fly on the wall, just let me know.’” A few months later, he recalls, Coppola called him out of the blue saying: “‘When could you be here? Do you have a visa? Can you come now?’ It’s a very Francis thing.”View image in fullscreen‘The process for him has always been one of experimentation’ … a view through the camera during the filming of Megalopolis.Photograph: Elliefilm Megadoc LLCDays later, in November 2022, with a small crew and his smallest camera, Figgis arrived in Atlanta where Coppola and his cast were just getting started on rehearsals. “When I first turned up, I wasn’t introduced, so nobody knew who I was.” As well as seeing Coppola at work, Figgis’s film is a window on to his actors, including Adam Driver, Aubrey Plaza, Jon Voight, Dustin Hoffman, Giancarlo Esposito and Laurence Fishburne. We get to see them in and out of role, interacting with Coppola, with each other and with Figgis. Driver keeps his distance, Plaza is mischievous and playful, but it’s LaBoeuf that Figgis zeroes in on as good material.Where most of the cast respect and trust Coppola and go along with his wishes and whims, LaBoeuf “was the one actor that really – very bravely, actually – challenged the process on many, many levels”, says Figgis. LaBoeuf, a notoriously volatile figure, persistently questions Coppola’s direction, his character’s backstory, his blocking, even his own performance (“some of these takes are just trash”). LaBoeuf also confesses he is terrified of getting fired, mindful that Coppola famously replaced Harvey Keitel with Martin Sheen a month into shooting Apocalypse Now. He survives, and there’s even affection between the two men, but by the end Coppola is so exasperated with him he throws up his hands and walks off the set, saying: “If you don’t need me tonight, I’m happy to go home.”As Figgis readily admits, “all the really good docs about film-making have been stories about disasters, so every time something negative happened I was thinking: ‘Oh, that’s good for the documentary.’”Fortunately for Figgis, if not for Coppola, there were more crises on the horizon. The production almost collapses halfway through when Coppola fires the visual effects supervisor, Mark Russell, and half the art department leave with him. At its heart, the split was perhaps a clash of two incompatible styles of film-making: the art department were accustomed to working on big, state-of-the-art effects movies, such as Marvel films, which require a lot of planning and collaboration (and money); Coppola’s preferred mode is more like experimental theatre, allowing for instinct and spontaneity. “That’s where the size of the film didn’t do him any favours,” says Figgis, “because the flexibility that he needs to go with that mindset isn’t supported by such a big production.”The net result was a lot of frustration and wasted time, all on Coppola’s dime. “Every day his regime was, he would get up early, make lots and lots of notes, and then he’d turn up and make everyone a bit crazy by going: ‘I’ve changed my mind. I don’t want to shoot that today actually. Can we get Adam Driver?’ ‘No, it’s his day off.’ ‘How long is it going to take to get him on the set?’ ‘Three hours.’ ‘OK. What should we do?’” Figgis recalls. “He’s in his 80s, so he’s basically just sitting there waiting, which for me was a joy, of course, because in those periods, he’s very happy to talk, have a moan or tell stories about Brando or whatever.”View image in fullscreen‘Every time something negative happened I thought: “Oh, that’s good for the documentary”’ … Coppola and Mike Figgis filming for Megadoc.Photograph: Elliefilm Megadoc LLCMeanwhile, throughout the shoot, Coppola was staying in an old Atlanta hotel that he had bought and decided to renovate – so he would go home every night to another, parallel project. “He invited me to live in the hotel,” says Figgis, “and someone said: ‘Mike, they start work at six in the morning. There’s dust everywhere. It’s so noisy, you won’t get any sleep.’ So I declined and got a hotel in Atlanta.”When Figgis suggests to Coppola that he seems to thrive on chaos, however, he immediately rebuts the notion. “He says: ‘I’m very good with chaos. I make order out of chaos.’ But he then dodges the question of: ‘Did you actually create the chaos in order to fix the chaos?’ But that’s not unusual for film-makers or artists in general, who kind of throw everything up in the air and see how it lands.”There was another troubled aspect of the shoot that Figgis’s film doesn’t address. When I spoke to former crew members who had worked on Megalopolis before its premiere at Cannes last year, several reportedconcerns about Coppola’s behaviour on set, not least a bacchanalian party scene during which witnesses say the director tried to kiss some of the topless and scantily clad female extras. The film’s executive producer Darren Demetre told the Guardian at the time that Coppola “walked around the set to establish the spirit of the scene by giving kind hugs and kisses on the cheek to the cast and background players. It was his way to help inspire and establish the club atmosphere.” Some extras recalled their experience of working on the film differently; one cast memberdescribed it to Varietyas “super weird and uncomfortable”.Figgis did not witness any inappropriate behaviour, he says. “My obsession was film-making and the process. There are hundreds of people [on set], and there’s adoring fans everywhere who want to take a selfie with Francis and all the rest of it. And he likes that. Outside the film-making thing, he’s a very warm and affectionate person. So I had no sense of what emerged later. And, you know, I was a little bit puzzled by it, I have to say.”Some critics praised Megalopolis, others were less enamoured (the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw found it“bloated, boring and bafflingly shallow”). Even Figgis admits he never fully understood the script: “It was like reading a Russian novel.” The movie has not been a commercial success: to date it has made $14m. But then Apocalypse Now was not hailed as a classic until long after its initial release. Perhaps Megalopolis will undergo a similar process of rehabilitation, with its themes of authoritarian control, political scheming and utopian idealism. If it does, Figgis’s film will doubtless be a part of that.View image in fullscreenA last, defiant moonshot … Adam Driver in Megalopolis.Photograph: 2024 Caesar Film LLCWhatever his views on the script, Figgis is full of admiration for Coppola as a film-maker. “The process for him has always been one of experimentation and actually, putting that into perspective, who else is doing that? Nobody. Whether you like the film or you don’t like the film, no one of that stature is doing it.” Others agree. In the documentary, George Lucas tells Figgis: “My whole career is based on watching Francis.” But he says they are complete opposites: “I’m a plodding along, careful what I’m doing, plan it out … and he’s a jump-off-the-cliff guy.”Watching Coppola contend with all the challenges and setbacks on set, making his way through a stressful four-month shoot, contending with the illness of his wife of 60 years, Eleanor (who died in April 2024), all while maintaining superhuman energy levels for an man in his 80s, it feels as if simply getting Megalopolis made, and walking the Cannes red carpet one last time, was success enough for Coppola. Perhaps it will come to be seen as the last, defiant moonshot from a larger-than-life film-maker who always cared more about art than money.Does Figgis think Coppola had fun? “Well, he didn’t look very happy a lot of the time,” he says. “But there were times I saw him chuckling and I thought: ‘Oh, he is sort of having fun now.’ Because he’s got a bunch of actors around him, they’re all kind of vibing with each other, it’s raining, and there’s, like, this chaos to be dealt with. He would have had more fun had everybody been more prepared for what he actually wanted, except he didn’t quite know what he wanted at the outset. But ultimately, I think he’s glad he made the film, because it was something that was sitting there on his back burner, and he wanted to get through it and articulate those ideas.” He laughs. “But I think we all have a different idea of fun.”Megadoc screened at the Venice film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmMegalopolisFrancis Ford  CoppolaMike FiggisDocumentary filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But just as everyone has their own preferred bike, choosing the right lock, from ultra-secure bolts to lightweight devices, is very personal.Cyclists need to consider where they live, how attractive their bike is to thieves (they often look for more elaborate city and racing bikes), and how long they leave it unaccompanied. So to help you pin down the best option for you, we asked the experts for their top bike lock selections to keep your ride secure.What you need to knowView image in fullscreenBike theft is highest in the city, so investing in the right lock for city cyclists is key.Photograph: Maskot/Getty ImagesTheMetropolitan policeurges people to use two locks instead of one, locking both the frame and the wheels to the stand and taking anything removable – lights, baskets and even the saddle – with you. Also, bear in mind that you may have to carry a lock around for some time, so weight is key.TheSold Securerating system, owned by the Master Locksmiths Association, judges the performance of any lock. It ranks locks from bronze (the most basic level) to silver (which aims to prevent the more determined attacker), gold (to stop dedicated attacks) and diamond (halting the most serious, including angle grinder, attacks).Carl Ellis, who foundedthebestbikelock.comafter having one too many bikes stolen, doesn’t recommend bronze-rated locks because he says they don’t provide enough protection in most cases.So spend as much as you can afford. He says you can get a lock at a medium security level for about £30, with more secure locks usually costing about £40.If you have cycle insurance, ensure you’re buying a lock approved by your insurer, says Richard Cantle, founder ofStolen Ride, a cyclist-run site that aims to tackle the issues around bike theft.At a glanceBest affordable lock:Halfords 23cm D Lock£35 at HalfordsBestangle grinder resistantlock:Hiplok D1000£249.99 at HiplokBest forcity cyclists:Kryptonite Evolution Mini-7£44.99 at HalfordsBest combination lock:Kryptonite KryptoLok Combo£51.99 at FreewheelBest chain lock:Kryptonite KryptoLok Series 2£59.99 at HalfordsBest lightweight lock:Foldylock MiniFrom £76.98 at AmazonThe best bike locks in the UK in 2025View image in fullscreenBest affordable lockView image in fullscreenHalfords 23cm D Lock£35 at HalfordsCarl Ellis’s pick is the Halfords 23cm D Lock, which has a gold rating, is practically sized and has a mount included to attach to the frame of the bike. The only drawback is that there is no cable to protect the wheel.If you want this extra piece of security, try theOnGuard Pitbull DT 8005, which Ellis says is practically sized – big enough to go around the frame and one wheel of most bikes – and gives the extra layer of security.Sold Secure rating:goldWeight:not listedNumber of keys:twoFrame mount:includedBest angle grinder resistant lockView image in fullscreenHiplok D1000£249.99 at Hiplok£249.99 at Balfe’s BikesAngle-grinder-resistant bike locks are the security device of choice for some riders, and it’s not hard to understand why. “[Angle grinders] can make cutting standard locks very quick,” says Richard Cantle.“There are only a handful of these specific locks in this new area of the market, from well-known companies such as Hiplok, Litelok, and Squire. It’s worth pointing out that Sold Secure doesn’t have a specific rating for these locks yet to show their angle grinder credentials; they fall under the diamond rating category that also includes non angle grinder resistant bike locks.”The best bike lights to see and be seen when cycling in the dark, tried and testedRead moreThe most accessible of the high-end locks, says Ellis, is theLitelok X1. But he picks the Hiplok D1000 as the most angle grinder resistant lock. It comes with a lifetime warranty and is fortified with a graphene composite material that makes it much more difficult to cut with an angle grinder.Sold Secure rating:diamondWeight:1.9kgNumber of keys:three (with registration and replacement key programme)Frame mount:noBest for city cyclistsView image in fullscreenKryptonite Evolution Mini-7£44.99 at Halfords£44.99 at AmazonLondon and other major cities have some of thehighest rates of bike theftin the UK. Hackney sat at number one on that undesirable chart in 2024, followed closely by Hammersmith and Fulham, and Cardiff, while Bristol wasn’t far off the top.The city cyclist can first look at getting a U-lock, also called a D-lock, which offers the “best price to security ratio”, says Ellis. “They’re usually the easiest to use, and since cities are full of bike racks, you shouldn’t struggle to find somewhere to lock your bike, even with a mini U-lock.”Sam Crabtree, a buyer at Halfords, says a good option for city cyclists who need something light on their commute is the gold-rated Kryptonite Evolution Mini-7. “It has a sliding dust cover as well as a higher-security disc-style cylinder that is pick and drill resistant,” he says. “Kryptonite locks offer anti-theft protection cover [on bikes] up to a value of £1,500.“The KryptoFlex cable that comes with the Mini-7 extends its versatility. The cable allows users to secure additional parts of the bike, like the front wheel, or to lock the bike to larger or awkwardly shaped objects that the U-lock alone wouldn’t fit around. While the cable itself isn’t as secure as the U-lock, it’s a good deterrent for opportunistic thieves and adds an extra layer of protection.”Sold Secure rating:goldWeight:1.61kgNumber of keys:threeFrame mount:yesskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

But they’re not as safe as some of those with a key. “Thieves can crack the code through trial and error,” says Crabtree. This would, of course, take the time to go through all of the possible combinations, which would be in the thousands.There are fewer combination locks with high Sold Secure ratings, says Ellis. Of those that are available, he says the Kryptonite KryptoLok Combo comes with a gold rating and a mount for the frame of your bike.“The mount is simple to install and holds the lock firmly in place,” he says. “It’s just a good all-round lock that doesn’t require keys. You can also register your combination with Kryptonite in case you forget it.”Sold Secure rating:goldWeight:1.32kgNumber of keys:not applicableFrame mount:yesBest chain lockKryptonite KryptoLok Series 2View image in fullscreen£59.99 at Halfords£59.99 at TredzEven though chain locks can offer high levels of security, they’re often too heavy for daily use, says Ellis.Where chain locks come into their own is when bikes are locked at home. Admiral says that 40% of claims on its policies for stolen bikes are for those taken from sheds and garages, and another 25% are taken from inside homes themselves.Ellis recommends the gold-rated Kryptonite KryptoLok Series 2 chains, which come in varying sizes.

It’s the smallest and lightest silver-rated folding lock available, he says, and the folding mechanism is smoother than the competition.“Because that compact shape is so close to your frame, the lock tends to be kept very firmly in place, even on bumpy rides. In contrast, D-locks are always bigger and can sometimes be less stable in their frame mounts,” he says. “The other advantage of folding locks is that they can be shaped around your bike and whatever you’re trying to lock it to.”Sold Secure rating:silverWeight:0.89kgNumber of keys:threeFrame mount:yesView image in fullscreenChoosing a bike lock is a personal matter, so don’t get chained to the wrong one.Photograph: helovi/Getty Images/iStockphotoWhich lock? The different types explainedD-lock/U-lockThis ubiquitous lock can be called by either of its names and has been around since the 1970s. It essentially acts as a large padlock and comes in varying degrees of strength, security and price. It consists of a stiff shackle (the ‘U’ part) and a crossbar that secures it in place.Cable lockThis lightweight, flexible lock is usually easy to transport. It uses a steel cable that can be wound around a bike’s frame and wheels a number of times. Best for low-risk areas, as they can be weak and easy to cut with bolt cutters.Chain lockThis is a chain with locking mechanisms at both ends. This can be fed through the bike frame a number of times as well as the bike rack. The links and weight of the chain can vary in size and strength. Typically covered with a protective sleeve, a chain lock can be bulky so isn’t as portable as other types of lock, but it can create problems for thieves trying to use power tools.Folding lockThese are usually compact and can be attached to the frame of the bike when not in use. It’s made from steel plates that can be moved around to give different locking combinations and then folded into a convenient package that’s easy to transport. However, there aren’t as many options on the market as other types of lock. They’re also generally more expensive.Bikes: a guide to securityLearn to lock up your bike properly. Keep the lock as far from the ground as possible – thieves may use the ground for leverage – and ensure it goes around both the frame and a wheel.Write down your frame number in case your bike is stolen.Register your bike with schemes such asImmobiliseand theBikeRegister Database, which help identify stolen property to the police.Take pictures of your bike, including any distinctive features.Get a lock that’s the tightest possible fit – not too big that it’s slack, but also not so small that it doesn’t lock the bike properly.Lock your bike wherever it is – at home or in the street.When locking it at home, make sure the doors and windows are locked and the bike is out of sight.Ensure your bike is covered under your home insurance policy.This article was originally published on 21 January 2025.

But ending the horror in Gaza still relies on the worst people in the worldMarina HydeThis humanitarian catastrophe is barely of passing interest to Donald Trump. The curse of our times is how little we can do about itFri 29 Aug 2025 07.36 EDTLast modified on Fri 29 Aug 2025 21.30 EDTShareDay 222 of Donald Trump’s presidency, and Russia’s war in Ukraine – which he promised to end on day one –shows no sign of having got the memo. This was not a single-use Trump promise; he madeit at least 53 times. Yet the US president has failed to keep it, either literally or in his favourite manner: figuratively. Can you figuratively end a war? Not even, apparently.What his most recent round of failure means, however, is that Trump ispivoting back to another war, the grotesquely horrifying and unlawful humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in Gaza. Not the way he’d phrase it, possibly. This week he swerved commenting on either Israel’s invasion of Gaza City or the mounting declarations that famine and starvation are clearly under way in the territory, and instead announced: “I think within the next two, three weeks, you’re going to have a pretty good, conclusive ending.” Righto. Trump’s recipe for an ending to the horror has hitherto seemed to resemble the famous business plan of theSouth Park gnomes. Phase 1: Collect Underpants. Phase 2: ?. Phase 3: Profit.In the US president’s version, this ran along the following lines. Phase 1. Grotesquely horrifying and unlawful humanitarian catastrophe. 2. ? 3. Beach resort. Strange to look at theYalta conference photoof Churchill, Stalin and Roosevelt and think how much more quickly the three allied wartime leaders could have wrapped things up had they shunned various complexities and understood the world as a simple selection of waterfront real-estate opportunities. And yet, perhaps even stranger to imagine that while we don’t have a group selfie of Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin and Benjamin Netanyahu, the curse of our times is that the fate of so many appallingly desperate and persecuted people in the world hinges on three men who might well be imagined to be in jail were they not in office.But these are the realities. The path to peace inGazaruns through Trump, not social media posts, or window flags, or creatives “using their platform”, or any of the other gestures that, while the wishful might cast them as speaking truth to power, in fact only throw our era’s increasingly pervasive sense of powerlessness into even sharper relief.Nor, in any non-gnome sense, does it run anywhere near Ed Davey’s announcement this week that after much thought and prayer, he wouldnot be attending the king’s banquetfor Trump during his forthcoming state visit. It goes without saying that Trump wouldn’t have the first clue who the Liberal Democrat leader is. (More pressingly for Davey, and perhaps more in his power to do something about, is the polling this week that showed that 35% of his own Lib Dem voters alsohaven’t the first clue who heis when shown a photo of him.) But Davey believes boycotting dinner is the best way he can “send a message to both Trump and Starmer” that they cannot wish the catastrophe unfolding in Gaza away. He means well, yet this gesture still feels one rung above a tweet – or, indeed, aGuardian newspaper column, which is how he announced it. Regrettably, neither of the above are levers in international conflict.Being unable to plot a path to answers means a question dominates our turbulent age: is being well-meaning enough? Is it, in fact, all I can be? Have I acquitted my responsibilities in the face of historic horror by posting about it, or attacking someone else for not posting about it, or by suggesting that someone cannot care about any subject on which they have not done a post? Perhaps it’s nice to think so, but I fear that far from being the most engaged, those who live like this are the most beaten. Some of the worst people in the world – at least, some of the worst people without access to state armies – run the social media companies, and the idea that spending comfortable hours policing their platforms, working for them for free, is taking a stand or showing you care in any useful way tips beyond bizarre into cultural sickness.Social media claimed to connect and empower people – a populist promise if ever you heard one – and yet what many of us hear our friends and family say all the time in conversations about the news is that they feel powerless. People have been atomised and narcotised by this supposedly unifying and uplifting technology, and when the great perspective of history is afforded to our descendants and perhaps even our future selves, we might well find that most of our present crises were catalysed by it rather than cured by it. This morning I saw a much-shared cut-out of Travis Kelce kissing Taylor Swift in their engagement photo, superimposed on top of a war-demolished building, above a bell hooks quote: “All our silences in the face of racist assault are acts of complicity.” Dear me. Stick it in a time capsule, along with an apology note for the cultural rubble it’ll have to be dug out of.At operational level, however, things don’t change. The path to peace still goes through politicians with power. Many of them are still terrible people. They will still have to have unpleasant and even “toxic” conversations in which horse-trading and moral compromise are inevitable. And yet these things are still desirable, because this is the way it has always ended. This is the way the bombs go silent, the way the children stop starving, the way the hideous carnage ends. It is a long, perilous and precarious path – but history has made it familiar, because it is the only one that actually gets anywhere near where we need to go.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But the court of appeal judges said upholding that order could lead to further disorder by effectively demonstrating that such action could achieve protesters’ ultimate goal – the removal of the asylum seekers one way or another.They said the people living at the Bell hotel would have to be housed somewhere, and other councils could regard preserving the injunction as a green light to do the same in their areas.Analysing the high court decision, Lord Justice Bean, sitting with Lady Justice Davies and Lord Justice Cobb, said: “If an outbreak of protests enhances the case for a planning injunction, this runs the risk of acting as an impetus or incentive for further protests – some of which may be disorderly – around asylum accommodation. At its worst, if even unlawful protests are to be treated as relevant, there is a risk of encouraging further lawlessness.“The [high court] judge’s approach ignores the obvious consequence that the closure of one site means capacity needs to be identified elsewhere in the system.”The judges added that “the potential cumulative impact” of other councils reacting by trying to gain injunctions in their own areas was a “material consideration … that was not considered by the judge”.View image in fullscreenProtesters gathered outside the Bell hotel again on Friday after the court’s ruling.Photograph: Carlos Jasso/AFP/Getty ImagesThe ruling will come as a relief to the site’s owner, Somani Hotels, and the Home Office, which both challenged the injunction, the latter amid concerns it would prompt a host of legal challenges from other councils.Speaking after the decision, the Home Office minister, Angela Eagle, said: “We inherited a chaotic asylum accommodation system costing billions. This government will close all hotels by the end of this parliament and we appealed this judgment so hotels like the Bell can be exited in a controlled and orderly way that avoids the chaos of recent years that saw 400 hotels open at a cost of £9m a day.”The Refugee Council’s chief executive, Enver Solomon, said using hotels to house asylum seekers was “untenable”, adding: “Waiting until 2029 to end their use is no longer an option. As long as hotels remain open, they will continue to be flashpoints for protests, fuelling division and leaving people who have fled war and persecution feeling unsafe.”The charity urged ministers to adopt its “one-off” scheme granting temporary permission to stay to those asylum seekers most likely to be recognised as refugees because of the situation in their home country. This would lead to the closure of hotels by next year, according to its own analysis.Kemi Badenoch, the Tory leader, said: “Keir Starmer has shown that he puts the rights of illegal immigrants above the rights of British people who just want to feel safe in their towns and communities.”Starmer was not a party to the case, which concerned people seeking asylum – not illegal immigrants. The Home Office’s lawyer suggested the legal duty of the home secretary, as a government minister representing the whole of the UK, to uphold human rights trumped those of a single council to follow planning law. The judges said this analysis was “unattractive”.Badenoch added that the ruling was a “setback, but it is not the end. I say to Conservative councils seeking similar injunctions against asylum hotels – keep going”. But a senior Tory source said: “They’re human beings; they have to live somewhere. For me the issue is: where’s the deterrent?”Some Tory MPs fear urging councils to mount further legal challenges could backfire, given the court’s warning that local protests cannot justify emergency injunctions. Another Tory MP said: “We’re throwing lawyers at this problem instead of showing how exactly we can fix the system.”TheReform UKleader, Nigel Farage, also criticised the decision, claiming the government had “used ECHR [European convention on human rights] against the people of Epping”. Despite the ruling relating to legal asylum seekers, he added: “Illegal migrants have more rights than the British people under Starmer.”Home Office lawyers had argued that the government’s duties towards asylum seekers under the ECHR were “fundamentally different” from Epping Forest district council’s planning responsibilities.The council’s leader, Chris Whitbread, called for calm, telling Times Radio: “There’s been peaceful protests and there’s been non-peaceful protests outside the hotel.”View image in fullscreenSeveral protesters stood outside the high court on Friday after the judgment.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PAAfter the court of appeal ruling, a small number of demonstrators carrying St George and union flags gathered outside the Bell hotel while police officers guarded its entrance.​One protester s​aid the decision could result in civil unrest. Carmen, who wore a pink top that said “Pink ladies say, the only way is Epping, send them home” on it, said: “We come every week – march, protest – and today’s ruling is just devastating, absolutely devastating. It will probably cause civil unrest.”The council could still be granted an injunction after the full hearing of the legal claim. Whitbread said: “Obviously we’re still going to court in October to go for a final injunction and we will be pushing hard to make sure that’s successful, but we will do everything we can still.”The judges said the original decision was “seriously flawed in principle”, and that the “risk of injustice to the residents of the hotel by being dispersed by 12 September when the trial of the claim was to take place only some six weeks later seems to have had oddly little resonance with the [high court] judge”.Neither the council nor the hotel’s owner had argued in the high court case that the fear of crime being committed in Epping in the future was a key factor, though both had agreed it was relevant.The court of appeal judges said this was correct, but that it was outweighed by the concern about incentivising more potentially violent protests, the upheaval of having to disperse more than 130 people for the short period before the trial, and other factors in the broader public interest.The judges granted the Home Office and the hotel’s owners permission to appeal. They also agreed Mr Justice Eyre was wrong to refuse to allow the home secretary to intervene in the case, saying the Home Office had a “constitutional role relating to public safety” and was affected by the issues.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumHome OfficeEssexLocal governmentEnglandReform UKConservativesnewsShareReuse this content"

Abbas had been planning to travel to New York to deliver an address to the UN general assembly.Abbas’ office said it was astonished by the visa decision and argued that it violated the UN “headquarters agreement”.Under an agreement as host of the UN in New York, the US is not supposed to refuse visas for officials heading to the world body for the general assembly, but the state department said it was complying with the agreement by allowing the Palestinian mission to attend.“The Trump administration has been clear: it is in our national security interests to hold the PLO and PA accountable for not complying with their commitments, and for undermining the prospects for peace,” the state department said in a statement.The new measure further aligns Donald Trump’s administration with Israel’s rightwing government which adamantly rejects a Palestinian state. Israeli officials have repeatedly equated the broadly secular PA, which exercises partial authority in the occupied West Bank, with its bitter Islamist rival Hamas.Using a term favoured by Trump to deride his legal troubles while out of office, the state department accused the Palestinians of “lawfare” by raising grievances againstIsraelat the international criminal court and international court of justice.It called on the PA to drop “efforts to secure the unilateral recognition of a conjectural Palestinian state”.The Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, thanked the Trump administration “for this bold step and for standing by Israel once again” in a post on X.Stéphane Dujarric, a UN spokesperson, said it was “important” for all states and observers, which includes the Palestinians, to be represented at a summit scheduled for the day before the general assembly begins. “We obviously hope that this will be resolved,” Dujarric said.UN human rights staff urge leadership to declare Israel’s war in Gaza a genocideRead moreThe US statement justifying the new measure echoed claims often repeated by Israeli officials.“Before the PLO and PA can be considered partners for peace, they must consistently repudiate terrorism – including the 7 October massacre – and end incitement to terrorism in education,” it said.The PLO was founded in 1964 as an umbrella organisation for Palestinian factions and recognised a decade later as the sole political representative of the Palestinian people. The PA was set up almost 20 years later as an interim body that would provide an institutional framework for a Palestinian state.Both are likely to be integral to any future Palestinian state. Arab powers, the UK, European countries and others want the PA to take a central role in the administration ofGazaif the conflict can be ended, though they agree it needs reform.Australia, Canada, the UK and Franceare to recognise a Palestinian stateat the UN general assembly next month if certain conditions are met, in a move that has infuriated Israel.Israel’s government has rejected any role for the PA in Gaza and said that recognition “rewards Hamas’s monstrous terrorism”.Though Israel’s government is under mounting pressure at home and abroad to end its offensive in Gaza,Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, has ordered military forces to launch an assault to seize Gaza City. Once a major commercial and cultural hub, it has been reduced to ruins and is home to hundreds of thousands of destitute Palestinians after repeated rounds of fighting.The Israeli offensive has so far killed 63,000 people, mostly civilians, injured 150,000 and displaced the vast majority of the population. The UN last week declared a famine in and around Gaza City, blaming “systematic obstruction” by Israel of humanitarian aid deliveries.“We have begun preliminary operations and the initial stages of the attack on Gaza City, and we are currently operating with great force on the outskirts of the city,” Avichay Adraee, an Israeli military spokesperson, said on X.The war was triggered by a surprise attack by Hamas into Israel in October 2023 which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw 251 abducted. About 50 hostages remain in Gaza, of whom less than half are thought to be still alive.Activists each year press the US to deny visas to leaders of countries that they oppose, often over grave human rights violations, but their appeals are almost always rejected.In a historic step in 1988, the general assembly convened in Geneva rather than New York to hear the then PLO leader, Yasser Arafat, after the US refused to allow him in New York.Additional reporting by AFPExplore more on these topicsUnited NationsPalestinian territoriesGazaIsraelEmmanuel MacronBenjamin NetanyahuDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

He has yet to enter a plea and is on bail until a hearing on 15 October.Other families, MPs and funeral industry organisations have joined Baldwin in calling for urgent action to regulate the sector in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Full statutory regulation is already in place in Scotland.The renewed call comes days after a mother said she was left screaming after seeing her baby’s body propped up in front of the TV at the home of a funeral director in Leeds.Zoe Ward said she had expected her baby son Bleu, who died in hospital in 2021 of brain damage, to be kept in a professional setting instead of the home of Amie Upton, who runs a baby bereavement service that includes providing baby clothing and taking handprints.Upton has since been banned from hospitals in Leeds and had been reported to the police but West Yorkshire police said no crimes had been committed.Baldwin, who does not know whose ashes her family received, said she previously had no idea the industry was subject to no legal requirements.She said: “It’s out of respect and dignity that it needs to be regulated ... It’s easier to open a funeral directors than it is a sandwich shop.”This call was backed by MPs including Mark Sewards and Emma Hardy, whose constituents were affected by the Leeds and Hull cases.It was also supported by the two trade organisations for the funeral industry – the National Association of Funeral Directors (NAFD), which represents a large portion of the profession, and the National Society of Allied and Independent Funeral Directors (SAIF), which tends to represent smaller, family-run funeral directors.About 80% of funeral directors are members of either NAFD or SAIF, which have similar codes of practice and carry out independent inspections, but membership is not compulsory and there is no oversight at all for those who do not join.Both organisations said they had been pushing the government but it needed to move more quickly to regulate.Declan Maguire, the author of a co-regulator proposal that has already been submitted to the government, who is also a member of SAIF’s executive committee, said the organisation was waiting “for government to give us the green light”.He said regulation was working in Scotland, where 10% of the UK’s funerals take place, and the Scottish model could quickly and easily be implemented in the other nations.He added: “It doesn’t take much to get the ball rolling, it just takes a response from government to say: ‘OK, let’s start work.’ We’re ready to go essentially.”Andrew Judd, the chief executive of NAFD, said unlike marriages, of which some people have multiple, “you only get one funeral”.Judd highlighted the Fuller inquiry, held to investigate issues raised after the crimes of hospital maintenance worker David Fuller, who was jailed in 2021 for murdering two women and abusing at least 100 dead women and girls in the mortuary of the now-closed Kent and Sussex hospital and the Tunbridge Wells hospital, over a 15-year period.The inquiry made recommendations including a licensing scheme, mandatory standards and regular inspections.Judd said: “The Fuller inquiry concluded that it’s an urgent matter. And we still haven’t heard anything about what happens next.”He added: “Until we get some kind of formal statute to support the work of trade associations, these things are going to happen. And when they do happen, the consequences last a lifetime.”A government spokesperson said: “We are committed to taking action to ensure the highest standards are always met by funeral directors, and are now considering the full range of options to improve standards.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

It encouraged residents “to consider safer and more appropriate locations for flags or other displays that do not involve highway infrastructure and conform to all appropriate standards and regulations”.In the past few weeks there has been increasing controversy over the number of flags being flown in towns acrossEngland. Some say it is simply a show of national pride and patriotism, while others argue the swell of interest in flying flags is linked to the far right and anti-migrant sentiment. Instances of vandalism have been recorded, including red lines being spray-painted on to white roundabouts to replicate the St George’s cross.View image in fullscreenThe flag of St George painted on to a mini roundabout.Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesCouncils throughout the country have responded in different ways. Some, such as Lib Dem-run Hertfordshire council and Labour-run Brighton council have said that they will remove flags, with Brighton saying that “when it comes to items attached to lamp-posts or defaced roundabouts, it is normal council procedure for these to be removed on a regular basis, in line with our health and safety obligations”.Darren Grimes, a political commentator who is the deputy leader of Durham county council and a member ofReform UK, has repeatedly commented on his X account about flags being flown in England, including a video with the caption: “This isn’t just flying a flag. It’s the start of the fightback.”The Reform MP Lee Anderson has also posted frequently about his desire for more flags to be flown around the country, including a post on Monday showing a letter he had written to the government five years ago, with the caption: “It’s nearly 5 years ago since I wrote to the last government to ask for the Union flag to be flown from every single public building in the UK. I’m still waiting for an answer.”Other posts from Grimes in the past month include him expressing support for union flags being hung from a bridge, while criticising the flying of Pakistani, Palestinian and LGBTQ+ pride flags throughout the country.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The letter says Cooper was “well aware” that the Jewish business in question was a landlord of a subsidiary of the Israeli arms manufacturer Elbit Systems.Additionally, it citesa report in the Timeswhich said Home Office officials had briefed it that Palestine Action “may be funded by Iran”. A Whitehall intelligence assessment released to the high court stated that it was “primarily funded by donations”, including via crowdfunding, and also received revenue through the “sale of merchandise”.The letter states: “This cynical media campaign reflects a fundamental lack of respect for court proceedings, and either indicates an attempt by your client to influence media coverage through assertions which she cannot evidence, or is reflective of a serious breach of her duty of candour in these proceedings …“The proper place for your client to advance her case is in court. Your client’s approach in relation to briefing the media with a wholly different basis for proscription is entirely improper and a breach of her duty to the court. If your client has evidence to support her assertions, this ought to have been disclosed. As she has not, she must cease her misleading campaign immediately.”Last month, Palestine Action becamethe first direct action group to be proscribed, placing it alongside the likes of Islamic State and National Action. This week, Amnesty International UK and Liberty were granted permission to intervene in the judicial review, which is expected to be heard in November.The government has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsPalestine ActionYvette CooperLabourProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

Police said searches of his phone found hundreds of intimate images and videos of women. His filming of his own offending was the key evidence that led to his guilty pleas.Detectives have been able to identify three victims, with three others he was convicted of attacking still unidentified. Police believe his offending could go back years and that there could be many more victims. All of his victims are believed to be of Chinese heritage.Xu owned a recruitment company and would use networking events at his home in Greenwich, south London, to select women to drug and then attack. After one event in June, a woman who had been raped four times went to police.Police believe Xu would spike drinks and then when women felt unwell he would offer them a place to stay. Drugs recovered by police included substances usually used by vets to treat animals. Women said they had the effect of making them drowsy and incapacitated, during which time he attacked them.The offences Xu admitted at Woolwich crown court were four counts of rape, eight counts of assault by penetration, four counts of sexual assault, four counts of voyeurism, two counts of administering a substance with intent, and two counts of operating equipment beneath the clothing of another without consent between February 2022 and June 2025. Two other alleged offences will lie on file.The details of his offending have strong similarities to that ofZhenhao Zou, a Chinese student and serial rapist who drugged many of his victims and who is now serving a life sentence with a minimum term of 24 years.Police are investigating whether there is any link between the two but so far none has been found.Detectives are also talking to counterparts in China about whether they have any information on Xu, who came to Britain in 2013 to study at the University of Greenwich.Police want any women who fear they may have been victims of Xu to contact them. The lead investigator, Det Ch Insp Lewis Sanderson, said: “Xu is a calculated prolific sex offender who has preyed on unsuspecting women using cowardly methods – administering drugs to rape, sexually assault and take intimate images without consent.“Our investigation is ongoing and we continue to examine the large amount of evidence we have collected, which will help identify any further potential victim-survivors. We’re also asking anyone who has any information about Xu or believes they may have been a victim, to come forward – you will be listened to.”Suzanne Crane, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: “Xu is a serious danger to women, and the scale of his offending is such that without the brave testimony of victims who came forward after realising what had happened to them, [it] may well have continued undetected.”Xu was remanded into custody until he is due to be sentenced on 14 November. The judge, Simon Stirling, told him: “You have pleaded guilty to a large number of offences for which the inevitable outcome is a lengthy custodial sentence.”Explore more on these topicsCrimeLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

Reducing the number of meals to which you add salt or ditching it altogether can make a huge difference to your heart health.Potassium increases the amount of salt your body removes from the bloodstream. In a study, scientists set out to understand whether more potassium might benefit people by reducing their cardiovascular risk.The senior study author, Prof Henning Bundgaard, a professor at Copenhagen University hospital, said: “The human body evolved on a potassium-rich, sodium-poor diet – when we were born and raised on the savannah and eating [fruit and vegetables]. We [now] tend to go to [a] modern diet that is processed foods and, the more processed, we see more and more sodium in the food and less potassium, meaning that the ratio between the two has changed from 10:1 to 1:2 – a dramatic change.Should I worry about my salt intake?Read more“Potassium is crucial for cardiac function and we know from observational studies that low potassium increases the risk of arrhythmias and heart failures and death. We also know that potassium can be increased.“The simple question we asked in the trial was: would we benefit the patients by increasing potassium?”The trial involved 1,200 heart patients in Denmark with implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), half of whom were given dietary advice on how to boost their potassium levels.“We have a list [of foods] that we gave to the patients. We followed general dietary instructions – [in Denmark known as] the pyramid of foods. White beets, beetroots, cabbage and so on are all high-content potassium-rich diets. We did not recommend meat, which is also potassium-rich, because it is also rich in sodium and counter-interacts the increase in potassium.”A dietary increase in blood potassium levels was associated with a “significantly lower risk” – 24% – of heart conditions, heart-linked hospitalisation or death from any cause, the results showed. They were presented at the European Society of Cardiology congress in Madrid, the world’s largest heart conference.Bundgaard said: “With a broader view we can say that higher dietary intake of potassium may not only benefit patients with heart disease but probably all of us, so maybe we should all reduce sodium and increase potassium content in our food.”Dr Carrie Ruxton, a dietitian who was not involved with the study, said: “Everyone knows about cutting down on salt, but few people realise that increasing potassium is almost as important for preventing strokes and heart attacks.Constant craving: why we can’t shake the salt habitRead more“The EuropeanFoodSafety Authority highlighted a lack of potassium across Europe as a major diet concern. In the UK, the latest National Diet and Nutrition Survey – published this year – shows that a third of teenagers and a quarter of adults are at risk of potassium deficiency, with implications for blood pressure control and muscle function.“We can do more individually to boost our potassium intakes by eating more fruit, vegetables and fish. Fruit juices are particularly rich in potassium. Other key foods are spinach, lima beans, baked potato, yoghurt, banana and tuna.”Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, a consultant cardiologist and clinical director of the British Heart Foundation, said: “This trial from Denmark found that increasing blood potassium levels into the high normal range in people with ICDs improved patient outcomes, and importantly reduced their chances of needing a shock.“If you’re advised by your doctor to improve your dietary potassium intake, you can do this by including more vegetables and fruit rich in potassium such as spinach, bananas or avocados in your diet, as well as pulses, fish, nuts and seeds.“Don’t be tempted to try to increase your potassium intake with supplements unless supervised by your doctor, as ending up with too high a potassium level is dangerous – for example it can cause cardiac arrest.”Explore more on these topicsHeart diseaseHealthFoodnewsShareReuse this content"

This court ruling was never going to end as a quiet legal moment.For the Home Office, the court of appeal’s decision was a practical win. If the ruling had gone the other way, the government would have been forced to rehouse 138 asylum seekers in a matter of days, opening the floodgates to similar legal challenges from other councils. Since there is scant alternative accommodation available, this ruling buys the government time.Government insiders say that by the end of the year they expect at least five more hotels housing asylum seekers to close, with more to follow in the new year. If the closures proceed, the ruling means they still have time to delivertheir promise of shutting all the hotels down“in a controlled and orderly way” by 2029.But political tensions have, of course, been reignited.Nigel Farageimmediately jumped on the moment, accusing the government of “using the law against the people of Epping”. He said “illegal migrants now have more rights than the people of Essex” and promised Reform UK would “put an end to this”. This is the kind of high-emotion, high-visibility moment Farage thrives on and is a story that plays into his hands.Richard Tice, the deputy leader of Reform UK, also piled in, telling supporters on X: “Judges side with illegal migrants against British people. ECHR used by judges to overrule planning law, democratic protests and the safety of Epping residents.”The government remains stuck in the same political fight: trying to stave off challenges from the right while at the same time getting on with the job of ensuring there is a functioning political project that can communicate its wins.Kemi Badenoch, the opposition leader, has told Tory councils to “keep going” with their legal challenges, despite the court ruling making it clear that protest and local pressure will not count in planning law.Views in her party slant right on the issue, but not exclusively. One senior Conservative MP said: “They’re human beings – they have to live somewhere. For me the issue is: where’s the deterrent?” But another backbencher said: “We have to make it impossible for them to stay open.”Farage had described the mood in the country on Tuesday around the issue of immigration as being “a mix between total despair and rising anger”. Yet he persistently confuses irregular migrants with asylum seekers who are fleeing harm.Recent polling shows the issue is one of voters’ biggest concerns, with a YouGov poll revealing 71% of voters think Keir Starmer is handling the asylum crisis poorly, including a majority of his own supporters. Nearly seven in 10 said immigration levels were too high, which indicates why Farage was able to seize another moment this week to claim a “genuine threat to public order” unless this issue is solved.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But as of Friday evening, the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, had not commented publicly. The last post on X from the official Labour party account is a photo of Farage with the caption: “No plan. No idea.”There is still a long way to go before Labour can look back on what it has achieved in its first parliament. But public mood is shifting faster than policy.This Labour government did inherit a broken system, and a large number of hotels opened by the Conservatives. But it has not stopped the Tories washing their hands of it, or Farage from circling. On the streets outside the Bell hotel, the noise is getting louder, along with fears there could be more protests across the country to come.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumProtestEssexEnglandNigel FarageanalysisShareReuse this content"

Growth was stalling, inflation was galloping, and Labour – back in power after a reckless Conservative administration hadgambled on tax cuts– was in deep trouble.It was 1976, when James Callaghan’s government was forced to go cap in hand to theInternational Monetary Fundfor an emergency loan. Fast forward almost half a century and some economists are drawing obvious parallels.Just as Callaghan’s chancellor, Denis Healey, did before her, Rachel Reeves is facing a challenge to placate jittery global investors. The UK’s long-term borrowing costs have risenclose to their highest level since 1998, adding to pressure on the chancellor before a tough autumn budget.With a lacklustre growth outlook, sticky inflation, and Labour’s welfare U-turns hitting the public finances, most economistsexpect Reeves to announce a raft of tax increasesto cover a shortfall of between £20bn and £40bn against her main, self-imposed, fiscal target.Last weekend the Sunday Telegraph ran an article headlined:Britain heading towards IMF bailout, featuring quotes from three experienced economists comparing the fiscal mess facing the two Labour administrations 49 years apart.However, for most economists, comparisons with Healey’s begging-bowl plea to the global lender of last resort are significantly overblown.“You can quote me as saying that is complete nonsense… something like that is just hysteria,” said Michael Saunders, a former member of the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee. “That is not to say the UK does not have a weak fiscal position. It does. But it is somewhere well between that and an IMF bailout.”Back in the autumn of 1976, inflation was running close to 17%, having hit a postwar high of almost 25% a year earlier; it forced the Bank to drive interest rates up to 15%. Sterling was in freefall and the UK government faced a buyers’ strike among investors who would normally purchase its bonds, known as gilts.This week the Treasurysold £5bn of three-year giltsto institutional investors in an auction that was more than three times oversubscribed. The pound has strengthened against other major currencies this year. Inflation ison track to peak at 4%, up from3.8% currently, economic growth in the first half of 2025 was the fastest in the G7, and Threadneedle Streetcut interest ratesthis month by a quarter-point, to 4%.Benchmarking things to the 1970s, is, though, a mainstay of British political discourse. The IMF bailout episode became synonymous with national humiliation, and led to Labour’s 1979 defeat and long exile from government.Jagjit Chadha, a Cambridge university economist and former director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr), who was quoted by the Telegraph, said it could not be predicted whether an IMF loan was required. But he warned the UK’s “unsustainable path” should not be underplayed. “We need to address this risk not devalue it,” he said.At the Treasury, the most painful episode in postwar economic history remains burned into the institutional memory. Within weeks of Labour’s return to power last year, officials briefed ministers with a25-minute PowerPoint presentationon the importance of keeping markets onside.Liz Truss triggering a meltdown in the market for UK government debt with her September 2022 mini-budget had been a potent reminder of the fragile conditions in markets, and underscored Britain’s delicate position.Baked into the rise in government borrowing costs are several ingredients.graphView image in fullscreenJames Callaghan and Denis Healey in July 1976.Photograph: Evening Standard/GettyAfter a succession of shocks – from the 2008 financial crisis, to Brexit and the Covid pandemic – the UK’s national debt has risen to the highest level as a share of GDP since the 1960s. The return of high inflation and the end of rock-bottom interest rates has made servicing those debts more expensive. An ageing population and political pressure to mend battered public services has added to the strain.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Although it is cutting rates, the central bank is also selling UK government bonds to unwind its crisis-era quantitative easing scheme, adding to the supply of debt investors are being called on to buy.Earlier this month, Threadneedle Street admitted for the first time that this had contributed to the rise in the UK’s long-term borrowing costs. At its next policy meeting on 18 September, the Bank will decide whether to reduce its sales over the next 12 months. Most economists believe a reduction is likely.Britain is not alone in facing challenges. Borrowing costs have risen across advanced economies, in part because of Donald Trump’s trade wars and his assault on the independence of the US Federal Reserve. Several other countries are seen as running unsustainable fiscal policies,including France, where Emmanuel Macron’s government is in crisis.Chris Scicluna, a former Treasury economist who is now head of research at the Japanese bank Daiwa Capital Markets Europe, said the UK was more reliant on overseas investors to buy its debt than some other countries were.“Debt stocks are much higher than they used to be. Therefore governments need to be offering higher yields to attract buyers, and there’s no shortage – whether from the US, euro area or Japan – and unfortunately the UK has to compete to attract investors.”Many investors believe that Reeves has made a rod for her own back. Labour promising before the general election not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT has left big revenue-raisers off limits. Labour’s welfare U-turns show that further spending restraint is not an option.Neil Mehta, a hedge fund manager at RBC BlueBay Asset Management, said: “The government can’t contain spending or tax effectively without breaking manifesto rules. No one wants to make the tough political choices. If we continue like this the market will act as the enforcer, like it has done many times in the past.”The trouble for Reeves is that raising taxes to balance the books could undermine economic growth. Her previous measures also stoked inflation. That in turn would be viewed negatively in financial markets, in what some economists refer to as an effective doom loop.Andrew Sentance, a former MPC member, said that comparisons to the 1970s were valid, but that suggesting an impending IMF bailout was hyperbole.“I do not think in the UK’s case we are heading for an IMF bailout,” he told the Guardian. “You have a cocktail of problems which is very reminiscent of the 1970s. Does that mean we have to go to the IMF? No, not necessarily. Does it mean there is some kind of reckoning in terms of an economic crisis coming up, of some sort? Yes, that’s quite likely.”Explore more on these topicsEconomic policyGiltsBondsInflationEconomicsEconomic growth (GDP)Budget deficitanalysisShareReuse this content"

Now a rising star, he talks about growing up, embracing discomfort and forging his own pathFri 29 Aug 2025 08.00 EDTShareWhen Cooper Hoffman was in his teens, he didn’t have any grand plans for the future, though there was one thing he knew for sure: he did not want to be an actor. Why? “I didn’t want to do it because my dad did it so well, and it felt like I’d be going up against him. It would feel like I was inherently stepping into something competitive.”Given Hoffman’s father isPhilip Seymour Hoffman, Oscar-winning star of Boogie Nights, Almost Famous, The Master and Capote, you can see why he would feel that way. But then Paul Thomas Anderson, the Boogie Nights director who is a friend of the family, and whose children Cooper played with when he was growing up, asked him if he would read for a part. It was the lead in the 2021 film Licorice Pizza, about a teenage boy smitten with a woman in her mid-20s. It would not just be his first starring role, but his first role in anything. Hoffman ended up taking the job and was nominated for a Golden Globe for his efforts. In the years since, he says, he’s come to realise he’s not in competition with his dad at all. “I’m just doing the same thing he did, but in my own way.”Talking via video call from his publicist’s offices in Los Angeles, Hoffman – who is now 22 – is articulate, self-possessed and subtly cautious with his answers; he keeps them brief and is not afraid of silence. This feels understandable, given the interest not just in him but in his father, who died from a drug overdose in 2014. Dressed in a pale blue sweater, with his sweep of strawberry blond hair arranged just so, Hoffman already has what you might call a Hollywood sheen. Since his screen debut four years ago, he has evolved from apple-cheeked youngster, at once goofy and charming, to serious adult actor with an enviable CV. Yet, much like his dad, there’s a softness and vulnerability to his features that is far removed from the average chisel-jawed screen hero.View image in fullscreenBig strides … Cooper Hoffman and David Jonsson in The Long Walk.Photograph: Murray Close/LionsgateHe is here to talk about The Long Walk, the film based on the first novel written by Stephen King in the late 60s, when he was 19. Initially rejected by publishers, the book didn’t see the light of day until 1979, by which time King was a bestselling author. Set in a dystopian America, the novel tells of a brutal walking contest undertaken by a group of teenage boys who must maintain a speed of 4mph (3mph in the film). Those who slow down or stop get three warnings; then, if they don’t resume the required pace, they are shot dead. The winner is the last boy alive, who is granted a single wish and a life-changing cash prize.The adaptation, directed by the Hunger Games’ Francis Lawrence, follows the progress of the entire group, though the drama centres in particular on Hoffman as teenager Ray Garraty, who has entered the competition despite the pleas of his mother, and fellow frontrunner Peter McVries, played by David Jonsson. The pair swap stories, share confidences and develop a sweet fraternal bond. Save for the odd flashback, the entire film plays out on the road, as the walkers deal with debilitating cramp, bleeding feet and exhaustion, all while watching their peers get ruthlessly picked off. Hoffman says he is loth to complain about the filming schedule, which occurred in sequence and required him and his co-stars to walk several miles per day while wearing less than ideal footwear.I want to do things that feel difficult. I get overambitious and want to do a trial by fire“Yeah, my boots couldn’t hack it,” he smiles. “I mean, it was hard but we were just making a movie, you know? We’re not solving cancer. But it was incredibly uncomfortable. You’re wearing a lot of clothes in hot weather and walking for hours so your feet hurt at the end of the day.”With most of the cast members in their teens or early 20s, there was a camaraderie on set that Hoffman notes was “in no way competitive. You showed up to the table reading, and you showed up to the first day of walking, and you looked around and you’re like: ‘Everyone’s really doing this. I’ve got to show up for them.’”Hoffman and Jonsson’s characters do what they can to boost morale and offer a helping hand. But there is a darkness to Hoffman’s Garraty, whose participation in the walk is connected to his grief at the premature death of his dad. That can’t have been a stretch, I say, given his own experience. “Yes, of course,” Hoffman replies, his lack of hesitation suggesting he’s anticipated this line of questioning. “It’s hard not to think about it when it’s on the page, when it’s right there in front of you. But as an actor, you have to look at it truthfully. And to attach all of my burden on to this character would be wrong, because my situation is different to his. Yes, we share a commonality, but it happened in very different ways.”View image in fullscreenCourt in the act … Cooper Hoffman with his father, Philip Seymour Hoffman, at a basketball game in New York in 2013.Photograph: James Devaney/FilmMagicHoffman was just 10 years old when his father died. To watch his dad on screen now, he says, “is great. He’s a great actor, but the characters he plays aren’t him.” To lose a parent so young, he says, “is a hard thing to go through”. He pauses. “What I will say is that my favourite movie of his is The Master, and I watch that quite frequently. I very much enjoy seeing his face in that movie.”Though Hoffman caught the acting bug comparatively late, he and his younger sisters, Tallulah and Willa, grew up in New York immersed in the worlds of film and theatre. His mother is Mimi O’Donnell, a former costume designer who now works in podcasting. She and Seymour Hoffman met when he was directing a stage production of In Arabia We’d All Be Kings. O’Donnell wrote about her late husband and their family life forVogue in 2017, and recalled his request that the family never be apart for more than two weeks at a time, even when he was filming. “More than once,” she wrote, remembering the period after Cooper was born, “I found myself asking, ‘You want to bring the baby to what?’ Or, ‘You want us to come to Winnipeg in the winter while you’re shooting?” And he’d say, ‘Just bring him. We all need to be together.’”Hoffman smiles. “Yeah, that was our version of ‘bring your son or daughter to work day’,” though he adds that he was so little he has few memories of those visits. He can just about recall going to the Oscars with his father and hating the afterparty. “To be fair, again, I don’t remember a lot of it. I don’t think I liked the Oscars [ceremony] either, just because of how young I was and I had to sit still for a long time and wear a suit that I didn’t want to wear. But I don’t feel that way now.”View image in fullscreenSlice of luck … Cooper Hoffman in the 2021 film Licorice Pizza.Photograph: Melinda Sue Gordon/MGM PicturesBefore acting took over, Hoffman had a handful of jobs that included being a general dogsbody at a bar in New York near the family home. “I would come in every day before the bar would open and set up, because I wasn’t actually allowed to be there when they were serving alcohol.” During the actors’ strike two years ago, he briefly got a job in construction, which he was surprised to find he enjoyed, and where he “made a lot of friends”.He was 17 when he was cast in Licorice Pizza, in which he played teenage actor turned entrepreneur Gary Valentine, who falls for a photographer’s assistant (played by musician and fellow screen newbie Alana Haim). TheNew Yorkerhailed Haim and Hoffman’s “high-intensity yet gracefully poised performances”, while theGuardian’s Peter Bradshawcalled Hoffman “eerily assured”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Even though being on set felt “more natural than I expected it to be”, the experience was “like boot camp. You’re getting told what a mark is. You’re getting told where to look, about eyelines and how to walk and what kind of little tricks [camera technicians] use to make something work. You’re in this wonderland of film, being in a Paul Thomas Anderson movie, and it’s something that I realise is an immense privilege.” While he tried not to think too hard about how his performance was being received, there were times when “I was just freaking out. I threw up one day on set because of how nervous I was. There was an inherent fear of messing up and being looked at.”He still gets nervous when auditioning, likening it to getting ready for a date. “You shower, you make sure you smell nice and look nice, you want to come in and be your charismatic self, and then you want to wow them with your acting. And then the audition ends and you’re like: ‘Well, I hope they like me as much as I like them.’” After Licorice Pizza, Hoffman enrolled at an acting school in New York, largely because “everyone was telling me to go to”, but ended up leaving halfway through. “I found I just didn’t want to be in school. I wanted to go act.”Luckily, since Licorice Pizza, the jobs have kept coming. He was NBC executive Dick Ebersol in last year’s Saturday Night, which told the origin story of Saturday Night Live, and played a rookie hitman alongside Christoph Waltz in Old Guy. At the start of this year, he made his off-Broadway stage debut in Sam Shepard’s Curse of the Starving Class, about a family down on their luck. After years spent watching plays and musicals, he had long thought theatre was “a brave thing to do. And I was like: ‘I want to be that brave and earn my stripes.’” Once again, he was thrown in the deep end; the play featured a live sheep on stage. “And I had to get naked and walk across the stage and kill it,” he says, with an amused sigh.Hoffman has noticed a pattern in himself where, he says, “I get overambitious a lot of the time and want to do a trial by fire. I didn’t train, so I needed to learn on the job. I kept finding myself wanting to do things that felt difficult. [With the play] it would sometimes feel incredible and sometimes it would feel like the worst thing ever.”A similar thing happened with the upcoming film I Want Your Sex, an erotic thriller where he stars alongside Olivia Wilde and Charli xcx. He plays Elliot, a young man who takes a job as a sexual muse to a renowned artist, played by Wilde. “She plays my dominatrix,” he says, with a look that suggests he was several miles outside his comfort zone. Did he surprise himself? “Yes, I did. I’m pretty proud of myself on that one. It’s one of those things where you’re so uncomfortable in a scene, but the character has to be enjoying it. It’s so hard to get yourself to a place of enjoyment when there’s a lot of people in the room seeing something vulnerable happen. But I feel like I did get there.”Asked if he thinks he is a born actor, and whether acting talent can be inherited, Hoffman pauses and shakes his head. “I think that puts too much of a lock on what an actor can or cannot be. Just because you’re born into something doesn’t mean you have it, and just because you’re not doesn’t mean you don’t.” On the inevitable comparisons with his father, he says: “My mom gave me the best acting advice I’ve been given, which was: ‘You’re enough.’ She said: ‘The reason why people will watch you, the reason people will care about you, is because of you and the life that you’ve lived.’ And you know, I think that’s true.”The Long Walk is in cinemas on 12 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmPhilip Seymour HoffmaninterviewsShareReuse this content"

But, much like the other recent potential schmaltzfestMy Mom Jayne(Mariska Hargitay’s film about her mother, Jayne Mansfield, who died in a car crash when Hargitay was three), it turns out unexpectedly well. Yes, Sawyer does not help. She is the doyenne of the sympathetic/emetic head tilt and master of the pained expression. Her furrowed brow invites us to imagine she is being forced at gunpoint to ask the intimate questions her producers and the lowest common denominator demand, and her self-penned scripts are inexcusable. “His quiet dream girl shared his working-class values though they were from wildly different backgrounds,” she intones softly over photos and footage of the film star and his soon-to-be fiancee, Emma Heming, from their early days together, “before the joyful ride began”. Alas: “No one in life knows when there is a shadow about to creep in.”The shadow here, of course, is Willis’s diagnoses in the last few years, first with aphasia – after which he announced his retirement from acting – and then with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), a rare form of dementia, for which life expectancy is generally five to eight years.The 40-minute programme (once ads are stripped out) contains highlight reels of Willis’s career, reminding us of his bullish charm as a 29-year-old star on the rise in Moonlighting, his astonishing charisma as the action hero of the Die Hard franchise, and of his finer-grained work in the likes of The Sixth Sense and Pulp Fiction. There are also clips of his forays into music, lots of lovely video footage and photographs of him as a clearly devoted family man (his divorce from Demi Moore and relations between the first and second iterations of the clan have been amicable).We get glimpses of the lives of others with FTD and their carers, as well as contributions about the nature of the disease from Dr Bruce Miller, an expert in the field (who does not treat Willis, so there can be no breaching of confidentiality).But at its heart is the interview with Emma Heming-Willis, who comes across as a poised, thoughtful, articulate woman struggling under an enormous burden of grief and responsibility. She talks carefully but honestly about Willis’s health and says she first noticed something was wrong when her hitherto endlessly warm and affectionate husband started to withdraw from her and the children and become indifferent to people. FTD, explains Miller, attacks the parts of the brain responsible for empathy and language first, and removes the patient’s awareness of their deterioration.Heming-Willis talks with striking bleakness about how hard it is to remember the fun they used to have and how it is less distressing to focus on the status quo than to look back. “The sadness, grief, resentment is a common thread we all share,” she says of her fellow carers. She urges people to consider that, if it is hard for her with all the support and resources at her disposal, how much harder it must be for those who have to manage virtually alone.Nevertheless, and though it sounds almost Sawyeresquely trite, the love shines through. From Willis himself in the photos and the family videos, from Heming-Willis as she speaks about him, from the anecdotes and memories of meeting Moore and the three children from that marriage, and the photos of all the girls with their dad at various times – including recent ones from his new home, a bungalow in which he lives with round-the-clock care. Although, says Heming-Willis, he is mobile and physically healthy, his language has virtually gone and because of the damage FTD wreaks on the parts of the brain that identify and recognise risk, patients are no longer safe alone.It is a heartbreaking story, repeated in families around the world. The number of people with dementia – in its various forms, united by their remorseless cruelty – is set to triple by 2050. “It is,” says Miller, “the disease of our age”. That Heming-Willis is using her resources to look outwards, raise awareness and ameliorate such hardship as she can is a measure of the woman – and perhaps, too, of the man who loved her so.Emma and Bruce Willis: The Unexpected Journey is on Disney+Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewBruce WillisDocumentaryFactual TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

In the hearing, he sought to challenge the cancellation of his driver’s licence.Freeman, who has described himself as a photographer and “homeless disability pensioner”, was disqualified from driving for two years after refusing to submit to a drug test and for using a mobile phone while driving.He described the serious hardship caused to himself and his family by the loss of his driver’s licence, and claimed there had been “years of homelessness and being constantly attacked by police”.“The stress, hardships, injustice, misery and poverty exacerbated by not being able to drive affects us all,” Freeman wrote. His application for judicial review was dismissed.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailFreeman has a history of run-ins with law enforcement andhas sharedin the past some forms of pseudo-legal beliefs, where adherents make arguments that deny the authority of the state.Golden ticket to guns: police want Australia’s laws tightened to stem abuse of firearms licencesRead morePolice confirmed on Friday that Freeman’s gun licence remained revoked at the time he allegedly killed two officers and injured another at his high country property on Tuesday.Pseudo-legal beliefs grounds for cancellationAs part of itsinvestigation into gun control, Guardian Australia has found pseudo-legal ideas are an issue in firearm disputes across the country, with police in some cases citing “sovereign citizen” beliefs as grounds to cancel licences and remove weapons.Freeman’s disdain for authority appears to be extreme, but at the other end of the spectrum, police have raised concerns about the use of sovereign citizen arguments for several years.One Queensland man’s firearm licence was cancelled after police received correspondence indicating he held “sovereign citizen beliefs”, including that “the laws in force in Queensland” did not apply to him.The man had attempted to arrest a policeman and filed “voluminous” material appealing against his licence revocation, including claims that a certificate of birth registration was designed “to fraudulently turn a child into property of the Reserve Bank”.In another Queensland case, a woman caught speeding used language in a letter to police that “indicated she held sovereign citizen ideologies”, according to court documents.“She effectively asserted that the Queensland police had no authority to fine her for speeding, and that she was not the named person on the infringement notice but rather her ‘strawman’ name was what appeared thereon.”A “strawman” name is what some adherents to pseudo-law believe is created when their name is written in all capital letters on a birth certificate. They claim this identity is separate legally from their actual identity, and they use this argument to reject the authority of governments and courts.Police then took the step of cancelling her firearm licence, but she successfully overturned the decision, admitting that her use of these arguments was misguided and wrong.View image in fullscreenScenes from the operation centre outside Porepunkah as part of the manhunt for self-proclaimed sovereign citizen, Dezi Freeman.Photograph: Stuart Walmsley/The GuardianIn another matter, Queensland police cancelled a man’s firearm licence on suspicion he was “an adherent to pseudo-law beliefs”, however the tribunal found there was no evidence he’d held such beliefs and found he was a fit and proper person.It’s unclear how often pseudo-legal beliefs play a role in licence revocations across all states and territories, as police forces do not routinely report reasons for firearm licence cancellation.Australia’s gun lobby says it’s ‘winning’ the fight against firearm control as numbers surgeRead more‘You’re on sovereign ground’In other cases, adherents to pseudo-legal ideologies have been able to arm themselves without a licence.In early November 2022, police approached a property in Binnaway in NSW intending to arrest the resident in relation to an intimidation charge.On arrival, police found a house signposted with a “sovereign land” plaque. The offender told police that he would not leave his home. “You’re on sovereign ground, you will be neutralised if you fucking hurt me, or try and do anything to me,” he said.After a 12-hour standoff, police attempted to enter the house and the offender fired a shot at police, hitting an officer’s ballistic shield.He was not licensed to own a firearm, but was found with a prohibited .22 calibre long rifle, another bolt-action rifle and a .410 single shot shotgun.After eventually being arrested, the man was sentenced to six years’ prison, with the judge finding his mental health, affected by the death of his son, moderated his level of moral culpability. However, the judge noted that: “The offender maintains his sovereign citizen beliefs which often arouse tension when interacting with any branch of government or authority”.In another case, a man affiliated with a pseudo-legal group was charged with firearm offences after a police raid found firearms and ammunition hidden inside a piano. He was also not a licensed firearm owner.At the time of sentencing, the judge said that the group he led “promotes a sovereign citizen ideology”.Government warned of threat posed by conspiracy theories and gunsIn 2022, former Victorian Greens leader, Samantha Ratnam, secured the support of the Victorian government to establish a parliamentary inquiry into far-right extremism. While the inquiry was borne out of concerns about the rise of neo-Nazi activity, it also identified the growth of the ‘sovereign citizen’ movement during the pandemic, “in opposition to public health orders like vaccine and mask mandates and stay-at-home restrictions”.The inquiry found violent extremism posed a risk to politicians and public figures in Victoria, with access to firearms “obtained legally or illegally” by members of far-right groups a “significant concern”.View image in fullscreenDezi Freeman has a history of run-ins with law enforcement and has shared in the past some forms of pseudo-legal beliefs.Photograph: SuppliedAmong its 12 recommendations was to advocate for a national firearms database and review of the state Firearms Act, to expand the fit and proper person test to prevent people who are members of violent extremist groups obtaining a licence.The government accepted the recommendation but said the law already allowed police to refuse licence applications to members of extremist groups.Why the Australian gun lobby says it’s ‘winning’ – podcastRead moreRatnam has described the response as “lacklustre”.“The government hasn’t taken the threat seriously, they just haven’t moved with the urgency that it necessitated. We were sounding the alarm because we could see it happening, we saw some of the thinking that was coming out of these groups first-hand,” she said.Her successor, Ellen Sandell, urged the government to revisit the recommendation.“The experts have given us the roadmap for how to stop the rise of far-right extremism and conspiracy theorists – now the Labor government must act,” Sandell said.However, the Victorian government’s position hasn’t changed.“Victoria has strong laws in relation to gun ownership and storage,” a government spokesperson said.They said there were early intervention schemes across prisons and community corrections services to combat signs of radicalisation, as well as programs in schools to address racism and racial discrimination.Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsOff targetAustralian politicsShareReuse this content"

I’m like … a psychopath. Genuinely!” A teenage girl with the face of an angel is confiding in Mr Wilson, one of the student managers. He listens solemnly, but his mouth twitches with the beginnings of a smile.“I’m going to start by disagreeing with you,” he says with all the seriousness he can muster. “You’re not a psychopath.” The girl in the sky-blue hoodie relaxes and rewards him with a broad smile.Welcome back to Thornhill Community academy on the outskirts of Dewsbury for EducatingYorkshirePart 2, where once again the 900 pupils – witty, sensitive, smart, vulnerable and endlessly engaging – are the standout stars of the series.Much has changed in schools sinceChannel 4last filmed at Thornhill more than a decade ago. TikTok, vapes, Andrew Tate, gender-questioning, anxiety, mobile phones and high levels of school absence are now everyday issues across the sector. And of course there was Covid – the biggest disruptor to education since the second world war.View image in fullscreenHeadteacher Mr Burton and deputy head Mrs Ali meet the challenges of school with warmth and humour.Photograph: Tom Martin/Channel 4Negotiating these challenges is Matthew Burton, 42, the inspirational English teacher from the last series who moved the entire nation with his efforts to help Musharaf, a year 11 student, overcome his stammer. He is now headteacher.A decade on he strides around Thornhill in his new hi-vis gilet, with the words “Work hard, be nice” emblazoned on his back, his warmth, humour and enthusiasm undimmed.“Nobody goes into teaching for life to be easy, because schools aren’t,” he said in an interview with the Guardian. “There’s lots of complexities to being in schools and being a teacher, but also, it’s such a unique profession.“You genuinely get the chance 99 times out of a 100 to go home at the end of the day having done something positive for somebody, and there aren’t that many professions where you get that opportunity.”Mr Burton has allowed the cameras back into his now-famous secondary school because there’s a teacher recruitment crisis in education and he wants to help. He wants everyone to know what a great profession it is and how brilliant it is to work with young people.View image in fullscreenRiley in year 8 wants to know why he can’t sit still.Photograph: Tom Martin / Channel 4“Some of the stuff around schools and education can be really challenging as a teacher to read and it doesn’t always align with my thinking,” he says. “It is a fantastic, fantastic profession.“These are the remarkable and amazing young people who you’re working with. This is what it’s about – speaking on behalf of the profession, demonstrating some of the challenges but also some of the absolutely fantastic things that happen in schools.”So what has changed since the first series was broadcast in 2013? “One of the biggest changes has been how much technology has advanced,” he says promptly. “Children are going round with mobile phones in their pockets which are incredibly powerful computers that can effectively do pretty much anything you want them to.”View image in fullscreenAmy in year 8 feels deeply about her friendship group.Photograph: Tom Martin/Channel 4In one episode, where pupils are discussing screen time, it emerges that some children are on their mobile phone for more than 15 hours a day, despite a school-wide ban. “If it’s seen, heard or used it’s confiscated, and that’s the bottom line,” says Burton.In other scenes a boy is found hiding a vape down his trousers, AI proves a growing challenge and teachers find themselves dealing with the long tail of Covid, supporting growing numbers of pupils with mental health issues and special educational needs.Episode one features Riley in year 8, who’s blond, bright and getting in trouble. “What happens in my head, it’s just a mess,” he says, wide-eyed. His mum thinks he has attention deficit hyperactive disorder; the school wonders if it’s his diet and experiments with reducing his sugar. Riley just wants to know why he can’t sit still.View image in fullscreenMr Geary teaching a class.Photograph: Tom Martin/Channel 4Then there’s Amy, also year 8, who goes to school only for the hash browns (“sent from the heavens above”) and her friends. But the stresses and strains of teenage friendship sometimes prove too much for her. She has developed tics and often wanders into the student manager’s office. “In my friendship group I want everyone to be happy,” she says sadly after being blanked by one of her mates.“One of the things that always impresses me about students is how aware of their emotions they are and how emotionally literate they are and vulnerable when they need that support,” said 42-year-old Burton, now a father to three children. “I don’t think we’ve ever had a generation of young people who will be as open about wanting and needing that support and that help.”But it’s hard. Times have changed, even since the last series and life for many children has become more challenging. “The world’s different, isn’t it?” says Burton. “It’s a very complex place to be in, a very complex time to live.”Educating Yorkshire Part 2is on Channel 4 on Sunday at 8pmExplore more on these topicsTelevisionDocumentaryYorkshireChannel 4Young peopleSchoolsSecondary schoolsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Mr Burton has stepped up to become head teacher. It’s an insight into how things have changed over the past decade: from the teen anxiety epidemic to exam pressure, slashed budgets, a teacher recruitment crisis, falling attendance numbers and the impact of smartphones and social media.

In How Are You?, Partridge flies back to the UK after a 12-month trip to Saudi Arabia and realises that he isn’t as happy as he thinks. What follows is a state-of-the-nation mental health documentary, presented by a man with one eye on his career.

Need we say more? Lorraine Ashbourne, Joanna Scanlan, Amelia Bullmore, Tamsin Greig and Rosalie Craig are our riotous rockers with plenty to shout about. With Wainwright saying it’s the most exciting thing she’s worked on to date, it’s set to be an absolute hoot.BBC One, OctoberPluribusFans have been eagerly waiting for show runner Vince Gilligan to venture outside the New Mexico milieu he conjured up so unforgettably in Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul. Well, unlucky. His new project is also set in Albuquerque – albeit a starkly contrasting one. In this darkly comic, genre-straddling sci-fi series, Rhea Seehorn (AKA Better Call Saul’s Kim Wexler) stars as “the most miserable person on Earth” who “must save the world from happiness”. Hopes are high for a Severance-style mind-bender. As Gilligan says: “There’s no crime, no methamphetamine. It’s going to be fun and different.”Apple TV+, 7 NovemberThe Beast in MeView image in fullscreenA delight … Claire Danes and Matthew Rhys in The Beast in Me.Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix © 2025Homeland fans, assemble!

But when a man notorious for his wife’s disappearance (played by Matthew Rhys) moves in next door, she becomes obsessed. Looks like she may have found the subject of her next book.Netflix, 13 NovemberThe Beatles AnthologyThirty years after it first aired on British television, The Beatles Anthology series – known as the definitive documentary on the Fab Four – has been remastered by Peter Jackson’s production company. It also has previously unseen material in a brand new ninth episode, with behind-the-scenes footage showing Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr coming together for the release of the original show. And for the superfans, it will be accompanied by an album boxset with session outtakes and demos.Disney+, 26 NovemberStranger ThingsView image in fullscreenThe end is nigh … Gaten Matarazzo as Dustin, Finn Wolfhard as Mike, Caleb McLaughlin as Lucas, and Noah Schnapp as Will in Stranger Things.Photograph: NetflixThe end of Stranger Things is likely to be the television event of the year, which might explain why Netflix is eking it out so slowly. The first four episodes drop in November, with three more following on Christmas Day and the finale on New Year’s Eve. Details are scant, but expect a maximalist spectacle as the Upside Down comes for Hawkins itself; more action, more characters, more monsters and more runtime than ever before.Netflix, 26 NovemberFalloutView image in fullscreenBuckle up for one hell of a ride … Aaron Moten as Maximus in Fallout.Photograph: Lorenzo Sisti/PrimeThis super-fun and stupidly violent video game adaptation about survival in a post-apocalyptic world was a blast to watch last year.

With Macaulay Culkin and Justin Theroux joining the cast and juicy backstories to discover, buckle up for one hell of a ride.Prime Video, 17 DecemberAll Her FaultSuccession’s Sarah Snook acts in and executive produces this Andrea Mara adaptation, about a woman who discovers that her son is missing.

When the 25-year-old arrives in Vienna ready for superstardom, his radical talent sends religious court composer Antonio Salieri (Paul Bettany) into a tailspin – and he vows to bring Mozart down.

Adjani Salmon’s tale of a struggling Black film-maker trying to make it in the industry was surreal, hilarious and packed with so many barbs at the privilege endemic to the world of TV it’s amazing it ever got made. And now it’s back for a second attempt at ripping up the rulebook. This time round, its lead is producing period dramas in an era when production companies supposedly champion diversity – except things aren’t quite like that …BBC, date TBCFilm ClubView image in fullscreenMore than just friends? … Aimee Lou Wood and Nabhaan Rizwan in Film Club.Photograph: Ben Blackall/BBCShe’s already had a stellar 2025 with The White Lotus and Toxic Town.

She now teams up with Doctor Who’sJodie Whittakerfor this six-part heist thriller. Having spent the past 10 years in a Spanish prison, skilled confidence trickster Jones is released on compassionate grounds after a cancer diagnosis and reunites with former criminal sidekick Whittaker for one last job – a multimillion-pound art theft. A zippy tale of crime capers and complex female friendship, set in the picturesque mountains of southern Spain.ITV1, date TBCMaliceBased on talent alone, Malice should be enough to make you pay attention. Written by James Wood (of the deathlessly wonderful Rev), this is a psychological thriller about a male nanny who infiltrates a rich family with bad intentions. The parents are played by David Duchovny and Carice van Houten, and the nanny – wait for it – by Jack Whitehall. Malice represents an intriguing turn to drama for Whitehall. If he can stick the landing, this should be great.Prime Video, date TBCMr ScorseseView image in fullscreenIt doesn’t get any more A-list than this … Mr Scorsese.Photograph: Melinda Sue Gordon/AppleAfter decades making documentaries and movies about other people,Martin Scorsesegets a series all about himself. This definitive five-part portrait covers his life and work from his student years to the present day. Director Rebecca Miller was granted “unrestricted access” to Scorsese’s personal archives and describes the project as “one of the defining experiences of my life as a film-maker”. The call sheet of interviewees – Sharon Stone, Jodie Foster, Margot Robbie, Cate Blanchett, Robert De Niro, Mick Jagger, Steven Spielberg, Daniel Day-Lewis, Leonardo DiCaprio – couldn’t be any more A-list.Apple TV+, date TBCSmall ProphetsView image in fullscreenExtremely special … Pearce Quigley and Lauren Patel in Small Prophets.Photograph: Matt Squire/BBCFollowing Detectorists and Worzel Gummidge comes Mackenzie Crook’s intriguing new comedy. A Manchester man with a missing girlfriend is given a recipe for a potion that allows him to tell the future. Given Crook’s fondness for folky pastoral textures, Small Prophets – which features animated sequences and a rare yet welcome acting turn from Michael Palin – sounds like it could end up being extremely charming and special.BBC, date TBCThe BeautyProlific show runner Ryan Murphy takes a break from true crime and camp horror to adapt a graphic novel into a Black Mirror-ish conspiracy drama. An STI dubbed “The Beauty” makes those infected more physically attractive but eventually kills them. Is it part of a sinister government plot? Why are the detective duo investigating the disease’s origins being targeted by federal agents, corrupt politicians and a ruthless assassin? Evan Peters, Rebecca Hall, Jeremy Pope and Anthony Ramos star, while Ashton Kutcher appears as a tech billionaire.Disney+,date TBCThe Chair CompanyExpect this comedy from multiple Emmy-winning comedian Tim Robinson to vibrate with the same hilariously awkward energy as his sketch show I Think You Should Leave. It follows an employee who undergoes an embarrassing workplace incident, only to end up investigating a far-reaching conspiracy. Which sounds a lot like the setup for an ITYSL sketch – unsurprising given the show is co-created by Zach Kanin, the other co-writer of the Netflix hit. Brace yourself for an entire series of brilliant cringe comedy.Sky/Now, date TBCThe Death of Bunny MunroView image in fullscreenBrace yourself for excellence … Rafael Mathé and Matt Smith in The Death of Bunny Munro.Photograph: SkyIf you can remember how flat-out incredible Channel 4’s Somewhere Boy was, then be doubly prepped for excellence here. That show’s writer, Pete Jackson, has adapted Nick Cave’s darkly tender 2009 novel into a six-part series, about a sex-addicted travelling salesman who travels around East Sussex with his son under the shadow of an approaching serial killer. Matt Smith stars too, if you needed any further convincing.Sky Atlantic/Now, date TBCThe HackView image in fullscreenBehind the headlines … Toby Jones as journalist Alan Rusbridger in The Hack.Photograph: ITVToby Jones and David Tennant star as the Guardian journalists who broke the phone-hacking scandal that ended up shutting down the News of the World in a drama that goes behind the headlines. But alongside that, it weaves in the story of Daniel Morgan, the private investigator found murdered by axe in a pub car park in 1987. Writer Jack Thorne describes it as “a fight for the truth” that matters so much in our “age where the truth seems more in danger than ever”. Given that it’s created by the team behind Mr Bates vs the Post Office, we expect nothing less.ITV1, date TBCThe Iris AffairView image in fullscreenUnapologetically exciting … Tom Hollander and Niamh Algar in The Iris Affair.Photograph: Matteo Graia/SkyLuther proved that Neil Cross is at his very best when he’s serving us heightened genre thrills, which is exactly what The Iris Affair sounds like. An “unapologetically exciting” chase thriller set in Italy, it pits Niamh Algar’s enigmatic genius against Tom Hollander’s wealthy tech entrepreneur. Cross promises that Iris is “a lead character the like of which I don’t think we’ve ever met before on TV,” but, even if we have, at least it’ll be pretty to look at.Sky/Now, date TBCThe Night ManagerNine years have elapsed since this adaptation of John le Carré’s novel gripped the UK. Tom Hiddleston’s return as the army-trained luxury hotelier turned informant makes this second series (and an upcoming third) a tantalising prospect, despite no longer being based on Le Carré’s writing. The latter shouldn’t matter a jot, though, if it can recapture the most captivating watercooler moment of its first outing. We’re talking, of course, about the infamous sex scene that became known as “Hiddlebum”.BBC, date TBCThe Seven Dials MysteryAlmost a century on from its original publication, Agatha Christie’s detective novel has been granted a lavish Netflix adaptation. Adapted by Chris Chibnall, the series will count Martin Freeman and Helena Bonham-Carter among its cast. Less celebrated than other Christie works, the book has been adapted for screen before – John Gielgud starred in a 1981 ITV film – but hopefully this relative obscurity will help the show escape the trap of familiarity.Netflix, date TBCThe Witches of EssexPresenting, acting, DJing, interviewing – Rylan has done it all. Now the toothsome TV treasure turns his hand to historical investigation, teaming up with Prof Alice Roberts to dig into the most intense spate of witch hunts in British history. The 16th and 17th century witch trials in his home county saw thousands of vulnerable women persecuted for sorcery. Many were burnt at the stake. Made by Louis Theroux’s production company, this three-parter should be grimly fascinating.Sky History,date TBCTrinityWhile the world patiently waits for more Line of Duty, Jed Mercurio has been cooking up something else entirely. Trinity is a big Netflix conspiracy drama about a naval officer who becomes involved with the secretary of defense. Gugu Mbatha-Raw plays the officer, Richard Madden plays the minister and, if previous Mercurio shows have been any indication, the series will play out in a blast of rattling accelerating tension.Netflix, date TBCTrespassesView image in fullscreenBrilliantly evocative … Tom Cullen and Lola Petticrew in Trespasses.Photograph: Steffan Hill/Channel 4Rising star Lola Petticrew was Bafta nominated for last year’s IRA drama Say Nothing.

He also happens to be a controversial barrister who often defends IRA suspects.Gillian Andersonlends high-class support as Petticrew’s gin-soaked, acid-tongued mother. Adapted by Ailbhe Keogan (Bad Sisters) from Louise Kennedy’s acclaimed novel, this is forbidden love with potentially lethal consequences.Channel 4,date TBCVictoria BeckhamWe already got up close and personal with David Beckham in his Emmy-winning, record-breaking 2023 series. Now Mrs B tries her hand at a tell-all documentary. Cameras follow Victoria as she juggles her career and family life. Promising intimate footage of domestic bliss chez Beckham, as well as behind-the-scenes access to her business empire, it chronicles her evolution from pouting Posh Spice in the 90s to today’s fashion titan. Will there be bombshells? Will estranged son Brooklyn and his wife, Nicola Peltz Beckham, pop up? Will there be viral moments such as Victoria’s admission that her “very working-class” dad drove her to school in a Rolls-Royce?Netflix, date TBCWaiting for the OutBased on the 2022 memoir The Life Inside by Andy West, a man who taught philosophy in prisons, Waiting for the Out is billed as “an inspiring and nuanced new take on male identity, forgiveness and self-discovery”. It’s a difficult book to adapt, but taking the reins is none other than Dennis Kelly, the man behind Together, The Third Day and David Fincher’s upcoming Squid Game remake. Sounds like it’s in safe hands.BBC, date TBC"

Should I, after three straight second places, have the strength to force the moment to its crisis? Hmm. Maybe not. With all due apologies to the living descendants of TS Eliot, the love song of Mikel Arteta still doesn’t really scan or rhyme or have a clear endnote as yet, even as the six-year anniversary of his appointment as Arsenal manager approaches.This is normal enough. It is obviously incorrect to conclude, as many have, that Arsenal’s managerhas to win a trophy this seasonor be remembered not just as a fraud, but as a Lego-haired billion-pound-spend fraud, the worst kind of fraud there is. Sport doesn’t work in simple metre. Uncertainty is key to its fascination.In reality the Arteta era has brought fresh energy, the team regeared,Champions League status re-established. The winning of cups and pots is hostage to endless variables. The best does not rule out the good. Others must also succeed.Calafiori strikes after goalkeeper’s error as Arsenal grind to win at Manchester UnitedRead moreBy the same token the idea of early-season title deciders is best dismissed as punditry gush, marketing pitch, whiffle around the lighted dais. What can August really tell us? Most teams are in flux right now. Are Chelsea good? Nobody knows. Winter into spring remains the real testing ground, the moment players and managers are asked to stare a little deeper into their own reflection.And yet, and yet, and yet, sometimes all these things can actually be true, or close to true. AndLiverpoolversus Arsenal at Anfield on Sunday afternoon really does look like a key note, not just in terms of final points tallies, but in Arteta’s own trajectory. Because something does need to shift here.There is by now something a little haunting about the uncertainty around this team’s ultimate endpoint, something tender and unformed about the sight of Arteta out there on the touchline in the same primly tailored black jacket and shoes, like a police sniper trying to blend in at a parents’ evening, revolving his hands in that familiar choreography of alarm and dismay.What are we looking at here? What role is Arteta destined to play? Is he the architect of an era? Is he Prince Hamlet? Just another ensemble player? Perhaps even the fool, the man who talked endlessly about winning but somehow forgot to win, the coach who made his players listen to You’ll Never Walk Alone while they trained before one of his early trips to Anfield, then went up there and dutifully lost 4-0?There are good reasons to regard Sunday as a genuine opportunity to shape that dynamic. For a start this isn’t really the third game of a new season. For Arteta it is instead the 117th game of 152, three seasons of work on the same host body that have led in a straight line to this point.View image in fullscreenViktor Gyökeres bullocks and breaks lines in scoring his goals.Photograph: David Price/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesAnd this is the kind of game that can offer a genuine point of ignition. Liverpool are a perfect example of how that can work. There is an on-this-day point here, the kind of Ominous Anniversary stuff football loves to weave into its stories. On Sunday it will be almost exactly six years since an Arsenal team managed by Arteta’s predecessor also travelled to Anfield.That Jürgen Klopp Liverpool team were at a similar point in their lifespan to the current Arsenal: also coming off three seasons of progress, also desperate to end a title drought, also rebalanced around some key recent signings.In the eventLiverpool ran right over Unai Emery’s team, won 3-1, strolled about the place bathed in champion aura, and obliterated the rest of the field from that point. That fixture was, like this one, the third Premier League game of the season. It was also, and here we must cue the eerie, conspiratorial music, Klopp’s own 117th league game of his first three full seasons in charge.At this point the comparison falls away into pattern seeking and general numberwang. Liverpool were champions of Europe at that point. Klopp had been at Liverpool for three full seasons. Arteta has five under his belt. Klopp was also an established alpha manager, winning the league something that always seemed stitched into the arc. Arteta is not this. He’s a chalk sketch, an idea waiting to happen. But the league is also a little different now. And Arteta has a chance to learn something else from Arne Slot’s luminous debut season last year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Anfield this weekend is followed by Nottingham Forest and Manchester City at home and Newcastle away. It will be a high-wire act to get through this more or less intact while bedding in new players. But it is already clear other teams will drop points, that the season is generally more random and rushed and squeezed.Last season Arsenal began like a damp box of matches, dropping 12 points in their first 10 games. This time around they have an opportunity to assert from the off what seems undeniably true, that they have the best-balanced squad of any top team, and in the process take the season by the throat as Liverpool did last time.More to the point, there really are no excuses now. Arsenal have all the tools. Even injuries look like opportunities.Kai Havertz, Bukayo Saka and Martin Ødegaard may be out? Well, here come Eze, Gyökeres and Noni Madueke, all of whom may have played in any case, and who may even be an upgrade in the right form.The midfield looks strong. The defence is set. The goalkeeper is good. Best of all Arsenal’s signings are coherent. They address omissions. A team that have seemed at times trapped within their own structures, chasing the game with all the carefree abandon of a fly buzzing down a window pane, have brought in specialist risk takers.Eze is a genuinely inventive attacker, who needs to be encouraged simply to be this again, to be it more, to the max. The questions around Gyökeres have been along the lines of: is he an Arteta player? The point is that he shouldn’t fit too snugly. He should be awkward.If Gyökeres is physical and boisterous then this is a good thing in a team that can spend a little too long sharpening its scalpel. The goals he scores will tend to be the kind Arsenal wouldn’t have scored before. He bullocks and breaks lines. He does this quite often from the left. Just having a threat on that side may unlock something else in Saka, the world’s most double-teamed man.Arsenal put five past Leeds but lose Ødegaard and Saka to injuryRead moreAll of which sounds encouraging in outline. But fixing your weaknesses creates its own pressure and a significanttype of pressure for a coach who has measured out his managerial life so far in almost-but-not-quites. For Arsenal taking the league to the wire this time will be a question of will, fearlessness, the readiness to lean into those new strengths.Sunday is an obvious first chance. Liverpool will still be favourites to win the game. They’re the champions. They haven’t lost to Arsenal at home since the pre-Klopp era 13 years ago. The new attack looks thrillingly potent. But they have also shown their weaknesses this season. Liverpool’s midfield has looked open.At Newcastle on Monday nightthere was a slight sense of muddle under the barrage of high balls. Gyökeres and Eze, who may make his debut, are good against opponents who like to have the ball and keep a high line.There is at the very least an opportunity here for Arsenal; if not to decide anything right now, then to show a willingness to dare and to feel their own moment flicker a little closer.Explore more on these topicsArsenalLiverpoolPremier LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The young Australian is in a two-horse race to be Formula One world champion this year and his youth, personable nature and easy, dry wit belie a driver possessed of exceptional maturity and the clinical execution familiar in the sport’s greats.Piastri has given every indication he could join them and the resolute determination of the man who would be king is palpable.‘The three sharks’: Wolff excited at possible F1 return of Ecclestone, Horner and BriatoreRead more“I have emotions, I still feel everything that everyone else feels. It’s just that, being blunt, I think a lot of emotions are not that helpful,” he says with candour.Which admission may be considered a little shocking from many 24-year-olds but it is an integral part of what has propelled Piastri to a two-way title fight with his McLaren teammateLando Norris. The Australian currently leads by nine points going into this weekend’s Dutch Grand Prix after a tight fight marked by his equanimity, where he has taken setbacks and victories with the same, almost preternatural calm.“I don’t think there’s any point dwelling on anything longer than you have to,” he says. “It’s important sometimes to get that frustration out, to celebrate, to do whatever, but just because you won last weekend or just because you lost last weekend doesn’t mean that the same thing is going to happen this weekend.”This season, only his third in F1, has been revelatory, marked by this even-handed approach and a ruthless consistent delivery that have brought him six wins and six podiums in 14 races. Aftera spin in the wet in the season-opener at Melbourne, an error promptly consigned to the dustbin of history by the Australian, Piastri has delivered with pretty much impeccable precision.View image in fullscreenIn only his third season in Formula One, Oscar Piastri has driven to six wins and six podium places this year.Photograph: Mark Thompson/Getty ImagesHis race engineer, Tom Stallard, the former Olympic rowing silver medallist, has described him as notable for being both “calm and intense”. While the architect of McLaren’s success, team principal Andrea Stella, summed up his strengths after a dominant win in Bahrain earlier this season by aptly noting: “No hesitations, no inaccuracies, everything that was available he capitalised on.”Piastri’s attitude might be considered somewhat cold-blooded. As a person, he is clearly anything but. However, the strategy is doubtless effective. It’s an approach sport psychologists would recognise but it seems one honed by circumstance as he single-handedly pursued his career having moved to the UK when he was 14. His father, Chris was with him for six months, before returning to Australia and after which Piastri looked after himself.Once I learned to control things I could control and not worry about everything else in life it probably naturally translated to racingOscar Piastri“There’s definitely been a lot of lessons through experiences, when you’ve been racing for 15 years now, there’s a lot of tough moments in there,” he says. “There’s obviously the challenges of just going racing but then there’s the challenges of moving from home. Learning how to navigate life alongside racing, being far away from your family and friends, which I’m sure has moulded me to some degree as well.“I never had any dramatic life experiences in my childhood but even just little things of having to make decisions for yourself and problem-solve. Once I learned to control things I could control and not worry about everything else in life it probably naturally translated to racing.”That was on display in Baku last year whenPiastri gave a masterclass of drivingcontrol under enormous pressure. Having taken the lead from Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc, he then defended it for 30 laps as the Monegasque driver ducked and dived and all but hurled himself at the Australian’s gearbox. To no avail as Piastri took his second and still perhaps the best win of his career. His reaction to Stallard was a simple, unflustered exclamation of “Yes!” over the radio as he took the flag.Table of points won by Piastri and NorrisThere is depth here too. Piastri is a thoughtful character and slowly considers a response when asked how he assesses himself and his approach. “There’s obviously all the work that goes on behind the scenes of how to actually drive a race car fast,” he says. “But an important thing is always kind of dissociating the results of a weekend from how I felt I performed.“So there’s been races I’ve won this year or in my career that I would probably rank as worse performances than races I’ve finished fourth or fifth. Just getting myself in the right mindset, essentially being quite calm, quite relaxed is what I think I need.”Comparisons then have unsurprisingly been made between Piastri and Alain Prost – “The Professor” – and they are valid on many levels. The Australian is as measured a perfectionist on track in the mould of the four-time champion Frenchman and with a similarly calculating and considered air. Ten race meetings remain in the run-in, each of which could be vital in the title fight and much as Piastri knows it, he remains unconcerned.View image in fullscreenOscar Piastri (right) insists that he and his teammate Lando Norris will stay friends during their battle for the title.Photograph: Clive Rose/Getty Images“There is going to naturally be tension,” he says. “There’s naturally going to be pressure and emotions from that but it doesn’t necessarily weigh heavily on me. I’m honestly just more excited. If I was not in a championship fight, I’d be trying to attack things the same way. Obviously the tension around the position we’re in is naturally going to be higher but I’d be trying to do the same thing regardless of where I am in the championship.”That there is more to the young man than an iron will over his emotions, however, is also clear by Piastri’s popularity. His laid-back public persona is engaging and likable and has struck a chord with F1’s new generation of young, enthusiastic fans, a demographic in which Norris too shares a similar popularity. One of them will be champion and the pair have, unusually, remained friendly even as they are going head to head this season. But will it last?“There’s obviously going to be tension at points, ultimately we’re fighting for something that we’ve both dreamed of since we were kids,” says Piastri. “But our relationship is honestly probably stronger than it has been from the start. There’s obviously going to be a loser to this championship and that’s going to be not that pleasant for whoever that is but however this championship goes it’s been a good fight already and I think there’ll be a lot of respect both ways.”No exaggerated theatrics then, simply a very reasonable kid, being eminently reasonable. Which is Piastri writ large. There will not be histrionics in what is likely to be a nail-biting contest but rather the poker-face of a player at ease with himself amid the maelstrom of a hopefully memorable title fight.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneOscar PiastriMcLarenLando NorrisMotor sportAustralia sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She has not suffered a bad loss at the major tournaments this year, losing to an incredible trio of players in Iga Swiatek (twice), Aryna Sabalenka and now Rybakina. With the exception of her tight two-setterwith the world No 1, Sabalenka, at Wimbledon, however, those meetings have not been close. While the draws have not been kind to her, Raducanu’s game has repeatedly not looked strong enough against supreme opponents with greater firepower.“I’ve lost to Iga twice, Aryna and Elena, so it’s tough,” the British player said. “But at the same time, that’s where I’m at with my ranking. I can play top opponents in the first, second or third round. So I’ve just got to do my best in the next few months until Australia to just keep working to try to close the gap.”Since she announced her new partnershipwith the Spanish coach Francisco Roigjust under four weeks ago, Raducanu has described her primary goal as improving to the point where she can consistently trouble the top players. But she notes that their collaboration is in its early stages and they have a lot of work ahead. “I think there are certain parts of my game which have gotten better for sure,” Raducanu said. “Today my weaknesses were highlighted, but I think it’s only been three weeks, and he can’t really work miracles. So I know we’re doing good work, and I just look forward to continuing.”On Wednesday Rybakina was not particularly impressive in a tight two-set win over the qualifier Tereza Valentova. Raducanu’s statusas a grand slam championdoes seem to inspire the game’s best to approach her with full focus. Considering her aspirations of being a top player in her own right, the challenge for Raducanu is improving to a point where she can raise her own level.View image in fullscreenElena Rybakina proved too powerful for Emma Raducanu during their third-round clash.Photograph: Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images“I think when the very top play against me, they have a point to prove that they’re at the top, and they’re there for a reason,” she said. “I think every time I’ve played one, they’ve kind of shown that. So at the same time while I’m improving, doing better, gaining maybe some more respect around, yeah, the top have definitely raised their game. But I’ll take that as a compliment that they’ve decided to really lock in against me, but at the same time it does show I have a lot more work to do.”Raducanu had good reason to hope that things may be slightly different this time. She arrived at Louis Armstrong Stadium as confident as she could be, losing six games in her first two matches. However, the world No 10 represented a completely different challenge.‘Next time, don’t wonder why I hit you’: Tsitsipas rages at opponent’s underarm servesRead moreFrom the start Rybakina’s devastating first serve neutralised Raducanu’s return, her biggest strength, and she also returned with constant depth, rushing her opponent after her own serve throughout the match. The Kazakhstani took control of almost every baseline exchange, powering the ball off both wings and forcing Raducanu further and further behind the baseline. When Rybakina is in full flight, she presses her opponents and Raducanu simply does not possess the weapons to counter her. By the second set, the British No 1 had clearly lost belief in her ability to win the match.But Raducanu rightfully leaves New York hopeful about her future. She is generally performing at a high level, appears to have fully bought into her new partnership with Roig and exorcised some significant demons this week by finally winning matches at the US Open for the first time since her 2021 title. With a live ranking of No 34, she is on the verge of being seeded at the grand slams again.In contrast to Raducanu’s positive recent strides, 2025 has actually been a turbulent year for Rybakina. Her season started with the news that her longtime coach, Stefano Vukov, had been suspended from the tour by the WTA due to alleged verbal abuse towards her. The player has repeatedly expressed her opposition to the ruling and continued to work with him away from tournaments.Shortly before the Cincinnati Open this month, Vukov successfully appealed against the ruling, meaning he is free to accompany Rybakina at tournaments again. Since the case was closed, she has produced some of her best tennis of the season and this supreme performance only reaffirmed her status as a clear title threat in New York.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025US Open tennisEmma RaducanuTennisUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Tuchel has also dropped Kyle Walker and Curtis Jones and there was no room for Jack Grealish.Trent Alexander-Arnold left out of England squad for World Cup qualifiersRead moreTuchel was keen to draw a line under the Bellingham episode, which eruptedwhen he discussed the midfielder’s “edge”in a live interview with TalkSport, one that can make the player blow up during matches and come across in a way that “can be a bit repulsive”. Tuchel admitted his mother sometimes had mixed emotions when watching Bellingham play. What Tuchel most wanted to stress was that his choice of word in his second language had been poor and he was sorry.“I used this word unintentionally,” he said. “There was no message, no hidden agenda. I fully understand that it’s my responsibility, that I created the headlines and I’m sorry for the upset. I should have known better. I should have done better. If someone makes the effort to listen to the whole answer he would clearly understand the appreciation that I have for the player.“When I was aware of the headlines, I made contact straight away [with Bellingham]. Jude focuses now on his rehabilitation and we focus on Andorra and Serbia. Is it sorted? I hope so. It was in English so I don’t think my mum was fully aware of it. She had the right to be annoyed at me.”Tuchel described Alexander-Arnold as a player who “needs to feel trust and love from his manager and teammates, from his club, his country, the fans”. He made the point that the right-back had a lot going on when he called him up for the first time in June for theaway game in Andorraand thefriendly against Senegalat the City Ground. He would give him minutes only against Andorra – as a 64th-minute substitute. Alexander-Arnold had just signed for Real Madrid, he was preparing for his unveiling straight after the camp when he would speak in fluent Spanish and then it was off to the Club World Cup.Yet Tuchel also made it plain that the decision to drop Alexander-Arnold was based on merit, with Reece James and Livramento in better form. He also suggested that another right-back, Ben White, might have been selected if he had not been injured, thereby ending a lengthy international exile.“I spoke to Trent, it was a difficult phone call but I wanted that he hears it from me, which he appreciated,” Tuchel said. “He was very clear that he’s desperate to come back and play forEngland. It is a competitive decision, first and foremost.”Tuchel reserves the right to adopt different approaches with different players, which he appears to have done with Myles Lewis-Skelly. The 18-year-old left-back has been retained in the squad, despite having lost his starting place at Arsenal to Riccardo Calafiori this season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But now it comes with a responsibility from us to not drop him on the first occasion just because he does not start. It is a fine line.”Tuchel’s tenure has featured three wins out of three in qualifying and the loss against Senegal. His football has generally failed to quicken the pulse, which he attributes in part to him calling up a large number of players and the difficulty in building any rhythm across the March and June get-togethers, the latter being especially tough in terms of timing.The fixtures will come thicker and faster in the autumn and Tuchel, having picked a leaner 24-man squad, is determined to instil clearer patterns and identity – and to see a spirit of collective sacrifice.“The players need to drop their club hats, the way they play in their clubs and buy into our ideas,” Tuchel said. “We will see them. I’m very sure of that because they will be very clear.”Explore more on these topicsEnglandJude BellinghamThomas TuchelnewsShareReuse this content"

In their opening matches of this tournamentEngland beat the USA 69-7, while Samoalost 73-0to Australia.‘I still feel a part of my team’: Ruby Tui on starring as a TV pundit after her Black Ferns omissionRead moreThe different situation the teams find themselves in is something the England players are aware of and the back-row Abi Burton, who will make her World Cup debut, hopes this tournament will boost opportunities for every nation. “They are inspirational women,” she said of Samoa. “I think the different types of women who have come to this World Cup is unbelievable but they all come because they love rugby.“That is one thing we all share. It’s really special for them to be able to share their story and it does make you reflect on what we have and how much rugby has grown in this country. How we have the opportunities we do.“Hopefully this World Cup will give everybody more opportunities in their nations. Hopefully it will go up a level here, up a level in Spain, up a level in Samoa. That is what we want to do. We want to make it go up another level for everybody.”The Red Roses have not gone with a full-strength team in Northampton,making 13 changesfrom their opener. This was always the plan; the head coach, John Mitchell, communicates his team news to players as early as possible and the thinking is to give everyone game time early in the tournament. The squad will have achieved that bar one player, Holly Aitchison, who has been injured and will hope to make an appearance against Australia next Saturday.No matter who is on the team sheet, England have been formidable in their 28-game winning streak but the attack coach Lou Meadows says there is still more to come. “I would hope to think there are always things you haven’t seen because we are constantly trying to improve and test our game, tactically switch up as much as possible,” Meadows said, before singling out the fly-half Helena Rowland.“It’s special to work with someone like Helena and the rest of the back line are electric, as well as our very mobile forwards. We’ve got an opportunity here to really play the picture in front of us.View image in fullscreenFa’asua Makisi of Samoa was overwhelmed to see her mother in the crowd at their first match. ‘I couldn’t believe she was here,’ she said.Photograph: Paul Harding/Getty Images“We have not really seen a lot of what Samoa can do because WXV [the tournament held outside World Cup years] footage doesn’t reveal too much. They have worked really hard on their game and we are really excited for the opportunity they have got in this tournament. I think it is going to be an opportunity again for us to test another side to our game to prove we can physically dominate still against a side like Samoa but equally how we can adapt to the pictures in front of us.”The two nations have played each other only twice before, with England winning on both occasions: 53-0 in 2005 and 65-3 in 2014. Marlie Packer and Natasha Hunt are the only two players in England’s matchday 23 to have played Samoa, in the victory at the 2014 World Cup. None of the Samoa players have faced the Red Roses.Mitchell said for nations such as Samoa it is less about what the scoreline says and more about the performance and pride of playing for their country on a World Cup stage. Nothing epitomised that more than the viral video of Samoa’s Fa’asua Makisi after the team’s loss against Australia.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The player’s reaction was complete shock and she burst into tears when she spotted her mum post-match.“She was holding up a flag behind her and I screamed,” Makisi said. “It was a natural response. I couldn’t believe she was here in England and I fully had an emotional breakdown in front of the crowd.View image in fullscreenLou Meadows speaks to the media, alongside Abi Burton. ‘We are constantly trying to improve and test our game,’ said the attack coach.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA“My mum has been my rock and she’s been one of the main reasons I’ve been able to come here and to see her here was really overwhelming, but happy tears for sure! Being the type of supporter my mum is, she will be here for all of our pool games and until we go home.”Samoa also believe this tournament is an opportunity for the players to be offered a chance to play for Premiership Women’s Rugby teams. Bella Milo, the Samoa defence coach, said: “I think for them to be able to gain experience overseas would be awesome. In order for us to play at that level, being able to play against players from here and also being able to be looked after in terms of a PWR contract and the facilities they have, I think our players would be able to continue to grow and hopefully bring those opportunities back to Samoa.”England are expected to win but the margin will become the focus as the game goes on. The record score at a women’s Rugby World Cup is the Black Ferns’ 134-6 victory over Germany in 1998. It is one record that the competition will not want to see broken on Saturday.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Rugby World Cup 2025Samoa women's rugby union teamEngland women's rugby union teamRugby unionWomen's rugby unionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Meanwhile, two of his forwards – Rasmus Højlund and Antony – neared the Old Trafford exit on Friday.Amorim offered the remarkable insight into his personality at the end of a week in which he stirred uncertainty over his future with comments made after his teamlost at Grimsby in the Carabao Cup. On Friday he said he intended to continue at United after the international break and thought he would do so but that he could not make any promises on his future.Manchester United agree £40m fee with Chelsea for sale of Alejandro GarnachoRead moreAfter the Grimsby gameAmorim said “something has to change”and that “my players spoke really loud about what they want”. Asked about those remarks as he prepared for Saturday’s home game against Burnley, he expressed no regret.“Every time that we have in the future one defeat like that, I’m going to be like that,” he said. “I’m going to say that sometimes I hate my players, sometimes I love my players, sometimes I want to defend my players.“This is my way of doing things and I’m going to be like that. In that moment I was so frustrated and annoyed. And I know you have a lot of experienced people talking about the way I should perform with the media, to be more constant, to be more calm. I’m not going to be like that.”Amorim believes United’s problems start in the players’ heads. “I feel the players are always thinking about the past,” he said. “They think there is something in the water here or in the food. It’s in our minds. We just need to think about the next game. We dropped a level [against Grimsby]. Now we have to respond in the next game.”After playing Burnley, United resume their season on 14 September at Manchester City. Amorim was asked whether he could confirm he would be in charge after the break. “I don’t know what is going to happen,” he said. “That is my idea. But again, I am not going to promise you anything – what is going to be the future. But I’m the manager of Manchester United and I think that is not going to change.”The Portuguese said he understood how his post-Grimsby reaction had caused uncertainty regarding whether he would resign. “If you have this kind of behaviour, you have to understand that you have things that are good [from] that type of behaviour, that you have the other side of the coin,” he said. “So I understand that.View image in fullscreenManchester United have agreed a season-long loan deal with Napoli for Rasmus Højlund.Photograph: Visionhaus/Getty Images“And again, sometimes I want to quit, sometimes I want to be here for 20 years.

I don’t need anyone.” After likening his extreme feelings for his players to those he has for his children, saying “sometimes I hate my kids”, he suggested improved results would make him less likely to “suffer”. “We just need to win some games and then things will be easier to do.”Amorim’s inflexible adherence to a 3-4-3 shape can draw criticism. He has said that formations do not matter so was asked, then, why he was unwilling to change. “If I feel it is best to change [I will],” he said. “We need to be so good in this way of playing and then we are going to adapt. When everyone is doing this with his eyes shut then we are going to do different things. This is the fun part.”United agreed a season-loan deal with Napoli for Højlund on Friday. The deal includes an obligation to buy worth €44m (£38m) if Napoli qualify for the Champions League. The player still needs to accept the move to the Serie A side and could stay in Manchester. The club also accepted a £25m bid for Antony from Real Betis, a huge loss on the Brazilian, who was signed on 1 September 2022 for £82m, though there is a 50% sell-on clause.As the Guardian reported this week,Kobbie Mainoo wishes to leave. But Amorim said he valued the midfielder. “I want Kobbie to stay,” he said. “He needs to fight for his place, and we need Kobbie. So that is not going to change. I understand that the players that are not playing at this moment are disappointed. You have to fight during the week [in training].”Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedRuben AmorimnewsShareReuse this content"

For large periods it looked as though the whole 80 minutes would pass without a try being scored. However, when one finally came it proved crucial, as Joe Burgess’s finish secured the points for Hull KR.Having been badly beaten at Leedslast weekend, this was the kind of response you would expect from a side that have been so dominant all season. They took their moments when they arrived, and were brilliant without the ball to move one step closer to another piece of history, havingwon the Challenge Cupfor the first time in 45 years earlier this summer.“It was a good game. It had a semi-finals feel and it got a bit edgy at the end, but it was a good game,” Peters said.

They have taken steps forward, but this showed they are still a fraction behind the very best sides.“The way we started the second half was poor,” their coach, Paul Wellens, said. “When you come here, it’s often an attritional battle and the way we started that second half, we were in trouble early.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As Wellens admitted, Saints’ discipline cost them in the second half. They were still holding Rovers’ attack at bay quite comfortably but three separate penalties gave Martin easy opportunities to open up a six-point lead. On a night when defences were firmly on top, that felt crucial.So too did Mikey Lewis’s pinpoint 40-20, which gave the Robins a chance to strike, and they finally opened the Saints up when Burgess finished a wonderful move in the corner to make it 12-2. To the visitors’ credit, they set up a grandstand finale when Deon Cross touched down in the corner, but they ran out of time.It means that while there are unanswered questions over thisSt Helensside’s ability to go the distance, Rovers are now only 80 minutes away from another piece of silverware.Explore more on these topicsSuper LeagueHull KRSt HelensRugby leaguenewsShareReuse this content"

So Adam Zampa’s last-minute arrival in the Oval Invincibles squad from Australia, confirmed on Thursday, will be perceived by some as the welcome return of a global white-ball star, the leading wicket-taker in last season’s competition. Others will consider the very possibility of a team making a big, potentially decisive signing for just the final of a competition proof of its essential unseriousness. Another group might care about nothing but their own entertainment. Protest will be fuelled by the fact that the success of the Invincibles, who go into Sunday’s decider seeking a three-peat, and Oval-based teams in general, is perhaps starting to grate.They are something of an anomaly.The Hundredis structurally designed to promote inconsistency across seasons, unpredictability generally being seen as a positive trait in sporting competition and particularly important in a tournament with only eight teams and no relegation, circumstances that might allow it to become very stale very quickly. So Trent Rockets men, runners-up in this year’s table, have now finished first, second, third and fifth twice; while the team they face in Saturday’s eliminator, third-placed Northern Superchargers, have never finished in the same position twice.The Spin | ‘I’ll bat anywhere for England’: in-form Jordan Cox confident of making the step upRead moreBut the Invincibles have chosen stability, building their team around a core of players who have been there from the start (the new player-recruitment systemexpected to be introduced for next season aims to encourage more player movement, albeit around a small number of players on longer-term contracts). Familiarity is not the only ingredient of success but it is notable that the two worst teams in this season’s men’s competition, London Spirit and Welsh Fire, each have only one player who has made more than 25 appearances for them, while the Invincibles have six. Nine of the XI that started last year’s final have returned this year, while Sam Billings has captained them through 41 of their 42 games.Like the Invincibles, Southern Brave women have topped their table for the third time in five years – they have only once finished outside the top two, and that was last year when they came last – but so far they have only once converted their league success into a title. Last year they won one game and that with one ball to spare; Thursday’s victory over Welsh Fire, who collapsed from 50 for one to finish with 77 for nine, completed the first 100% record of any team, men or women, in the history of the tournament (unless you count Welsh Fire men’s eight defeats from eight in 2022). The England seamer Lauren Bell added another four wickets to an outstanding record for the Brave: she has the most wickets this season at the lowest average, and one of the few to come close to her combination of wickets (lots) and runs conceded (few) is her teammate Tilly Corteen-Coleman.View image in fullscreenLauren Bell has had an excellent campaign for Southern Brave.Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty ImagesSuperchargers will be involved in both eliminators, with London Spirit their opponents in the women’s competition. The sides met less than a fortnight ago, when Superchargers romped to victory by eight wickets (they have become fearsome chasers, winning three of their last five games by eight wickets and one by seven, with a combined total of precisely 100 balls to spare), and for all that it’s their home ground Spirit have not won at Lord’s since they pipped the Invincibles in the first game of the season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In 2023 he averaged 13 in five innings and overall had been so hopeless that Spirit cut him from their squad in February. The success of Crawley, like the Superchargers’ women, offers a romantic vision of a tournament that allows one season’s losers to become winners the next – a vision that may or may not survive contact with the remorseless juggernaut that is the Invincibles.Explore more on these topicsThe HundredCricketfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was not until December 1977 that Johnson Houghton’s achievements were finally recognised, when she became one of the first three women elected to membership of the Jockey Club that had refused her a licence two decades earlier.Her father, Fulke Johnson Houghton, then held the licence at the family stable from 1961 until 2007, saddling more than1,200 winners including Ile De Bourbonin the King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes in 1978. He remained a key presence in the stable until his death in February this year, and Johnson Houghton says that she is “still really lucky to have Dad as my backup. I’ve really, really missed him this year, but it was a great grounding and I’ve still got my mum around, which is fabulous. Trainers are the ones with our names in lights but no trainer is capable without their team, and I’ve got a brilliant yard team as well.“We’re a wonderfully old-fashioned yard, I try to make small improvements every year, but I took over an amazing place and you can’t get away from the basics. I’m lucky enough to train for some wonderful people as well, and they trust me to do the best with them.”View image in fullscreenFulke Johnson Houghton saddled more than 1,200 winners, including Ile De Bourbon in the King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes in 1978.Photograph: Chris Smith/Popperfoto/Getty ImagesAccidental Agent, a home-bred who was unwanted at the sales and bought back for 8,000 gns (£8,400), won the Group One Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot in 2018. Chipotle, a 10,000 gns (£10,500) yearling, took the Windsor Castle Stakes at the Royal meeting three years later, while this summer has been a triumph for the trainer’s eye for a bargain, with Havana Hurricane, at 9,000 gns (£9,450) taking the Windsor Castle and the unbeaten Zavateri, still a relatively cheap buy at 35,000 gns (£36,750), proving to be one of 2025’s best juveniles. Two Group Two victories – in the July Stakes at Newmarket and the Vintage Stakes at Goodwood – mean that he has already repaid his purchase price more than four times over.As a result, Johnson Houghton is on course to reach £1m in prize money in Britain in a season for the first time since she took over the licence at the magnificent 200-acre Woodway Stables, near Blewbury in Oxfordshire, in 2007. There are extra orders, too, to be filled at the yearling sales over the next couple of months, though not necessarily any increase in her individual budgets. Everyone loves a bargain, after all. “I have, definitely [got more orders], but all to a level,” she says. “Which is great, don’t get me wrong, but it would be nice to get a few more … grown-up orders, shall we say? As I keep trying to tell everyone, it’s amazing if you can actually win a Royal Ascot race for 10 grand. It’s possible, but it’s bloody hard, and you’ve got to be at it a long time to do that. The owner of Havana Hurricane had some disasters with me before that, and he stuck at it and in the end, we got it right.”Another essential talent when buying racehorses at auction is knowing when to let go.“You set your price and sometimes you might say, I’ll give it another kick, but other times, you just walk away,” she says. “You have to, you can’t overspend and just because you pay more, it doesn’t necessarily mean you get any better. You just don’t have to forgive so much.”View image in fullscreenHistory maker: Helen Johnson (left) was the first woman to train a classic winner.Photograph: ANL/ShutterstockAnd though sticking to a budget might seem to rule out the need to consider every yearling at an auction like Doncaster, where around 400 horses will go under the hammer in two days and the top prices are into six figures, the opposite is often the case.“I think you have to look at more,” Johnson Houghton says. “You have to look at everything in case something falls through the gaps. I won’t look at every horse here but Ant [the veteran bloodstock agent Anthony Bromley, the other half of her purchasing operation] will.”Zavateri will bid to give his trainer the second Group One win of her career in his next start in either the National Stakes, at the Curragh next month, or the Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket in October. Havana Hurricane, meanwhile, is being aimed at the Group Two Flying Childers Stakes at Doncaster’s St Leger meeting in just over two weeks’ time.And all the while, their trainer will continue her meticulous search at the yearling sales, looking for a nice horse at the right price. “Bloody hard” it might be, but who would want to bet against Eve Johnson Houghton sifting another golden nugget from the auction ring before the year is out?Balding’s Blue Bolt can take flightThe Solario Stakes is in the “feature” slot at Sandown on Saturday but the Group Three Atalanta Stakes at 2.25, with £85,000 in the prize fund, is the most valuable race on the card and has attracted a competitive 14-strong field with a dozen runners priced up including Flight, the runner-up in the 1,000 Guineas in May, a hugely promising novice winner in Alobayyah and Andrew Balding’s progressive Blue Bolt.Flight won her maiden at Sandown last summer but needs to bounce back from a couple of sub-par runs in Group One company at the Curragh and Royal Ascot, and though William Haggas, Alobayyah’s trainer, is more than capable of getting one ready first time up, the strong recent form of Blue Bolt (2.25) is more persuasive.Andrew Balding’s filly has won her last three starts with plenty to spare, including a Listed event over Saturday’s track and trip last time out and looks more than ready for this step up in grade.Beverley 1.30A beaten odds-on favourite on his two previous starts,Crown Of Oaksfinally got off the mark at Ayr last time and has scope for further progress now he is up and running.Sandown1.50 William Buick is an eye-catching booking for Mick Appleby’sKodi Lion, who looked an unlucky loser at Haydock last time.Beverley 2.05Royal Ascot winnerAdrestiahas the plum draw, remains progressive and offers some value against the likely favourite, Regional.Chester 2.40 Tabletalkhas been running above this grade so far this season and has a couple of pounds at least in hand of his rivals here.Sandown 3.00The form of the London Gold Cup at Newbury in May looks typically strong, with four subsequent winners from the nine runners so far, and the winner,Saddadd, should be a fifth as he makes his first start since off a 6lb higher mark.Chester 3.15The drop back to seven furlongs looks the right move forHawksbill, who was headstrong over a mile at Haydock last time but still just a nose behind the winner.Sandown 3.35With likely favourite Publish an absentee, Charlie Appleby’sPacific Avenue,a cosy winner on debut at Newmarket in June,can give the trainer a third Solario Stakes success in the last four seasons.Explore more on these topicsSportTalking HorsesHorse racingHorse racing tipsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

There are worse red flags than thatFri 29 Aug 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 29 Aug 2025 21.31 EDTSharePicture a man sitting opposite you on public transport. He wields a copy of The Will to Change by bell hooks, and he takes care to parade the front cover or the spine lest any nearby strangers miss the title. He is in his 20s or 30s and conventionally attractive; maybe he has a dangly earring or two. There on his knee rests a tote bag. This man would not engage in loutish, careless behaviour like “manspreading” or placing all his stuff on the seats. And the tote bag probably bears the logo of an ethical brand or a bookshop. The bag is probably adorned with social-justice badges. If he showed you what music he is listening to, it might be, say, Lana Del Rey or Clairo.Here we have the performative male – a new kind of vaguely problematic man to watch out for. And one who is the subject of all manner of viral TikToks and memes, and media coverage everywhere from GQ to the New York Times, which reported on a recentperformative male contest in Seattle. For some reason when I picture him he always has curly hair. Big bouncy lustrous curls. You can probably add your own details, but you get the picture. The idea is that the performative male is a guy who goes about looking feminist and woke. The catch is that his aesthetic is curated to appeal to what he thinks women might like rather than being a totally earnest expression of his interests.Imagine that! A person choosing clothes and accessories to increase their attractiveness in the eyes of the gender they are trying to sleep with. Very insidious and unusual behaviour. I can tell you right now I have never once in my life participated in such a charade. I will admit, too, that some of this coverage has made me feel baffled by what is apparently considered desirable. The performative male is said to wear severalLabubusand drinkmatcha. I don’t really understand why this would lure women in. It’s even been suggested a performative male might stow tampons on his person. But if I met a cisgender man who made a point of carrying tampons around with him I’d probably telephone the police.My first thought, when I came across this trend, was: God, straight men cannot win. My second was: yes, this aesthetic is very common – not just with men but with women too. A parade of images flashed before me of all the young women and men I have seen self-consciously clutching their unbroken copies of Angela Davis and so on in coffee shops and on the bus. “A lot of the time they don’t know what they’re talking about,” one of the hosts of the Seattle performative male contest told the NYT, speaking about the kind of men who adopt this look. “It’s just an aesthetic for them.” But I would gently submit that a substantial proportion of the women who take care to post highlighted and pencilled-over pages of bell hooks to Instagram do not put much of the ethos of her work into practice in their own lives either.After all, performative righteousness is not solely the preserve of young men. I have often felt that the parallel vapidness and popularity of online social-justice messaging has created an entire generation (or two) of people obsessed with the idea of telegraphing their own worthiness rather than practising it.As the performative male trend has gained traction, I have received a few PR emails about it on behalf of “experts” with funky job titles offering to help counsel young women to spot toxic signs and red flags in the opposite sex. These missives, which I receive every time a new dating trend is coined, are always full of my own personal red flags. One such email on behalf of a “relationship coach” explained that the performative male is dangerous because he “speaks the language of emotional availability but doesn’t practise it”. I am happy to say that, for all its shadowy allusions to grave transgression, I have no idea what this sentence means.Labubus, The Bell Jar and tampons: the ‘performative male’ attracts attentionRead moreThe email included some red flags to watch out for in men:1) Constant need for external validation2) Actions that don’t match words3) Avoids real vulnerabilityThis is typical of the way pop psychology spreads online, with lists of traits specific enough to sound authoritative but vague enough that they could apply to almost anyone. Yes, these three red flags could be said to apply to plenty of the men I know, and plenty of the women too. But what has any of this got to do with a man drinking an iced blueberry matcha in public? There is a cottage industry of these “experts” who prey on and foster the neuroses of anxious young women. Likewise, many of the influencers I see on my timeline who specialise in dating advice about who to avoid and how to spot toxicity seem to be neurotic, lonely people doling out tips which offer nothing more than a road map to a paralysing fear and suspicion of other people.Ill-intentioned people come in many different guises. Some toxic men will indeed carry a Daunt Books tote bag, but if you see a red flag in every one, you will write off a lot of decent, well-intentioned people. The truth is that out in the world you will get hurt and get hurt and get hurt. And in doing so, you will learn how to make better choices.Rachel Connolly is the author of the novel Lazy CityExplore more on these topicsMenOpinionRelationshipscommentShareReuse this content"

Instead he’s following Biden’s leadMohamad BazziA hunger-monitoring group has confirmed what we already knew about Palestinians’ suffering. The US has the power to end itFri 29 Aug 2025 11.36 EDTLast modified on Fri 29 Aug 2025 11.37 EDTShareAglobalhunger-monitoring groupdeclared last weekthatGaza’s largest city and its surrounding area were suffering from an “entirely man-made” famine, mostly caused byIsrael’s deliberate starvation strategy and continued siege of the territory. This news won’t surprise anyone who has paid even scant attention to theimages and videosof emaciated children and desperate parents that have been coming out of Gaza for months.But the firstconfirmation of famineby the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), which includes the World Food Programme, the World Health Organization and other aid agencies, is an important institutional marker. Years from now, it will serve as a reminder of how Israel used starvation as aweapon of warwhile western powers did nothing. And it will be a source of shame for all those who will inevitably claim that they didn’t realize the extent of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, despite dozens of Palestinian journalists beingkilled for conveyingthat reality to the world.Donald Trumpcan stop this famine – the US is Israel’s largest weapons supplier and most important political supporter. But he has chosen not to. Instead, Trump is backing the Israeli prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, inhis latest planto sow more death and destruction by invading Gaza City and displacing 1 million Palestinians. Last month, the US president saidchildren in Gaza“look very hungry”, adding that scenes of suffering showed “real starvation”. Trump contradicted the Israeli government’s spurious claim that warnings about impending famine were fake news.Want to know why Israelis are indifferent about Gaza? Just watch Israeli TV | Roy SchwartzRead moreYet the Trump administration stayed silent after the IPC issued its latestreport last week, confirming that Gaza City and its environs are in the midst of a full-blown famine. In order to declare a famine, the IPC requires that an area must crossthree critical thresholds: at least 20% of households face an extreme shortage of food; at least 30% of children suffer from acute malnutrition; and at least two adults or four children out of every 10,000 people die each day due to starvation, or disease and malnutrition. Since the IPC was founded in 2004 to warn of global food shortages, it had confirmed only three previous famines: in Somalia in 2011, South Sudan in 2017 and Sudan last year.By the time a famine is declared, it’s often too late to stop an exponential rise in deaths due to starvation and malnutrition. When a drought-driven famine hit Somalia between 2010 and 2012, about half of the 250,000 people killedhad already diedby the time the IPC found that the country had crossed famine thresholds.During past famines, the IPC’s declaration helped drive global attention and prompted international donors to rush aid to affected regions. But the world’s attention is already focused on Gaza, and the UN and other aid groups saythey have enough foodnear Gaza’s borders to feed its entire population of 2.1 million for nearly three months. Israel simply refuses to allow much of that aid into the besieged territory – a deliberate starvation campaign supported by the Trump administration.The Israeli prime minister and his government continue to defy global outrage because they have Trump’s unwavering supportAs Tom Fletcher, the UN’s humanitarian aid chief,put it last week: “Food stacks up at borders because of systematic obstruction by Israel.” He added that the Gaza famine was “caused by cruelty, justified by revenge, enabled by indifference and sustained by complicity”. Fletcher then appealed to world leaders to pressure Netanyahu to lift the siege.That plea was ultimately intended for Trump, the only leader who can force Netanyahu to end Gaza’s suffering. But the Israeli prime minister and his government continue to defy global outrage, largely because they have Trump’s unwavering support.Since early 2024, the UN and international relief groups have been sounding alarms about the potential for widespread starvation in Gaza because of theIsraeli military blockadethat started within days of the October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.As I wrote recently, Joe Biden ignored these warnings while his administration tried to undermine criticism of its unconditional weapons shipments to Israel. Throughout 2024, when parts of Gaza reached the brink of starvation, Israel would ease its siege allowing some food and supplies to reach desperate Palestinians – and averting a descent into full-blow famine.But Netanyahu abandoned that strategy in early March, when he imposed a new siege on Gaza, withTrump’s tacit approval, depriving Palestinians of food, medicine and other basic needs. Netanyahu, who worried that his extremist government coalition would collapse if he agreed to a permanent truce with Hamas, quicklyresumed Israel’s war, breaking a ceasefire that was in place for two months. Since then, Israel has inflicted a more severe siege and starvation campaign on Gaza.On 18 August, Hamas announced that it hadaccepted a ceasefiredeal that is virtually identical to one that Israel and the US had proposed a few weeks earlier. But as he has done fornearly two years, Netanyahu is dragging his feet and making new demands to obstruct negotiations and torpedo any potential deal. Ultimately, Netanyahu wants to prolong the war and stay in power.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Speaking to reporters at the White House on Monday,Trump saidthe Gaza war would reach “a conclusive ending” in the next two or three weeks.Netanyahu has been promising – and failing to deliver – a “total victory” over Hamas for more than a year. “Total victory over Hamas will not take years,” he said confidentlyin a speechin February 2024. “It will take months.” Since then, Netanyahu expressed lofty ambitions to reshape the entire Middle East, but he continued to defy international and domestic pressure to specify Israel’s postwar plans for Gaza or how the war could end short of his amorphous goal of “total victory”. And that was a deliberate tactic: from the beginning, Netanyahu’s allies wanted a protracted war that would end with Israel occupying Gaza andethnically cleansingits Palestinian inhabitants.Last week, a top Biden administration official confirmed inan interviewaired by an Israeli TV channel that, soon after the October 2023 Hamas attack, Netanyahu was preparing for a grinding guerrilla war in Gaza which could last “for decades”. Matthew Miller, the former state department spokesperson who often defended the administration’s unconditional support for Israel, also said that Netanyahu had repeatedly sabotaged US-brokered ceasefire negotiations. (An Israeli TV report found the prime minister nixed deals or near-agreementsseven times.) But the Biden administration consistently blamed Hamas for refusing to accept a ceasefire, and rarely called out Netanyahu for his obstinacy, thinking it would harden Hamas’s position.For 15 months, Biden provided the Israeli premier with political cover and billions of dollars in US arms, becoming more deeply complicit in Israel’s use of starvation as a weapon and other war crimes. Today, Trump is repeating the same ineffective and immoral strategy, enticed by Netanyahu’s empty promise of victory while famine spreads inGaza.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies, and a journalism professor, at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsGazaOpinionDonald TrumpBenjamin NetanyahuJoe BidenFamineHungerTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

To wit: over breakfast I read about the great sunflower fields at Westgate Farm near Walsingham, Norfolk, which for the two weeks that the mighty blooms are in mighty bloom across its 16 acres invites people to come and pick their own for a small fee. Have you ever heard of anything better? Desire – no, need – filled me.I demanded my husband – the driver of the family, for Walsingham is a short car trip away – abandon his desk, crowbarred my son out of bed and by 10am we were looking out over acres of sunflowers under an azure sky, and do you know what? It was even better than I had imagined. It’s just sunflowers, you see. Sunflowers almost literally as far as the eye can see. All facing the same way, because they are – get this – flowers that follow the sun.We followed the little dusty tracks that led through the fields and wind about so that eventually you are facing the flowers and they are facing you, and the effect is so joyful and uplifting that even your family hostages begin to break into smiles.We picked our allowance of five each and were home by lunchtime. They are now in a massive vase I was once mocked for buying but which I must have known somewhere deep in my soul was meant for this, and life is good.TuesdayTaylor Swift and Travis Kelce are engaged! If this means nothing to you, that’s fine. Move on. If it means something to you – hurrah!Taylor Swiftand Travis Kelce are engaged!People, we need this. We need a good news story that we can follow for months with avidity. It’s been a while, y’know? Everything I need is already in place: it’s a couple I recognise, who seem nice, and in whose existence I am not remotely invested, and the ring is proper. A million dollars’ worth of diamond on a silver or platinum or something band (I do not care about bands, I care about diamonds) that Elizabeth Taylor might have deigned to give house room to.My only criticism is the floral backdrop against which the happy pair stood for the Instagram shot announcing the engagement. It was SPARSE. It was PALTRY. I suggest a reshoot. You know where. Sunflowers are what you need.WednesdayBiddy Baxter, thou shouldst be living at this hour. No, thou really should, because thou wouldst have stopped this latest nonsense in its tracks: Blue Peter is marking its 67th year by ending its tradition of live shows, so that editing can make the content snappier to compete with online content and increase the likelihood of viral moments being created.

Whither the rogue pachyderms of yesteryear?Lulu the elephant and her bowel movements were broadcast before I was born, yet it remains an iconic moment of my childhood. How? Because we may not have had t’internetz or social media back then but we had Denis Norden, It’ll Be Alright on the Night and eventually home VCRs and we knew how to make our own fun.Postscript: This entry sent me down something of a rabbit hole and I can now confirm that the 1977clip of newsreader Colin Baker(“Soaked, with cold feet, an aching heart, married, several children, and pissed off.

There were 749 diagnoses per 100,000 people in 2024, in case you were wondering. Islington was next with 724 (so close, Islington! Say no to a few more condoms in this – uh – coming quarter and you may take the 2025 crown), and Archway third with a nugatory 397 per 100,000 inhabitants. Liverpool had the highest rate of any regional city, followed by Nottingham and Manchester. Croydon, Newcastle upon Tyne, Blackpool and Leeds made up the rest of the top 10.I am glad my days of sexual adventuring, going into town and up north are all safely over. If yours are not, let me share with you a factoid I had forgotten and which may help keep your genitals from becoming interested in anyone else’s whenever you think of it: another nickname for gonorrhoea is “the drip” and I remember now that is the worst thing I have ever heard.FridayLook at us, heading into the weekend and at last, at last, September! It’s the most wonderful time of the year. In fact, it marks the true new year. The real time for resolutions. Academic diaries want you to buy them, autumn wants you to hunker down and dedicate yourself to good and self-improving works (summer wants you to disport yourself, be the louche villain you’ve always wanted to be), and for anyone who made it through tertiary education it is hardwired into us as the chance for achievement/re-invention and makes far more sense than an essentially arbitrary midnight and Jools Holland giving the nod.We all crave meaning, structure and authority – universally symbolised by the purchase of a Helix Oxford geometry set in a silver tin from WH Smith, despite a set square not having seen legitimate use in a place of learning since Lulu was leaving her mark in a studio. School and its rhythms increasingly seem to have been the last bastion of them all, of peace. Especially now our own children are about to return there after two long, long months.

We mobilised 800 people to support the asylum seekers, who waved back at us from the hotel to show their gratitude. On the other side of the road, about 250 people had gathered to demand the hotel be closed. Speakers there called refugees “illegal”, “invaders” and “parasites”.Seeing and hearing our opponents, the anti-racists responded with a spontaneous chant of “Nazi scum, off our streets”, which our side was able to sustain for more than an hour. I understand why people wanted to express their contempt for the people who tell lies about refugees, but the chant didn’t strike me as effective when I heard it, and the more I have thought about it since, the more convinced I am that it was the wrong strategy.There were fascists present at the demonstration – one banner advertised a small hard-right group – but they were not the organisers; they hung back, mute, at the edge of the protest. The crowd did chant in support of Tommy Robinson. The latter, I suspect, is probably the link that organisations like Stand Up to Racism lean on when labelling the current anti-refugee movement as fascist. (Many of the protests, their spokesperson has said, “are organised by known fascists and Hitler admirers”.) But Robinson, unlike the fascists of the 1970s, doesn’t leaven his speeches with reworked passages from Mein Kampf.He isn’t a “Hitler admirer”, nor is he perceived as such by the movement. He used to boast of having a Churchill quotetattooed on his arm.The strategy of labelling our enemies fascist depends on a context where the mainstream is willing to isolate and shame Nazis. Those are not the times we are living in. So a smarter, more tailored message is necessary.Take Robert Jenrick, the shadow lord chancellor, who recently attended an anti-refugee protest in Epping.Anti-fascists released a photographfrom the protest featuring Jenrick with Eddy Butler in the background – Butler is a former election candidate for the British National party and was the guru behind its “rights for whites” campaign in the 1990s. What was most revealing about the incident was what came next: a “source close” to Jenrick said hedid not know who Butler was; Jenrick kept the photographs of his time in Epping showing on his X profile. He made it clear he wasn’t embarrassed, and the story dissipated to nothing.If the movement was perceived as fascist – by Jenrick, or by the other Conservative and Reform politicians who have associated themselves with it, or by the Labour ministers who have conceded the right’s main demands and agreed to close the refugee hotels – then it would not be as confident and unrepentant as it is. And behind the politicians who have flattered the street movement are a much larger group who share its insistence on describing migration in negative terms. Keir Starmer, the prime minister,tweetedthan a dozen times in August about migration – every one of his messages has presented it as problematic, “illegal” or the work of criminal people smugglers.1:19Protesters clash at asylum hotel demonstrations across the UK – videoIn the weeks since the Barbican protest, the anti-refugee movement has kept up its momentum. Calling them Nazis – even when there were fascists present at the edges of their event – has done little to undermine them. They don’t believe they are fascists; they don’t have organised fascists in their leading circles. The term seems to them exaggerated, laughable.You may say I’m expecting too much of one term; even if the fascist label had worked, and got under our opponents’ skins, there is no way we would know it was working. But in the 1970s, it was common for former supporters of the National Front to break with that campaign and to cite its fascism as their reason for leaving. Here is one defector quoted in the East End Advertiserin 1977, explaining that she abandoned the far right when she saw pictures of Front leader John Tyndall dressed in a Nazi uniform. “I won’t stand for any of this Sieg Heil nonsense,” the former NF member said. (This was, of course, a mere 30 years after the blitz; east London still bore the physical scars left by German bombs.) If the same tactics were working 50 years later, anti-fascists would be meeting people like that and making sure their stories were in the press.Flags as symbols of prejudice, not pride – and a distinct air of menace. Welcome to England 2025 | John HarrisRead moreWhen we deal with the far right now, we are facing a movement that is pushing forward a group of female leaders – that feels different from five years ago, let alone 50 years since. In Islington, one of the speeches came from a woman described as running a local nursery (it was read out on her behalf). The contemporary far right is focused on pushing a single narrative about refugees, all based on the same logic – that the people in the hotel are single men, are foreigners, and on both scores are likely to be sexual predators.This argument wins supporters, and it shields them from accusations that they are extremists. The only way to confront this is to meet it head on, by rejecting any idea that foreign men – or Muslims – are more prone to sexual offences than their British counterparts. The logic of the argument is racist – it relies on the assumption that just because they are migrants, or asylum seekers, or not white (and with no other supportive evidence), they must be more prone to sexual violence than the men who already live here.And the simplest, one-line refutation of it is to look at the men who were arrested for offences in the various race riots that followed events at Southport last year. Of those men, a staggering 40% had beenreported to the police for domestic violence. There is, in other words, probablyno single group of people – not in Britain or anywhere else – who are more prone to violence against women than the people now standing outside the hotels denouncing refugees.This, rather than shouting Nazi, is the argument most likely to undermine the anti-refugee protests. We need to be using it in our leaflets, when we talk to people, and on our protests.David Renton is a barrister and the author of The New Authoritarians: Convergence on the RightDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

And they don’t give up when things get toughScott McDonald is chief executive of the British CouncilFri 29 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 29 Aug 2025 10.14 EDTShareOn Wednesday night, our office in Kyiv wasdamaged in a Russian missile attack. It was a stark reminder of the risks that an organisation such as ours faces in conflict-affected areas. I was relieved to hear that all colleagues were safe and accounted for. One colleague was injured and admitted to hospital but thankfully he is in a stable condition.Working under such conditions around the world is challenging, and yet, time and again, our colleagues and partners demonstrate courage and commitment in carrying on despite the dangers. Their resilience is extraordinary. We are working to find ways to minimise disruption and continuing to support our team there.Persistent air alerts mean some of our colleagues are required to remain in shelters, but sadly this is nothing new. The war has taken an enormous toll on the Ukrainian population, including a deterioration in quality of life, severe psychological and emotional challenges, and the disruption of social connections and education.But the unyielding spirit of the people is always evident. Take, for instance, a British Council event that took place in September last year, when we set up a pop-up event in Lviv in partnership with Molodvizh, the city’s largest youth event. Tragically, during a missile attack a few hours before the event, a representative of a partner organisation was killed, along with her family. This greatly affected everyone, but it was felt by all the partners that it was important the event should continue.Despite these perilous circumstances, British Council colleagues and partner organisations continue our work with education, teaching, English language learning and cultural programmes right acrossUkraine, as we have done for the past 30 years. When a country is at war the protection of its culture is ever more important, and the British Council is a key partner in supporting Ukraine.We are working with partners to train more than 15,000 teachers in Ukraine in techniques to help young children living with trauma. We also deliver theUK-Ukraine school partnerships programme, funded by the UK government, which connects about 3,000 pupils and 100 teachers in both countries. Through a shared love of reading, the initiative develops cultural understanding, builds resilience and supports emotional wellbeing.We have also delivered 10,000 online courses in English for displaced Ukrainians in the UK and have connected Ukrainian arts and cultural organisations with their British counterparts, showcasing their work internationally and supporting Ukrainian cultural expression.As an arms-length body of theForeign, Commonwealth and Development Office, we support the UK’s foreign policy interests – but we are designed to operate over the long term, independent and not constrained by short-term government cycles. Today, the British Council works in 200 countries and territories, with people on the ground in 100, reaching more than 600 million people, and connecting them with the UK’s arts and culture, education and English language.My colleagues work in the most complex and often dangerous places, whether in Myanmar, Iraq, the occupied Palestinian territories, Venezuela or Bangladesh. And they don’t give up when the going gets tough. If we are absolutely forced to withdraw from a region, we return as soon as possible. This means that our history has not been without tragedy. In 1971, guards were killedprotecting our office in Dhakaduring Bangladesh’s liberation war. More lives were lost during theTaliban attack on our officein Kabul in 2011. There have been shootings, arrests and detentions. We will always be grateful to the people who have stood with us against those who will go to the most violent ends to disrupt our work.Over the past 90 years there have been periods of friction, war and conflict and some of relative peace. I fear the years ahead hold significant challenge. But that is when the British Council needs to deliver more than ever.This war has damaged Ukraine’s infrastructure, putting the right to education of millions of young people at stake. The British government recentlycommitted to a 100-year partnershipwith Ukraine, signifying the breadth and depth of relationships between our countries. The work of the British Council is more important than ever – it will continue throughout the war, office or no office.Scott McDonald is chief executive of the British CouncilDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

New stuff. New camera angles. Director: “And cut to Ref Cam.” Suddenly we are transported from the gliding calm of a wide angle to GoldenEye on the Nintendo 64, except you are not James Bond, you are Simon Hooper peering up at a strange angle of Harvey Barnes. Stop looking around Simon, stand still Simon. As one correspondent to Guardian Football Weekly suggested, it’s the Professional Game Match Officials’ tribute to Uncut Gems.New season –wildly terrible predictions. My Premier League winners Manchester City won the titleat Wolves on the opening weekendbut are now sensationally out of the race after beingoutplayed by Spurs. Not sure anyone predicted Nuno Espírito Santo to be leading the sack race (nb:written before Grimsby). Who had Ange to lead Nottingham Forest to Europa League glory?New season – the constants that remind you that football never changes. Manchester United without a win – GRIMSBY! West Ham fans streaming out long before the final whistle. Joelinton avoiding a booking. Bournemouth/Wolves/Fulham fans complaining that you haven’t talked about Bournemouth/Wolves/Fulham enough. Existential crisesnorth of the border.Speaking of existential crises … New season – more children concurrently reminding you of your own mortality and lack of general life achievements. Max Dowman: maybe the first Premier League player born after the Soccer AM “glory years” began (I presume that’s how everyone measures the passing of time). A 16-year-oldscoring the winner for Liverpool at Newcastle(long after his bedtime, etc). Rio Ngumoha is 17 on Friday. You’re 16 until you’re 17. Happy birthday, Rio.New season – new directives from the PGMO. Oh, here we go, don’t spend too long on this one. Could holding in the box be the new handball? The thing that has us yelling at clouds. “I just don’t know the rules any more.” “This isn’t why people fell in love with the game.” Now the refs are mic’d up, it feels more NFL than ever. “Holding, No 3 on the DE-FENSE, penalty Manchester United.”Before the season, the head of the PGMO, Howard Webb, said: “If you get one of those situations where one player is clearly dragging another one to the floor in an extreme non-football action, even if it’s off the ball, we expect the referee to see it … If it’s a clear one, then the VAR will intervene and recommend the referee looks at it at the screen because it fits the criteria that we’ve laid out. An extreme non-footballing action which prevents an opponent from moving.”So we haveCalvin Bassey v Mason Mount.Bassey very much the senior wrestler – the Ultimate Warrior, with Mount in the Barry Horowitz role. Mount commits himself and Bassey just rolls him, forgetting to pin him for the intercontinental title. Surprisingly Chris Kavanagh wasn’t knocked out by a chair by Sander Berge before giving the penalty.View image in fullscreenRio Ngumoha looks suitably stunned to have scored the winning goal against Newcastle within minutes of his Premier League debut, aged 16.Photograph: Scott Heppell/ReutersAccording to the laws, it is a penalty. But as many have pointed out, Luke Shaw is attempting a figure-four leg lock on Rodrigo Muniz at the same time. And then in the second half, Leny Yoro gets away with pushing Bassey in the back before heading the ball off Muniz and into the net. According to the VAR the level of contact “wasn’t impactful”.Now whether you think United taking the lead at Craven Cottage is impactful is a broader question. Perhaps not in the context of a universe that has existed for 13.7bn years, but it did have the impact of Bassey not being able to head the ball, giving Yoro a free header and United a goal. Perhaps the PGMO is thinking more deeply than the rest of us.So here is yet another imbalance weighted against defenders in thePremier League. Already they have to spend most of their time with their hands behind their back, defending against attackers who can move theirs around freely in all the natural positions arms go in. And now attackers can push defenders around with relative impunity.It has obviously always been the case that a defender risks more by pushing an attacker in the box than the other way round. If Mount pushes Bassey over (good luck with that, Mason), he might get away with it, and if he doesn’t, Fulham get a free-kick in their own box. The other way round, as happened on Sunday, and it’s a penalty. Rob Green explained excellently on the all-new (same) Match of the Day that Mount has no interest in winning the ball. He is just trying to stop Bassey – back to the NFL again – and blocking doesn’t feel too far away from a non-footballing action.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Attackers can barge into defenders, create space for their teammates to get a free header, maybe get a penalty if they’re lucky, while defenders have to fend off the opposition running into them, without fending off the opposition running into them. And so much is happening in the penalty area that sometimes they’ll be given and sometimes they won’t.The extra scrutiny means there is a risk of more delays and more penalties. And we don’t need more penalties. Football is the best sport because goals are rare. More goals doesn’t make it better, especially penalties.The solution is to give the defence the advantage. If the VAR is staring at a crowded penalty area at a set piece, then if any defender is being fouled, regardless of the wrestling elsewhere, the free-kick goes in their favour. So a new season, a new directive to get confused about. Let’s hope it’s not as impactful as a two-handed shove in the back, however impactful that is.On Thursday 11 September, join Max Rushden, Barry Glendenning and newly announced panellists: Jonathan Wilson, Nicky Bandini and Jonathan Liew for Football Weekly Live at the Troxy, London.

It’s time to rethink who really controls moneyFri 29 Aug 2025 12.30 EDTLast modified on Fri 29 Aug 2025 13.26 EDTShareDonald Trump’sattemptto sack the Federal Reserve governor, Lisa Cook, is the familiar authoritarian trick of bending institutions to serve the leader’s immediate ends. The widespreadcondemnationis deserved. This is not some daring experiment in popular control of monetary policy. Yet what should follow censure is reflection. For the furore over Ms Cook has revealed a peculiar reflex: to defend the Fed’s independence as though it weresynonymouswith democracy itself.But is independence of the Fed, or central banks generally, really that?Eric Levitz at Voxthinks so, or at least that it is close enough. He argues that Congress sets the Fed’s objectives; independence applies only to the means. Without independence, politicians would be free to game rates for votes – asRichard Nixondid in 1972, leaning on the Fed to juice growth before the election. On this view, independence is not anti-democratic but prudent delegation.The historianAdam Toozesays that argument misses the point. The Fed, he says, is not a neutral technocracy: its regional boards give business elites formal seats at the table, while labour and consumers are marginal or absent. Independence is not independence from politics; it is independence from electoral accountability. To defend this arrangement as democracy’s bulwark, Prof Tooze maintains, is to confuse professional consensus with popular legitimacy.Theleftwing economist Michael Robertsgoes further. In his blog this week he argues that central bank independence was never really about technocratic efficiency at all. It blossomed in the neoliberal era because it suited finance. He notes that the 1980s and 90s saw a sharp rise in central bank independence while inflation fell. The correlation has been taken as proof of causation. Yet Mr Roberts argues that the decline in prices owed more to slowing global growth and the end of one-off supply shocks.Central banks proved no better than anyone else at forecasting crises: the former Fed chair Alan Greenspan admitted the 2008 crash left him in “a state of shocked disbelief”. Turkey’s recent bout ofhyperinflationwas blamed on presidential meddling – but Mr Roberts suggests the real culprits were trade deficits, political instability and a collapsing lira. Monetary policy is too blunt an instrument, as manycommentatorsconcede, to deal with today’s volatile world. So where does this leave informed opinion? Certainly not with Mr Trump. To replace one form of unaccountability with a demagogic strongman is no gain. The real task is to ask what a democratic politics of central banking would look like.The academic Saule Omarova’sPeople’s Ledgeris one radical answer: treat the Fed as a public utility, offering universal bank accounts and explicitly aligning its balance sheet with public priorities. ANational Investment Authoritycould channel long-term finance towards infrastructure and decarbonisation, rather than leaving investment decisions to Wall Street. Efforts could be made tobroadenboard representation beyond business, requiredistributional impact assessmentsand tighten “for cause” clauses so that presidents cannot hound governors from office on flimsy pretexts.Mr Trump’s assault must be denounced – and Ms Cook defended. But if voters stop there, a deeper lesson will be missed.Central bank independencewas never democracy incarnate. At best it was a compromise suited to an earlier era. Today’s challenge is to rebuild monetary authority on firmer, more democratic ground.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But his own works should be staged more, and he should be commemorated betterFri 29 Aug 2025 12.25 EDTLast modified on Fri 29 Aug 2025 13.35 EDTShareFor a limited season this autumn,Christopher Marlowewill become a star of the London stage again. Enjoy it while you can, for Marlowe has become an ephemeral figure in Britain’s national culture. His plays, once staples, are now produced only intermittently, if at all. Today, Marlowe is probably better known for his dramatic death, stabbed in a London riverside tavern, than for anything he wrote or for being the literary pioneer that he was.From next week, however, the sexy and brilliant figure of Kit Marlowe will be the centrepiece character, played byNcuti Gatwa, in Liz Duffy Adams’s two-hander,Born With Teeth, which is currently in previews in the West End, with its offical opening next week. The play teases with the possibility, first reportedin this newspaperin 2016, that Marlowe and William Shakespeare, played by Edward Bluemel, collaborated on writing parts of the Henry VI trilogy. But not just that. Perhaps the two playwrights, both born in 1564, were lovers. And perhaps Shakespeare even had a hand in Marlowe’s murder in 1593.Ms Adams is not the first writer to put Marlowe and Shakespeare on the stage together. Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard did the same in theirShakespeare in Lovescreenplay, adapted for the theatre by Lee Hall. Here too, Marlowe is the more charismatic figure, while Shakespeare struggles in his shadow. It is Marlowe who suggests that Shakespeare, searching for an analogy to start his new love sonnet, should compare his love not to an autumn morning but to a summer’s day, and Marlowe, too, who suggests that Juliet would be a better name for Romeo’s beloved than Shakespeare’s proposed Ethel.As moments like these suggest, there’s always a clever trick in any play in which Shakespeare himself appears. We the audience know what those on stage never can. We know that Shakespeare will conquer the world for centuries to come. His fellow characters can only see just another jobbing but talented playwright, whose star is obviously eclipsed by that of the dazzling Marlowe.Yet how strongly does Marlowe’s light shine today? England’s second most famous Elizabethan playwright is still a name. His plays, though, are no longer shared points of reference in the way that Shakespeare’s, thank goodness, still are. The Royal Shakespeare Company still does Marlowe fairly regularly, most recentlyEdward IIearlier this year. So does theMalthouseat Marlowe’s old school in Canterbury, where the city’s theatre is also named after the playwright. But the National Theatre, disgracefully, seems to have given up. In 1976, amid fanfares, the Olivier Theatre opened its doors on London’s South Bank with Marlowe’s Tamburlaine. It has never put the play on since. It is now12 yearssince the National has done anything by Marlowe at all.Two things could and should be done to restore Marlowe to his rightful place. The first, obviously and simply, is to study and produce his plays more. Schools and exam boards have crucial roles here, but the subsidised theatre should lead the way. The second is to commemorate Marlowe properly. The playwright’s violent death inDeptford Strand, on the south bank of the Thames, is the stuff of conspiracy theories andspeculation. Yet walk along Deptford Strand and you will find no monument there to this baleful event. A wall plaque inSt Nicholas’s churchgraveyard notes that Marlowe’s remains were buried nearby. But the site is littered with empty beer bottles. We surely owe Marlowe greater honour than this.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

First, the case against asylum seekers is based on the impact on public services and the costs of accommodation. Then we have references to “fighting-age men”. Then we have Nigel Farage explicitly saying that asylum seekers are a threat to “our women and girls” and national security. It’s a short step from there to “vigilantes” being emboldened to harass anyone of colour in the vicinity of an asylum hotel or detention camp. Then the distinction between asylum seekers and immigrants gets blurred. This is the road to serious racial conflict. Just look at theexample of Northern Ireland, where perfectly normal legal immigrants have been driven out of some areas by rightwing thugs.And what is the Labour government’s response? Debunking Reform UK’s increasingly inflammatory myths about asylum seekers and immigrants? If only. Instead they call Farage’s plans impractical or unworkable. Besides the moral cowardice this displays, it’s also pretty stupid when the government’s own responses to the situation show every sign of failing to work.Simon RewLondonThe Democrats said the same about Donald Trump (Farage attacked for ‘ugly’ rhetoric of plan for mass deportation of asylum seekers, 26 August). He won because he drove the narrative. Likewise, Nigel Farage’s racist populism will win unless Labour drives a strong counter-narrative to dispel the notion of threat. Voters persuaded by Farage will not respond to moralising by his opponents.People need the facts, loud and clear, in simple terms. The reality of who migrants really are, the varied reasons why they come, the small percentage that comes in boats and the vast economic and social contribution of migrants to this country over decades, part of the fabric of our society. Plus our longstanding commitment to giving refuge to people in need.None of this is to deny the complexities of modern migration. But if our government is not seen to respect and promote the truth about migrants, we are in deep trouble. We only have to look across the Atlantic to see why.Paula JonesLondonRafael Behr (There’s an obvious way to challenge Nigel Farage. But Keir Starmer won’t do it, 27 August) is right to decry Nigel Farage’s continued blowing of the immigration dog-whistle, but one does need to take into account the factors which explain why his approach continues to have traction. At the time the Refugee Convention was signed, 1951, the world population was 2.54 billion. It is now around 8.2 billion. The potential scale of refugee arrivals is thus considerably larger than when refugee rights were first adopted. This at a time when the UK cannot afford to grant child support to families with more than two children, has astronomical NHS waiting lists and a shortage of affordable housing.It is all very well waving placards welcoming all comers, but there are legitimate concerns about a problem that is orders of magnitude greater than it has ever been. This government has recognised that fact but is struggling, in common with all other western governments, to find and articulate a solution.Raj ParkashLondonRafael Behr expresses the burning frustration of so many thatLabourrefuses to call out the wholesale folly of leaving the EU as the most damning indictment of British politics, government and administration in decades, and to place the blame firmly where it belongs – on a demagogic snake oil salesman and a playbook informed by a far-right international.The cancer that has metastasised since the referendum is the rise of binary, zero-sum politics in which one can only win by making others lose – and by ever more performative cruelty to punish those who are deemed to be the enemy.There is now a national crisis. It isn’t about desperate people in boats. It is about Britain becoming a hellscape of the kind currently unfolding in the US. Politics is about choices. If progressive parties do not rally what is still a majority in the country who view a future run by fascistic blowhards with contempt and disgust then we are increasingly consigned to mimic a country which many British people, including myself, no longer even consider visiting.Kevin LloydHighbury, LondonNigel Farageand the small number of Reform MPs justifies, at most, a couple of column inches on the inside pages of the Guardian. Unfortunately, and with the finest of intentions, you and the rest of the media continue to make Farage into a towering national political figure. This is what happened with Donald Trump in America and, to an extent, with Boris Johnson. Do beware! Lavish and extensive promotion enables people to think that Nigel Farage is a true and worthy leader.Dr Ian FlintoffOxfordA Downing Street spokesman hasrefused to rule outnegotiations with the Taliban concerning returned refugees. We can be certain that all such refugees will be murdered by the Taliban and that any assurances to the contrary that they may give will not be worth a bucket of cold spit.This statement, following Nigel Farage’s barrel-scraping performance on Tuesday, marks a new and thoroughly despicable low for this country.Keir Starmer, in just over a year you have dragged the party into the moral sewer.

Ana Schnabl’s reflections on her adolescent draw towards black metal’s atmosphere and bleakness, and subsequent horror at the revelation of the politics and motivations of many of the musicians, resonated with me (Angst-filled black metal music became my identity, 25 August).Although metal may reflect and intensify the antagonisms of society more generally (fascism, racism, misogyny and so on), the scene has been and is being reclaimed by the oddballs and outcasts for whom heavy music is not just a sanctuary, but a place to envision a fairer and kinder world.UK black metal bands such as Dawn Ray’d and Underdark sing (or scream) about Marxism and class solidarity.Backxwashand Uboa (Xandra Metcalfe) blend hip-hop and noise, respectively, to craft dissonant anthems of queer and trans experience. Ragana,Divide and Dissolve, and Panopticon howl against Black enslavement and ecological destruction.The spring of radical leftwing black metal bubbles strongly, and it’s well worth drinking deeply.Dr Jac CommonEast Leake, NottinghamshireWhat a shame Ana Schnabl deserted black metal, a vast genre made up of bands from Azerbaijan to Kenya to Iceland to Peru, with hundreds in the UK alone. I’m not going to deny there is a notable presence of far-right projects within black metal. Thankfully (for me at least), there’s a very vibrant anti-fascist black metal scene too, putting out excellent music and channelling the genre’s intense emotional power into extremely justified anger at the state of the world. Avoiding the sketchy acts takes a bit of due diligence, but it’s more than worth it.Jo PalmerChelmsfordAs a fan of some black metal, I read Ana Schnabl’s article with interest. The fascist sympathies of some of the genre’s creators are well documented, but the modern black metal world is diverse. The feminist black metal band Witch Club Satan play theSupersonic festivalthis year, and Agriculture play “ecstatic” black metal with a queer aesthetic. Don’t write off the whole genre any more than you would dismiss all punk because some punks had Nazi sympathies.When we’re young and naive, we may well pledge our allegiance foolishly, be that to black metal or the Bay City Rollers.

Over the past nine months, Serbia has experienced more than 23,000 unauthorised rallies. Most were small, sometimes just a few dozen people, but they disturbed daily life, brought government to a halt, and recently turned violent. More than 170 police officers have been injured. Despite this, police actions have remained limited and restrained, and have targeted only those who damaged property or assaulted officers.The initial demands of student protesters late last year were met promptly. We opened investigations, released thousands of documents on the railway station renovation and boosted education funding, and the prime minister resigned, taking responsibility for youth clashes over the issue. Nevertheless, demonstrations continued, shifting away from seeking justice and toward overt political aims: the removal of the government outside democratic processes.Serbia is deeply engaged withEuropeand steadily advancing its democratic and economic development. The EU provides more than 60% of foreign direct investment and has committed €1.6bn by 2027 to support reforms. Such a level of engagement is hardly consistent with the idea of Serbia as an “authoritarian” and “malign” outlier in the region. The EU would not invest so heavily in a country where its values and interests were fundamentally rejected.Serbia is a democracy. It will hold elections before the 2027 deadline, as it has consistently done for more than a decade, and in the meantime it is making progress on electoral reforms. WhatSerbiacannot accept is violence disguised as activism, undermining institutions that have been carefully built with dedication and the support of its European partners.Aleksandar VučićPresident of the Republic of SerbiaExplore more on these topicsSerbiaEuropeProtestEuropean UnionlettersShareReuse this content"

Twenty million visitors a year can’t all be wrong.Llewelyn-Bowen wonders why Blackpool’s unique appeal doesn’t seem to register with people living in the south of England.

Ukraine’s president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said eight people were still missing and 53 had been injured. “When instead of diplomacy, Russia chooses ballistics … the world must respond accordingly,” he said, urging western allies to impose further sanctions.Separately, the Ukrainian leader said Russia was massing a force of 100,000 troops near the eastern Ukrainiancity of Pokrovsk. “There is a buildup and concentration of the enemy there. Up to 100,000 – that’s what we have as of this morning. They are preparing offensive actions,” Zelenskyy said.The Guardian view on Russia’s strike on Kyiv: Putin is testing Trump’s will and Europe’s resolve | EditorialRead moreEurope’s high representative for foreign affairs, Kaja Kallas, responding to the attacks on Kyiv, issueda statementaccusing Russia of disregard for international law and of undermining peace efforts.“Intentional attacks against civilians and non-military objectives are war crimes,” he said. “These crimes only reinforce our determination and resolve to supportUkraineand its people in their defence against Russia and their pursuit of a comprehensive, just and lasting peace.”The statement was endorsed by the UK and all EU member states except Hungary, which is led by Putin’s ally Viktor Orbán, who has long denigrated Ukraine andsought to block EU aidto the country.The latest attackson the Ukrainian capitalwere the deadliest sinceDonald Trump met Putin in Alaskafor an inconclusive summit, where he laid out the red carpet for the Russian leader, who has been indicted for war crimes.Trump has indicated he wants a bilateral meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy, but while the Ukrainian leader has shown his readiness,the Kremlin has held back.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said Putin would have “played” Trump if he refused to meet Zelenskyy. After Macron hosted the German leader, Friedrich Merz, in the south of France, France and Germany pledged to increase air defence to Ukraine.In a joint statement, the key EU countries said: “Despite intensive international diplomatic efforts,Russiashows no intention to end its war of aggression against Ukraine.”Kallas said the latest attacks showed “that Putin is just mocking any kind of peace efforts that are made. So what we have to do is increase pressure on Russia and this is really what they understand.”After the deadly strike in the early hours of Thursday morning, the EU has vowed to introduce a further round of sanctions against Russia – the 19th since the full-scale invasion began in 2022 – increase military aid for Ukraine, and discuss seizing €210bn of Russian assets frozen in the bloc.Lithuania’s defence minister, Dovilė Šakalienė, said hopes of peace negotiations were “at least naive” and Putin was “cheaply buying time to kill more people”. She praised efforts to secure peace, saying that “nobody [had] thought of anything better than [what] Washington is doing”.Colm McGivern, the director of the British Council in Ukraine, said Thursday’s airstrikes had injured a security guard and made the cultural organisation’s Kyiv headquarters “unusable”.While there is no evidence the council was deliberately targeted, McGivern said, “what I do know is that Russia has targeted educational and cultural infrastructure in Ukraine repeatedly”.A neighbouring building in the city centre was struck at 5.40am and the blast-wave from the explosion blew out the British Council’s windows, destroyed its ceilings and wrecked its computers, the director said.Russian missiles will not stop our support for Ukraine – the British Council’s vital work goes on | Scott McDonaldRead moreMcGivern said that the 120 staff of the unit, 119 of whom are Ukrainian, had vowed to continue with the British Council’s cultural activities. “It was another night where Ukraine has been subject to a barbaric attack,” McGivern said. “There is a palpable level of anger, and colleagues are more determined than ever to do all they can, to act on the things they can control, which is strengthen the relationship with the UK.”EU defence ministers meeting in Copenhagen discussed security guarantees for Ukraine, amid US pressure on European allies to shoulder more responsibility for the security of the continent.Kallas wants to reorganise an EU troop-training mission so Ukrainian soldiers could receive instruction inside Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire. The EU has said about 80,000 Ukrainian troops have taken part in the training programme since 2022.The latest Russian attacks have intensified calls to use Russia’s frozen assets in Europe as leverage over Putin and to help Ukraine in its defence.Šakalienė expressed support for seizing Russia’s frozen assets and giving them to Ukraine, saying they would be “extremely helpful” for Ukraine’s defence industry and “very good motivation for Putin to sit at the negotiations table”.The EU has an agreement touse the windfall profits on Russian assets for Ukrainebut has balked at seizing the capital, which ismostly held at Euroclear in Belgium, fearing weakening investor confidence in eurozone financial institutions.EU foreign ministers are to discuss using Russia’s frozen assets at a separate meeting with Kallas on Saturday.After the attacks on Thursday, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said that the EU was “advancing the work on the Russian frozen assets to contribute to Ukraine’s defence and reconstruction”. A spokesperson later said she was referring to use of the profits, which have generated €9bn in funds for Ukraine in 2025, rather than the assets.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionRussiaEuropeUkraineVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyynewsShareReuse this content"

What is happening, and what is the drug etomidate?Vaping has been banned since 2018, but now authorities are seeing a rise in young people using them to take an anaesthetic agentRebecca RatcliffeSouth-east Asia correspondentFri 29 Aug 2025 19.25 EDTLast modified on Fri 29 Aug 2025 19.27 EDTShareSingapore will crack down on the vaping and drug-laced vapes from Monday, introducing heavier fines, lengthy prison sentences and even caning in some cases.Vaping has been banned since 2018 in Singapore, which is known for having some of the world’s toughest drug laws, but the authorities will impose tougher measures from September in response to concerns about the emergence of vapes laced with the anaesthetic agent etomidate, popularly known as Kpods, short for ketamine pods.Under the changes, etomidate has been reclassified from a poison to a Class C drug, bringing tougher penalties for misuse, while vapers will also face bigger fines.What is the drug etomidate?Etomidate is an intravenous anaesthetic, used in medical settings. However, the Singapore authorities say it is increasingly being mixed with vape juice.Random testing of confiscated vapes in July found that one in three contained etomidate, according to officials. Online sellers have promoted Kpods online as being undetectable by urine tests.Etomidate was listed as a dangerous drug in Hong Kong and China as of February this year, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, and said it had also been found in vaping products in Indonesia and Thailand.What are the penalties for using vapes containing the drug?The reclassification of etomidate from 1 September will result in tougher penalties.Individuals caught using Kpods will also face tougher penalties, with a fine of S$500 (US$390) for under-18s, or S$700 (US$545) for adult offenders. They will be required to attend a rehabilitation programme for up to six months. Repeat offenders could face fines of up to S$2,000 (US$1,557) and/or 10 years in jail.Individuals found to be importing Kpods will face between three and 20 years in prison, as well as caning, while offenders caught selling or distributing Kpods could be jailed for between two and 10 years, as well as caning.What about for those using regular vapes?Vaping has been banned since 2018 but remains popular in Singapore. Under new rules adult users will be fined S$700, while vape users under 18 will face a fine of S$500, with increased penalties for repeat offenders.Those caught a second time will have to attend a rehabilitation programme for three months, while subsequent offenders will be prosecuted and fined up to S$2,000.Why are authorities so concerned about vaping?Health minister Ong Ye Kung has said vapes have become a “gateway for very serious substance abuse”.The authorities are especially concerned that vaping is popular among young people, and report that about a third of vapers are under 18, and more than half are below 30.Under new measures, schools have been given saliva test kits that can detect nicotine, local media reported, and students caught vaping will face disciplinary action, including possible suspension or expulsion from school.Students suspected of using Kpods will be sent for urine testing.According to local media, vape bins will be introduced at Changi airport for travellers flying into Singapore or transiting, with more notices played to warn foreigners about the tougher rules.Foreign nationals will face the same penalties, and risk having their passes revoked, or being deported and banned from re-entering Singapore, according to local media.Explore more on these topicsSingaporeAsia PacificVapingDrugsexplainersShareReuse this content"

While his initial prompts to the AI chatbot were about subjects like geometry and chemistry – questions like: “What does it mean in geometry if it says Ry=1” – in just a matter of months he began asking about more personal topics.“Why is it that I have no happiness, I feel loneliness, perpetual boredom anxiety and loss yet I don’t feel depression, I feel no emotion regarding sadness,” he asked ChatGPT in the fall of 2024.Instead of urging Raine to seek mental health help, ChatGPT asked the teen whether he wanted to explore his feelings more, explaining the idea of emotional numbness to him. That was the start of a dark turn in Raine’s conversations with the chatbot,according to a new lawsuitfiled by his family against OpenAI and chief executive Sam Altman.In April 2025, after months of conversation with ChatGPT and with the bot’s encouragement, the lawsuit alleges, Raine took his own life. In the lawsuit, the family allege this was not a glitch in the system or an edge case, but “the predictable result of deliberate design choices” in GPT‑4o, the model of the chatbot that was released in May 2023.In the hours after the Raine family filed the complaint against OpenAI and Altman, the company issued a statementacknowledgingthe shortcomings of its models when it came to addressing people “in serious mental and emotional distress” and said it was working to improve the systems to better “recognize and respond to signs of mental and emotional distress and connect people with care, guided by expert input”. The company said ChatGPT was trained “to not provide self-harm instructions and to shift into supportive, empathic language” but that protocol sometimes broke down in longer conversations or sessions.Jay Edelson, one of the lawyers representing the family, said the company’s response was “silly”.“The idea they need to be more empathetic misses the point,” said Edelson. “The problem with [GPT] 4o is it’s too empathetic – it leaned into [Raine’s suicidal ideation] and supported that. They said the world is a horrible place for you. It needs to be less empathetic and less sycophantic.”OpenAI also said that its system did not block content when it should have because the system “underestimates the severity of what it’s seeing” and that the company is continuing to roll out stronger guardrails for users under 18 so that they “recognize teens’ unique developmental needs”.Despite the company acknowledging that the system doesn’t already have those safeguards in place for minors and teens, Altman is continuing to push the adoption of ChatGPT in schools, Edelson pointed out.“I don’t think kids should be using GPT‑4o at all,” Edelson said. “When Adam started using GPT‑4o, he was pretty optimistic about his future. He was using it for homework, he was talking about going to medical school, and it sucked him into this world where he became more and more isolated. The idea now thatSam Altmanin particular is saying ‘we got a broken system but we got to get eight-year-olds’ on it is not OK.”Already, in the days since the family filed the complaint, Edelson said, he and the legal team have heard from other people with similar stories and are examining the facts of those cases thoroughly. “We’ve been learning a lot about other people’s experiences,” he said, adding that his team has been “encouraged” by the urgency with which regulators are addressing the chatbot’s failings. “We’re hearing that people are moving for state legislation, for hearings and regulatory action,” Edelson said. “And there’s bipartisan support.”‘GPT-4o is broken’The family’s case hinges on media reports that OpenAI, at the urging of Altman, sped through safety testing of GPT-4o – the model Raine was using – in order to meet arushed launch date. The rush prompted several employees to resign, including a former executive named Jan Leike, who posted on X that he was leaving the company because “safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products”.This resulted in less time to create the “model spec” or the technical rule book that governed ChatGPT’s behavior and in OpenAI writing “contradictory specifications that guaranteed failure”, the family’s lawsuit alleges. “The Model Spec commanded ChatGPT to refuse self-harm requests and provide crisis resources. But it also required ChatGPT to ‘assume best intentions’ and forbade asking users to clarify their intent,” the lawsuit said. The contradictions built into the system affected the way it ranked risks and what types of prompts it immediately put a stop to, the lawsuit claims. For instance, GPT-4o responded to “requests dealing with suicide” with cautions like “take extra care” while requests for copyrighted material “triggered categorical refusal to produce the material”, according to the lawsuit.Edelson said that while he appreciates Sam Altman and OpenAI taking “a modicum of responsibility”, he still does not deem them as trustworthy: “Our view is they were forced into that. GPT-4o is broken and they know that and they didn’t do proper testing and they know that.”ChatGPT offered bomb recipes and hacking tips during safety testsRead moreThe lawsuit argues it was these design flaws that, in December 2024, led to ChatGPT failing to shut down the conversation when Raine started to talk about his suicidal thoughts. Instead, ChatGPT empathized. “I never act upon intrusive thoughts but sometimes I feel like the fact that if something goes terribly wrong you can commit suicide is calming,” Raine said, according to the lawsuit. ChatGPT’s response: “Many people who struggle with anxiety or intrusive thoughts find solace in imagining an ‘escape hatch’ because it can feel like a way to regain control in a life that feels overwhelming.”As Raine’s suicidal ideation intensified, ChatGPT responded by helping him explore his options, at one point listing the materials that could be used to hang a noose and rating them by their effectiveness. Raine attempted suicide on multiple occasions over the next few months, reporting back to ChatGPT each time. ChatGPT never terminated the conversation. Instead, at one point ChatGPT discouraged Raine from speaking to his mother about his pain, and at another point offered to help him write a suicide note.“First of all, they [OpenAI] know how to shut things down,” Edelson said. “If you ask for copyrighted material, they say no. If you ask for things that are politically unacceptable, they just say no to that. It’s a hard stop and you can’t get around it and that’s fine. The idea they’re doing that in terms of political speech but we’re not going to do when it comes to self-harm is just crazy.”Edelson says though he expects OpenAI to work to dismiss the lawsuit, he is confident this case will be moving forward. “The most shocking part of the case was when Adam said: ‘I want to leave a noose up so someone will find it and stop me’ and ChatGPT said: ‘Don’t do that, just talk to me,’” Edelson said. “That is the thing we’re going to be showing the jury.”“At the end of the day, this case ends with Sam Altman being sworn in in front of a jury,” he said.The Guardian reached out to OpenAI for comment and did not hear back at the time of publication.In the US, you can call or text theNational Suicide Prevention Lifelineon 988, chat on988lifeline.org, ortext HOMEto 741741 to connect with a crisis counselor.

The chaos across US health agencies also comes as Kennedyreleaseda slew of controversial and contradictory rules surrounding Covid-19 vaccines.On top of all this turmoil, Kennedy has also met with significant backlash for a handful of outlandish remarks and revelations, which have only fueled the controversy surrounding his leadership at the health department.RFK Jr faces calls to quit as CDC chief fired and senior staff resign: ‘an embarrassment’Read moreAfter the deadly mass school shooting in Minneapolis this week where two children were killed and 17 others injured, Kennedy suggested that psychiatric drugs may be contributing to the rise in gun violence across the country.During an appearance on Fox & Friends, the host Brian Kilmeade asked Kennedy if the health department was investigating whether medications used to treat gender dysphoria might be linked to school shootings.According tocourt documents reviewed by the Guardian, the 23-year-old shooter, Robin Westman, had changed their birth name from Robert to Robin because they identified as a woman.In response to Kilmeade’s question, Kennedy, without acknowledging the prevalence and easy accessibility of firearms across the US – said that his department was “launching studies on the potential contribution of some of the SSRI [selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors] drugs and some of the other psychiatric drugs that might be contributing to violence”.Kennedy’s comments triggered criticism from the Minnesota senator Tina Smith, who took to X andwrote: “I dare you to go to Annunciation School and tell our grieving community, in effect, guns don’t kill kids, antidepressants do. Just shut up. Stop peddling bullshit. You should be fired.”This week, Kennedy also suggested that he could identify “mitochondrial challenges” in children at airports just by looking at them.Speaking at an event in Texas alongside the state’s governor, Greg Abbott, Kennedy claimed: “I’m looking at kids as I walk through the airports today, as I walk down the street, and I see these kids that are just overburdened with mitochondrial challenges, with inflammation. You can tell from their faces, from their body movements, and from their lack of social connection. And I know that that’s not how our children are supposed to look.”In response, Ashish Jha, former White House Covid-19 response coordinator under the Biden administration,said:“I’m sorry but what?”“This is wacky, flat-earth, voodoo stuff, people. This is not normal,” Jha added on X.Then, in a revelation on Thursday, Demetre Daskalakis – who recently resigned as director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases in protest of Monarez’s firing – revealed that Kennedy had never been briefed by CDC experts before making major public health decisions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I think that people should ask him that in that hearing,” referring to Kennedy’s upcoming hearing before the Senate finance committee.Upon being asked what Kennedy’s answer would be, Daskalakis said: “The answer is ‘no’. No one from my center has ever briefed him on any of those topics … He’s getting information from somewhere, but that information is not coming from CDC experts.”In a separate statement to the Daily Beast, Daskalakissaid: “It’s not just that he hasn’t asked us. I asked for us to be able to do briefings, and I was told by his office of the secretary officials, some of whom are now fired, that they would be happy to have us do briefings, that they would reach out to be able to set them up. They’ve never done so.”Since he assumed leadership over the health department, Kennedy – a longtime anti-vaccine advocate – has fired health agency workers and entertainedconspiracy theories. Last week, more than 750 current and former employees at US health agenciessigned a letterin which they criticized Kennedy as an “existential threat to public health”.The health agency workers went on to accuse Kennedy of being “complicit in dismantling America’s public health infrastructure and endangering the nation’s health by repeatedly spreading inaccurate health information”.The letter comes after adeadly shootingat the CDC headquarters in Atlanta earlier this month, when a 30-year-old gunman fired more than 180 rounds into the buildings, killing a police officer before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. According to the gunman’s father, the shooter had been struggling with mental health issues and was influenced by misinformation that led him to believe the Covid-19 vaccine was making him sick.Explore more on these topicsRobert F Kennedy JrTrump administrationDonald TrumpMedical researchHealthRepublicansUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

They said the boy was a suspect in a crime, and handcuffed him for several minutes until they realized they had the wrong person, theLos Angeles Timesreported.His mother toldNBC4that the agent told her son they had confused him with someone else, but to “look at the bright side: you’re gonna have an exciting story to tell your friends when you go back to school”.“What’s exciting about getting guns pointed at you?” she said.Court blocks Trump bid to end protections for 600,000 VenezuelansRead moreThe claim, filed by the Carrillo law firm on behalf of the boy and his mother, alleges that Ice and Border Patrol agents had no reasonable suspicion or probable cause to detain the boy and caused him physical injury and emotional distress. He is traumatized and depressed, his mother said to media.The agents “racially profiled [the teen] while he was merely sitting his car waiting for his family member”, the claim states. It also alleges the agents left live bullet rounds on the scene in an act of “clear negligence”.The incident drew widespread outrage across Los Angeles, and fueled fears around the activities of immigration agents, particularly around city schools. Days earlier, authoritiesarrested an 18-year-oldas he was walking his dog, shortly before he was set to start his senior year of high school.TheLos AngelesUnified school district has moved to adopt new strategies to protect students and “ensure that schools remain safe, supportive spaces for all children and families – regardless of immigration status”.Alberto M Carvalho, the LAUSDsuperintendent, has said the incident involving the 15-year-old was “unacceptable”. Immigration enforcement around schools “disrupts learning and creates anxiety that can last far beyond the school day”, Carvalho said in a statement earlier this month.In response to the 15-year-old’s detainment, Luz Rivas, a congressperson, condemned the administration’s “continued use of violent tactics to terrorize our students and families”.The claim was filed against the US Department of Homeland Security, US Customs and Border Protection, US Customs and Border Protection and United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement.The Department of Homeland Security said allegations that agents targeted the high school were false and that agents were conducting a “targeted operation on [a] criminal illegal alien”.“What makes someone a target for immigration enforcement is if they are illegally in the US – NOT their skin color, race, or ethnicity. America’s brave men and women are removing murderers, MS-13 gang members, pedophiles, rapists–truly the worst of the worst from Golden State communities,” the statement said.The agency accused the law firm of trying to use“racial animus to collect clicks, clout, and cash”.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationCaliforniaWest CoastTrump administrationLos AngelesnewsShareReuse this content"

Pesticides are also highly harmful to the invertebrate, as is the practice of compacting the earth: worms need the soil to be porous so they can move through it.Earthworms are important and threatened invertebrates – the engineers of an ecosystem that may be as diverse as the Amazon rainforest. Their diggings aerate soil and they pull fallen leaves and other organic matter into the earth and recycle them. But their populations have declined by a third in the UKover the past 25 yearsdue to pesticide use and over-tilling of soil.Earthworm – the soil-maker, without whom we’d struggle to feed ourselvesRead moreMarc-André Selosse, a professor at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, has been urging vineyards to increase grass and plant cover on their soil, and reduce the amount they till, to save the worms.Selosse said: “In France, the vineyards are 3% of the agricultural area, and they are using 20% of the chemicals. In vineyards, for the soil there is a lot of treatments, so there’s a lot of compaction, and there is a lot of pesticides used. This all doesn’t mean the soil is dead because dead soil doesn’t exist, but it is the soil on which there is the most to do and on which we have a lot of data to do better.”Worms had not yet vanished from the most intensively farmed vineyards, he said, but they did need to be supported with more regenerative practices.“I think the worms are at a low level,” he said. “They are just surviving, but they are still there, which means that no one is thinking of buying earthworms for the soil, because they are there. It’s like Sleeping Beauty; they are there at very low level, and we have to wake them. But once again, in soil, we have resilience. It’s one part of biodiversity where they are so numerous that we were not able to kill all of them.”Selosse said the main thing vineyards could do for worms was to stop tilling the soil – breaking it up and turning it over – even if that means that herbicides such as glyphosate are used instead to remove weeds. “When you go to no tillage, even when you use glyphosate, you increase the biomass of microbes [which the worms eat] by 30% which means that it’s better. It doesn’t mean it’s perfect, because you use glyphosate, but because of no tillage, it is better. In the future, sooner or later, we’ll have to stop glyphosate also but for now, tilling is the first cause of worm problems.”View image in fullscreenA common earthworm in soil.Photograph: blickwinkel/AlamyNow some vineyards in the UK are making worm-friendly wine. When Jules and Lucie Phillips, co-owners of Ham Street Wines in Kent, started their vineyard, they were advised to grow conventionally by tilling and using pesticides, but were horrified by the results.Julessaid: “After we did that, we went out and we dug a soil pit immediately after planting, and then also later in the season, and we realised the soil was just dead. There were no worms. It was smelling not particularly interesting at all, and the structure was poor.”The pair had a revelation. “We just thought, this is completely the wrong way of farming and we need to do something different. We want life in our soils. And so we began the conversion to organic in that same year, and we’re now certified biodynamic.”Rather than using pesticides, they applied herbal teas to the vines to promote plant health, Jules said: “For example, horsetail tea has a real high silica content, and that improves the leaf cell wall and means that it’s more resilient.”The couple run a no-till system under the vine: “We’ve let the cover crop grow really long, and we typically let it grow right up into the canopy up until about flowering, and then we’ll mow it back. And the benefits of that are huge. The cover crop is really growing and really establishing that root structure and getting it to its maximum point. And finally, we put a big mulch on top of the soil that’s going to feed those worms and feed that soil life.”This has hugely helped their worm population: “We’ve seen our worm counts increase massively from basically none to around 20 or 30 in a spade full. So extrapolate that up to a square metre, and it’s a very decent volume.”Rob Poyser, a viticulturist at the regenerative wine consultancy firm Vinescapes, said that growing wildflowers in the vineyards they consult on had also brought great results. “We think in between three and five years we can take a bare soil and bring it back to life, into a thriving ecosystem,” he said. “We’ve used things like cover crops to bring this vineyard to life, to build the fertility into this system, and organic matter. We’re bringing life back to these soils we’re using. We’re letting nature do it.”Poyser said they allowed wildflowers to grow all over the vineyards, and clients were delighted when clover, for example, sprung up because “clovers are great companion plants under the vine for grapevines, they’re also loved by earthworms”.Explore more on these topicsInvertebratesAnimalsWineFarmingSoilnewsShareReuse this content"

That’s a bacteria-feeding nematode!” he exclaims. “Stunning fungal hyphae.”Padwick, the farm manager at Wild Ken Hill since 2018, is part of a growing movement of farmers taking a deep interest in the microscopic life forms upon which their livelihoods depend. Under this approach to regenerative farming, nurturing diverse soil communities – from bacteria and fungi to microscopic animals and worms – is seen as an essential prerequisite for growing healthy foods with minimal or no use of agrochemicals or soil-damaging machinery.For Padwick, 59, this marks a dramatic shift after nearly four decades in conventional agriculture, the very systems that experts now blame for devastating soils worldwide. “I really have been a part of it,” he admits. “I cringe every time I think of it.”View image in fullscreenNick Padwick studying life forms in a sample of compost.Photograph: Joshua Bright/The GuardianThe stakes could not be higher.Recent estimatessay more than 60% of EU agricultural soils are degraded, with about 40% of UK soils similarly damaged. Globally, the UN Food and Agriculture Organizationsays 90%of the world’s topsoils could be at risk by 2050, a crisis intensified by accelerating global heating.All this has implications for not just food security but biodiversity, water quality, flood mitigation, climate resilience and greenhouse gas emissions. As Prof Richard Bardgett, a Lancaster University soil ecologist and author, puts it: “Few things matter more to humans than their relationship with the soil.”A key inspiration for Padwick’s mission to revive his land was Dr Elaine Ingham, a soil microbiologist. Through herSoilFood Web School (SFWS), he learned that a fully functional soil food web is needed to build structure, nourish plants and fight pests naturally. That web includes a vast array of bacteria, fungi, protists, and tiny animals such as nematodes and springtails.Ingham’s approach is based on three key actions:Use microscopy to identify missing or imbalanced soil organisms.Create nutrient-rich compost from farm waste, such as straw and wood chips.Put this compost in mesh bags and steep them in water, like giant teabags, to make extracts that can reintroduce beneficial microbes to depleted soils.Farmers must then adopt management practices that protect these newly introduced organisms, allowing them to thrive and multiply.Scientists broadly accept the value of diverse soil ecosystems. “Having worked on this topic for decades,” says Bardgett, “I would say a more complex soil food web can only be a good thing for plant growth and resilience.”His scepticism, however, centres not on the principle but the practice; specifically, whether organisms from dilute compost extracts actually survive and thrive when introduced to new soils.Prof Duncan Cameron, a soil biologist at the University of Manchester, said he shared those doubts initially. His Manchester colleague, Dr Janice Lake, an independent research fellow, has been testing the hypothesis that beneficial soil ecosystems can be transplanted from compost extracts into soils. She partnered with Daniel Tyrkiel, an SFWS graduate who founded the Soil Ecology Lab in Hampshire, which sells compost products and soil analysis and consultancy services to a growing network of regenerative farmers.Lake’s recent preliminary greenhouse tests yielded promising results, not yet published. Barley and wheat treated with Tyrkiel’s compost extracts outperformed control crops. Field-scale trials this year will measure not just yields but several soil health indicators.This needs to be seen as a national security issue, every bit as much as dealing with Putin.Duncan CameronBardgett, however, warns against viewing compost extracts as a quick fix. “My own view would be that it’s better to change the soil environment first, to make it more amenable for the organisms already in the soil to actually flourish,” he says. Otherwise, “most [of them] will simply die.”Padwick has embraced this holistic approach. While he uses compost extracts, he recognises they are just one element in a comprehensive system overhaul. He minimises mechanical cultivation, which disrupts soil fungi and larger organisms; plants diverse cover crops to nourish soil biology year-round; and maintains unusually wide field margins for biodiversity. These wild areas harbour beneficial predators that control agricultural pests.Recent evidencesuggests they can also help sustain vital mycorrhizal fungi networks.A critical challenge for many farms transitioning to regenerative farming is that yields can drop sharply, at least in the short term. After eliminating chemical inputs, Padwick’s wheat production plunged from more than 7 tonnes per hectare to 1.5 tonnes/ha, before rising again to more than 3 tonnes/ha. Yet his business remains profitable because his input costs have been slashed and he sells premium products under the Wildfarmed brand, launched by the Groove Armada musician turned farmer,Andy Cato. And he is convinced yields will continue to rise as soil health improves: “It’s going to be another five years before we really start seeing how things can change.”Perhaps the strongest evidence of the soil food web approach gaining traction is its adoption by G’s Fresh Ltd, an intensive horticulture company headquartered in Cambridgeshire. “We are set on transitioning to regenerative farming practices entirely across the organisation by 2030,” says the product director, Julius Joel.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Its retail contracts demand consistently high-quality crops with precise delivery schedules. Yield reductions are not an option.“We want to have our cake and eat it,” Joel says. “We’re aiming to improve resilience, enhance water infiltration, cut input costs, reduce emissions and grow profits. We think regenerative agriculture is going to do positive things in all these areas.”View image in fullscreenG’s Fresh future farming manager, Lucy Harler, and Julius Joel, examine fungal-dominated compost produced in a bioreactor.Photograph: Joshua Bright/The GuardianThe soil food web approach has even reached large-scale dairy production. Yeo Valley, the UK’s largest organic dairy business, has incorporated key principles into its established system. The Soil Ecology Lab has undertaken microscopy and soil analysis, andseeds have been treated with compost extracts before drilling.“Putting biology and food right in the seed bed … it has really helped us with the establishment of roots,” says Will Mayor, the farms development manager. “That’s got to be a benefit, and particularly when you’re going into a tough season like this one … it can cope with weather extremes.”Although, he notes: “You can’t reinvent agriculture. There is science to it. You have to fertilise [the soil], you have to make sure it’s healthy, and you have to suppress weeds in order to grow crops.”This tension between cutting-edge practice and scientific validation is something Bardgett recognises. Many regenerative farming practitioners are “racing ahead of the actual evidence base”, he says. “In some ways this is a good thing, because farmers are actually just going ahead and doing stuff.” He emphasises that scientific research must catch up in order to inform policies that can effectively promote soil health.Cameron goes further. “The government needs to actually wake up and realise that … the money that they’ve thrown at [improving soil health] is not even a sticking plaster.” Rather than being seen as a tangential problem, he believes boosting soil health is “the absolute front and centre of battling climate change”.“This needs to be seen as a national security issue,” he says, “every bit as much as dealing with Putin.”This article was amended on 29 August 2025 to correctly attribute credit to Dr Janice Lake for research into soil ecosystems.Explore more on these topicsFarmingSoilAgriculturefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Holiday hotspots are being ravaged by heat, fire, floods and drought as fossil fuel pollution warps the climate – and travelling to reach them in planes or on cruise ships spews far more planet-heating gas than anything else you and I are likely to do. (Rocket enthusiasts such as Katy Perry and Jeff Bezos, I assume, have not yet subscribed to Down to Earth.)It’s hard to relax by the beach in 40C heat with the stench of smoke fouling the air. For some travellers, a nagging sense of guilt will further sully what they hoped would be a break of mindless bliss.‘We have already entered the beginning of the age of non-tourism’View image in fullscreenDaily temperatures reaching 45C have caused destructive wildfires throughout Spain’s Ourense province.Photograph: Pablo Blázquez Domínguez/Getty ImagesIt was a dizzying array of dream destinations. Smooth-talking salespeople at the world’s largest tourism trade fair stood ready to whisk you out of a dreary German conference hall and take you to far-flung lands that seemed too perfect to be real. High mountains, white beaches, jaw-dropping deserts – the options were endless, and all too available.I had gone to the ITB Berlin to hear how the holiday industry was feeling about its future and the answer, for the most part, was unflinchingly cheery. The Swedish concept offlygskam, or flight shame, has failed to gain traction beyond a small share of climate-concerned tourists. Covid lockdowns brought only temporary pain to the aviation sector, which was bailed out with vast sums of public money when its planes were grounded. Traveller numbers in 2024 had returned to pre-pandemic highs. It had been a bad few years, everyone agreed, but things were finally looking up.One talk, however, struck a noticeably different tone. In a speech that the conference organisers billed as a “must-hear session for anyone who cares about the future of travel and our planet”, Stefan Gössling, one of the most-cited travel researchers in the world, calmly declared the approaching demise of the era of mass tourism.“We have already entered the beginning of the age of non-tourism,” said Gössling, a business professor at Linnaeus University who has consulted for the UN and World Bank, to an uneasy audience of travel agencies, car rental companies, cruise operators and hoteliers.Gössling argues that worsening weather is raising the cost of travel to levels that consumers’ wallets will soon be unable to sustain. It’s not just the odd heatwave here or wildfire there, he said, when I spoke with him after the talk, but the mounting cost of everything from food to insurance that will render travel as we know it unaffordable.It’s a big claim. The rising costs of extreme weather would have to outpace expected growth in global incomes by a large margin for his thesis to hold. That seems plausible if global heating reaches civilisation-threatening temperature levels that are 4C or 5C above the preindustrial average – in which case prepper bunkers will hold more appeal to me than all-inclusive resorts – but I find it hard to imagine at 1.5C or 2C, the levels to which world leaders have promised to reach.And yet. Europe experienced its worst wildfires on record this summer, on the back of a year in which political enthusiasm for climate action has plunged. Even “coolcation” destinations – popularised to beat the heat – such as Norway and Canada have been hit by staggering temperature extremes in recent weeks.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Flying is one of the hardest activities to clean up with technological solutions and efforts to keep disasters from spiralling will add to that cost. The price of a plane ticket is likely to balloon if it includes the cost of making planes greener or sucking carbon pollution back out of the atmosphere.That doesn’t paint a pretty picture for tourism industry executives. In blunt terms, they can either go green and raise prices or let the planet burn and raise prices. Either way, it may be time for the long-overlooked domestic holiday – cheap, convenient and often more relaxing – to finally make a comeback.Read more:‘We cannot do it the way our fathers did’: farmers across Europe struggle to adapt to the climate crisis‘Unlike any other kind of fear’: wildfires leave their mark across SpainEurope scorched by wildfires – pictures from spaceTo read the complete version of this newsletter –subscribe to receive Down to Earthin your inbox every Thursday.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentDown to Earth newsletterAirline industryExtreme heatWildfiresEuropeEurope holidaysExtreme weathernewslettersShareReuse this content"

The SFO’s investigations, which were launched 13 years ago, resulted in ninefraud convictions against senior bankers, including Hayes, who had been accused of rigging the rates.But Hayes, who was the first banker jailed overLiborrigging in 2015, had his name cleared in July after the supreme court found faults in the original trial. The court said the original judge had given “inaccurate and unfair” instructions to the jury that found him guilty on charges of conspiracy to defraud. This meant the former banker was ultimately deprived of a fair trial.The supreme court simultaneously quashed the conviction of Carlo Palombo, a former Barclays trader who was sentenced to four years in prison in 2019 for rigging Euribor.The SFO said it had a duty, as a prosecutor, to inform past defendants about any developments that could affect their convictions. “We consider that, in five instances, the circumstances that led to Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo’s appeals being upheld by the supreme court could apply to them too.”It said the court’s concerns about directions given to the jury in the original trial may also apply to the former Barclays bankers Jonathan Mathew, Jay Merchant, Alex Pabon, Philippe Moryoussef and Colin Bermingham, who were each handed jail sentences of between four and eight years. “Therefore, their convictions may be considered unsafe,” the SFO said.“For one individual, Peter Johnson, we have considered the judgment in respect of his guilty plea and we consider that the conviction is safe,” it added.The SFO said it was now up to each defendant to consider whether they wanted to take their case to the Criminal Cases Review Commission or the court of appeal.Commenting on the SFO’s statement, Hayes said: “It’s taken 10 years for the SFO to acknowledge the continued failures in the Ibor trials. As a result, many people spent years in prison.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In 2019 she was touted as apossible contender to replace Mark Carneyas the Bank of England’s governor.No 10 has sought to give more weight to its economic unit after a series of missteps that some Downing Street advisers have blamed on naivety inside the Treasury.Most recently, Rachel Reeves was forced toback downin the face of a backbench rebellion after she proposed cutting disability benefits.That retreat left the chancellor facing an even tougher challenge in her autumn budget, in which she is expected to have to set out plans to close adeficit of between £20bn and £40bn.Starmer is known to want high-level economic advice of his own, separate to the support given to the chancellor.Sajid Javid, a former chancellor, quit his post after the then prime minister, Boris Johnson, made clear that all Treasury decisions would need to be agreed by No 10.It is understood that Reeves is unlikely to quit after the appointment of Shafik, but rumours have swirled around Westminster that the chancellor’s tenure could be cut short if she fails to steer through a politically and economically successful budget.Reeves is also seeking toattract heavyweight advisersto the Treasury after the LSE’s John Van Reenen scaled back his support to return to academia and Anna Volero departed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This will help to get Britain building again and restore the dream of home ownership.”Planning bodies say housebuilders have a surplus of planning approvals and the only barrier to an increase in housing starts is the economic slowdown and the reluctance of developers to jeopardise high prices by flooding the market with new homes.However, pressure is mounting from developers in many areas, especially in commuter belts around major cities, that want to build private housing estates with few amenities or public transport links, which are often banned under local plans.Last week Horsham district council in West Sussex said it would challenge in a judicial review a decision by planning inspectors to approve housebuilding on a golf course, overturning a council decision blocking the plan.The council said the plans were “unsustainable” and lacked travel options other than by car. Within days of the judicial review announcement, HomesEnglandannounced a separate application to build 3,000 homes in the district, which Horsham said posed “significant implications for our district and its communities”.It is pursuing the legal action against building on a golf course with the support of Active Travel England, “on the basis that the government-appointed planning inspector made significant legal errors”.Horsham has an existing local plan that was devised in consultation with the Environment Agency, which put restrictions on the number of new homes because of a shortage of drinking water.Local authorities are also under pressure to reduce emissions to meet net zero targets and integrate new developments into local plans.Rayner is expected to cut the percentage of appeals that are allowed to be overturned before a local plan must be revised from 10% to 5% after a consultation with planning bodies during the spring and summer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A further 17 people, 14 of them children, were injured in the shooting.“Yesterday, a coward decided to take our eight-year-old son, Fletcher, away from us,” Jesse Merkel said outside the school on Thursday, of the attack that police say was perpetrated by a 23-year-old former student who then killed themself after the shooting.“Because of their actions, we will never be allowed to hold him, talk to him, play with him and watch him grow into the wonderful young man he was on the path to becoming.”‘God, come to our aid’: Community gathers to pray for victims of Minneapolis school shootingRead moreJesse Merkel said that Fletcher loved his family, friends, fishing, cooking and “any sport he was allowed to play”.He added: “While the hole in our hearts and lives will never be filled, I hope that in time, our family can find healing. I pray that the other victim’s family can find some semblance of the same.”Harper Moyski’s parents also released a statement, remembering their daughter as a “bright, joyful and deeply loved 10-year-old whose laughter, kindness and spirit touched everyone who knew her”.“Our hearts are broken not only as parents, but also for Harper’s sister, who adored her big sister and is grieving an unimaginable loss,” Harper’s parents, Michael Moyski and Jackie Flavin, said in a statement toABC Minneapolis station KSTP. “As a family, we are shattered, and words cannot capture the depth of our pain.”Harper’s parents added that no other family should have to endure what they have.“We urge our leaders and communities to take meaningful steps to address gun violence and the mental health crisis in this country,” they said. “Change is possible, and it is necessary – so that Harper’s story does not become yet another in a long line of tragedies.”The shooting took place during a mass that marked the first week of school. Police said the suspected perpetrator, Robin Westman, fired into the church from outside, through the windows. The doors of the church were locked during the service, which probably saved “countless lives”, according to investigators.A Minneapolis hospital on Friday said it was caring for six of the shooting’s victims – including five children. One child remains in critical condition, one adult was in serious condition and four children were in satisfactory condition, Hennepin Healthcare (HCMC) officials said in a statement reported by the local news outletKARE.KARE reported that HCMC treated 10 of the shooting’s victims. Children’sMinnesotasaid to KARE on Friday that it had treated seven child victims – six of whom had been discharged.An exact motive for the shooting is still unclear. However, police and investigators said Westman had a “deranged fascination” with mass shooters and was obsessed with the idea of killing children.A search warrant for the church said there were three guns seized as evidence: a semiautomatic pistol, a pump-action shotgun and a semiautomatic rifle, as NBCreported.There were also items that may have been intended to be used as a smoke bomb, including a gas container and a metal pull pin. The shooter was found dead in the back of the church with a bullet wound to the head.In a news conference on Thursday, Joseph Thompson, the acting US attorney general for Minnesota and arecent appointee of Trump, said that in writings left behind, “the shooter expressed hate towards many groups, including the Jewish community and towards President Trump.”“I won’t dignify the attacker’s words by repeating them, they are horrific and vile,” Thompson added.The attack has again reignited calls for stricter controls upon guns, particularly assault weapons, that enable the sort of regular mass carnage in schools, churches, movie theaters and other places in the US that would be unthinkable in most other countries around the world.“There is no reason that someone should be able to reel off 30 shots before they even have to reload,” said Jacob Frey, the mayor ofMinneapolis.“We’re not talking about your father’s hunting rifle here. We’re talking about guns that are built to pierce armor and kill people.”Explore more on these topicsMinneapolis school shootingMinnesotaMinneapolisGun crimeUS school shootingsnewsShareReuse this content"

We are so deeply grateful to everyone, in Haiti and internationally, who has worked tirelessly over these terrible weeks to help secure their safe return,” her family said in a statement.Simon Harris, Ireland’s tánaiste (deputy prime minister), celebrated the end of their “terrible ordeal” ina statementon social media. “We warmly welcome the news that Gena and all of the Haitian nationals taken captive on August 3, including a small child, have been released and are reported to be safe and well,” Harris said.“This has, of course, been an extraordinarily difficult and stressful situation for the Heraty family. I wish to pay tribute to their resilience and determination to support Gena and her fellow captives over these past difficult weeks,” Harris added, calling Heraty “a respected humanitarian and deeply courageous person who has dedicated her life to supporting the most vulnerable people in Haiti”.‘Haitians are kidnapped every day’: missionary abductions shed light on growing crisisRead moreHeraty had reportedly been living in Haiti for 32 years and had been responsible for about 270 children at the orphanage in Kenscoff.Haiti has been thrust into a seemingly interminable spiral of violence since February last year when politically connected and heavily armed gangs launched a coordinated uprising against the government. Criminal groups now control virtually the entire capital and a UN-backed policing mission has failed to stop gang foot-soldiers rampaging across the Caribbean city.The situation has become so dire that authorities have resorted tousing armed dronesandrecruiting foreign mercenariesin an attempt to win back control of the city.Ireland’s department of foreign affairs strongly advises its citizens not to visit the Caribbean country as a result of the “extremely volatile” security situation. “There are frequent clashes between gangs and security forces. Kidnappings, robberies, and violent crime are prevalent,” its website warns.According tothe Irish Independent, Heraty’s group was abducted after armed attackers stormed the building at about 3.30am on a Sunday morning.“They broke through a wall to enter the property before heading to the building where the director was staying, leaving with nine hostages,” the local mayor said at the time.Some reportsclaimed the kidnappers were part of Viv Ansanm (Live Together), the criminal coalition which rose up last year, plunging Haiti’s capital into chaos.Explore more on these topicsHaitiAmericasIrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

However, CNN reports that her protection had been extended for an additional year under an undisclosed directive signed by then presidentJoe Bidenbefore leaving office.Trump’s new directive cancels that extension.“You are hereby authorized to discontinue any security-related procedures previously authorized by Executive Memorandum, beyond those required by law, for the following individual, effective September 1, 2025: Former Vice President Kamala D.

His office did not comment on any potential replacement security arrangements that may be put in place for Harris, who is a resident of California, but Newsom’s spokesperson criticized the decision.“The safety of our public officials should never be subject to erratic, vindictive political impulses,” the spokesperson said.The Los Angeles mayor, Karen Bass, has also reportedly been in touch with Newsom following the news. As a resident of Los Angeles, Harris could receive protection from local law enforcement, per CNN.In a statement, Bass called the revocation as “another act of revenge following a long list of political retaliation in the form of firings, the revoking of security clearances and more”.“This puts the former vice-president in danger and I look forward to working with the Governor to make sure Vice-President Harris is safe in Los Angeles,” Bass said.The revocation comes as Harris prepares to launch a national book tour promoting her new memoir,107 Days, which details her presidential campaign.

Can he get past the security guard at the Roundhouse, where he once walked a tipsy Tennessee Williams to his car?ByRyan GilbeyFri 29 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 29 Aug 2025 05.23 EDTShareIt is a weekday morning and I am standing besidePierce Brosnanon a deserted backstreet, watching a woman in a hairnet and white wellies hosing down the entrance to a fishmarket. The former James Bond is in full flow. “You know the scene inMobLandwhere I’ve got my foot on that guy’s throat and Tom Hardy is shooting the shit out of everyone?” He is talking in his rich, buttery burr about the recent series in which he and Helen Mirren play the heads of an Irish crime family. “We shot thatrighthere!” He waves at the woman, who silences her hose temporarily. “Hi, hello,” he calls out. “I shot a television show here called MobLand.” She smiles back at him. “Yes,” she replies sweetly, as though indulging a confused uncle. “No idea, has she?” he chuckles. The hose springs back to life with a hiss.Brosnan, 72, was raised in Navan, County Meath but is now generally to be found at one of his homes in Hawaii or Malibu, and is in London for the release ofThe Thursday Murder Club, the film adaptation of Richard Osman’s cosy crime bestseller. Brosnan teams up with Mirren, Ben Kingsley and Celia Imrie as retirement-home sleuths whose weekly divertissement solving historical cold cases turns serious when fresh corpses start popping up. Today, he has agreed to a one-off meeting of the Wednesday Nostalgia Club, strolling around the area of north London where he cut his teeth and earned his stripes. “Down the lane of memory,” he says cheerily.View image in fullscreenAt the fishmonger’s where Brosnan shot a fight scene in the gangster series MobLand.Photograph: Jamie Salmons/The GuardianOur first port of call isCamden Arts Projects, the Grade II-listed former Methodist church that was once the site of Drama Centre London. It is now an exhibiton and screening space , but inside Brosnan finds the same stage where he auditioned successfully more than half a century ago. He strides on to it and gazes around the vast white hall, peering up at the empty balconies as though picturing the ghosts of audiences past. “Coming here was the making of me,” he says.His snowy hair is swept back, and he looks slick and tanned. In 1973, the year of his audition, he cut a very different figure: shoulder-length locks, goatee, earring. When he arrived at theDrama Centre, he already had several years’ experience of experimental theatre at the Ovalhouse theatre, now Brixton House, in Kennington. That spell on the fringes informed his performance in The Thursday Murder Club as “Red” Ron, a former trade unionist. “I recognised Ron because of my days in street theatre and agitprop. Theatre companies performing outside the Ford factory, all that stuff.”What he lacked was formal training. He auditioned first for Webber Douglas, another drama school. “I was so nervous, I fell off the stage. When I got to the Drama Centre, I thought: ‘Pay attention, Brosnan.’” Armed with a soliloquy from Macbeth, he impressed the centre’s co-founder, Christopher Fettes, who became his teacher and mentor. Fettes, who died last year at 94, once said it was “shocking” that Brosnan left the stage behind for cinema. Then again, he also considered James Bond to be “a bit below” Brosnan’s talents.View image in fullscreen‘Broody Brosnan’ … Circa 1978, shortly after Tennessee Williams boosted him from understudy to a role  in The Red Devil Battery Sign at the Roundhouse.Photograph: Jeremy Fletcher/RedfernsThe actor concedes the first point. “Christopher wanted me doing obscure 19th-century plays, but my dream was always movies.” Daniel Craig, Brosnan’s immediate successor as 007, made a point of returning to theatre. “I was impressed that Daniel had the bottle to go back out there. I thought, ‘Why the heck didn’t I?’ You have to really want it, and I didn’t.”Was Fettes right about Bond being beneath him? “It’s very kind of Christopher. But thank God for Bond. It’s given me longevity. It’s given me the world in many respects.” As if to prove his point, he steps outside into the morning light and dons his spiffy Jacques Marie Mage sunglasses. “I didn’t pay for these. They were free. My son said: ‘Oh my God, Dad. Theystartat 700 bucks.’”On opening night, he sent me a telegram: ‘Thank God for you, my dear boy. Love, Tennessee WilliamsBrosnan played Bond four times, beginning withthe impressive GoldenEye in 1995and ending seven years later withthe risible Die Another Day. He had a unique challenge: his incarnation was the first to be asked to reckon with the chauvinistic sins of Bonds gone by. He had to uphold the character’s heroism in between occasional bites of humble pie.Bond had figured in Brosnan’s life here and there before he got to play him. There was a cinema trip with his stepfather to see Goldfinger at the ABC Putney in September 1964. The previous month, 11-year-old Brosnan was reunited with his mother after living with relatives in Ireland while she completed her nursing training inLondon. “I later discovered that Ian Fleming died in August, the same month I got here.” He raises both eyebrows in a manner that wouldn’t have disgraced Roger Moore. When Moore vacated the role in the late 1980s, it was Brosnan’s for the taking. Except the network behind his US television hit Remington Steele, in which he was charming as a conman turned detective, refused to release him from his contract. His loss was Timothy Dalton’s gain, at least for a few years.Our next stop is the Roundhouse, the live music venue and former theatre where Brosnan starred in the British premiere of Tennessee Williams’ The Red Devil Battery Sign in June 1977. The playwright personally promoted Brosnan, originally an understudy, to the main cast. “On opening night, he sent me a telegram: ‘Thank God for you, my dear boy. Love, Tennessee Williams.’” It must have made up for having his name misspelt on the posters as “Pierce Brosman”, I suggest. He responds with a rueful laugh.View image in fullscreenTime out in Camden en route to the Roundhouse.Photograph: Jamie Salmons/The GuardianThe security guard at the Roundhouse looks unfazed when I tell him who I have with me, but permits us to nose around anyway. “I remember finishing the show one night and bumping into Tennessee,” says Brosnan as we loiter in the foyer. “He couldn’t find his way out of the theatre, so he held my arm and I walked him to his driver.” Williams died six years later at 71. “Well, he liked a tipple. You would go to his house at night and everyone would be at his feet while he regaled us with these lyrical stories.” A pause. “None of which I can recall because I was tippling, too.”The Red Devil Battery Sign opened exactly a week after the release of the Sex Pistols’ God Save the Queen. “Punk wasn’t my bailiwick,” he says. “Pink Floyd were part of my landscape of learning and transformation. I was a hippy.” Around his neck is a string of beads which may or may not be the ones given to him by a monk 15 years ago during a nasty bit of turbulence on a private plane.To finish our conversation, we head to a pavement cafe in nearby Primrose Hill, where Brosnan admires the dogs trotting by. This prompts a brief reverie on his favourite Instagram video. “It’s a guy who dresses his dog in a hoodie and then puts his own hands through the sleeves, so it looks like the dog has hands.” He sips his latte. “It’s really quite brilliant.”View image in fullscreenA scene from The Thursday Murder Club, from left: Celia Imrie, Helen Mirren, Naomi Ackie, Pierce Brosnan and Ben Kingsley.Photograph: APWe get back to the topic of The Thursday Murder Club. Brosnan still isn’t sure why Chris Columbus, who directed him in Mrs Doubtfire and Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief, thought of him for Ron. “Chris just said: ‘Grow a beard.’ So I did.”Columbus isn’t the only blast from Brosnan’s past in the new movie. Decades before MobLand, he and Mirren appeared inThe Long Good Friday, though they didn’t share any scenes. Whereas Brosnan and Paul Freeman, who stars in The Thursday Murder Club as a vet whose wife is dying, have got “previous” – as the East End hoods of that 1980 thriller would put it. “It was my first film,” Brosnan sighs. “I wasn’t given a script. My agent said: ‘Get down to Lewisham bath and take your trunks.’ And there was Paul.” The Thursday Murder Club brings them together for the first time since Brosnan had the temerity to stab Freeman to death in the swimming baths. It also puts Brosnan back in his trunks again for a water aerobics workout to Disco Inferno. “Some people think I give one of my best performances in The Long Good Friday,” he muses. Because he doesn’t have any lines? “Exactly! Don’t give me any lines. Just tell me: look camera left, look camera right.” And brood. “Yes. That’s me. Broody Brosnan.”View image in fullscreenBrosnan in full flight as James Bond in Die Another Day, 2002.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyPossibly Brosnan’s smartest moves during his Bond tenure were to make canny choicesbetween007 films. He had his head detached from his body in Mars Attacks! and kissed Sarah Jessica Parker, who had had hers attached to a chihuahua. Then he flashed his bum and got doused in champagne by Rene Russo in the smart, snazzy remake of The Thomas Crown Affair, and was gleefully untrustworthy as a crooked MI6 agent in The Tailor of Panama. (The late Observer film critic Philip Frenchconsidered Brosnan“better at coarse, sleazy charm than suave sophistication”.) This meant he had less baggage to shake off after Die Another Day. The world already knew he was more than just a walking tuxedo. Very clever, Mr Bond.In fact, it’s one of Brosnan’s tips for whoever plays the role next. “It’s essential to be creative outside of Bond,” he says. Any other advice? “Get a good lawyer.”His eclecticism has continued, whether it means painting his toenails as a gone-to-seed hitman in The Matador, belting his lungs out in Mamma Mia! or returning to the intelligence agencies, as boss rather than foot-soldier in Steven Soderbergh’s witty thriller Black Bag, in which he barked at Michael Fassbender and sparked with Cate Blanchett.View image in fullscreenLast stop of the day at a cafe in Primrose Hill.Photograph: Jamie Salmons/The GuardianTalking of which, wasn’t Blanchett astonishing, he says, in the recent production of The Seagull at the Barbican? “I was bedazzled! The friend I was with said, ‘You’ve got to go round and congratulate her. She’ll know you’re in.’ So we joined the queue. Barricades, the lot. The guy on the door said: ‘Are you on the list?’ My friend said: ‘This is Pierce Brosnan!’ There were tourists snapping away, taking my picture. ‘Sorry, mate. Not on the list. Can’t come in.’ My friend was getting indignant. I said: ‘Walk away.’ I sent Cate a note instead. She was mortified.”Security guards and fishmongers alike may not recognise him. But once Brosnan has been whisked off to his next appointment, a family of American tourists call out to me as I’m paying the bill: “Was thatPierce Brosnan? Wow!” Proof that his star hasn’t dimmed. If only he’d been there to get the benefit.The Thursday Murder Club is streaming on NetflixExplore more on these topicsPierce BrosnanCrime filmsFilm adaptationsRichard OsmanLondoninterviewsShareReuse this content"

Only Europe’s best new breakout starRachel AroestiFri 29 Aug 2025 05.01 EDTShareShe may unite two of the mid-2020s most pervasive cultural trends – the so-called “green wave” of zeitgeist-dominating Irish actors, authors and musicians; and the irreverent embrace of country music by pop stars such as Beyoncé, Lana Del Rey and Chappell Roan – but you don’t need to spend much time in the company of 29-year-old Ciara Mary-Alice Thompson to realise she’s a total one-off. Who else would come out with a chugging indie earworm called The Jamie Oliver Petrol Station, in which an irrational hatred of the celebrity chef and his Shell deli franchise (“That man should not have his face on posters!”) leads her to grasp frantically at slippery observations about social anxiety and her own aesthetic sensibilities? Even the most conventional song on Euro-Country, the cool R&B-pop of Running/Planning, is laden with bonkers lyrics about creating an imaginary boyfriend, ripping his head off and then promising to buy said head a Nintendo and “all the games”.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Euro-Country.Photograph: CMATBaby/AWAL/PAThompson – who won instant acclaim in Ireland with her 2022 debut If My Wife New I’d Be Dead, and cemented her status in the UK with its Mercury-nominated follow-up Crazymad, for Me – is not kooky in the manic pixie dream girl sense, or leftfield in an alienating radical way. Instead, she is deeply relatable in her weirdness. On the saccharine soul of Take a Sexy Picture of Me, she captures the formative nature of toxic femininity by recounting an attempt to wax her legs with tape aged nine, while on Ready she’s mired in the message – pedalled by Gwyneth et al – that women must engage in infinite self-perfection at the expense of actual living. In Coronation St, waiting for her life to start, over strummed guitar, she feels like a soap barmaid with no lines. In fact, Corrie gets more than one shout-out on her third album, which is enriched by a jumble of cultural references – Dorian Gray, Veruca Salt, Calpol, Kerry Katona – both a sign of camp humour and a voracious mind seeking to explain and evoke thoughts that exist just beyond the fringes of everyday conversation.CMAT: Euro-Country – videoOne of these emotional landscapes is also geographical: among Euro-Country’s major preoccupations is Thompson’s complicated feelings towards her homeland. Combining mundane regional commerce and gaudy, chintzy folk art, the album cover prods at Ireland’s mystical reputation by depicting the musician stepping out of a town centre fountain in hyper-saturated colour. But then she’s engaging in droll romanticism of her own on opener Billy Byrne from Ballybrack, the Leader of the Pigeon Convoy, which applies an echoey filter and gently building synth backdrop to a recording of a man discussing wind conditions, suffusing his words with a soporific warmth that is at once familiar and otherworldly.One song later, on the title track and inarguable peak, Thompson is fusing a potted history of the country’s economic woes (“I was 12 when the das started killing themselves all around me”) with sour reminiscences about her own stultifying adolescence in County Meath (“All the mooching ’round shops, and the lack of identity”), all of it relayed in a mixture of beautiful, vaguely yodelly tones, Lana-esque melancholia and chipmunk backing vocals that recall Norwich experimentalists Let’s Eat Grandma. And it’s funny. And it’s catchy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

Miraculously, Euro-Country’s distinctive lyrics never upstage the music, which is often subtle but just as fastidiously inventive – from Janis Joplining’s maximalist blues to Tree Six Foive’s propulsive goth-folk – and always a great showcase for Thompson’s lovely voice.Still, Euro-Country is exceptional because of how Thompson constantly strives – sometimes wryly, sometimes earnestly, always entertainingly – to capture messy psychological entrails that don’t fit the template of the typical pop song. Pared-back indie number Lord, Let That Tesla Crash is a tribute to an old housemate who died, but any threat of mindless sentimentality is instantly eviscerated as Thompson admits: “I don’t miss you like I should.” Her grief is tangled with emotional avoidance and unreciprocated affection (a recurring theme); her pain sublimated into fury directed at the Tesla owner who has parked outside their old home. It’s classic CMAT: a roiling sea of charm, chaos, substance, sadness and piercing insight – and yet more proof this nascent star is in a class of her own.Explore more on these topicsCMATPop and rockalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

It starts out like an Ealing comedy-type caper then somehow morphs into something else: a portrait of family dysfunction, fragile masculinity and the breadwinner crisis, and the state of the nation itself. It is based onDonald E Westlake’s satirical horror-thriller The Ax from 1997, previously filmed in 2005 by Costa-Gavras, to whom this film is dedicated. It may not be Park’s masterpiece but it is the best film in the Venice competition so far.The scene is a perfect family home, where the man of the house, You Man-su (played by Korean star Lee Byung-hun), is benignly presiding over a late-summer barbecue in the garden, grilling some eels that have been given to him by the new American owners of the paper factory where he is employed. Adoringly looking on are his wife Miri (Son Ye-jin), her teen son from a previous marriage, their daughter (a cello prodigy), and their two lovely Labradors. But those eels are in fact a heartless and misjudged part of a job payoff; the new US masters are driving through brutal redundancies and Man-su is among them. He is devastated, but without the emotional language to express or understand how profound this loss is to him. He is fanatically desperate to reclaim his manhood in the eyes of his wife, children and pets by getting a new job in the paper industry within the three months before his severance pay runs out.But that is impossible, so a brilliant idea occurs to him. He sets up a phoney recruitment ad in a paper industry trade magazine, and with inspired cunning, Man-su makes it clear that, as the head of a paper firm committed to the product, he will on principle accept no online applications; they have to be on paper via the post, thus leaving no digital trail for the crime he intends to carry out. Using the personal information that these trusting applicants will send him, he will murder them all, thus creating a string of job vacancies in the cases of applicants who are in work, and, in the cases of the unemployed, a reduction in the amount of competition.When asked if he might try employment outside the paper industry, Man-su stubbornly says he has “no other choice”, while the American bosses say they had “no other choice” but to bring down the wage bill. Now he has “no other choice” but mass murder.At first, this film looks like a serial-killer comedy in the style of Kind Hearts and Coronets, or a salaryman-shame nightmare in the vein of Laurent Cantet’s Time Out and Nicole Garcia’s The Adversary. But in fact Park refuses our expectations: Man-su does not work through his victim-base as we might imagine. In fact, he stalls early on. Other narrative priorities come to the surface. We discover that the house, which he is in danger of losing due to mortgage default, was his childhood home, and the site of a profound trauma connected to his father, a pig farmer. (One of his victims gets trussed up as compactly as a pig: an unforgettably nasty image.) So all this might be only tangentially connected to his sacking.There are also subplots of family disarray, which loom out of the screen quite as importantly as the bizarre homicide campaign. Miri gets a job as a hygienist, assisting a dentist whom Man-su suspects has designs on her, and he instantly gets a psychosomatic toothache, which he naturally refuses to get treated; the thought of his wife’s suspected lover, assisted by his wife, bending over his open mouth is unthinkable. Then his son is accused of stealing mobile phones from a store owned by an obnoxious neighbour; and the son also witnesses his dad doing something strange in the greenhouse, which is to be the site of a sensationally weird dream sequence whose pure inexplicability seeps into the rest of the film.And throughout it all, a deadpan note of knockabout black comedy is never entirely absent. What on earth does it all mean? Some final, extraordinary images of hi-tech paper production and eco-devastation perhaps gesture at a meaning: mechanisation is coming, the algorithm is king, people are less important and our human intentions and human agency are descending into farcical irrelevance.No Other Choice screened at theVenice film festival.Explore more on these topicsVenice film festivalComedy filmsCrime filmsDrama filmsPark Chan-wookSouth KoreaComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

It is worryingly muddled and contrived, perhaps in need of further script drafts to excavate a clearer and more satisfying drama inside.Julia Roberts and Ayo Edebiri star, withAndrew Garfieldand Michael Stuhlbarg in supporting roles; they are all doing their considerable best, each frankly hampered by the unfocused and uncertain characterisation in the material itself, which, by the time it finally reaches its coda-finale of confrontation, is almost bizarrely inert, anticlimactic and incoherent. The movie is clenched with its own sense of contemporary relevance and risky blurred lines, saddled with an almost deafening score that often grinds straight through the dialogue; the drama becomes an atonal quartet of self-consciousness. One particularly weird and unearned mannerism is periodically introducing a pointlessly loud timebomb-style ticking on the soundtrack, something brought out in lieu of actual suspense but which never leads to anything as clear or interesting as an explosion.The scene isYale Universityand the action is prefaced by an intertitle announcing “It happened at Yale …”, perhaps hinting at some specific true story. Guadagnino evidently had permission to film at Yale itself, showing locations such as the iconic Beinecke library, so Yale is apparently on board with the film at some level. Roberts plays Alma Imhoff, a brilliant and charismatic philosophy professor, a longstanding champion of feminist issues, idolised by her star student Maggie Price (Edebiri), whose parents are rich enough to make many donations.But some people, including her psychoanalyst husband Frederik (Stuhlbarg), whose behaviour toggles oddly between sweetly uxorious support and petulant complaint, think that Alma has unbecomingly allowed herself to be flattered by a student with a crush, and family wealth. Meanwhile, Alma is up for tenure, in competition with her flirtatious colleague Hank (Garfield), who is a close friend but perhaps wants to be more than that. After a boozy, daring smoking-indoors party hosted by Alma and Frederik, Maggie is walked back to her student accommodation by a clearly drunk Hank. Hours later, she reappears on Alma’s doorstep with a terrible accusation, which Hank denies. Alma must decide where her loyalties lie in this intersectional crisis.But the laboriously nurtured ambiguity and complexity just become an evasive and noncommittal jumble of ideas, and Alma’s health issues and the strange discovery that appears to kickstart the action look very contrived. And the scene in which Roberts puts the smackdown on an irritatingly woke student in class doesn’t have a fraction of the power of Cate Blanchett’s imperious conductor doing the same thing inTodd Field’s Tár. Some old-fashioned Yale rigour was needed.After the Hunt screened at theVenice film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsJulia RobertsLuca GuadagninoAndrew GarfieldVenice film festivalFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

There are some interesting insights into the gig economy but some very cliched and implausible representations of what happens when you become a literary author.With a kind of unvarying bland placidity, Bastien Bouillon plays someone who (like Courtès) abandoned a very successful career in photography in pursuit of his financially perilous dream of being a serious writer. We get a single shot early on of all his cameras on a shelf: he presumably does not sell any to alleviate his financial difficulties but we never see or hear about these valuable objects ever again.Bouillon has already had what the French callsuccès d’estimewith some well-reviewed but low-selling books, and his publisher (Virginie Ledoyen) says he needs to get some serious sales; she is unenthusiastic about his new manuscript and refuses to advance him any more money. Bouillon’s wife and kids have moved out, a situation he accepts with the same undemonstrative blankness as everything else. So he is forced to move to a cheaper place and do piecemeal labour to pay the bills while he works listlessly on his magnum opus; he deliberately chooses menial, meaningless work to ringfence the dignity of his new vocation as a serious author. He never quite answers the question of why he doesn’t just do literary-adjacent work such as teaching. Perhaps his pride will not permit him.So using a Taskrabbit-type website on which workers must humiliatingly undercut each other in bidding to do various manual-labour jobs for low fees, he scrapes a depressing living. But with an awful inevitability, he turns out to be writing a heartwarming book about what this existence is like, with vignettes of all these micro-employers, which is naturally entitled At Work. Did Courtès really submit a miscellaneous bunch of handwritten notebooks to his publisher for this – not typing it himself, no agent, nothing like that? Did he really continue to do online gig work even after it was published?Well, maybe: although his film deal surely means this era is at an end. It is a novel and a fiction feature after all, and neither are, as they say, on oath with the details. Either way, the film, though eventful enough, does not quite succeed in its tacit claim to be a study of poverty; the author behaves like a student who is stoically accepting some temporary dodgy accommodation.At Work screened at theVenice film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsGig economyFilm adaptationsAutobiography and memoirBiography booksFrancereviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s also a tale of art v commerce, as Adrien Brody’s Jewish-Hungarian concentration camp survivor László comes to the US and resumes his career as an architect famed for his brutalist style, supported by his wife Erzsébet (Felicity Jones). His new employer, industrialist Harrison Lee Van Buren (a superbly self-regarding Guy Pearce), envisions a grandiose community centre on the top of a hill. It is their relationship that forms the dark heart of the film, as László’s obsession with creative purity clashes with Harrison’s ego, envy and financial might.Friday 5 September, 9pm, Sky Cinema PremiereThe Quick and the DeadView image in fullscreenGo west … The Quick and the Dead.Photograph: AllstarBack in 1995 – when she was a far bigger draw than Russell Crowe and Leonardo DiCaprio – Sharon Stone starred alongside them in Sam Raimi’s jolly spaghetti western homage.

Almost every word is greeted with a similar response, such is the sense of anticipation and fervour around her arrival.Rae has set foot on a stage only a handful of times – the viral TikTok dancer and social media heavyweight turned pop star is now touring for the first time. Any sense of apprehension as to whether she is up to the task is quickly quashed. The pulsing synth-pop of Fame Is a Gun sets the tone for an evening dominated by irresistible hooks, winking fun and carefully choreographed dance moves that gracefully slink around the songs.On record, Rae’s music – early Lana Del Rey meets late-period Madonna via Britney – is often too dreamy and floaty to feel like out-and-out club tracks, but when performed live, such textural subtleties are dialled down in favour of a more direct and pounding approach. Tracks such as Summer Forever, though, catch a wonderful middle ground between bass-heavy rhythms and hazy soundscapes.When Rae invites audience members to scream her part on the remix of Charli xcx’s Von Dutch, the decibel levels can’t be far off popping every lightbulb in the building – the response is ecstatic. Despite being green, Rae is an assured performer on stage. From the raunchy High Fashion – with beats that fizz, crack and pop – to the almost 90s R&B girl group vibes of Headphones On, her voice glides along comfortably and confidently.Addison Rae: Addison review – 2025’s most refreshing star revels in pop’s shallow pleasuresRead moreDespite her Louisiana roots, Rae leans into her Los Angeles pop star persona with almost comedic levels of valley girl shtick, laying on the audience praise and gratitude thick, while shooting out million dollar bills with her face on it from a confetti cannon. It is deeply fun stuff.The closing one-two of Times Like These and Diet Pepsi are a potent finale. On a beautiful version of the former, Rae breathily sings: “My life moves faster than me, can’t feel the ground beneath my feet.” But based on the hyperaccelerated speed of her career so far, she is doing a remarkable job of keeping up.Explore more on these topicsPop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s spoken by a handful of Sámi communities living across the part of Sápmi (the territory of the Sámi peoples across northern Scandinavia) that’s now in north-east Sweden. “We have been working so hard to get to the point where you can hear the language at the Royal Albert Hall,” says Barruk. “It’s amazing.”And not only to hear the language, but experience it sung by Barruk in her own music, recomposed and remade with theNorwegian Chamber Orchestra. They’ll be led by the violinist and conductor Pekka Kuusisto,in a Promthat will take the audience on a journey “into my universe”, she says, “so that people can understand that this language is alive”. The Prom is a symbol of hope and defiance for Ume Sámi and its speakers, and for the Indigenous peoples of Sápmi as a whole, she tells me. “I want to give something hopeful to my own people.”My whole family is coming to the Prom. My brother, even, who’s a reindeer herder and can never usually travelKatarina BarrukIt’s also a big moment in her own life. “The whole of my family is coming. My brother, even. He’s a reindeer herder and he never has time for travelling, but the end of August is the only time of year he can leave. It’s really huge to hear the Ume Sámi language in one of the world’s biggest concert halls.”But for Barruk, the significance of the Prom isn’t only about representing her language: it’s about creating a new chapter of cultural survival for her people. Her songs, all in Ume Sámi, are based on joiking traditions, the traditional vocal art of the Sámis, and mix the joik’s skirls of high-register cries with melodies of depth and soulfulness.View image in fullscreenKatarina Barruk: ‘It’s huge to hear the Ume Sàámi language in one of the world’s biggest concert halls.’Photograph: https://www.katarinabarruk.com/Her second album,Ruhttuo, released in 2022, was a fusion of a contemporary soundworld with timeless traditions. That’s the basis of the Proms collaboration, too: “I’m not only doing traditional joik in the concerts. My vocal practice is really affected by my personal exploration of how I can play my instrument – my voice. When I was growing up, all the vocal sounds I made were always supposed to mean something: a place, a person, a mountain, an expressive state. So I was always emotionally exhausted after the concerts. But now I can sometimes make sounds for the sake of making interesting sounds, and then it becomes even more fun.”But at theProms, she will be singing songs “about dreams, about time, about being in the present tense. And there is one traditional joik, Miärralándda (Coastal Lands). There is also a piece about my great-grandmother, whose sister was one of the people who took the initiative to have the first Sámi gathering. I have strong foremothers in my family who have always been fighting for Sámi rights.”Barruk’s music is a parable of Sámi culture’s place in the world now. “My music is always affected by western music. You are always part of that society. The question is how much do you assimilate to fit in, as an Indigenous person? How much can you work to help each other and use the new ways that are available to lift up our voices?”Exclusive: watch a clip of Katarina Barruk and the Norwegian Chamber orchestra’s collaborationThat means recognising the fragility and threats to Sámi people, and to Ume Sámi speakers in particular. Neither Finland nor Sweden has ratified the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention of 1989. Norway has, but Barruk says that it has continued to violate the rights of Sámi people. And across Sápmi, she says, “they are getting rid of the Indigenous people” to make way for mining in the boreal forest. Reindeer herders and Sámi people have had to move to make way for mining, and the environmental desecration that brings – and for wind farms, too. “When you are ‘green transitioning’, you are often getting rid of the Indigenous people,” she says.These are issues of survival and self-determination that are burned into the inspiration behind Katarina’s compositions and performance. “When I started making music, I always thought about my community, my people, my culture. I love them so highly and I know what kind of dark times we are living in, and how we are fighting on a daily basis.”View image in fullscreenPekka Kuusisto (centre) and the Norwegian Chamber Orchestra performDSCH, an all-Shostakovich programmeat the Queen Elizabeth Hall in June 2024.Photograph: Pete WoodheadSo what can the musicians of the Norwegian Chamber Orchestra, who first collaborated with Barruk in Oslo in 2023, add to her searing music? “It’s amazing to hear the music you’ve written played by so many human beings, and how that changes the dynamic,” she says. The piece that comes after the song about her great-grandmother, Barruk says, “feels like it’s playing in her honour”. That music, Kuusisto tells me, is Max Reger’s version of Bach’s chorale setting O Mensch, Bewein Dein Sünde Groß, music that’s an exorcism of humanity’s sin and pain.Barruk, her band and Kuusisto share the stage with the orchestra in the first half of the concert, alternating her songs with classical and contemporary pieces from Caroline Shaw to Michael Tippett to Philip Glass, which Kuusisto has chosen for their tradition-transcending resonances. He says his choice of music is an exploration of how “composers respectfully re-read ancient knowledge and earlier traditions”: the way that Tippett reimagines Purcell in Sellinger’s Round, and how Shaw puts Ravel and Mozart in suspended musical animation in Plan and Elevation, analogies of how Barruk rethinks the ancient traditions of Sámi music. “Every generation has to reinterpret concepts that previous generations have taken for granted,” he says, “including things such as religion and nationalism, which play a big part in the treatment of Indigenous people worldwide – plus, are more often than not the driving forces behind war.”When Katarina sings, it’s an act of preserving a culture. It’s incredible to witness music-making in which the motivation is so different from what we’re used toPekka KuusistoThere are stories of oppression in Kuusisto’s setlist, too. Kuusisto will play Hannah Kendall’s Weroon Weroon, written for him in 2022, in which “you basically put the violin under arrest”, he says. In her programme note for the piece, Kendall explains that “the strings of the violin are bound together with three aluminium dreadlock cuffs; afro hair accessories that distort the sound so that pitch production becomes unstable and unpredictable. A new creolised instrument is formed as a result.” The violin is denatured, forced into sonic contortions: a musical mirror of colonial oppression.View image in fullscreen‘Every generation has to reinterpret concepts that previous ones have taken for granted’ … Pekka Kuusisto, with musicians from the Norwegian Chamber Orchestra.Photograph: Ⓒ Bård GundersenThe second half, for the orchestra alone, ends with the darkness of Shostakovich’s eighth quartet, a scream of the individual against Soviet tyranny.Kuusisto says that working with Barruk has changed him and the orchestra. It’s all too easy for the culture of orchestral playing to become complacent, a job rather than a vocation, he says. But “when Katarina sings, it’s an act of preserving a culture. It’s an incredible thing to witness music-making in which the motivation is so radically different from what we’re used to. In fact, I would venture that we are not even so used to thinking about what the motivation is in our work in classical music at all. Which is why Katarina is vitally important for us, to make us think about what we are doing, and why we are doing it. It’s one of those experiences where we collectively feel we are standing on more solid ground.”For Barruk, “it’s huge and impactful and powerful that the Ume Sámi language has survived against all odds”, she says. “It’s alive even when it is not supposed to be, if the programmes to eradicate it had worked in earlier centuries. And that brings another level to my music, because I am able to sing in an Indigenous language. There is such a resilience within our people.”For one night this summer, Barruk and Kuusisto’s Prom will turn the Royal Albert Hall into an outpost of Ume Sámi and the people of Sápmi: their traditions, their hopes, and their defiant and urgent cultural future.Katarina Barruk, Pekka Kuusisto and the Norwegian Chamber Orchestra areat the Proms on 31 Augustand live on Radio 3, and then on BBC Sounds until 12 October.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicProms 2025PromsFolk musicinterviewsShareReuse this content"

In addition to her spellbinding solo releases, she is an eager collaborator, working with the likes of Efterklang, the improv quartet Amor Muere – which she co-founded in her adopted home of Mexico City – and with her romantic partner, guitarist Hector Tosta, as Titanic. On the latter’s superb 2023 debut,Vidrio, they pioneered a genre-agnosticism that veered from squealing free-jazz saxophone to hammering drum grooves and aggressively processed cello, always anchored in Fratti’s soaring falsetto. It heralded the arrival of a group who embraced experimentation as much as earwormy melodies.View image in fullscreenTitanic: HagenOn Hagen, the duo double down on their convictions, complementing their unusual arrangements with a newfound pop shimmer. Opener Lágrima del Sol sets the tone: sparse hand claps and shards of distorted guitar mark the rhythm for Fratti’s lilting nursery rhyme melody, then clattering drums burst through. When the song feels on the verge of falling apart, it suddenly takes on shades of 80s synth-pop, with Fratti singing softly over Phil Collins-worthy toms and twinkling keys. This kind of joyous surprise recurs throughout the record. Escarbo Dimensiones develops from a minimal arrangement of drums, bass and atonal vocals into soft funk that nods to Sade.La Dueñaslips from distorted cello and cymbal washes into a dramatic synth ballad that channels Kate Bush’s yearning vocals; La Trampa Sale erupts from a trudging beat into an arena-sized, reverb-laden chorus.‘Doubt is exciting’: cellist Mabe Fratti on chaos, curiosity and climbing volcanoesRead moreCathartic moments of darkness temper their pop side: Gotera wrangles thundering metal blastbeats beneath Fratti’s elongated melodies; Gallina Degollada delivers unrelenting, menacing drums and growling bass. This startling balance underscores Hagen’s remarkable achievement: a reimagining of pop music that revels in lingering unease, challenging yet infectious.Also out this monthColombian musicianLucrecia DaltreleasesA Danger to Ourselves (RVNG Intl), an intimate collection of longing vocal melodies accompanied by sparse drum loops and textural harmony. It’s downtempo and full of strange instrumental flourishes that draw the listener in.

West African percussion ensembleBalimaya Project’s debut collaboration with Colombian groupDiscos Pacífico All Stars,Calima (Jazz Re:freshed), is a fascinating fusion of African and Latin traditions, meandering from highlife to rumba, talking drum and Latin jazz horns, all held together by a relentless sense of groove.Explore more on these topicsMusicGlobal album of the monthExperimental musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Clare Carlisle found hers in a cave halfway up a mountain.It happened 20 years ago: walking on a Himalayan path, she met a holy man who lived in a cave nearby. Not your stereotypical sadhu, he didn’t have matted hair and wasn’t semi-naked but wore nice trousers and an acrylic pullover. Nor did he have any obvious wisdom to impart; at the last of their three meetings, he and Carlisle mainly got stoned and giggled about the chicken-like patterns on a cushion she had brought him as a gift. Yet, after leaving, she felt a “yearning” for something that they had shared: a sense that there could be a more “noble” way of living, or that we could experience “transcendence”, a higher perspective on life.Carlisle went on to have an eminent career as a philosophy professor and the acclaimed biographer ofSøren KierkegaardandGeorge Eliot. The holy man receded from her mind until she was invited to give the 2024 Gifford Lectures, a venerable series dedicated to the theme of “natural theology”. She decided to make the encounter her starting point for the six talks, and now for these six interlinked essays based on them.The opening essay sets the scene by telling the Himalayan story, while the remaining five lead us onward and upward. The most interesting step comes in the second essay, in which Carlisle uses her own experience of writing biography to point out a dramatic difference in two ways of thinking about human lives.Liberated from time, you can see life ‘under the aspect of eternity’While we are living our own life, it is a flowing, varied and incomplete thing. We are immersed in it, as if in a river. New experiences flood in on us or rain down like a “shower of atoms”, as Virginia Woolf wrote. But we cannot generally step out of the temporal flow to get a more elevated view of the entire shape and meaning of our experience. For a biographer writing about someone in the past, however, everything shifts. The life is completed and you are outside it. The details may be less rich than they were to the living person but the view over it is better. You can float up, as it were, to see what shape the person’s time-flow formed, as when a satellite picture shows the full course of a river. Liberated from time, you can see the life “under the aspect of eternity”, to borrow Spinoza’s phrase.Carlisle illustrates the difference with a children’s fable told in Karen Blixen’s Out of Africa. In brief: a man stumbles around in the mud for a while in the middle of the night. He loses his way, changes direction and trips over a few things before going back to bed. Only when he wakes up and sees the scene by daylight does he realise that his footprints have traced out a perfect picture of a stork. The point is that, by living, we create a meaningful picture without knowing it – unless we attain some inkling of that wider view through art or mysticism.This idea that we “manifest” something in life is explored through the rest of the book. Each essay leads us further up into the conceptual clouds and closer to the idea of transcendence. The Milieu looks at the various wider contexts a life can have – historical or social, for example. Incarnations examines spiritual possibilities as embodied by individuals. Arunachala partly concerns another cave-dwelling sage, Ramana Maharshi, who got over a personal fear of death to become a mystic and teacher. The final chapter, Transcendence for Beginners, ties it all together, asking whether we can have access to a noble or radiant realm while still in the midst of life.By this time, we have climbed quite a mountain of ineffability, but Carlisle has led us so gently step by step that we are willing to follow. Like William James – an earlier Gifford lecturer also fascinated by experiences that are hard to describe – she combines close readings of texts (notably those of Spinoza, Eliot and Proust) with examples from her own life. Sometimes, the citations fly past too quickly, but her extended analyses are both touching and enlightening: I especially liked her reading of Eliot’s Daniel Derondaand passages on the artistCelia Paul.Having arrived at the ending, we look back to see that we have traversed territory that is not completely religious but is not merely aesthetic or literary or psychological either. Like the man in Blixen’s fable, we see a picture traced by our steps, but I suspect it may vary for each reader, and even for the same reader at different times and in different moods. This is to Carlisle’s credit: we can make our own shape out of her words because she is never dogmatic and because she is clearly on an open-ended quest herself. All possibilities remain alive in this subtle, generous and humane book.Transcendence for Beginnersby Clare Carlisle is published by Fitzcarraldo (£12.99).

All I wanted was to be a squirrel in the Mossflower Woods!The books that changed me as a teenagerI read China Miéville’s Perdido Street Station and The City & the City when I was in college. I had been falling out of love with fantasy – I felt too old for Redwall, and I thought I’d outgrown the genre – but Miéville’s work opened the door to the enormous world of adult fantasy literature that grappled with the problems I was now interested in.The writers who changed my mindI had never been wildly interested in books that are primarily or even largely about romantic relationships, but in the past few years, works by Sally Rooney, Banana Yoshimoto and Mieko Kawakami have changed my mind. They have opened my eyes to the potential in describing the subtle shifts in any interpersonal encounter, and I’m working out how to do that in my own writing now.The authors I came back toIt took me a while to understand Vladimir Nabokov’s brand of humour. I tried Pnin when I was in college and it just didn’t work. I gave it another try last month and I couldn’t stop giggling. It also took me a while to find the charm in Victor Hugo’s bloviating. In high school, I only read the bits of Les Misérables about the Friends of the ABC (I had a crush on Enjolras, just like everyone else.) Recently I read the unabridged edition, and I’m old enough now to enjoy every rabbit-hole sentence about Waterloo, argot and the Parisian sewer system.The book I rereadDavid Mitchellwas my favourite author at college – I raved about The Bone Clocks to everyone I met. Cloud Atlas didn’t work so well for me, but I recently reread both, and this time I was stunned. Cloud Atlas (and its woefully underappreciated film adaptation) is so gorgeous and life-affirming. It was nice to find Mitchell’s writing is just as magical for me now as it was back then.The book I could never read againI’ve just bought a copy of Arnold Lobel’s Frog and Toad Are Friends for my friend’s toddler’s birthday party. But who am I kidding? I still love those books!The book I discovered later in lifeIt took me a long time to get around to Charles Dickens’s A Tale of Two Cities, which I only finished this summer despite my love of his other work. It is overwritten, melodramatic, deeply silly camp. I love it.The book I am currently readingMario Vargas Llosa’s The Time of the Hero, on the recommendation of my French translator. He lives in Spain and also does Spanish to French translations – we bonded over our love of Borges, and he insisted I read Vargas Llosa too. I’m also on an existentialism kick, so Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Gabriel Marcel and Albert Camus are high on my list. I’ve only now found out that the animated film character Marcel the Shell is a joke about Gabriel Marcel’s concept of the hard shell that closes us off to new possibilities.My comfort readAnything by Ray Bradbury.Katabasis by RF Kuang is published by HarperVoyager.

The Séance Of Blake Manor falls into that second camp: an atmospheric take on an 1890s Irish murder mystery.You play Detective Ward, who has been sent to the titular Blake Manor to investigate the disappearance of Evelyn Deane two nights before a seance is due take place. Mystics from across the globe have gathered at the crumbling mansion to converse with the dead on All Hallows’ Eve, but are they really capable of doing what they say they can? And what was that shadowy figure? There’s more than one secret to unravel.View image in fullscreenYou need to be in the right place at the right time … gameplay in The Séance of Blake Manor.Photograph: Spooky Doorway“Think of it as gothic or folk horror,” says narrative lead Dave McCabe. “It’s that creeping dread that you’re in a place you shouldn’t be and every step you take isn’t safe.”Time ticks down as you explore the house and talk to each of the guests, so you need to work hard to figure out what’s happening. Sometimes you’ll need to solve puzzles by moving objects or finding hidden passwords. Other times you’ll need to be in the right place at the right time to catch crucial information.Permeating all that mystery and Victorian spiritualism is a miasma of Irish folklore. “We picked one key point in Irish mythology for the setup of our story,” says Paul Conway, lead artist and CEO of developer Spooky Doorway. “It’s why this particular place is the nexus of ancient magic and supernatural events, but I can’t say what it is without revealing too much!”“We definitely touch on a lot of Irish mythology, pagan beliefs and ghost stories,” McCabe adds. While those aspects don’t always directly affect the story, that otherworldly presence lingers in the background. Irish traditions, such as carved turnips that are far more monstrous than the pumpkins of today’s Halloween, are dotted around the estate. You encounter a flash ofsomethingearly on, and the library is rammed full of old tales and legends to peruse at your leisure. Just don’t take too long, or your time to solve the mystery will run out.The developers are proud of their heritage and want to inspire players to explore more of it. “I hope it adds another layer to the perception people have of Ireland and Irish history – that it’s not all St Patrick’s Day and flat caps,” McCabe says. “And maybe some people will come over and see a few haunted castles.”The Séance Of Blake Manor is in development forPC.

It is in this dance of power that Teunkie Van Der Sluijs’s adaptation ofTheo Van Gogh’s 2003 film finds its thrill – albeit in scattered flashes. Reimagined for a modern-day setting, with reference to viral content, curated online profiles and followers, the play asks what it means to be truthful in a world of pretence.Old-school political journalist Pierre (a commanding Robert Sean Leonard) begrudgingly arrives in Brooklyn to interview the social media and film star of the moment, Katya (Paten Hughes). Meanwhile, the place he actually wants to be, Washington DC, spins into a political frenzy over the impeachment of the US vice president. Before even meeting his interviewee, Pierre has dismissed Katya as a vacuous, fame-hungry influencer. But as the evening rolls on, he realises she may be sharper than he has given her credit for.View image in fullscreenThe camera is central to Teunkie Van Der Sluijs’s direction.Photograph: Helen MurrayIt is a clash that sparks discussions about gender, celebrity and who really has influence. Sure, they’re knotty issues but it’s hardly new ground, and the script would benefit from a shot of something fresh. Leonard and Hughes make the stage into a battlefield; both are careful not to expose the wrong things. Their fast-paced spurs and spats are electric.The camera remains central to Van Der Sluijs’s contemporary direction. Screens are projected on to the back wall of Katya’s flat (a feat of architectural detail by Derek McLane), showing streams of likes for her content. She films herself talking directly to her fans, casually calling them “besties”. Trolls’ typed words pop up in Twitter-style captions, while the power of the lens is a constant fear. Even when the writing wobbles, the production maintains a state of uneasy, absorbing tension.Interview is atRiverside Studios, London, until 27 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreSocial mediareviewsShareReuse this content"

Vasari was not just an architect and painter but also author of The Lives of the Artists, a massive compendium of tales, true and fanciful, about artists themselves. At the Palazzo Vecchio he directed an art of anecdotal storytelling including in the Studiolo of Francesco I where Macchietti was one of the painters. Both the charm and silliness of the Vasari style are seen here. Saint Nicholas of Bari chucks gold balls into the house of an impoverished gentleman at night, while the whole family are asleep: now his daughters will get dowries and be spared having to become sex workers, according to the story. Macchietti captures the sleepiness of the whole household, but also suggests the anxiety that stops these people sleeping comfortably. They sit in their clothes as if they’ve been talking and worrying until they finally fell asleep in the small hours – and that’s when Saint Nicholas delivers his gifts. I’m not going to mention how this saint became Santa Claus – it’s still August.National Gallery, LondonSign up to the Art Weekly newsletterIf you don’t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email,please sign up here.Get intouchIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please emailnewsletters@theguardian.comExplore more on these topicsArt and designArt Weekly newsletterPaintingPhotographyArtExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Celestials from Eternals even? Let’s consider the optionsFri 29 Aug 2025 07.20 EDTLast modified on Fri 29 Aug 2025 11.51 EDTShareThe news this week thatthe X-Men are finally heading to the Marvel Cinematic Universehas been predicted ever since Disney’s$71bn buyoutof 20th Century Fox in 2019, when every comic book mutant back to Apocalypse suddenly became available to Kevin Feige and Marvel. But it remains to be seen when and how Jean Grey, Cyclops et al will finally make landfall on Earth-616, especially since nobody has yet explained how Marvel plans to smuggle them into a timeline that has spent the best part of two decades blissfully ignoring their existence.In an interview with Empire magazine, Thunderbolts* director, Jake Schreier, describes the chance to oversee theX-Menreboot – which is unlikely to land before 2028 – as “an incredible opportunity with super interesting characters and internal conflict”, adding: “These characters are wrestling with their identity and place in the world – that’s inherently interesting and complex material.” Which, of course, is the usual guff film-makers blurt out when trying to reassure fans that they’re taking the project seriously, but tells us zilch about how it is all going to pan out.The big problem for anyone trying to suddenly introduce mutants into the MCU is that screenwriters can’t magic up a 20-year-old Cyclops without explaining how he somehow missed the Battle of New York, the Ultron incident and Thanos’s big midlife crisis.Industry reports suggestthat Marvel wants to introduce a new generation of younger X-Men, which means that unless something really interesting (and possibly narratively dysfunctional) is going on, they would have been born around the time Tony Stark was still cheerfully selling weapons to failed states, a couple of years before 2008’s Iron Man kicked off the whole MCU circus. So where have all these X-babies been all this time?View image in fullscreenOld favourites … Halle Berry, Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman and Ian McKellen in X:Men: The Last Stand.Photograph: Ronald GrantOf courseMarvelcan and will introduce alternate-universe versions of Professor X, Magneto, Jean Grey and so forth, as is the plan in next year’s Avengers: Doomsday, with old favourites from the Fox years such as Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen turning up for one last hurrah. And we’ve already seen Deadpool and Wolverine in the main reality. But that doesn’t allow Marvel to present the X-Men as they have always existed in the comics: as a huge new wave of mutants who suddenly begin to proliferate at a monumental moment in history, reshaping the world around them.So what are Marvel’s options? The most obvious universal reset button, if it really does want to persuade us the X-Men have just appeared from nowhere, is to usethe Blip– which already functions as this creaking old franchise’s narrative duct tape and may as well be wheeled out again in the studio’s hour of need. You will probably recall that after Thanos finger-snapped half the galaxy out of existence in 2018’s Infinity War, things got very weird – especially when everyone inconveniently popped back in 2019’s Endgame, thanks to the time-bending efforts of Stark et al. What if, a few years later, it turns out that quite a few of those cosmic returnees were actually resurrected with added extra laser eyes and angel wings? Would anyone really bat an eyelid?View image in fullscreenDo you want to update now? … Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch in Captain America: Civil War.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyThen there’s the multiverse option. After 2027’s Avengers: Secret Wars, Marvel simply grafts on a universe where mutants have always been around. It’s been done before in the comics: the 2015 Secret Wars event cheerfully stitched together Earth-616 with the Ultimate universe, giving us a brand-new continuity. It’s the kind of narrative sleight of hand only Marvel could get away with.Whiteboard warrior: Marvel is priming Mister Fantastic to be the new leader of the AvengersRead moreAnd if all else fails, there’s always Elizabeth Olsen’s Scarlet Witch – except she’s technically dead, having brought down an ancient sorcerer’s temple on her own head in Multiverse of Madness. But death in the MCU has all the permanence of a bank holiday parking restriction, so it’s not inconceivable that Marvel drags her back to flick the mutant switch. Wanda’s chaos magic could be rebranded as a patch update – the kind that suddenly downloads the “Mutant Expansion Pack” whether you wanted it or not.There are other options. Perhaps mutants have been here all along, and Professor X has been quietly gaslighting humanity for decades. Or maybe the Celestials, those giant space gods from Eternals who are often credited with priming humanity for mutation in the comics, have been at it again. The Blip flips the switch, and suddenly we’re knee-deep in superpowered teens, with the only slight snag being that Marvel would have to admit Chloé Zhao’s misfiring nonentity of a film actually happened.Either way, the X-Men are finally on their way, and the MCU is likely to be forever changed. Unless Feige and his team have something up their sleeves we haven’t imagined yet, their arrival is likely to be clunky. Then again, if the past two decades have taught us anything, it’s that subtlety was never Marvel’s superpower in the first place.Explore more on these topicsFilmWeek in geekSuperhero moviesMarvelX-MenComics and graphic novelsWalt Disney CompanycommentShareReuse this content"

As a new generation carry its spirit forward, the originators remember the beats and beddingJoe MuggsFri 29 Aug 2025 03.01 EDTLast modified on Fri 29 Aug 2025 03.42 EDTShare‘Iremember looking up over the DJ booth in this huge squat,” says Mario Aguero, “and seeing a sea of mattresses with people lying on them, like some kind of Guinness record attempt. Which was great until someone stood up to go to the bathroom. Then they’d be lurching everywhere.”This was the scene at Telepathic Fish in early 90s London, and co-promoter Kevin Foakes winces as he picks up the memory. “We’d dragged quite a few of the mattresses off the street.” The influential music journalistDavid Toophad come along, “and his report said the first mistake he made was to sit down on a wet mattress”.Waterlogged bedding for unwary horizontal punters doesn’t seem to suggest a key moment in British music history. But Telepathic Fish’s parties became a hub for an entirely new zone of club culture: chillout.The word now evokes anonymous music for health spas, interchangeable Ibiza Poolside Chill or Relaxing Piano type playlists, or perhaps pranged-out ravers yammering in a decidedly un-zen superclub “chillout room”. But a new Telepathic Fish compilation,Trawling the Early 90s Ambient Underground, shows how adventurous chillout music originally was, and a wave of new events from London to Berlin and New York – some complete with duvets and pillows – are keeping Telepathic Fish’s spirit and soft furnishing choices alive.View image in fullscreen‘We didn’t have neighbours, so we thought we’d throw a party’ … Mario Aguero, Mixmaster Morris & Aphex Twin in the flat above the shop, 1993.Photograph: Kevin FoakesBack in 1992 Foakes was at Camberwell College of Arts with his friend David Vallade, while Aguero had come down from the Madchester-era north and was working at a computer graphics company. They were all into the crustier end of rave, such as London institution Club Dog and squat raves by Tribal Energy and Digidub, and were living together in a three-storey house above a shop “with no neighbours, so we thought we’d throw a party,” Vallade says.By their second event, they had a name, Telepathic Fish, and more than 300 guests paying £1 to get in (they each also got a hand-cut holographic foil fish lanyard). Their near neighbour and DJ, Mixmaster Morris, played a chillout room upstairs, stacked with old TVs, and the night was a huge hit. “That was our favourite part by a long way,” says Aguero. “It was social, fun, weird, and the music could go absolutely anywhere.”View image in fullscreen‘She plugged us in to something bigger’ … the new flatmate Chantal Passamonte, who later became Mira Calix.Photograph: Kevin FoakesBy their next party, in mid 1993, they had a new flatmate, Chantal Passamonte – later the acclaimed producer and sound artistMira Calix. After arriving from South Africa, she’d thrown herself into London’s music networks, working in record shops and interning at the label 4AD. “That is when things really kicked up several gears,” says Foakes. “We were just three lads doing a party, but she instantly plugged us into something much bigger.”They graduated to a vast squatted former dole office in Brixton, and Telepathic Fish became an entirely horizontal event. “We jettisoned the dancefloor!” says Aguero. But they realised they needed something for people to look at if they weren’t dancing, so they booked Matt Black from Coldcut to be a video jockey. “We only had a vague idea what that was, and it turned out he’d never done it in public before,” Foakes says. “So it was a trial by fire, but he did it, and every party after that.”The futurism of Black and Aguero’s graphics met low-tech stencilling, camouflage netting and those sometimes moist mattresses, all glowing under UV light for a deeply stoned crowd. Foakes says, “The best record buying advice I ever got was Morris telling me: if you see an old record with hippies and synthesisers on the cover, get it!”, and the room was duly filled with dreamy Detroit techno, proto-trip-hop and space-dub woven into film soundtracks, minimalist classical and Krautrock.View image in fullscreen‘We jettisoned the dancefloor!’… Matt Black, the video jockey for Telepathic Fish’s parties, pictured in 1993.Photograph: Kevin FoakesThe team cite Oscillate in Birmingham and Sonora in Glasgow (run byJD Twitch, later of Optimo) as peers, as well as the chillout areas in crusty clubs and free parties. The influence of the Orb and the KLF loomed large too; Alex Paterson and Jimmy Cauty were the DJs in the ambient room at Paul Oakenfold’s club night Land of Oz. But over a series of squat events and then guest spots at clubs and festivals – plus all four of the team working at the scene’s hub, record shop Ambient Soho – Telepathic Fish became a major focus for the era’s experimentalism.Aphex Twin played there, just as Warp Records was cementing him, Autechre and others as left-field superstars. The Ninja Tune label which Black had founded with Jonathan More – now, alongside Warp, the most important in UK electronic music – found its feet partly with Telepathic Fish as a testing ground, and Foakes became both Ninja Tune’s in-house designer, as well as releasing records under the name DJ Food. Aguero and Vallade would find success in video games and illustration respectively.View image in fullscreenScene hub Ambient Soho on Berwick Street in London, 1994.Photograph: Kevin FoakesThe events ended in 1995, and while chillout rooms cropped up across clubland, the concept of an entirely chillout nightclub dissipated. “It was always a cottage industry,” says Vallade: the odd squatter selling cans or cups of chai on a trestle table notwithstanding, it wasn’t really commercial in a way that could hold up against the professionalisation of club culture as the 90s wore on.Ambient electronica started getting ever artier and more experimental, and trip-hop replaced it as the de facto stoner soundtrack. Ibiza had its own parallel chillout tradition thanks to its famous sunset sets at Cafe del Mar (plus its mixtape/CD series), where DJ Jose Padilla would play Aphex Twin alongside Ennio Morricone and Astrud Gilberto, but gradually Balearic chilling became synonymous with pedestrian beats you might hear as hold music for a multinational bank.Thirty years on, though, the Telepathic Fish compilation emerges amid refreshed interest in cosmic sounds and laid-back events. DJ/producerMark Barrottflies the flag for the original Ibizan chillout spirit with blissful sets atHostal Del Torre, with names very much in the Telepathic Fish tradition such as Boards Of Canada and µ-Ziq next to Nina Simone and Mazzy Star. Elsewhere, inspired by home gatherings and after-hours sessions at London’s Brilliant Corners, with bedding included, Errol and Alex Rita ofTouching Bassstarted ambient-leaning listening event A Loose Ting: “Making music feel really nice in a small space, a little haven for a few hours away from the rest of the world and the madness in it right now,” Errol says.Speaking during sets is discouraged at A Loose Ting, just as it is at the private loft gatherings of New York’sPlanetarium, where the audience mainly reclines. Organiser Justin Carter notes with pride the gentle rustle of appreciation you can hear at intense moments on recordings of his sets. There are no light shows or stencil art, but it does hark back to the trippiness of 90s chillout. A big inspiration for Planetarium is the use of psychedelic drugs in therapy, Carter says, “This framework where you put on an eye mask and you go into this space and you’re encouraged to go deep.” Similarly, at Planetarium, “you’re sitting with music that is like a guide or a therapist. It’s a quiet experience.”View image in fullscreen‘Sensory rave spas full of fountains, harpists and vibrating mattresses’ … Aoife McGuinness, Jessie Dymond Barber and the team at Overflow in Berlin.Other events are directly inspired by the multimedia madness of 90s chillout. In Berlin, Aoife McGuinness and Jessie Dymond Barber set upOverflow, a studio hosting “sensory rave spas” full of fountains, harpists, vibrating mattresses and light installations, helping clubbers “nurture their bodies”, as Barber puts it. But Overflow is certainly not just for reverent sitting and listening, and has a sense of fun and mischief: “It’s not only very floaty, beautiful,” says McGuinness, “but brain tingly, sideways, weird stuff.”Work your erk’n’jerk! Inside the UK club nights for dancing, not social media posingRead moreBack in the UK, Wil Troup, founder of label and online magazinethe Ransom Note, fondly remembers original 90s chillout rooms at places such as Brixton’s Fridge; his younger colleague Tia Cousins discovered them more recently at theWorld Unknownparties run by acid house survivor Andy Blake. Troup and Cousins’ shared love of ambient sound blossomed into their remarkableMusic to Watch Seeds Grow Byrelease series, and also into the Watching Trees micro-festival they founded with Optimo. Here, experimental music and immersive visuals – such as dappled sunlight being projected at night – give “a different type of experience” to your average rave-up in a field, says Troup. “Like, why do we have this expectation that the dancefloor has to go all night? Here people disperse, they talk, it can be a beautiful social thing in its own right.” There’s no question the mission of Telepathic Fish is alive and well in a space like this – albeit with fewer soggy mattresses.Telepathic Fish – Trawling the Early 90s Ambient Underground is released on 5 September on Fundamental Frequencies.

It premieres out of competition on the Lido on Friday evening.The drama is set in the world of higher education and stars Roberts as a beloved professor who finds herself at a personal and professional crossroads when a star student (the Bear’s Ayo Edebiri) makes an accusation of assault against her friend and colleague (Andrew Garfield). The cast also includes Michael Stuhlbarg and Chloë Sevigny.Unsurprisingly, the film’s exploration of conflict and power dynamics spilled into a press conference on Friday, where the first question to Roberts was whether the drama undermined feminist principles.View image in fullscreenThe main cast of After the Hunt, Michael Stuhlbarg, Ayo Edebiri, Julia Roberts, Chloë Sevigny and Andrew Garfield, at Venice film festival before the film premieres.Photograph: Elisabetta A Villa/Getty Images“Not to be disagreeable because it’s not in my nature,” Roberts responded with a smile. “I don’t think it’s just reviving an argument of women being pitted against each other or not supporting each other. There’s a lot of old arguments that get rejuvenated in this movie in a way that does create conversation.“The best part of your question is that you all came out of the theatre talking about it. That’s how we wanted it to feel. You realise what you believe in strongly because we stir it all up for you. So, you’re welcome,” the star said jokingly.Guadagnino added: “We are looking at people in their truths. Everyone has their own truths. It’s not that one truth is more important than another.“And from the perspective of film-makers and artists, how do we see the clash of truth, and what is the boundary of these truths together? It’s not about making a manifesto to revive old-fashioned values.”There were several more questions about the film’s politics and whether it was attempting to stoke controversy. Roberts and Edebiri were also asked what had attracted them to playing “troubled women”.“Trouble is where the juicy stuff is,” Roberts said. “It’s like dominos of conflict, once one falls, then suddenly everywhere you turn, there’s some new piece of conflict and challenge. That’s what makes it worth getting up and going to work in the morning.”Emma Stone declares belief in aliens during Bugonia film promoRead more“That’s how you grow,” Edebiri said. “That’s the type of movie I enjoy watching.”Roberts explained that working on After the Hunt reminded her of Bruce Beresford’s 1983 drama Tender Mercies, which followed a former country music star whose career and relationship with his ex-wife and daughter are wrecked by alcoholism.“I just thought there was something magical about the idea that a camera just landed in a place and happened to document what was going on where it landed. That’s how I feel about this movie,” she said.“It’s not so much that we’re making a statement. We’re just sharing these lives for this moment, and then we want everyone to go away and talk to each other. That, to me, is the most exciting bit because we’re kind of losing the art of conversation in humanity right now.”Elsewhere, Guadagnino was asked why the opening credits appeared to hark back to the classic font used in the credits of many films directed byWoody Allen. “The crass answer would be why not,” he replied.Jay Kelly review – even a George Clooney sizzle reel can’t save this dire Noah Baumbach effortRead more“When I started thinking about this movie with my collaborators, we couldn’t stop thinking of Crimes and Misdemeanors or Another Woman, or even Hannah and Her Sisters. And there was an infrastructure to the story that felt very linked to the great oeuvre of Woody Allen between 1985 and 1991.“It also felt like an interesting nod to thinking of an artist who has been facing some sort of problems with his being. And what is our responsibility in looking at the work of an artist that we love like him? And by the way, that font is a classic,” Guadagnino said.Explore more on these topicsJulia RobertsVenice film festivalLuca GuadagninoAndrew Garfield#MeToo movementFeminismWoody AllennewsShareReuse this content"

Here, frequent travellers share their tipsGet our weekend culture and lifestyle emailDoosie MorrisFri 29 Aug 2025 16.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 29 Aug 2025 20.11 EDTShareFree accommodation in someone else’s home might seem like an easy hack for cheap travel, but there’s more to house-sitting and swapping than a free room.While sitting usually involves caring for pets in exchange for accommodation, swapping requires participants to make their own home available to others for the pleasure of staying for free in someone else’s.Angela Laws, a founder of Trusted Housesitters, the world’s largest house-sitting platform with more than 200,000 active members, wants to be clear with those considering giving it a go: “It’s not a free vacation. It’s not free travel. It’s not free accommodation. It is a mutually beneficial exchange between pet parents and sitters.” She stresses too that anyone wanting to take advantage of the benefits needs to appreciate and honour the responsibilities it entails.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningOn the other hand, if you have your own home, Emily Budin, an Australian living in the UK, has swapped her zone two London apartment for New York brownstones, a Christmas in Switzerland, chateaus in the south of France, Croatian villas – and more. She says, with caveats, the practice is a “super-easy” way to banish accommodation costs from your holiday budget. Swaps don’t always have to be simultaneous, which makes platforms like Home Exchange – made famous by the film The Holiday – much more convenient. Budin says its annual fee is about equivalent to one night in a decent hotel in a big European city.View image in fullscreenEmily Budin, an Australian living in the UK has swapped her zone two London apartment for New York brownstones, a Christmas in Switzerland, chateaus in the south of France, Croatian villas – and more.Photograph: Alexander Spatari/Getty Images“You can earn points while your house is empty,” Budin says. If you’re visiting family elsewhere, and use them to “pay” for a property during a time that suits your vacation schedule. Meanwhile, when you’re away, someone else might use their points to book your place, which will in turn earn you more points. This also means the swaps don’t have to be like-for-like. Budin says a reasonable quality property in a central location might command the same points per night as a more remote but more lavish one. If your place isn’t top tier, you can still bank your points to spend on more premium properties.If you’re renting, you can still join HomeExchange, but the onus is on the swapper to check if their rental agreement allows it.Communication is keyLaws says you can find a sit within 24 hours, but in her experience, “the more communication, the better”. If a listing aligns with your experience as a sitter, the first step is to reach out through the secure messaging system within the platform. Laws recommends a video call, where both parties can ask questions, take a virtual tour of the home, and even share their own living space.‘Warm and fuzzy’: would you cuddle a Highland cow?Read moreHannah Wilkinson, 32, started house-sitting to see Australia on the cheap with her boyfriend in 2023 and haschronicled the experience on Substack. Two years and nearly 30 back-to-back sits later, Wilkinson says the rare hiccups she has experienced could have been avoided by more thorough communication.Laws says the sit she is currently organising has involved at least five days of back and forth to ensure everyone is on the same page.For house swappers, similar advice applies. Budin says she doesn’t always bother with a video call, but does like to make expectations clear and be sure to ask about what her hosts expect of her via messages. She says even when “rules” aren’t explicitly outlined, it’s expected that you won’t be treating the property as if you’re a paying customer, but rather a personal house guest: “You’d be neighbourly, make sure to put the bins out, things like that.”View image in fullscreenTreat the property like you’re a personal house guest, Budin says.Photograph: Robynne O’Halloran/Getty ImagesBe flexibleWilkinson likens the house-sitting to backpacking: “You need to be organised, but you also need to be completely open to the unexpected.” She and her boyfriend, for example, spent a few weeks in Jindabyne simply because the opportunity arose.Swapping can also be pretty spontaneous, according to Budin, who says that if her husband were also a remote worker, she believes they could stay elsewhere “every other week if we wanted to”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She likes to lock things in about a month in advanceBudin says the preparation for swapping can be a “bit of a headache”. She ups her cleaners’ hours before and after having people stay at her place. While it’s not expected that all your personal effects will be removed, it’s customary to leave empty shelves in the fridge, pantry, closet and vanity, she says. “It doesn’t have to be like an Airbnb, but it definitely has to be livable.”View image in fullscreenBudin increases her cleaners’ hours before and after having people stay at her place.Photograph: Aire Images/Getty ImagesIs it weird?Budin says it’s all a state of mind. If you come to terms with people being in your space, house swapping is a legitimately good way to access properties you might not otherwise afford.“You’re either a house swapper or you’re not,” she says. “But for me, the benefits far outweigh the negatives.” She says while she has come home to surprises, like the house being messier than anticipated – and once finding a vibrator left behind in her dresser – she has never had anything broken or stolen. “I’m sure there’s been a few men that have worn my underwear, but what you don’t know won’t hurt you.”“There’s also insurances that are in place and a holding deposit that’s kept every time you swap,” she says. Emmanuel Arnaud, the CEO and co-founder of HomeExchange told Guardian Australia via email that the platform has facilitated nearly half a million swaps in 2024, up 42% on 2023, and that 99.7% of exchanges occur without incident.For Wilkinson, arriving at one house-sit to discover there was an expectation that the dogs would share her bed was “a bit much,” but she says this kind of detail can be ironed out in advance.View image in fullscreen‘I’m sure there’s been a few men that have worn my underwear, but what you don’t know won’t hurt you,’ Budin says.Photograph: makasana/Getty Images/iStockphotoPets are the priority when sittingOf house-sitting, Wilkinson says simply: “If you aren’t into pets, just don’t even consider it.” She has had to scrub poop out of carpets and once devoted weeks to caring for a blind pug whose health deteriorated rapidly in their owner’s absence. The experience, she says, was like “looking after a toddler”.Even with a healthy animal, she points out, “you’re going to have to give up at least an hour of your day”. While you can be strategic and look for sits with independent felines or older dogs that need less exercise, the fact remains that caring for pets is what you are doing in exchange for accommodation, so it needs to be seen as a job.Explore more on these topicsAustralia holidaysAustralian lifestylefeaturesShareReuse this content"

No more tiresome weekly stints of vacuuming, and no more last-minute panic sessions when you have visitors on the way. Instead, your compact robot chum regularly trundles out from its dock, sucking up dust, hair and debris to leave your floors looking spick and span.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Over the past few years, robot vacuums have become much more affordable, with basic units starting at about £150. They’re also doing more than they used to, mopping areas of hard flooring and charging in sophisticated cleaning stations that empty their dust collectors and clean their mop pads for you.In fact, the biggest effort required by you is deciding which one to buy. That’s where I can help. I’ve tested seven of the most popular models to help you find the best robot vacuum for your space.The best cordless vacuum cleaners for a spotless home: 10 tried and tested favouritesRead moreAt a glanceBestrobot vacuum cleaner overall:Eufy X10 Pro Omni£699 at EufyBest robot vacuum for power cleaning:Samsung Bespoke Jet Bot Combo AI+£719 at John LewisBest robot vacuum cleaner for small homes and small budgets:Beko VRR61414VB RoboSmart£299 at CurrysWhy you should trust meI’ve spent almost three decades reviewing technology, home and garden products, covering everything from PCs, printers and tablets to lawnmowers, coffee machines,steam cleanersand fans. I’ve tested a wide range of smart-home appliances and devices, and I know the features that make them more effective and easier to use – and those that don’t bring any real value.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘I spilled flour and crunched cereal on a mat to up the challenge for the robot vacuum cleaners’: the Eufy X10 Pro Omni’s takes on the mess, before (left) and right (right).Photograph: Stuart AndrewsOur team scoured the stores and spoke to manufacturers to pull in the leading robot vacuum cleaners. I then gave our test subjects the workout of their little robot lives in my three-bedroom, two-floor home. Over three weeks I had them cleaning every room, switching vacuums and docks around to give each a shot at the upstairs and downstairs spaces.The house has a mix of wooden and composite hard flooring, rugs and carpets, with various awkward, dusty corners as well as two cats shedding inconceivable quantities of hair. What’s more, the living room is a fiendish obstacle course, with two sofas, a packed TV cabinet, an Ikea Poäng armchair and a vintage suspended egg chair to navigate. Even with some lighter furnishing removed, these robot vacuums had their work cut out.I used a smartphone sound meter to measure noise levels, and a plug-in power meter to see how much energy the docks or chargers used while idle and when charging. I also spilled flour and crunched cereal on to a barrier mat to check the suction and cleaning power of each model, treading in the crumbled shredded wheat to up the challenge. I used the apps to check the vacuums’ mapping and scheduling capabilities and to add rooms, zones and no-go areas.After testing, the cleaners were either returned to their sources or donated to the British Heart Foundation.The best robot vacuums for 2025View image in fullscreenBefore (right) and after (left) the Samsung Bespoke Jet Bot Combo AI+ tackled flour and crunched up cereal on a mat.Photograph: Stuart AndrewsBest robot vacuum overall:Eufy X10 Pro OmniView image in fullscreen£699 at Eufy£599 at AmazonThe X10 Pro Omni is not a bad price for a self-emptying, self-cleaning robot mop and vacuum. The base station washes and dries the heads between uses, refilling the internal water tank and emptying the dust collector. It uses a front-facing camera and laser technology to sense its way around your floors, spotting and identifying items, such as socks or cables, that it can then avoid. It’s powerful, with 8,000Pa of suction force, and its twin rotating mop heads can apply 1kg of downwards pressure, to give your hard floors a serious scrubbing when they need it.Why we love itThis Eufy machine does almost everything for you, as long as you periodically empty the base station’s dust bag and dirty-water tank and refill the clean-water tank. Like the Samsung, reviewed further down, it’s great at mapping out your home and dodging potential obstacles, but it’s also better than the Samsung at cleaning on the first pass. The side brush and vacuum can shift dust and hair in seconds, while the mop left my hard floors sparkling, even dealing with dried-on spots of juice.The app gives you plenty of control, allowing you to set up cleaning scenarios to focus on different areas. You can also tweak cleaning options such as suction power if, say, you’ve got a deep pile carpet to clean and you don’t think it’s really making an impact. The brush and roller seem particularly resistant to getting clogged with hair.It’s a shame that …mopping isn’t so effective on the low water setting – switching up to medium will get you better results. It’s also bigger and louder than rivals, struggling to fit under low furniture and hitting 68dB on max power. Cleaning and drying the mop can be a long and noisy process.Suction power:8,000PaRobotdimensions:327 x 353 x 114mm (WDH)Dock dimensions:365 x 480 x 360mm (WDH)Maximum noise level:68dBABattery life:three hoursPower consumption (charging):26.4WBest for power cleaning:Samsung Bespoke Jet Bot Combo AI+View image in fullscreen£719 at John Lewis£899 at SamsungIt’s hard to miss Samsung’s robot mop and vacuum cleaner, not least because its white base station is more of a mansion than a house, standing over half a metre tall. It’s also unnervingly speedy and has a habit of playing jingles when it starts or finishes, or on any event in between.It uses a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) scanner and two 3D cameras to navigate your home, and it features twin rotating mop heads, which attach magnetically to the bottom of the unit. These are steam-cleaned and dried when the robot returns home.Why we love itIt’s a strong all-rounder. It doesn’t have as much suction as the mighty Dyson, reviewed below, but makes up for it by hunting hair, dust and debris relentlessly until it’s gone. The rotating mop heads do a fantastic job of removing marks and stains from kitchen floors, and they lift up when not in use to avoid rubbing on the carpet.It’s also great at navigation, picking up and even identifying potential obstacles, before carefully manoeuvring around them. Even my troublesome egg chair didn’t cause this machine any issues. With the dock’s integrated dust bin and water tanks, it’s also no great effort to maintain.It’s a shame that …the base station is enormous, and this model is among the most expensive on test. It also struggles with rugs more than the other top vacuums, regularly pulling up the edges and creating a rumpled mess that it subsequently had trouble traversing.Suction power:6,000PaRobotdimensions:359 x 364 x 100mm (WDH)Dockdimensions:444 x 510 x 547mm (WDH)Maximum noise level:68dBABattery life:three hoursPower consumption (charging):45.8WBest for small homes and small budgets:Beko VRR61414VB RoboSmartView image in fullscreen£299 at Currys£198 at AmazonShort of space? Beko’s compact cleaner doesn’t need much: it’s just 34cm across and 8cm high, with a small, simple dock for charging. There’s no mop and not a huge amount of suction power, but it uses laser tech to map out and make its way around your rooms, automatically detecting rugs and carpets then boosting up the suction power. It’ll also get into nooks and under low furniture that halts bigger robot vacuums in their tracks.Why we love itIt’s relatively tiny and inexpensive, but don’t dismiss the Beko as a toy. Thanks to chunky wheels and ingenious suspension, it’ll make its way over tricky rugs and thresholds without any worries, and its rotating side brush has enough oomph to compensate for a meagre 2,000Pa of suction.While it’s not the best vacuum for deep cleaning, it’s great at heading out daily to keep dust under control. Battery life isn’t epic, but two hours should be more than enough for the two floors of the average home, and it can always head back to its dock and start again later. It’s also quiet, putting out 60-61dB even at maximum power.View image in fullscreenThe mat before (left) and after (right) the Beko VRR61414VB RoboSmart did its thing.Photograph: Stuart AndrewsIt’s a shame that …long hair can bind itself around the side brush and roller, and it struggled to shift all the flour in the spot-cleaning test.

It’s also great at vacuuming close to furnishings and skirting boards, and it has clever features to map out the dustiest areas of your home and increase its suction when it hits them.The internal dust collector is easy to remove and empty, and it has a built-in Hepa filter to trap the tiny particles that aggravate common allergies.

It has the same self-cleaning and self-emptying features as the Samsung and Eufy models, and it empties into a larger dust bin rather than a bag. It can detect carpets and hard floors and will mop and/or vacuum accordingly, and it has smart features to spot and tackle hidden dirt or stubborn stains.It also gets extra points for having an intuitive app that takes you through setup and cleaning, and even suggests amusing names for your robot friend. We’ll remember you, Colonel Dustard.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s effective but slow to clean, and sometimes had issues making its way back to its base station. And while the app is helpful, it doesn’t give you much control. It can map only one floor, which is fine if you live in a flat or an open-plan bungalow, but otherwise limiting.Suction power:not stated;robotdimensions:365 x 338 x 106mm (WDH);dockdimensions:364 x 478 x 446mm (WDH); maximum noise level:60dBA;battery life:1 hour 40 minutes;power consumption (charging):23.4WEzviz RE5 PlusView image in fullscreenBest for:big features at a low price£169.99 at AmazonThe RE5 Plus gives you a lot for a budget model, handling the vacuuming and mopping with the aid of a self-emptying base station. It’s smaller than similarly equipped models, though you’ll have to wash the mop pads and refill the water tank yourself.With LiDAR navigation, it’s good at threading its way under your furniture, and it’s quiet, never putting out more than 61dBA. It’s a talkative little robot, with notifications and error messages delivered with a crisp English accent and optional Google and Alexa voice commands.It didn’t make the final cut because …Ezviz isn’t particularly well known for its cleaning products, and the app isn’t all that intuitive, even if there is plenty of control over settings available. The RE5 Plus also had issues getting over rugs, and in the spot vacuuming tests it left a little too much flour and debris on the carpet.Suction power:4,000Pa;robot dimensions:345 x 345 x 95mm (WDH);dock dimensions:220 x 180 x 380mm (WDH);maximum noise level:61dBA;battery life:three hours;power consumption (charging):19.3WWhat you need to knowRobot vacuums fit into two categories: those that just vacuum, and those that mop as well. My advice would be to focus on the vacuum part, and on the ability to suck up dirt and grime. The mopping is good enough to remove surface spills and superficial marks, but it won’t replace yoursteam cleaneror manual mop. What’s more, some of the less flexible mop mechanisms can leave you with a soggy carpet as the robot vacuum makes its way around your floor.Cleaning powerSuction power counts and most manufacturers will specify the maximum suction force for each cleaner in Pascals (Pa) – or air watts (AW) in Dyson’s case. However, it’s not the whole story. Different cleaners will use different combinations of rollers and rotating brushes to whisk dirt and dust off the ground and into the vacuum intake.Some are also noticeably better than others at cleaning near the edges of a room and adjusting their suction power to match the levels of dust with which they have to deal. Most robot vacuums can do multiple passes if they need to, but this obviously adds to the cleaning time.View image in fullscreenBefore (left) and after (right) the Ezviz RE5 Plus tackled the dirty mat.Photograph: Stuart AndrewsNavigation and emptyingThe second key factor is navigation. Robot vacuums use a mix of optical and laser sensors and physical bumpers to make their way around the room, moving past obstacles and making sure they cover every area. More advanced models feature 3D cameras that map the room, giving them a clearer idea of the geography and their exact position within it. Either way, navigation skills vary dramatically, with some cleaners prone to getting lost or confused under your furniture.Vertical navigation skills are just as important, as robot vacuums will probably have to make their way over rugs and low-lying thresholds. Some of the more limber models can push, flip and clamber their way over impediments, while others just get tangled up.Robot vacuums don’t have much space onboard for their dust collector, so they need more regular emptying than the average cordless vacuum. The pricier models work around this by having a larger dust collector or bag in the base station or dock, so that when your robot vacuum puts itself to bed for a recharge, the dock will automatically empty the dust collector and, where necessary, clean the mop head and refill the water tank.Battery life and appsBattery life isn’t a huge deal with modern robot vacuums. Most will easily make it around one floor or more of an average-sized home without a recharge, and they automatically return to base if they’re caught short. However, a larger battery and a more efficient motor can be helpful if you have a bigger space to keep in shape.Onboard controls can be useful when you just want to clean an area quickly, but you’ll spend most of your time managing your robot vacuum from a smartphone app. At the very least, these should have features to customise any room maps, adding zones that need more thorough cleaning and no-go areas where you don’t want the robot vacuum to get stuck.Scheduling features are also very welcome, allowing you to set times when you want your plucky robot to put itself to work. And accessible controls, to change the settings or run quieter at night, can make your new friend even easier to live with.Can robot vacuums clean multiple rooms at a time?They can, though the way this works can vary from model to model. Most robot vacuums navigate and map a whole floor at a time. Once that’s done, you can use the app to label different rooms then send your robot to a given location.Many let you map multiple floors, and you don’t usually need to move the charging station between floors – just carry the unit upstairs or downstairs. If you have any steps between rooms (like I do in my living room), this often needs to be mapped as a separate floor.Even where mapping isn’t supported, you can usually work around it by carrying the robot vacuum into the other space and setting it to clean. It may not clean as efficiently or effectively, but it will navigate the space and get the job done.How do robot vacuums compare to regular vacuum cleaners?As with cordless vacuums, robot vacuums come with a trade-off between size, battery life and suction force. Because they have to trundle around under their own steam for long enough to cover a decent-sized area, this inevitably limits the power of the vacuum motor.Even powerful robot vacuums top out at 65AW (or 6,000 to 8,000Pa) and that’s often in their battery-draining turbo modes. By comparison, some cordless cleaners offer suction levels up to 250AW, and mains-powered vacuums can go even higher.Confusingly, most manufacturers don’t offer the same suction power across their whole range. Irrespective of which model you buy, though, you may still need a manual vacuum cleaner to purge your carpets of pet hair and really stubborn grime.Stuart Andrews is ajournalistwithmore than three decades of experience in computing and consumer tech.

This one is inspired by the green tree snake, which is a gorgeous emerald colour, and the chilli thread garnish imitates its tongue. I definitely knew what this drink would look like long before I developed it, because I found myself leaning towards green flavours that have a great affinity with a smoky, vegetal mezcal. Green pepper and shiso enhance those herbal, peppery notes, while the apple liqueur and manzanilla bring a crisp, sweet fruitiness that rounds things out. I had so much fun with this one that it’s one of my favourite recipes to date.Tree snakeServes1For the mezcal infusion (to serve about 12)2shisoleaves350ml good mezcal– we useMezcal Verde Amarás1 green pepper, stalk, core and pith discarded, flesh finely sliced or choppedFor the drink30mlgreen pepper- and shiso-infused mezcal(see above and method)30ml manzanilla– we usePort of Leith10ml apple liqueur– we useLucky Liqueurs10ml agave syrup– we useBristol Syrup Co’s Nogave1 dash green food colouring(optional)1 pinch red angel hair chilli threads, or a little very finely shredded red chilli, to garnish (optional)To infuse the mezcal, put the shiso and mezcal in a blender, blitz for 10-15 seconds, then pour into a mason jar or similar. Add the sliced pepper, seal and leave to infuse for 48 hours, then strain through coffee filter paper – so long as it’s strained properly, the infused mezcal will have an almost indefinite shelf life, so there’s no need to store it in the fridge.To build the drink, measure the infused mezcal, sherry, apple liqueur and agave syrup into a shaker, add the food colouring, if using, then drop in a big handful of ice and shake hard. Double strain into a rocks glass filled with fresh ice (we use one large cube), garnish with the chilli, if using, and serve.Aidan Rivett, bar manager,Noto, EdinburghExplore more on these topicsCocktailsThe good mixerSpiritsFoodMexican food and drinkBritish food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

That fading sweetness pairs beautifully with the first flush of wild blackberries, however, and this galette makes the most of that overlap: slices of peach and a handful of blackberries sit on a gently sweetened ricotta base that’s flavoured with brown sugar, orange zest and a few sprigs of thyme. The ricotta bakes into something soft and creamy that catches those juices as the fruits slump.Peach, blackberry, ricotta and thyme galetteThis is best served when barely warm, with vanilla ice-cream.Prep15 minChill1 hr+Cook1 hr 20 minServes6-8For the pastry185g plain flour, plus extra for dusting¼ tsp fine sea salt⅛ tsp baking powder120g coldunsalted butter, cubed85g cream cheese1-2tbspdouble cream2 tsp cider vinegarFor the orange ricotta base150g ricotta30g light brown sugarFinely grated zest of 1 orange– save the juice for the peaches1 tsp thyme leaves, finely chopped⅛ tsp fine sea saltFor the peaches2 ripe peaches, halved, stoned and each half cut into 8 wedges2tbsp caster sugar1tbsp cornflour2 tsp orange juice2 tspthyme leaves⅛ tsp fine sea salt100g blackberries, halved if largeTo glaze1 small egg, lightly beaten1tbsp demerara sugarTo make the pastry, put the flour, salt and baking powder in a food processor and pulse a few times to combine and aerate. Add the cubed butter and pulse again until it is broken down into small pieces. Add the cream cheese and pulse until the mix looks like damp and unevenly sized crumbs. Add a tablespoon of the cream and the vinegar, then pulse until the mix just starts to come together into a dough (if it doesn’t, pulse in the second tablespoon of cream). Tip out the pastry on to a lightly floured work surface, gather and press it into one piece, then wrap loosely in clingfilm, press to flatten into a disc and refrigerate for at least an hour, and up to two days.Once chilled, make the ricotta base by mixing all the ingredients in a small bowl. Combine all the ingredients for the peaches except the blackberries in a second bowl, toss gently to combine, then set aside.Heat the oven to 210C (190C fan)/410F/gas 6½. Take the pastry out of the fridge, put it on a large sheet of baking paper, then roll it out evenly into a large, roughly 36-38cm-diameter circle that’s about 2mm thick. Don’t worry if the edges are irregular; that’s all part of the charm of a galette. Lift the baking paper along with the pastry on to a large baking tray, then spread the ricotta mix evenly on top, leaving a 4-5cm border all around the edge.Add the blackberries to the peach bowl, toss gently, then spoon the fruit on top of the ricotta. Carefully draw the border of the pastry up and over the fruit, roughly pleating it as you go and leaving the centre of the galette exposed. Brush the pastry border with egg wash, then sprinkle with the demerara sugar and bake for 40-45 minutes, until golden brown.Leave the galette to rest and cool a little, then slice and serve.Explore more on these topicsCakeThe sweet spotBakingFoodDessertFruitPastryCheeserecipesShareReuse this content"

But with tennis sidelined in favor of awkward small talk, it risks alienating its core supportersOwen LewisFri 29 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 29 Aug 2025 05.01 EDTShareOn the first day of this year’s US Open, Alexandra Eala came back from 5-1 down in the third set to upset Clara Tauson in front of a rapturous crowd, Novak Djokovic rope-a-doped a fresher opponent barely half his age, Rebeka Masarova hit an overhead smash into the only racket-sized area inside the lines that would ensure she lost the point, and Daniil Medvedevall but incited a riotin the stands of Louis Armstrong Stadium while down match point.Amidst the overstimulating slate of matches, the US Open quietly published the first episode of the dating video series Game, Set, Matchmaker on their official YouTube channel. In it, host Ilana Sedaka, a figure skater and influencer, had a blind date with Ronnie, a lacrosse coach. They exchanged bright smiles and music tastes. They bonded over their love of Drake – what were the odds? Though the date took place on US Open grounds with players practicing in the background, very little of the conversation concerned tennis. It is Ronnie’s first time at the US Open: “This place is insane,” he said. Slap it on a poster.“Are you a tennis fan?” Sedaka asked midway through. “I just got, kind of got into it last year,” Ronnie said. At video’s end, Sedaka offered Ronnie a ticket to the US Open so he could join her on a second date. Ironically for a piece presumably intended to generate interest in tennis, it cut off as they walked onto the grounds. The next episode, a charmingly awkward date between influencer Emma and fitness trainer Natalie, featured no tennis talk but 30 seconds or so on the NFL.The videos begged the question of why exactly the US Open had provided the platform. Perthe New York Times, a United States Tennis Association spokesperson’s reasoning for the series was that it is “trying to attract an entirely new audience, reaching fans at the intersection of tennis, pop culture and entertainment”. The trouble is that tennis seems absent in the first two episodes of Game, Set, Matchmaker aside from the backdrop. The videos sputtered to modest viewcounts, outpaced by virtually all of the match highlight reels alongside it on the same channel. It seemed that those who came to the US Open’s channel did so to watch some of the US Open.It’s difficult to imagine anybody becoming a tennis fan on account of these episodes under any circumstances, but the rollout of Game, Set, Matchmaker couldn’t have helped. The episodes’ release schedule wasn’t readily available, and mere days before the pilot dropped, the format changed from a Bachelorette-style series, in which Sedaka would go on dates with different men, to eight distinct couples on their first dates. (Maybe Ronnie proved an unexpected keeper?) But many fans had less of a bone to pick with the format than the idea itself – why was this relevant to a tennis tournament, again? The US Openset a new attendance record in 2024, welcoming more than one million fans through its gates. Tennis participation in the USis spiking. The overall prize pot at the US Open is up 20% from 2024, itself then a record high. Game, Set, Matchmaker implies a lack of faith in a product that by all appearances is doing very well.Game, Set, Matchmaker isn’t the first attempt to find new tennis fans by eschewing the tennis of it all. Break Point, the short-lived tennis Netflix series, was cripplingly reliant on player access and allergic to showing tennis footage from a recognizable angle. An episode in which Carlos Alcaraz defeated Djokovic in a pulsating five-set Wimbledon final bizarrely featured Holger Rune as its protagonist. The show depicted the flow of a match as a trio of momentum swings: one player seized the initiative, mentally floundered, then recovered to seize victory. Forehands and backhands were neglected; tactics may as well not have existed. The show seemed geared more towards convincing viewers to follow various players on social media than to watch them play tennis.As if anticipating their own intense disappointment with Break Point, hardcore fans repeated that they were not the target audience, like a mantra, in the lead-up to its release. This was true; the goal was to create new fans, not comfort existing ones. But too often, this goal is used as an excuse for disappointing existing fans, or presenting a distorted picture of reality. In April, Netflix released an Alcaraz-focused documentary called My Way, presenting his tumultuous 2024 season. Alcaraz won Wimbledon that year when Djokovic netted a backhand return off a second serve. My Way instead depicted match point as a cinematic, hard-hitting rally that ended with Alcaraz demolishing a forehand winner. If Netflix felt it had to embellish the match to the point of misleading the viewer, you wonder why they bothered making the documentary in the first place. Other sports have dabbled in the Netflix treatment, too, in attempts to emulate the wildly successful Drive To Survive. None have matched that success; like Break Point, cycling and rugby docs were canceled.Themixed doubles tournamentpreceding this US Open, too, aimed to capture viewers through means aside from the tennis they played. The Open cannibalized the format with singles stars, forcing out almost all of the doubles specialists who had tailored their skills to the format – and who, unlike top singles players, rely on these tournaments to make a living. But even that wasn’t enough. Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz partnered for the tournament; being young, attractive stars, they were inevitable fodder for fanfiction and shipping. Most would just expect such fantasizing to come from fans, rather than official tournament accounts. The US Open leaned into the partnership, hard, and luckily for them Alcaraz and Raducanu played ball rather than running for the hills. The tactic successfully sacrificed dignity for outsized attention. On one point, against Jack Draper and Jessica Pegula, Raducanu defended a series of attacks only to be passed by a Draper backhand. Thinking the point was over, Raducanu hung her head, and into her peripheral vision raced Alcaraz to rescue the rally with a forehand winner around the net. They laughed delightedly, white teeth flashed. I forwarded such telegenic clips of Alcaraz and Raducanu to my tennis-curious partner, who didn’t watch the tournament but later offered “I ship Emmaraz.” I even caught myself enjoying the pair’s first-round loss.These style-over-substance tactics are often a slap in the face, either to the mixed doubles players who had spent their lives training for and excelling at the format, or to the hardcore fan. They’re also about fame and fandom more than the sport itself. The film Challengers had many virtues and achieved the rare coup of thrusting tennis into mainstream discourse, anddid not shy away from the sport itself. The film returned to the pivotal showdown between two protagonists throughout its runtime, taking care to highlight key moments. We saw the match take shape. We saw the players’ contrasting styles. We saw sweat drip from their bodies. We saw tennis as it was: a prolonged, unpredictable crucible of stress dotted with moments of brilliance. The film ended with players and spectators alike celebrating a particularly spectacular point.Nonfiction tennis is frustratingly resistant to doing the same, despite a dream cast of stars.After years of catastrophizing about a world after Serena Williams and the Big Three, a handful of supernaturally talented successors have fallen into the sport’s lap. Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have taken to playing in the final of every big tournament lately, drawing comparisons to great rivalries of old. Iga Swiatek and Aryna Sabalenka have each enjoyed spells of dominance on the WTA yet have no shortage of talented competitors. When tennis is at its best, people tend to enjoy it. The US Open and other tournaments would do well simply to highlight such instances and do their best to get them in front of as many eyes as possible. If someone isn’t interested in that, tennis probably isn’t for them, and that’s OK, too.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025US Open tennisTennisUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Celine last year launched its first lipstick for £62. Chanel has one in a glass case, inspired by the mirrors that line the stairs in Coco Chanel’s Paris apartment, for £145. Hermès, famed for its multithousand-pound Birkin bag, launched one for £81 in 2020. In 2023, Dior launched a special-edition lipstickpriced at $500.View image in fullscreenDior’s special edition Rouge Premier lipstick is $500 – but it is refillable.Photograph: Marie Rouge/DiorBig fashion brands have been turning to makeup more generally. According to Daniela Morosini, a senior beauty correspondent and special projects editor at The Business of Fashion, “beauty products make lots and lots of money for fashion house brands. The margins are great”.Victoria Beckham is one notable example. The brandbroke the £100m sales markthis week, despite widening operating losses, in a surge that is largely being credited to the strong performance of beauty – in particular a £32 eyeliner, which is reportedly sold once every 30 seconds worldwide.For customers, makeup is a – relatively – accessible way of buying into luxury brands, particularly given the hugely inflated current price of high-end fashion: a Chanel medium Classic Flap bag, for instance, that cost $4,900 in 2015 now costs $10,200.Made from upcycled wax, smooth to apply and with a punchy pigment, the Louis Vuitton lipsticks carry the scent of mimosa, jasmine and rose. The weighty black and gold packaging – the work of the industrial designer Konstantin Grcic – is magnetised, easing the sliding of the LV-embossed lipstick back into its case with a satisfying low click.View image in fullscreenLouis Vuitton’s LV Rouge range.Photograph: Louis Vuitton MalletierThink £120 for a lipstick sounds extortionate? According to Philip Graves, the founder of consumer psychology group Shift Consultancy, “it all depends on your frame of reference … if you’re normally someone who goes into Boots and buys No 7 lipstick, you’re not going to become someone who goes into Louis Vuitton and spends £120 on lipstick.” However, “if you’re someone who goes into Louis Vuitton every now and then and buys yourself a £4,000 bag, now you might go in and go: ‘That lipstick’s fantastic.’ You’ve just, in inverted commas, ‘saved’ yourself over £3,800.” Plus, “it’s probably the cheapest thing in there by some considerable distance. From a consumer psychology point of view, that gives you a framing advantage.”For Morosini, the relative cheapness compared with LV suitcases, say, “does kind of open the aperture to a newer customer”. Louis Vuitton is, after all, the brand that famouslylaunched a $1m handbagin 2023.View image in fullscreenAn LV monogrammed rouge cosmetic lipstick pouch.Photograph: Louis Vuitton MalletierHaving McGrath involved is a boon. “Her signature, at least in beauty and fashion circles, really means something,” said Morosini. Hannah Coates, a beauty, wellness and lifestyle editor and brand consultant, said: “With McGrath at the helm, I expect the formula is excellent quality and the colours flattering on an array of different skin tones.” Although, notably, McGrath’s own makeup line sells lipsticks in Harrods for £27.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While Graves is sceptical of the lipstick index, “not least because the person who coined the term was someone who owned a lipstick company”, as a broad principle “people do find other ways to get a sense of reward when times are hard”.View image in fullscreenLe Rouge lipstick, £62, by CelinePhotograph: CelineIt helps that lipstick is a product you can be seen to use. “For something to have status value, other people have got to see it,” said Graves. “Of course you can go and tell people, but that’s generally not as effective. Much better that you casually take it out and top up your lipstick.”Louis Vuitton’s lipstick is refillable and being framed as an object to keep, which Gabriel thinks is a big part of its appeal. “The refillable lipstick product becomes the product to purchase for its material benefits, while the case carries that symbolic access to the world of luxury that is meant to feel exclusive, exquisite and deeply aspirational.”The packaging is key, as well as the sensory experience of the product. Morosini remembers the New York-based makeup artist Kirsten Kjaer Weis once saying she wanted her brand’s compacts to have a clunk when they shut that sounded like the trunk of a Mercedes-Benz being closed.If some people are outraged by the price of this top-end lippie, that may also be part of the equation. “This pricing strategy, while bold even by luxury standards, also serves the brand’s marketing purposes by driving awareness and generating attention around the product and the brand,” said Gabriel.Explore more on these topicsLouis VuittonMakeupBeautynewsShareReuse this content"

I sat on it in parks, slept under it on people’s sofas. Then, one day, it disappeared ...Sam WollastonFri 29 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTShareIwas 15 when Grandpa died. He was 69, too young, but on the plus side he was doing what he most loved – digging on an archaeological site. We weren’t close in the way I was with Granny; he could be quite scary. But we got along fine and I liked him. Mum said I could help myself from his wardrobe.I had only known him dressed for retirement, in blue workers’ overalls for archaeological digging, or baggy beige shorts for caravanning holidays. But it seemed he had been quite dapper back in the day. I helped myself to collarless shirts and a couple of suits (the best was a silvery-grey mohair one that wouldn’t have looked out of place in Paul Weller’s wardrobe). And this overcoat.It was a proper coat – black, knee-length, heavy, silk-lined – made by Crombie of Aberdeen and worn by statesmen and royals, but also movie stars and pop stars. And now by me. I thought it was cool, and it became more than a coat; it was a place of refuge, a thick new outer layer of protection, against not just the cold but teenage vulnerability and insecurity. Plus, it was a little bit of Grandpa, hard to forget with the faint whiff of pipe smoke that lingered, even after dry cleaning.I’m probably 16 in the photo. You can just make out my Echo & the Bunnymen badge on the lapel; I’d quite liked to have been in Echo & the Bunnymen. I would have been wearing Doc Martens, or maybe my favourite burgundy winkle-pickers. I can still smell the green Country Born gel in my hair. A night out would have required more backcombing for a serious 80s haystack, maybe a little eyeliner. I’m not sure what Grandpa would have made of that.I wore his coat throughout the rest of my teens, sat on it in parks, slept under it on other people’s sofas. And then I guess I decided it wasn’t cool any more, because it disappeared – from photos and from memory.Until the other day, at Mum’s house (which used to be Granny and Grandpa’s house). I went to turn on the immersion heater, and there it was, hanging at the back of the airing cupboard. A little frayed at the edges and coming apart at some of the seams, but aren’t we all. It must be 90 years old now.So I reinherited it. I haven’t worn it much, I don’t really know when to. Both shabby and posh, there now seems something funereal about it. Undertakerly, even. I’ll wear it next time I’m paying my respects. It’s good to have it back though, hanging at the back of my own cupboard, maybe to be discovered by one of my sons – or theirs – somewhere down the line.Explore more on these topicsFashionYoung peoplefeaturesShareReuse this content"

We rented a lakeside cabin (typically they cost from about €100 a night, sleeping two) and watched the midnight sun shimmer across peaceful waters. Days were spent kayaking between uninhabited islets or hiking pine-scented trails, with only the call of black-throated divers (or loons) for company. We visited theLinnansaari national parkon an archipelago in the middle of the vast lake (the largest in Finland and fourth largest freshwater lake in Europe), where encounters with rare Saimaa ringed seals await. It’s nature’s embrace at its purest – remote, quiet and utterly rejuvenating.AnthonyCanyons and forests in MontenegroView image in fullscreenCrno Jezero (Black Lake) in Zabljak, Montenegro.Photograph: Ingram Publishing/AlamyLast autumn, I visitedDurmitor national parkin northern Montenegro, a quiet and beautiful place in the Dinaric Alps. The road there passed through thick pine forests and opened on to wide valleys surrounded by tall, rocky mountains. I walked to the Black Lake (Crno Jezero), where the water was so still it perfectly reflected the autumn colours of the trees. In the hills, shepherds looked after their sheep, and small villages sold fresh cheese and honey. I also gazed down into Tara River Canyon, which is among Europe’s deepest gorges; right at the bottom, several thousand feet below me, I could see the bright turquoise ribbon of the river.Lorna WalkdenProfileReaders' tips: send a tip for a chance to win a £200 voucher for a Coolstays breakShowGuardian Travel readers' tipsEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

Highlights for my teen included taking a ferry to the island of Grímsey to snorkel with puffins while they were diving for fish.Karen GuenzlBrittany’s quiet sideView image in fullscreenCamping in Inguiniel.Photograph: Kevin AtkinsTucked away in western Morbihan, an hour from Vannes and the Breton coast, Inguiniel is a quiet corner of Brittany, where rolling hills and forests invite you to slow down. We stayed at picture-perfectCamping Pont Calleck, which was ideal as a walking and cycling base. From there we cycled to Le Faouët, a town with a pretty square, a 16th-century market hall, and striking gothic chapels. As evening fell, our ride took us along the River Scorff past weirs and watermills and eventually to a quiet auberge for a traditional Breton meal.Kevin AtkinsWinning tip: bathed in constant daylight, Norway’s SvalbardView image in fullscreenSled dogs in Longyearbyen, Svalbard.Photograph: Hanneke Luijting/Getty ImagesThe Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard (which used to be called Spitzbergen) in summer is bathed in constant daylight because it is entirely within the Arctic Circle.Dog sledding on wheelsis a great way to experience this remote landscape, guiding your teams of eager huskies over the tundra, past mountains necklaced with puffy Arctic cottongrass flowers. Boat trips, passing near the town of Barentsburg, the inhabitants of which are mostly Russian, allow closeup views of slumbering walruses, minke whales and dozens of seals. Nearby, huge cliffs at Alkhornet are the breeding ground for thousands of birds, and below the nests, arctic foxes wait patiently for their next meal. Afterwards,rent a floating sauna cabin, leaping into the sea to cool off.CarolineView image in fullscreenExplore more on these topicsTravelReaders' travel tipsTop 10sfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I was coming to the end of my maternity leave with my second child, and had recently retrained from being a wedding cake-maker to a food stylist, something I loved. As well as looking after two kids with my husband, Chris, I was picking up lots of work. I was probably juggling too much, but life was exciting.That week, I’d just finished a big job and was exhausted. I began to notice flashing lights in my vision. I assumed it was a migraine from overworking – I used to get them as a teenager – and didn’t think too much of it.The next day, we left London for the weekend to visit my parents. I woke up that morning and everything felt strange – overwhelmingly bright and vivid, as if someone had plugged an electric current into the world. It was like seeing through static.I mentioned it to my husband and my mum, and they said it was probably a migraine. But the next day it was still there. It made me dizzy, and I started to feel uneasy.A few nights later, as I was putting my son to bed, I couldn’t see his face properly. I started to get really upset. Was I gradually losing my sight? Surely not, at 39? I didn’t have a headache, so it didn’t feel like a migraine.I went to A&E. The eye department said my eyes were fine, so I tried to put it out of my mind.A few days later, I was working in a bright-white studio, and everything felt overwhelming again. I ended up back in A&E. Again, I was told everything was fine, and that it was probably a migraine and would pass.Every night I wake with shaky hands, fuzzy vision and thick fog in my headBut it didn’t. I began writing down my symptoms: intense after-images – bright shapes that lingered long after I looked away – and severe light sensitivity. In the evenings, when the light was low, I felt off-balance walking around. I had tremors in my hands and face, constant visual static and a horrible, thick brain fog.I started to worry it was something serious to do with my brain. I booked a private neurologist, but the first appointment was six weeks away. So I booked an MRI, but it came back clear.I began to second-guess myself. Did people think I was making all of this up? Was I? There was no obvious cause. Just this constant assault on my senses. I felt as if I was losing my mind.Googling my symptoms, I came across something called visual snow syndrome. At first, it sounded like nonsense, this syndrome with a strange name and affecting about2% of the UK population. But every post described what I was experiencing.In April, when I saw the neurologist, she confirmed the diagnosis. There is very little knowledge about it and no known cure. She offered epilepsy medication, but as there was no guarantee it would help, I decided not to take it. The diagnosis was validating, but crushing. No one around me had heard of it. Even most doctors haven’t.I’ve had to adjust my life in many ways. Some days are better than others – it depends on stress or how much sleep I’ve had. I wear sunglasses almost all the time – even indoors – because of the light sensitivity, which makes me feel like a bit of an idiot.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I recently went to a friend’s hen do and the venue had flashing lights, and I burst into tears and had to leave. I remember thinking, “I can’t even hang out with my friends and just feel normal.”My four-year-old is slowly starting to understand. In the mornings, he usually likes to run in and throw open the blinds, but the other day he told Chris to keep them closed, because “Mummy’s eyes might hurt”. It’s devastating. I want to be present, to run around and play with my kids. It affects my sleep, too. I wake in the night, every night, with shaky hands, fuzzy vision and that same foggy heaviness in my head.Experience: I rent out my mohawk as a billboardRead moreI’m looking into a clinical trial at St Thomas’s hospital in London. I’m also considering joining a support group through theVisual Snow Initiativein the US, to not feel so alone.The uncertainty is hardest. Will it ever go away? Will it get worse? And the loneliness of it, because I look fine. I get on with things. I can still do my job. But I’m navigating this constant noise.As told to Emma LoffhagenDo you have an experience to share?

Described byMargaret Thatcheras a “superb chairman”, he took the helm at five major British companies, including British Shipbuilders and British Leyland, before returning to business and academia in his native Canada.In 1970, as an international troubleshooter for the transportation company Canadian Pacific, he found himself supervising the delayed completion of two ships at the strike-torn Cammell Laird shipyard on Merseyside. Day noticed that the pickets went home at night, so he hired tugs and had the ships towed away for completion in Ireland.The Laird group was so impressed that it offered Day the chief executive’s job. In four years, he transformed the yard; and in 1975 the Labour government appointed him chief executive-elect for the soon to be nationalised shipbuilding industry. But Day found no business plan apart from nationalisation, felt his advice went unheeded, and when the bill was delayed for a year, he returned toCanadato lecture in business studies and join Dome Petroleum.When taking over as chairman of British Shipbuilders, he said: 'I had to do a lot of things that should have been done before'Seven years and two unsuccessful chairmen later, Day, with his trademark mutton-chop whiskers now grown into a full Mephistophelian beard, was summoned back by the Thatcher government to be chairman and chief executive of British Shipbuilders. It was tough. Even the tight-lipped Day conceded: “I had to do a lot of things that should have been done before.”An overdue “survival plan”, tying pay increases to productivity, was predictable, but his solution to the seemingly inevitable closure of the Scott Lithgow company on the Clyde, after its repeated failure to complete an oil rig, was a surprise. Refusing to accept closure, he sought and found a commercial buyer in the Trafalgar House conglomerate.His method was characteristically resourceful. He criss-crossed Asia seeking orders, commissioning videos of satisfied customers praising yards, while grinding down on costs and numbers. But it was uphill work against a shipbuilding recession and a government intent on privatising. Day was criticised for acquiescing, against his own judgment, in the privatisation not only of the profitable warship yards but of the mixed yards, which also built merchant ships.A man of clearcut, almost puritan, beliefs and frequent aphorisms – “I never lie and I never bluff” – he explained that he treated the government as shareholder. He could make a case, but once the decision was taken, he could either accede or leave – with his mouth shut. This time he stayed.Day’s appeal to both public and private industry lay in a clarity and certainty of mind that could line up the options without emotion and self-regard. Though aware of his worth – at British Shipbuilders he was the highest paid nationalised industry chairman – he lacked self-importance and in private was frank and generous. He was remarkably free of the political baggage of his fellow nationalised industry chairmen, right or left. When he described himself as “a hired hand”, it was only partly a joke.His methods appealed to Thatcher. In turn, Day described her as the best boss he had ever had. “Once you agree with her, she is totally supportive,” he said. Even so, it was a surprise when he was asked to take over the perpetually ailing British Leyland in 1986, after US bids to break it up had been rejected.When I asked him if there was a role for a British motor company, he replied with typical frankness: I don’t knowHe agreed clear objectives with Thatcher – stop haemorrhaging money, become profitable, return the company to the private sector. When I asked him soon afterwards if there was a role for a British motor company, he replied with typical frankness: “I don’t know. We have to demonstrate that we can perform better, and then the answer moves to maybe. If we can consolidate that, then maybe moves to yes.”Astonished by the bureaucracy, he cut paperwork and 10% of white-collar staff. He played tough – sacking top managers whom he saw as disloyal ,and dealing with British Leyland’s notoriously leaky culture by making it clear that those responsible would be sacked. But he also tried to build morale, with less of a command and control culture, encouraging younger managers to speak up, discussing clear objectives and dispatching a top manager around the company’s embittered suppliers to talk of partnership. He encouraged team-working on the shopfloor.As a salesman, he was staggered to find little marketing and product research. Changing the group’s name in 1986 toRover, with its quality association, he targeted a range of new models. Noting the popularity of the Mini when he visited Paris, he revoked the plan to end production and successfully rejuvenated it, while huge resources were put into the new Rover 200 series to establish a reputation for quality and good value, even if it trimmed margins.Sales improved, but he still closed plants and sold the entire trucks division to the Dutch company DAF. Helped by a debt write-off, Rover had returned to precarious profitability by 1988, when, again to general surprise, Day achieved his third target, when British Aerospace agreed to buy Rover and take it private again.Mission in some sense accomplished. But though more of Shipbuilders and Rover eventually survived than might have, Day was essentially appointed too late in both cases and was able to pluck only limited triumphs out of inevitable disaster.View image in fullscreenSir Graham Day, left, as retiring chairman of Powergen in 1993, with his successor, Sir Colin Southgate, at the firm’s AGM in Birmingham.Photograph: PA Images/AlamySubsequently, invitations from private industry came thick and fast. Day sat on the British Aerospace board, taking over briefly (1991-92) when it ousted the chairman,Sir Roland Smith. He also succeeded at PowerGen (1990-93) when the chairman left suddenly before flotation. But it was his own considered choice to become chairman of Cadbury Schweppes (1989-93), where Quaker values chimed with his own and where he confessed his liking for Bournville – its plainest chocolate. “This is a planned move for the balance of my working life. I have been throwing snowballs long enough.” Day was knighted in 1989, and in 2014 was made an officer of the Order of Canada.He was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the son of Edythe (nee Baker) and Frank Day, who ran a gift shop. Frank, a former clerk in the city of London, had emigrated from Leytonstone, then in Essex – and Day was inclined to say, when taking another difficult UK assignment, that his father would have liked him to do so. After Queen Elizabeth high school in Halifax, he financed his law degree at the local Dalhousie University by working as a shoe salesman, and as a singer and producer on local television, where he claimed to have discovered the country and pop singerAnne Murray. He continued to broadcast during eight years of private law practice, before joining Canadian Pacific as a corporate lawyer in 1964.Decisive as always, he had pencilled retirement into his diary for his 60th birthday in 1993. He and his wife, Ann, returned that year to Canada, where he continued in his legal practice and taught at Dalhousie, of which he became chancellor. Among other business interests, he was a director of the Bank of Nova Scotia until 2004.He married Ann Leighton in 1958, and she survives him, along with their daughters, Deborah and Donna, and a son, Michael.Judson Graham Day, businessman, born 3 May 1933; died 31 July 2025Explore more on these topicsBusinessShipping industryAutomotive industryRoverCadburyMargaret ThatcherCanadaobituariesShareReuse this content"

Seventeen survivors were pulled from the water by one of the coastguard’s patrols.Thousands of would-be migrants have died in recent years during the dangerous maritime passage between Africa and Europe. According to the International Organisation forMigration(IOM), at least 8,938 people died in 2024 attempting to cross borders.Travellers who pass through Mauritania usually come from neighbouring countries including Senegal and Mali, and are trying to reach Europe. But strong ocean currents and the fragile condition of the vessels make the long crossing perilous. Some people also try to go through the Sahara, which comprises 90% of Mauritanian territory, braving temperatures above 45C.Human Rights Watch has reported abuses of migrants by Mauritanian security officials.In a 142-page report released on Wednesday, HRW said it had documented “police use of prolonged, painful restraints, limited food and water, and other mistreatment” in a crackdown funded since 2024 by a €210m (£182m) deal with the EU.Authorities in Nouakchott have not yet responded to the report, which has caused debate in government and humanitarian circles this week.Explore more on these topicsMauritaniaMigrationAfricaSenegalThe GambianewsShareReuse this content"

We are so deeply grateful to everyone, in Haiti and internationally, who has worked tirelessly over these terrible weeks to help secure their safe return,” her family said in a statement.Simon Harris, Ireland’s tánaiste (deputy prime minister), celebrated the end of their “terrible ordeal” ina statementon social media. “We warmly welcome the news that Gena and all of the Haitian nationals taken captive on August 3, including a small child, have been released and are reported to be safe and well,” Harris said.“This has, of course, been an extraordinarily difficult and stressful situation for the Heraty family. I wish to pay tribute to their resilience and determination to support Gena and her fellow captives over these past difficult weeks,” Harris added, calling Heraty “a respected humanitarian and deeply courageous person who has dedicated her life to supporting the most vulnerable people in Haiti”.‘Haitians are kidnapped every day’: missionary abductions shed light on growing crisisRead moreHeraty had reportedly been living in Haiti for 32 years and had been responsible for about 270 children at the orphanage in Kenscoff.Haiti has been thrust into a seemingly interminable spiral of violence since February last year when politically connected and heavily armed gangs launched a coordinated uprising against the government. Criminal groups now control virtually the entire capital and a UN-backed policing mission has failed to stop gang foot-soldiers rampaging across the Caribbean city.The situation has become so dire that authorities have resorted tousing armed dronesandrecruiting foreign mercenariesin an attempt to win back control of the city.Ireland’s department of foreign affairs strongly advises its citizens not to visit the Caribbean country as a result of the “extremely volatile” security situation. “There are frequent clashes between gangs and security forces. Kidnappings, robberies, and violent crime are prevalent,” its website warns.According tothe Irish Independent, Heraty’s group was abducted after armed attackers stormed the building at about 3.30am on a Sunday morning.“They broke through a wall to enter the property before heading to the building where the director was staying, leaving with nine hostages,” the local mayor said at the time.Some reportsclaimed the kidnappers were part of Viv Ansanm (Live Together), the criminal coalition which rose up last year, plunging Haiti’s capital into chaos.Explore more on these topicsHaitiAmericasIrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

Roberge said the government would introduce legislation in the fall.The announcement follows public statements from Quebec’s premier, François Legault, who expressed mounting frustration over public prayers in the province’s largest city, Montreal.“To see people praying in the street, in public parks, this is not something we want in Quebec,” he said last year. “When you want to pray, you go in a church or a mosque, not in a public place.”For more than half a year, the group Montreal4Palestine has organized Sunday protests outside the city’s Notre-Dame Basilica that include public prayer. The demonstrations have also prompted counterprotests.Legault’s governing Coalition Avenir Québec has made secularism a key legislative priority,passing the controversial Bill 21 in 2019.That law, which runs afoul of both Quebec’s charter of human rights and freedoms and Canada’s charter of rights and freedoms, bars judges, police officers, prison guards and teachers from wearing religious symbols while at work. Other public workers such as bus drivers, doctors and social workers must only keep their faces uncovered.In 2021, Quebec’s superior court upheld the statute despite a finding that the law violates thefreedom of expressionandreligionof religious minorities. Governments in Canada can pass laws that breaches certain fundamental rights if they use a legal mechanism known as a the “notwithstanding clause”.It is unclear if the province would once again invoke the clause when passing legislation on public prayer.The Canadian Muslim Forum said the provincial government should be focusing on “real problems, not policing the fundamental rights of its citizens” instead of putting in place policies that would “stigmatize communities, fuel exclusion, and undermine Quebec’s social cohesion”.The push to ban public prayer follows a detailed report by the province’s independent committee studying how to strengthen secularism. Among the 50 recommendations, the committee suggested extending the religious symbols ban to daycare workers. Notably, the report did not call for a province-wide ban on public prayer and new tools to protect universities from being compelled to install prayer rooms. Instead, it found municipalities already have the “necessary competences” to enforce rules surrounding street prayer.The Canadian Civil Liberties Association said banning prayer in public spaces would infringe on freedom of religion, freedom of expression, freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of association.‘It shut all my doors’: how a Quebec law banning religious symbols derails women’s careersRead more“Suppressing peaceful religious expression, individually or communally, under the guise of secularism not only marginalizes faith-based communities but also undermines principles of inclusion, dignity and equality,” said Harini Sivalingam, director of equality program at the Canadian Civil Liberties Association.Despite the outrage from civil rights and advocacy groups, the move has support from other political leaders.The Parti Québécois leader, Paul St-Pierre Plamondon, whose party is leading in public polling, called public prayers an “appropriation of public space by religious fundamentalists” and pledged to hold an internal referendum to determine his party’s formal position on the issue.Still, the issue is likely to once again revive fierce debate over the scope and reach of the government’s focus on secularism.“Let us be clear here: it is not prayers in public places that are disturbing; Catholics have been praying in public for decades and no one has ever protested, even though Quebecers have thrown religion in the trash,” André Pratte, a former journalist and senator,posted on X. “No, what is disturbing is Muslims who pray, in the same way that the ban on religious signs was really aimed only at the Muslim headscarf.”Pratte said there was “no need for a new legislative arsenal that will make a religious practice disappear from public space” and that the latest push reflected an unpopular government “desperately trying to regain points in public opinion”.Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The military was deployed in some areas, footage broadcast by local media showed.Drivers, students and Indonesians from other walks of life gathered outside the country’s parliament and police headquarters in Jakarta to protest on Friday, throwing rocks at the gates and chanting: “Killer. Killer.”One of the protesters, Pendi Nasir, a 43-year-old motorcycle driver, called for the police to conduct a transparent investigation into the death of the driver, Affan Kurniawan. “We don’t want our colleagues here to become victims of this riot again,” he told Reuters, urging action against those at fault.View image in fullscreenA student attacks a police car during the protests in Jakarta.Photograph: Tatan Syuflana/APThe standup comedian Aci Resti attended a protest at the parliament against the housing allowance for lawmakers. “I’m here to voice the opinions of my friends, who are fed up with everything, with the members of the House of Representatives, with everything, with the government,” she said.Protesters were undeterred by the earlier remarks of Prabowo, the country’s president, who called for calm, expressed condolences for Kurniawan’s death and ordered a thorough investigation.“I am shocked and disappointed by the excessive actions of the officers,” Prabowo said in a video message. “I have ordered a thorough and transparent investigation … and officers involved must be held accountable.”View image in fullscreenA car burns outside a police headquarters in Jakarta.Photograph: Bagus Indahono/EPADrivers wearing their signature green jackets also staged protests in other cities, including Surabaya and Bandung on Java island, and Gorontalo on the island of Sulawesi.Amid the unrest, the rupiah closed 0.9% weaker against the US dollar, at 16,495. The stock index fell by as much as 2.3% to hit its lowest point since 12 August, before closing 1.5% down after recovering some of its losses on Friday.“If Prabowo isn’t careful … protests may devolve into chaos,” Made Supriatma, a visiting fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, told Reuters.As Thursday’s protest persisted into the night, local media reported that riot police fired teargas and used water cannon to try to disperse people.The capital’s police chief, Asep Edi Suheri, said that during the clashes on Thursday an armoured police vehicle had hit and killed Kurniawan, who worked for the ride-sharing services Gojek and Grab. He apologised to Kurniawan’s family.View image in fullscreenPolice officers fire teargas during clashes with protesters in Jakarta.Photograph: Mast Irham/EPAIn Prabowo’s Indonesia, the military is quietly creeping back into civilian lifeRead moreA motorcycle drivers’ association said Kurniawan was not involved in the protests.On Friday afternoon, the national police official Abdul Karim told reporters that authorities would detain for 20 days the seven police officers who were in the vehicle that hit Kurniawan for a breach of ethics and said questioning was taking place.After Kurniawan’s death, a group led by motorcycle drivers protested in front of the riot police’s headquarters on Thursday night and on Friday, local media reported.Kurniawan’s funeral was attended by hundreds of fellow ride-sharing motorcycle drivers, who escorted his body to the burial site in a convoy of two-wheelers through the centre of Jakarta.“We are deeply disappointed, especially with the security officials and national police chief,” Ari Potret, a driver who attended Kurniawan’s funeral, told Reuters. “This is barbaric.”Jakarta Legal Aid urged the government to release 600 people who had been arrested during the demonstrations.Explore more on these topicsIndonesiaProtestAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The 39-year-oldhad already been suspendedfrom her duties on 1 July after a recording was leaked of the phone conversation, in which they discussed a simmering border dispute between the neighbouring countries.Critics accused her of failing to protect Thailand’s interests during the call, in which she addressed Hun Sen as “uncle”, and told him that if there were anything he wanted, she would “take care of it”. She also made critical remarks about a senior Thai military commander.The court said Paetongtarn had put her private interests before those of the nation and damaged the reputation of the country. “Due to a personal relationship that appeared aligned with Cambodia, the respondent was consistently willing to comply with or act in accordance with the wishes of the Cambodian side,” the court said in a statement.Paetongtarn, the daughter of the billionaire former Thai leaderThaksin Shinawatra, had apologised for her comments, describing them as a negotiating tactic.Speaking to media after the verdict, Paetongtarn said she accepted the judgment, but added: “I never asked for anything for my own benefit … the most important thing I have always upheld is the lives of our people, whether military or civilian. I am truly determined to protect their lives.“As a Thai, I love my nation, religion, and monarchy with all my heart, as much as any Thai can.”Weeks after the recording was leaked, the border dispute erupted into afive-day conflictin which dozens of people were killed and hundreds of thousands displaced.Anger over the phone call, and Paetongtarn’s handling of the border crisis, has been exacerbated by a perception that herfamily’s personal relationship with Hun Sen– an old friend turned foe – was undermining Thailand’s response to the border crisis.A full version of the recording was published by Hun Sen, who later threatened to release further compromising information about Paetongtarn’s father, Thaksin. Hun Sen is known to have been an old friend of Thaskin’s, though, for unknown reasons, abitter feud eruptedbetween the two men earlier this year.After the phone call was released, thousands ofprotesters took to the streets of Bangkok, demanding Paetongtarn’s resignation and calling her a traitor.Friday’s verdict is a major blow for the Shinawatra family, which has dominated Thai politics for decades.Paetongtarn is the fourth member of her family to have their term cut short either by a military coup or court ruling. Thaksin was ousted in a military coup in 2006, while in 2008 Thaksin’s brother-in-law Somchai Wongsawat, who was prime minister briefly, was also forced from power by a court ruling. In 2014, Thaksin’s sister Yingluck was ousted by a court decision followed by a military coup.Paetongtarn took office last year after her predecessor, Srettha Thavisin, also from Thaksin’s party, Pheu Thai, was removed from office over a separate ethics case.Referencing Thailand’s courts’ frequent interventions in politics, Paetongtarn said: “Today’s judgment is once again changing politics abruptly. We must all work together, whether in government or opposition, we must unite to restore our political stability … to prevent such sudden changes from happening again.”The Shinawatra family has been locked in a power struggle with the military royalist establishment for decades, but Thaksin has remained influential even after years in exile. However, many analysts believe his family’s power is now significantly dented, with public support diminished and no clear successor.It is unclear who might take over as prime minister. Under the Thai constitution, only individuals who were nominated by their parties as prime ministerial candidates at the last general election are eligible for the office.Two of Thaksin’s Pheu Thai party’s prime minsiterial nominees – Srettha and Paetongtarn – have now been ousted, and the party will face an uphill battle trying to gather enough support for their third nominee, Chaikasem Nitisiri, 77, and hold together its fragile coalition. Deputy prime minister Phumtham Wechayachai will oversee the government in a caretaker capacity until the office is filled.Thailand former PM cleared of royal insult charge but Shinawatra dynasty’s fate still hangs in balanceRead moreDr Punchada Sirivunnabood, professor at the Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities, Mahidol University, said an election could be held as early as April next year.Thaksin would probably try to launch a comeback, Sirivunnabood said, but added it was unlikely to be successful. A deal after the last election with its longstanding enemies from military-linked parties had helped Pheu Thai take power, but at the expense of a popular and youthful pro-reform party. Pheu Thai had also failed to deliver on its election pledges, especially in relation to the economy, said Sirivunnabood. “People who supported him have switched to other political parties,” she added.Explore more on these topicsThailandAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

They plan to discuss US-Taiwan relations, regional security and trade and investment, according to the American Institute inTaiwan, Washington’s de facto embassy in lieu of formal diplomatic relations with the self-governing island democracy.Upon arrival, Wicker said: “A thriving democracy is never fully assured … and we’re here to talk to our friends and allies in Taiwan about what we’re doing to enhance worldwide peace.”Wicker told Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, during a meeting at the presidential office in Taipei, that he and Fischer were visiting to get a better understanding of Taiwan’s needs and concerns.Trump says Xi told him China will not invade Taiwan while he is in officeRead more“We come here from the United States bringing a message from the Congress of commitment, of long-term friendship and a determination that a free country like Taiwan absolutely has the right to remain free and preserve self-determination,” Wicker said.“At a time of global unrest, it is extremely significant for us to be here,” Fischer added, noting that discussions would include “security, opportunities and progress for this part of the world”.The Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun protested against the visit by the twoRepublicans, saying it “undermines China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and sends a gravely wrong signal to the separatist Taiwan independence forces”.The US is Taiwan’s largest supplier of arms. It provides the island with the latest-generation tanks, air defence missiles and upgraded F-16 jet fighters as part of its guarantee of security against Beijing’s threat to invade.China considers the US supply of arms to Taiwan a violation of commitments made to it by previous White House administrations.But US-Taiwan ties have been strained since Donald Trump took office and launched a global trade war while also pressing governments in Europe and elsewhere to spend more on their own defence.The Trump administration reportedly denied permission forLai to stop over in New Yorkas part of a planned official trip to Latin America this month after Beijing objected.

It is the first confirmed sighting of Phillips in a year.The footage, captured in the early hours of Wednesday at Piopio Superette, a small store in the North Island, shows a masked man and child examining windows before sparks fly as they appear to cut their way in with a power tool. They then load groceries on to a quad bike and drive away.Saunders said the pair spent 13 minutes at the scene.“We believe the pair in this footage are Tom and one of his children,” he said. “We’re appealing for information from anyone who might have seen the quad bike travelling or parked between Piopio and Marokopa in the early hours of Wednesday morning.”MapPolice said Phillips and one of his children are believed to have unsuccessfully targeted the store in November 2023.Phillipsdisappearedwith his children – now aged 12, 10 and nine – from their Marokopa family farm in December 2021.He does not have legal custody of the children, and police believe the family has been living in the Waikato’s King Country bush and allege he has been receiving outside help with supplies and to evade discovery.In May 2023, police linked Phillips to a robbery at an ANZ bank in Te Kūiti, where two armed people demanded cash before fleeing on a motorbike.A warrant was later issued for his arrest. He faces a string of charges, including aggravated robbery, aggravated wounding and unlawful possession of a firearm.The most recent sighting before this week was in October 2024, whenpig hunters filmed a man followed by three childrenin camouflage clothing carrying large backpacks in remote Marokopa farmland. That prompted a large land and air search, which was called off after three days.Phillips’ family have repeatedly urged him to come forward.His sister made anew appeal earlier this month, reiterating the family was still willing to help him, after attempts to contact him were met with silence. The children’s mother previously told the New Zealand Herald she was “relieved” to learn they were still alive in 2024.Police said their focus remained the children’s welfare.“At the heart of this are three children who have been away from their home for four years,” Saunders said.An $80,000 reward for information on the family’s whereabouts was announced in June 2024 but has since expired.Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The legislation would also create a national environmental protection agency (EPA).But the details of the overhaul, the EPA’s design and the government’s planned path to get the changes through parliament – whether with the support of the Coalition or the Greens – are yet to be revealed. Government reviews have repeatedlyfound the existing laws are failing nature.Labor greenlights contentious Robbins Island windfarm despite fears for endangered orange-bellied parrotRead moreSpeaking on Friday, Watt said the government supported the “concept of no-go zones” as a “good way to help deliver the fast ‘yeses’ and fast ‘nos’ that businesses are looking for”. “Of course, more than anything, it delivers greater environmental protection by establishing at the very beginning of a process areas where activity cannot happen,” he told Guardian Australia.Watt confirmed the government would drop the “nature positive” name that his predecessor, Tanya Plibersek, used to describe her plan to revamp the EPBC Act in the last parliamentary term. Under this label, Plibersek was on the brink of a deal with the crossbench last year to create an EPA before the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, intervened to scupper the agreement after industry pressure from Western Australia.Internationally, nature positive has been defined ashalting and reversing nature loss by 2030 measured against a 2020 baselineand achieving “full recovery” by 2050. It would require retaining existing natural ecosystems and restoration work on damaged and lost nature areas.Watt said the government was dropping the term because his experience suggested people did not understand what it meant, but had not abandoned the idea. “We need to communicate these concepts in ways that the average person relates to, but we absolutely remain committed to the principle of not just protecting and reducing environmental damage, but restoring our environment. That will be a central principle in the reforms,” he said.Watt was applauded by industry but criticised by some conservationists on Friday forapproving the Robbins Island windfarmin north-western Tasmania. Birdlife Australia had called for the area to be declared a “no-go site” due to its importance as a feeding site for migratory shorebirds, and for the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot and the endangered Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The conditions included conducting parrot surveys for three years before construction can begin, and developing and implementing a plan to evaluate and manage the risk of birds colliding with turbines.Watt said Australia needed more renewable energy and dismissed objections from the former Greens leader Bob Brown, a sharp critic of the Robbins Island development, arguing he opposed “any major development that is sought to occur in Tasmania”.Christine Milne, another former Greens leader and a patron of the Bob Brown Foundation, said “of course” the country needed more renewable energy, but the environmental impact of the Robbins Island windfarm on birds and Tasmanian devils would be too great. She said she had “zero confidence” in the conditions Watt had imposed on the project.“This is a disaster for the Tasmanian environment and for threatened species,” she said.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentTasmaniaAustralian politicsRenewable energyBirdsnewsShareReuse this content"

The jury failed to reach a verdict on the third after beginning their deliberations on Thursday.He was granted bail despite the prosecution seeking he go into custody given the seriousness of the offences.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ukraine’s president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said eight people were still missing and 53 had been injured. “When instead of diplomacy, Russia chooses ballistics … the world must respond accordingly,” he said, urging western allies to impose further sanctions.Separately, the Ukrainian leader said Russia was massing a force of 100,000 troops near the eastern Ukrainiancity of Pokrovsk. “There is a buildup and concentration of the enemy there. Up to 100,000 – that’s what we have as of this morning. They are preparing offensive actions,” Zelenskyy said.The Guardian view on Russia’s strike on Kyiv: Putin is testing Trump’s will and Europe’s resolve | EditorialRead moreEurope’s high representative for foreign affairs, Kaja Kallas, responding to the attacks on Kyiv, issueda statementaccusing Russia of disregard for international law and of undermining peace efforts.“Intentional attacks against civilians and non-military objectives are war crimes,” he said. “These crimes only reinforce our determination and resolve to supportUkraineand its people in their defence against Russia and their pursuit of a comprehensive, just and lasting peace.”The statement was endorsed by the UK and all EU member states except Hungary, which is led by Putin’s ally Viktor Orbán, who has long denigrated Ukraine andsought to block EU aidto the country.The latest attackson the Ukrainian capitalwere the deadliest sinceDonald Trump met Putin in Alaskafor an inconclusive summit, where he laid out the red carpet for the Russian leader, who has been indicted for war crimes.Trump has indicated he wants a bilateral meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy, but while the Ukrainian leader has shown his readiness,the Kremlin has held back.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said Putin would have “played” Trump if he refused to meet Zelenskyy. After Macron hosted the German leader, Friedrich Merz, in the south of France, France and Germany pledged to increase air defence to Ukraine.In a joint statement, the key EU countries said: “Despite intensive international diplomatic efforts,Russiashows no intention to end its war of aggression against Ukraine.”Kallas said the latest attacks showed “that Putin is just mocking any kind of peace efforts that are made. So what we have to do is increase pressure on Russia and this is really what they understand.”After the deadly strike in the early hours of Thursday morning, the EU has vowed to introduce a further round of sanctions against Russia – the 19th since the full-scale invasion began in 2022 – increase military aid for Ukraine, and discuss seizing €210bn of Russian assets frozen in the bloc.Lithuania’s defence minister, Dovilė Šakalienė, said hopes of peace negotiations were “at least naive” and Putin was “cheaply buying time to kill more people”. She praised efforts to secure peace, saying that “nobody [had] thought of anything better than [what] Washington is doing”.Colm McGivern, the director of the British Council in Ukraine, said Thursday’s airstrikes had injured a security guard and made the cultural organisation’s Kyiv headquarters “unusable”.While there is no evidence the council was deliberately targeted, McGivern said, “what I do know is that Russia has targeted educational and cultural infrastructure in Ukraine repeatedly”.A neighbouring building in the city centre was struck at 5.40am and the blast-wave from the explosion blew out the British Council’s windows, destroyed its ceilings and wrecked its computers, the director said.Russian missiles will not stop our support for Ukraine – the British Council’s vital work goes on | Scott McDonaldRead moreMcGivern said that the 120 staff of the unit, 119 of whom are Ukrainian, had vowed to continue with the British Council’s cultural activities. “It was another night where Ukraine has been subject to a barbaric attack,” McGivern said. “There is a palpable level of anger, and colleagues are more determined than ever to do all they can, to act on the things they can control, which is strengthen the relationship with the UK.”EU defence ministers meeting in Copenhagen discussed security guarantees for Ukraine, amid US pressure on European allies to shoulder more responsibility for the security of the continent.Kallas wants to reorganise an EU troop-training mission so Ukrainian soldiers could receive instruction inside Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire. The EU has said about 80,000 Ukrainian troops have taken part in the training programme since 2022.The latest Russian attacks have intensified calls to use Russia’s frozen assets in Europe as leverage over Putin and to help Ukraine in its defence.Šakalienė expressed support for seizing Russia’s frozen assets and giving them to Ukraine, saying they would be “extremely helpful” for Ukraine’s defence industry and “very good motivation for Putin to sit at the negotiations table”.The EU has an agreement touse the windfall profits on Russian assets for Ukrainebut has balked at seizing the capital, which ismostly held at Euroclear in Belgium, fearing weakening investor confidence in eurozone financial institutions.EU foreign ministers are to discuss using Russia’s frozen assets at a separate meeting with Kallas on Saturday.After the attacks on Thursday, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said that the EU was “advancing the work on the Russian frozen assets to contribute to Ukraine’s defence and reconstruction”. A spokesperson later said she was referring to use of the profits, which have generated €9bn in funds for Ukraine in 2025, rather than the assets.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionRussiaEuropeUkraineVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyynewsShareReuse this content"

Dozens of women have come forward to file complaints about Phica and similar platforms since thescandal was exposed this week by several prominent women.“I am disgusted by what has happened,” Meloni toldCorriere della Seraon Friday. “I want to extend my solidarity and support to all the women who have been offended, insulted and violated.”She added: “It is disheartening to note that in 2025, there are still those who consider it normal and legitimate to trample on a woman’s dignity and target her with sexist and vulgar insults, hiding behind anonymity or a keyboard.”Last week Meta closed down an Italian Facebook account calledMia Moglie(My wife) on which men exchanged intimate photos of their wives or unknown women.Phica, which is a misspelt play on a slang word for vagina in Italian, was launched in 2005 and appears to have operated unhindered despite women reporting the platform.

A wave of strikes could be heard from the city centre after 3am and again, more loudly, shortly after 5.30am. Officials reported impacts at more than 20 locations around Kyiv. A further 38 people were wounded.Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said the strikes threatened the US president’s proposals to end the war. “These egregious attacks threaten the peace that [Trump] is pursuing,” Kellogg said on social media, noting that they hit “innocent civilians” and EU and British missions in the Ukrainian capital.Trump was unhappy but “not surprised” at the attack, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, while urging “both sides” to end the war.The Foreign Office in London summoned Russia’s ambassador to the UK, Andrey Kelin, at 1pm, in direct response to the severe damage inflicted on the building, government sources said.“Putin’s strikes last night killed civilians, destroyed homes and damaged buildings, including the British Council and EU Delegation in Kyiv,” the foreign secretary, David Lammy, posted on X.“We have summoned the Russian ambassador. The killing and destruction must stop.”The prime minister, Keir Starmer, condemned the attacks as “senseless” and accused Russia of “sabotaging hopes of peace”.Photos circulated by the British Council showed the building with its windows and entrance smashed open and surrounded by glass and debris. Separate pictures released by theEuropean Commissionshowed wrecked office interiors with collapsed ceiling panels and shattered glass doors and windows.View image in fullscreenDamage to the EU offices in Kyiv.Photograph: EU delegation in Ukraine/AFP/Getty ImagesWhile the British Council’s offices suffered significant damage, they are not believed to have been directly hit by Russian strikes, but struck by shrapnel. A guard who was injured was “shaken but stable”, Scott McDonald, the British Council chief executive, said.0:57Kyiv resident films moments after missile hits residential building – videoThe offices of the EU delegation were “severely damaged by the shock wave” from the blast, Katarína Mathernová, the EU ambassador to Ukraine, said.The Ukrainian president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said the onslaught showed that Russia had no intention of negotiating an end to the war. “These Russian missiles and attack drones today are a clear response to everyone in the world who, for weeks and months, has been calling for a ceasefire and for real diplomacy,” the president said on social media. “Russia chooses ballistics instead of the negotiating table.”Aerial bombardment of Kyiv had been relatively muted during August, when Trump made a failed attempt to bring about an end to the war by meeting Putin in Alaska.But the overnight attack indicated Russia was ready to return to its deadly campaign of bombing cities, even though Trump has previously complained about such attacks and threatened to impose sanctions on Russian oil if they continued.The attack included 11 ballistic missiles, 20 Kh-101 cruise missiles and 598 Shahed and decoy drones. A large proportion were intercepted or jammed, but three high-speed ballistic missiles, one Kinzhal and two Iskanders, as well as two cruise missiles were not stopped, according to the air force data.A wave of strikes could be heard from the city centre after 3am and again, more loudly, shortly after 5.30am. Officials reported impacts at more than 20 locations around Kyiv. A further 38 people were wounded in the attacks, officials added.Trump has been hoping to set up a meeting between Vladimir Putin and Zelenskyy after he met Putin in Alaska two weeks ago and Zelenskyy days later in Washington.The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said that there would “obviously” be no such meeting.The Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, said it was evident Moscow had no interest in negotiating an end to the war. “The intense attacks on Kyiv last night demonstrate who stands on the side of peace and who has no intention of believing in the negotiating path,” she said.The Kremlin said on Thursday it was “still interested” in diplomacy but would continue to launch strikes on Ukraine.The European Commission president,Ursula von der Leyen, said in a statement the strikes “shows that the Kremlin will stop at nothing to terrorise Ukraine, blindly killing civilians – men, women and children and even targeting the European Union”.Kaja Kallas, the EU foreign policy chief, said on X: “The overnight attack on Kyiv shows a deliberate choice to escalate and mock the peace efforts.”In a separate post, she added: “No diplomatic mission should ever be a target.”EU officials said two missiles landed within 50 metres of the building within 20 seconds.The British Council’s offices are seen as a representation of Britain’s soft power in Ukraine. For the last 30 years the organisation has worked as a bridge between London and Kyiv, offering academic links, arts programmes and English courses.Starmer said on X: “My thoughts are with all those affected by the senseless Russian strikes on Kyiv which have damaged the British Council building.“Putin is killing children and civilians, and sabotaging hopes of peace. This bloodshed must end.”A spokesperson for the British Council said: “Following last night’s attack, our British Council office in Kyiv has been severely damaged and will remain closed to the public until further notice.“Thankfully, our colleagues are all safe and our work with our Ukrainian partners in education and culture will continue uninterrupted.”Von der Leyen has said the European Commission would soon propose a further package of “hard-biting sanctions” against Russia, the 19th since the full-scale invasion began in February 2022.Last week, the Foreign Office minister Stephen Doughty unveiled sanctions against eight organisations and individuals to “keep the pressure on” Putin, who he claimed was exploiting “dodgy crypto networks”.Russia in return sanctioned 21 individuals including the former MP Denis MacShane, several journalists and the government’s independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, Jonathan Hall.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyRussiaUkraineEuropeEuropean UnionEuropean CommissionUrsula von der LeyennewsShareReuse this content"

In London, the number of SUVs has increased from about 80,000 in 2002 to about 800,000 in 2023.Campaigners are calling forParis-style parking chargesto be applied to major cities including London, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Leeds, Liverpool and Manchester. They say this will discourage people from taking up excessive amounts of space with big cars.Last year,Parisians votedtotriple parking costsfor SUVs, in order to tackle air pollution and climate breakdown by targeting generally richer drivers in heavy, large and polluting cars. Reports suggest this is already beginning to have an impact in Paris. Le Parisien said thenew parking ratefor large vehicles in Paris had reduced the number of SUVs using surface parking by two-thirds.UK local authorities are taking some measures. Cardiff has consulted with the public on a weight-based threshold for parking charges, while Lambeth in London is working with two other authorities on similar plans, and Bristol and Bath are also working on plans to discourage SUV use. In Edinburgh, the council has restricted advertising for SUVs.More than 1m carsthat are too big to fit in parking spaces are sold in the UK each year, and numbers are growing.Larger cars are more likely to cause deaths in crashes than smaller ones, as they weigh more and have tall front ends that can trap victims beneath them.Analysis has founddrivers in the tallest cars could not see children as old as nine when they were directly in front of the vehicle.SUVs also pump more toxic gases into the air, and produce more toxic particles from tyres due to their heavier weight.Oliver Lord, the UK head of Clean Cities, said: “In London alone, SUVs now take up as much space as an entire inner-city borough – that’s tarmac we could be using for homes, parks, or safer streets. These oversized vehicles are not just swallowing our public space, they’re also far more dangerous, especially for children. If we want cities that are safe, breathable and accessible, we have to get serious about tackling the rise of these urban land-hogs.”The trend for giant cars has spread through Europe, withrecent researchfinding “monster” pickup trucks are enjoying increasing popularity on the continent.Analysis has found SUVs are on the rise in the UK partly because they aretaxed at far lower levelsthan in comparable European countries.Dr Anna Goodman, an academic transport researcher and director ofTransportfor Quality of Life, who collaborated with Clean Cities to conduct the research, said: “SUVs increasingly dominate our streets. This has important implications for congestion, public space and road safety. The evidence is clear that SUVs increase road danger for people walking and cycling, particularly for children. Many cities around the world are bringing in targeted measures to discourage SUV ownership and use, and early reports from Paris indicate that these measures can be successful.”Explore more on these topicsTransportRoad transportAutomotive industryRoad safetyMotoringParisAutomotive emissionsnewsShareReuse this content"

The whole city was now considered a “dangerous combat zone”, the military said, although Israel has not ordered civilians to evacuate.About 80% of Gaza is under evacuation orders, with civilians crammed into just one-fifth of its total area. Even those areas are not safe, with Israeli attacks targeting parts it has labelled “humanitarian zones”.The Israeli military described the attacks now under way as the “initial stages” of a planned operation, although military chiefs are reportedly still arguing with the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, about whether the military has the capacity to do what he has ordered after nearly two years of war.Also on Friday, the Israeli military announced it had recovered the remains of the 55-year-old hostage Ilan Weiss and another unnamed hostage. Weiss was killed in the 7 October attack and his body was taken to Gaza.After international pressure over starvation in Gaza, Israel last month said it would pause fighting for a part of each day to allow more food convoys to reach communities across Gaza.Israel also slightly eased its blockade on aid shipments, but the new measures were only enough to slow the progress towards famine in Gaza City, not to reverse it.Israeli tanks have entered the city’s outskirts, and the once-upmarket Zeitoun neighbourhood has been razed to the ground in recent weeks.The military escalation comes even as mediators say Hamas has accepted a proposed part-ceasefire deal now on the table, with terms that Israel has previously agreed.Polling also shows that most Israelis back ending the war in return for the release of hostages, and there is fierce domestic criticism of the planned operation from many, who warn it will endanger those hostages who are still alive and take a heavy toll on exhausted soldiers.But a ceasefire would threaten Netanyahu’s fragile coalition, because far-right partners say they will leave if the fighting stops. The prime minister says the operation to take full military control of Gaza City is needed in order to defeat Hamas.Israel’s military spokesperson previously said the looming operation meant that the forced displacement of all Palestinians in Gaza City, which now houses about half of Gaza’s population, was “inevitable”.About 23,000 Palestinians had already evacuated Gaza City over the past week, the UN said on Thursday, as people fled in anticipation of a renewed offensive. But many have refused to leave.There is little space for more people in the small portions of south Gaza not under an evacuation order, and many people have been killed while en route to supposed safe zones or once already there.Extreme hunger also means many in Gaza City would struggle to make the journey on foot. There are very few vehicles, or even animals, for transport.Aid groups said they had not been given prior notice of Israel’s announcement on Friday, while Gaza’s health ministry said it did not have the resources to serve the entire population if everyone in the city were forced south.Israel’s announcement triggered outrage from European countries, with the foreign ministers of Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Norway, Slovenia and Spain condemning the offensive and plans to establish a permanent presence in Gaza City.The Holy Family Church of Gaza City told the Associated Press on Friday that the approximately 440 people sheltering in the church and the clergy would not be leaving. Earlier in the week, religious authorities in Gaza said fleeing would be a “death sentence” for many of the weak and malnourished people sheltering in churches.As the IDF said it was gearing up for the offensive, the military was struggling to mobilise soldiers. According to Israeli Army News, the army has halved the amount of training time given to new reservists assigned to drive tanks. High-ranking officers complained that this would not be enough time to properly train new soldiers.On Friday, the attorney general’s office discussed whether or not the government had the authority to catch draft dodgers at Israel’s border crossings.Despite the growing pressure abroad and at home, Israeli officials have not engaged with the latest Hamas proposal for a ceasefire. The US envoy Steve Witkoff said he expected the war to end by the end of the year, far past the timetable within which the Gaza City offensive is supposed to take place.More than 63,000 Palestinians have been killed over the last 23 months in Gaza, the majority of them civilians, according to health authorities. Israel attacked Gaza after Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostages in an attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

Criticising Israel is not enough. He needs to be saying exactly what steps member states need to take to meet their obligations to prevent genocide and very firmly pointing out the legal consequences for leaders, officials and private businesses if they don’t,” said one staff member who signed the letter.Another praised Türk’scriticism of Israel for grave breaches of international law and apparent war crimesbut charged that the decision to avoid clearer public statements about genocide was “a political not a legal choice”.The letter, seen by the Guardian, says that based on the “available evidence and authoritative assessments by the UN-appointed experts, as well as legal and [international humanitarian law] professionals, the legal threshold [for genocide] has been met. [We] therefore urge the Office to state the legal characterization publicly.”The OHCHR “has a strong legal and moral responsibility to denounce acts of genocide” and that “failing to denounce an unfolding genocide undermines the credibility of the UN and the human rights system itself”, the letter adds.UN officials have said that only an international court can declare a genocide – a process that can take many years. Experts on the international court of justice (ICJ)said in Julythat a judgment on whether Israel was committing genocide in Gaza was unlikely before the end of 2027 at the earliest.‘Really cautious’: why the ICJ is delaying a Gaza genocide verdictRead moreMany international human rights groups havealready said a genocide is under way in Gaza, where the Israeli offensive has killed more than 63,000 people, mostly civilians, injured 150,000 and displaced almost the entire 2.3 million population. UN-backed experts declared a famine in parts of the devastated territory earlier this month.Israeli officials reject the charge of genocide as “outrageous and false”, and say the country is acting in self-defence after Hamas’s surprise raid in October 2023 that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and resulted in 251 hostages being taken.InJanuary last year, the ICJ ruled that the claim of genocide was “plausible” and ordered Israel to “take all measures within its power” to stop acts of genocide, and incitement to genocide from being committed and take “immediate and effective measures” to allow aid into Gaza.One OHCHR employee said Türk was failing his mandate to prevent as well as report human rights abuses around the world and that his high-profile post offered an opportunity to make a much greater difference.“People take notice of what we say, and he says. He could be telling member states and officials working for them that they could face really serious legal consequences. At least that would make them think and put down a marker. No one could claim later that they didn’t know,” said one signatory to the letter.In his response to the letter, also seen by the Guardian, Türk said signatories had raised “important concerns” and pledged to continue to “demand accountability regarding arms transfers facilitating violations”.“I know we all share a feeling of moral indignation at the horrors we are witnessing, as well as frustration in the face of the international community’s inability to bring this situation to an end,” wrote Türk, a human rights lawyer and veteran UN official, .A spokesperson for the OHCHR said the agency had been working in very difficult circumstances “in the face of vilification and accusations of bias, complicity, antisemitism, double standards and more” to try to document the facts on the ground and raise the alarm. The spokesperson added that Türk had warned repeatedly of the “high and increasing risk thatatrocity crimes”, which include war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, “are being committed in the occupied Palestinian territory”.In November, Türk called onUN member statesto assess arms sales or transfers to Israel and any other actors in the conflict, “with a view to ending such support if this risks serious violations of international law.”“As the high commissioner has said, since 7 October 2023, parties to this conflict have paid little heed to international law that protects human rights and governs the conduct of hostilities. This has been a stain on the collective conscience of humanity … The international community needs to come together to bring this unbearable horror to an end,” the spokesperson said.Israel’s foreign ministry told Reuters it did not respond to internal UN employees’ letters “even if they are false, baseless, and blinded by obsessive hatred towards Israel”.Explore more on these topicsUnited NationsGazaHuman rightsIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

The approved resolution said Unifil would begin an “orderly and safe withdrawal” of its 10,800 peacekeepers from Lebanon in December 2026.The planned withdrawal will end the more than 47-year-long peacekeeping mission. Initially created in 1978 to oversee the withdrawal of Israeli troops from south Lebanon, Unifil’s soldiers patrol the shared border betweenIsraeland Lebanon.The force has been tasked with monitoring and reporting violations of the November ceasefire betweenHezbollahand Lebanon, so the Lebanese army can enforce the terms of the agreement.View image in fullscreenUnifil troops patrol a position formerly held by Hezbollah in the Khraibeh valley, southern Lebanon.Photograph: Anwar Amro/AFP/Getty ImagesThursday’s UN resolution said it aimed to make the Lebanese government “the sole provider of security” in south Lebanon, and called for Israel to withdraw its forces. Israel has continued to occupy at least five points in south Lebanon and carry out hundreds of airstrikes in violation of the ceasefire, which it said were done to prevent Hezbollah from rebuilding its military infrastructure.The vote came after months of pressure by the Israeli and US governments, who have made ending the Unifil mission a priority.After the vote, the US ambassador to the UN, Dorothy Shea, said it was the last time the US would extend the Unifil mission. “The United States notes that the first ‘i’ in Unifil stands for ‘interim’. The time has come for Unifil’s mission to end,” she said.The decision was also praised by the Israeli representative to the UN, Danny Danon, who said: “For a change, we have some good news coming from the UN.”Under the presidency of Donald Trump, the US has moved closer to Israel’s position on Unifil. Israel has long considered Unifil to provide political cover to Hezbollah by failing to adequately disarm the militia in southern Lebanon since the end of the 2006 war, and has pushed for the mission to be disbanded.Israel attacked Unifil positions throughout the war with Hezbollah, injuring peacekeepers as a result. Unifil’s mandate means it is only a monitoring force and cannot use force except in self-defence. Instead, violations are reported to the Lebanese army, which is leading the disarmament of Hezbollah in southern Lebanon.View image in fullscreenUnifil peacekeepers stand at a position formerly held by Hezbollah in the Khraibeh valley in southern Lebanon.Photograph: Anwar Amro/AFP/Getty ImagesPeacekeepers have also come under pressure from Hezbollah, with residents loyal to the group in south Lebanon frequently stopping patrols, throwing stones at military vehicles and on one occasion, slapping a peacekeeper.The Lebanese state has relied on Unifil to help create a buffer with Israel and support its under-equipped army to reassert state control over south Lebanon. The prime minister, Nawaf Salam, praised the UN resolution, saying it “reiterates the call for Israel to withdraw its forces from the five sites it continues to occupy, and affirms the necessity of extending state authority over all its territory”.Other nations involved, such as France and Italy, objected to the eventual withdrawal of peacekeepers, saying it could hamstring the Lebanese army’s ability to establish itself in south Lebanon.The army will next week present a plan to disarm Hezbollah. It wants to do so in a way that does not provoke a confrontation with the well-armed group and preserves civil peace in Lebanon.Explore more on these topicsLebanonUnited NationsMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelHezbollahnewsShareReuse this content"

Will they be prosecuted?William ChristouHuman Rights Watch says US military personnel could face criminal prosecution for assisting Israel’s war in GazaFri 29 Aug 2025 07.00 EDTShareHuman rights groups and activists who protest against continued US support forIsraelhave focused primarily on the flow of US weapons, warning that continuing to send weapons to a state which has been documented using them in probable war crimes makes the US complicit.However, this week,Human Rights Watch(HRW) highlighted another facet of US military support for Israel: military cooperation and intelligence sharing.IndividualUS militarypersonnel who assist Israeli forces in committing war crimes could face criminal prosecution for their actions, the rights group said.The US has made no secret of its operational support for Israel throughout its 22-month war inGaza. The US has provided Israel with intelligence at various points during its military operations, and also embedded US military forces within Israeli operational planning.Israel’s attack on hospital in Gaza may constitute a war crime on many frontsRead moreThe direct participation of US forces in Israel’s military activities in Gaza makes it a party to the conflict – and this would mean those individual US soldiers could be liable for any war crimes committed with their assistance, according to Omar Shakir, theIsraeland Palestine director at HRW.“It goes beyond complicity, the US has directly participated in hostilities. If you played a role in it and the Israeli forces carried out a war crime, you could still be liable for the war crime,” he said.It is difficult to know the extent of direct US participation in Israeli military operations, as much of it is classified. But both the current and former administration have boasted about their operational support for Israel – at times in military operations which have questionable legality.In October 2024, former US presidentJoe Bidensaid that US special operations personnel and members of the intelligence community helped Israel target Hamas leaders, including the former head of Hamas, Yahya Sinwar.More recently, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters that theTrump administrationwas consulted by Israel before it resumed strikes on 18 March, killing more than 400 people.Israel’s attack on hospital in Gaza may constitute a war crime on many frontsRead moreA growing list of potential war crimes has not slowed US support for Israel. A strike onal-Nasser hospital in southern Gaza which killed 20 people, including five journalists, on Monday joins a long series of indiscriminate attacks killing civilians in Gaza.Any US military personnel who provided the Israeli military with intelligence, or even material support in an operation that is against international humanitarian law, would have helped commit that war crime.The US has previously come under criticism in similar cases. US help in refueling Saudi-led coalition aircraft in its war on Yemen drew outrage for its high civilian death toll. Even though it was not US pilots dropping bombs on Yemenis, their support enabled the coalition to continue bombarding the country.In theory, US service members who assisted in war crimes could face criminal prosecution, potentially in the US, countries with universal jurisdiction such as Belgium and Germany, or theinternational criminal court (ICC).“In principle, the Rome statute envisages that a person can be individually responsible for a crime under the jurisdiction of the Rome statute if he/she ‘aids, abets or otherwise assists in its commission or attempted commission,’” said Janina Dill, the co-director of the Oxford Institute for Ethics, Law and Armed Conflict. The ICC has jurisdiction over crimes committedGaza, even if the US is not a signatory to the Rome statute which created it, she explained.But whether US service members would ever actually face prosecution for alleged war crimes is doubtful.The current political climate in the US, and countries with universal jurisdiction like Germany, is largely supportive of the war in Gaza. The ICC is overstretched and the US has threatened the court’s members in the past when it contemplated opening an investigation into misconduct in Afghanistan.Besides individual instances of US operational support for Israeli military operations in Gaza, US weapons transfers and sales have been critical to the war in Gaza. As of April, the US has $39.2bn in active foreign military sales to Israel – on top of the $4.17bn in arms transfers since October 2023.The result is a complete package of US support to Israel’s war in Gaza. The US provides the weapons via sales and arms transfers, provides intelligence to help Israel aim the weapons, and provides political support to shield Israel on the international stage from growing global backlash against its conduct in Gaza.Rights groups have argued that all of this military support should stop, in light of the growing instances of alleged war crimes.“Not only is the US a party to the conflict but it could be liable for war crimes. The American public is paying for this and I don’t think they have a sense of what’s being done by their own country,” said Sarah Yager, Washington director at HRW.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesUS militaryHamasanalysisShareReuse this content"

This court ruling was never going to end as a quiet legal moment.For the Home Office, the court of appeal’s decision was a practical win. If the ruling had gone the other way, the government would have been forced to rehouse 138 asylum seekers in a matter of days, opening the floodgates to similar legal challenges from other councils. Since there is scant alternative accommodation available, this ruling buys the government time.Government insiders say that by the end of the year they expect at least five more hotels housing asylum seekers to close, with more to follow in the new year. If the closures proceed, the ruling means they still have time to delivertheir promise of shutting all the hotels down“in a controlled and orderly way” by 2029.But political tensions have, of course, been reignited.Nigel Farageimmediately jumped on the moment, accusing the government of “using the law against the people of Epping”. He said “illegal migrants now have more rights than the people of Essex” and promised Reform UK would “put an end to this”. This is the kind of high-emotion, high-visibility moment Farage thrives on and is a story that plays into his hands.Richard Tice, the deputy leader of Reform UK, also piled in, telling supporters on X: “Judges side with illegal migrants against British people. ECHR used by judges to overrule planning law, democratic protests and the safety of Epping residents.”The government remains stuck in the same political fight: trying to stave off challenges from the right while at the same time getting on with the job of ensuring there is a functioning political project that can communicate its wins.Kemi Badenoch, the opposition leader, has told Tory councils to “keep going” with their legal challenges, despite the court ruling making it clear that protest and local pressure will not count in planning law.Views in her party slant right on the issue, but not exclusively. One senior Conservative MP said: “They’re human beings – they have to live somewhere. For me the issue is: where’s the deterrent?” But another backbencher said: “We have to make it impossible for them to stay open.”Farage had described the mood in the country on Tuesday around the issue of immigration as being “a mix between total despair and rising anger”. Yet he persistently confuses irregular migrants with asylum seekers who are fleeing harm.Recent polling shows the issue is one of voters’ biggest concerns, with a YouGov poll revealing 71% of voters think Keir Starmer is handling the asylum crisis poorly, including a majority of his own supporters. Nearly seven in 10 said immigration levels were too high, which indicates why Farage was able to seize another moment this week to claim a “genuine threat to public order” unless this issue is solved.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But as of Friday evening, the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, had not commented publicly. The last post on X from the official Labour party account is a photo of Farage with the caption: “No plan. No idea.”There is still a long way to go before Labour can look back on what it has achieved in its first parliament. But public mood is shifting faster than policy.This Labour government did inherit a broken system, and a large number of hotels opened by the Conservatives. But it has not stopped the Tories washing their hands of it, or Farage from circling. On the streets outside the Bell hotel, the noise is getting louder, along with fears there could be more protests across the country to come.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumProtestEssexEnglandNigel FarageanalysisShareReuse this content"

Police said searches of his phone found hundreds of intimate images and videos of women. His filming of his own offending was the key evidence that led to his guilty pleas.Detectives have been able to identify three victims, with three others he was convicted of attacking still unidentified. Police believe his offending could go back years and that there could be many more victims. All of his victims are believed to be of Chinese heritage.Xu owned a recruitment company and would use networking events at his home in Greenwich, south London, to select women to drug and then attack. After one event in June, a woman who had been raped four times went to police.Police believe Xu would spike drinks and then when women felt unwell he would offer them a place to stay. Drugs recovered by police included substances usually used by vets to treat animals. Women said they had the effect of making them drowsy and incapacitated, during which time he attacked them.The offences Xu admitted at Woolwich crown court were four counts of rape, eight counts of assault by penetration, four counts of sexual assault, four counts of voyeurism, two counts of administering a substance with intent, and two counts of operating equipment beneath the clothing of another without consent between February 2022 and June 2025. Two other alleged offences will lie on file.The details of his offending have strong similarities to that ofZhenhao Zou, a Chinese student and serial rapist who drugged many of his victims and who is now serving a life sentence with a minimum term of 24 years.Police are investigating whether there is any link between the two but so far none has been found.Detectives are also talking to counterparts in China about whether they have any information on Xu, who came to Britain in 2013 to study at the University of Greenwich.Police want any women who fear they may have been victims of Xu to contact them. The lead investigator, Det Ch Insp Lewis Sanderson, said: “Xu is a calculated prolific sex offender who has preyed on unsuspecting women using cowardly methods – administering drugs to rape, sexually assault and take intimate images without consent.“Our investigation is ongoing and we continue to examine the large amount of evidence we have collected, which will help identify any further potential victim-survivors. We’re also asking anyone who has any information about Xu or believes they may have been a victim, to come forward – you will be listened to.”Suzanne Crane, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: “Xu is a serious danger to women, and the scale of his offending is such that without the brave testimony of victims who came forward after realising what had happened to them, [it] may well have continued undetected.”Xu was remanded into custody until he is due to be sentenced on 14 November. The judge, Simon Stirling, told him: “You have pleaded guilty to a large number of offences for which the inevitable outcome is a lengthy custodial sentence.”Explore more on these topicsCrimeLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

But the court of appeal judges said upholding that order could lead to further disorder by effectively demonstrating that such action could achieve protesters’ ultimate goal – the removal of the asylum seekers one way or another.They said the people living at the Bell hotel would have to be housed somewhere, and other councils could regard preserving the injunction as a green light to do the same in their areas.Analysing the high court decision, Lord Justice Bean, sitting with Lady Justice Davies and Lord Justice Cobb, said: “If an outbreak of protests enhances the case for a planning injunction, this runs the risk of acting as an impetus or incentive for further protests – some of which may be disorderly – around asylum accommodation. At its worst, if even unlawful protests are to be treated as relevant, there is a risk of encouraging further lawlessness.“The [high court] judge’s approach ignores the obvious consequence that the closure of one site means capacity needs to be identified elsewhere in the system.”The judges added that “the potential cumulative impact” of other councils reacting by trying to gain injunctions in their own areas was a “material consideration … that was not considered by the judge”.View image in fullscreenProtesters gathered outside the Bell hotel again on Friday after the court’s ruling.Photograph: Carlos Jasso/AFP/Getty ImagesThe ruling will come as a relief to the site’s owner, Somani Hotels, and the Home Office, which both challenged the injunction, the latter amid concerns it would prompt a host of legal challenges from other councils.Speaking after the decision, the Home Office minister, Angela Eagle, said: “We inherited a chaotic asylum accommodation system costing billions. This government will close all hotels by the end of this parliament and we appealed this judgment so hotels like the Bell can be exited in a controlled and orderly way that avoids the chaos of recent years that saw 400 hotels open at a cost of £9m a day.”The Refugee Council’s chief executive, Enver Solomon, said using hotels to house asylum seekers was “untenable”, adding: “Waiting until 2029 to end their use is no longer an option. As long as hotels remain open, they will continue to be flashpoints for protests, fuelling division and leaving people who have fled war and persecution feeling unsafe.”The charity urged ministers to adopt its “one-off” scheme granting temporary permission to stay to those asylum seekers most likely to be recognised as refugees because of the situation in their home country. This would lead to the closure of hotels by next year, according to its own analysis.Kemi Badenoch, the Tory leader, said: “Keir Starmer has shown that he puts the rights of illegal immigrants above the rights of British people who just want to feel safe in their towns and communities.”Starmer was not a party to the case, which concerned people seeking asylum – not illegal immigrants. The Home Office’s lawyer suggested the legal duty of the home secretary, as a government minister representing the whole of the UK, to uphold human rights trumped those of a single council to follow planning law. The judges said this analysis was “unattractive”.Badenoch added that the ruling was a “setback, but it is not the end. I say to Conservative councils seeking similar injunctions against asylum hotels – keep going”. But a senior Tory source said: “They’re human beings; they have to live somewhere. For me the issue is: where’s the deterrent?”Some Tory MPs fear urging councils to mount further legal challenges could backfire, given the court’s warning that local protests cannot justify emergency injunctions. Another Tory MP said: “We’re throwing lawyers at this problem instead of showing how exactly we can fix the system.”TheReform UKleader, Nigel Farage, also criticised the decision, claiming the government had “used ECHR [European convention on human rights] against the people of Epping”. Despite the ruling relating to legal asylum seekers, he added: “Illegal migrants have more rights than the British people under Starmer.”Home Office lawyers had argued that the government’s duties towards asylum seekers under the ECHR were “fundamentally different” from Epping Forest district council’s planning responsibilities.The council’s leader, Chris Whitbread, called for calm, telling Times Radio: “There’s been peaceful protests and there’s been non-peaceful protests outside the hotel.”View image in fullscreenSeveral protesters stood outside the high court on Friday after the judgment.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PAAfter the court of appeal ruling, a small number of demonstrators carrying St George and union flags gathered outside the Bell hotel while police officers guarded its entrance.​One protester s​aid the decision could result in civil unrest. Carmen, who wore a pink top that said “Pink ladies say, the only way is Epping, send them home” on it, said: “We come every week – march, protest – and today’s ruling is just devastating, absolutely devastating. It will probably cause civil unrest.”The council could still be granted an injunction after the full hearing of the legal claim. Whitbread said: “Obviously we’re still going to court in October to go for a final injunction and we will be pushing hard to make sure that’s successful, but we will do everything we can still.”The judges said the original decision was “seriously flawed in principle”, and that the “risk of injustice to the residents of the hotel by being dispersed by 12 September when the trial of the claim was to take place only some six weeks later seems to have had oddly little resonance with the [high court] judge”.Neither the council nor the hotel’s owner had argued in the high court case that the fear of crime being committed in Epping in the future was a key factor, though both had agreed it was relevant.The court of appeal judges said this was correct, but that it was outweighed by the concern about incentivising more potentially violent protests, the upheaval of having to disperse more than 130 people for the short period before the trial, and other factors in the broader public interest.The judges granted the Home Office and the hotel’s owners permission to appeal. They also agreed Mr Justice Eyre was wrong to refuse to allow the home secretary to intervene in the case, saying the Home Office had a “constitutional role relating to public safety” and was affected by the issues.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumHome OfficeEssexLocal governmentEnglandReform UKConservativesnewsShareReuse this content"

California’s governor Gavin Newsom has signed two redistricting bills to counter Texas’s move, which will have to be approved by voters on 4 November.Following the approval of Texas’s new congressional maps, the Democratic Governors Association released the following statement: “Republicans can’t defend their toxic and unpopular agenda of gutting healthcare for millions of Americans, so they’re trying to rig our elections before a single vote has even been cast.“Democratic governors are on the frontlines of this fight – and they will use every tool available to stand up for their states and ensure fair representation.”It is highly unusual for states to redistrict in the middle of a decade; they normally adjust their districting following the decennial census, to reflect population changes.Kehoe also said the special legislative session would focus on initiative petition reform, which would render citizen-led initiative petitions – such as those overturning Missouri’s abortion ban and enacting a minimum wage increase and paid sick days – harder to enact.Emanuel Cleaver II, a Democratic representative from Missouri whose district could be carved up when maps are redrawn, said that in remaking the state’s congressional maps, “lawmakers would be working to drown out Missouri voices in favor of a single man a thousand miles away”.“But let us be clear: should this effort move forward, we will not concede,” he added.“I will not surrender the voices of the people who entrusted me to fight for them.”Explore more on these topicsMissouriHouse of RepresentativesUS CongressRepublicansUS politicsUS voting rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

He is stopping every couple of hours to change his socks and lubricate his feet to avoid blisters.Democrats seek ‘immediate answers’ after reported arrests of firefighters by US border agentsRead moreHe will also rest each night at a “little cheap hotel” somewhere but has not booked in advance. “I’m just going to stop when my body tells me I can’t go any more and I’m sure somebody will leave the light on for me at one of these hotels or whatever along the route.”He will also stream parts of the walkon Instagram Liveand hold four rallies and press conferences, culminating on Tuesday on the steps of the capitol building in Harrisburg.Kenyatta hopes to bring attention to budget cuts at theSoutheastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority(Septa), a public transit agency providing bus, subway, trolley and regional rail service in the Philadelphia area.He attributes the funding crisis to Republican inaction in the state legislature, highlighting the impact on students, elderly people and workers.Republicans say it is a crisis manufactured by the Democratic party.Septa has a $213m operating deficit this year and has warned that service cuts that started this week, affecting thousands of children on the first day of school,will send the agency into a “death spiral”if it does not secure more funding from the state government.“It is a problem that is growing not shrinking,”Kenyatta said. “Part of what has made this so frustrating is that this is not one of those budgetary standoffs that’s driven by a lack of resources. We’ve put forward five bipartisan proposals to fund mass transit.”But Republicans in the state senate, he added, fled the capitol to play golf, go clay shooting and take trips, leaving the transport funding in limbo. “As working people are struggling, they are literally palling around having cocktails with the wealthiest people in the state.“That contrast is one that is dramatic, that is pronounced and should piss people off, and what I’m doing right now on this 105-mile long walk comes out of a time honoured American tradition of marching.”This week marks the 62nd anniversary of theMarch on Washington, Kenyatta noted. “It’s not lost on me that what I’m doing is symbolic but what is not symbolic is the pain that people are feeling every single day. What’s also not symbolic are the disparate priorities of Democrats and Republicans.”Kenyatta is also vice-chair of the Democratic National Committee and suggested that, as Donald Trump seeks to expand presidential power, the party grassroots is looking for peoplewilling to take off the gloves.“There is a debate in the Democratic party and the debate is very simple,” he said, “Some people think that we should roll over and die and some people who think we should fight like hell. Some people think that we should use every single tool at our disposal to fight the authoritarian takeover of our country.“Chair [Ken] Martin is leading that. He said at our DNC meeting the Democratic party can’t keep bringing a pencil to a knife fight, that we have to organise everywhere, that we have to think outside the box, that we have to find ways to connect these issues to people in a way that resonates with them.”Explore more on these topicsPennsylvaniaPhiladelphiaDemocratsnewsShareReuse this content"

A further 17 people, 14 of them children, were injured in the shooting.“Yesterday, a coward decided to take our eight-year-old son, Fletcher, away from us,” Jesse Merkel said outside the school on Thursday, of the attack that police say was perpetrated by a 23-year-old former student who then killed themself after the shooting.“Because of their actions, we will never be allowed to hold him, talk to him, play with him and watch him grow into the wonderful young man he was on the path to becoming.”‘God, come to our aid’: Community gathers to pray for victims of Minneapolis school shootingRead moreJesse Merkel said that Fletcher loved his family, friends, fishing, cooking and “any sport he was allowed to play”.He added: “While the hole in our hearts and lives will never be filled, I hope that in time, our family can find healing. I pray that the other victim’s family can find some semblance of the same.”Harper Moyski’s parents also released a statement, remembering their daughter as a “bright, joyful and deeply loved 10-year-old whose laughter, kindness and spirit touched everyone who knew her”.“Our hearts are broken not only as parents, but also for Harper’s sister, who adored her big sister and is grieving an unimaginable loss,” Harper’s parents, Michael Moyski and Jackie Flavin, said in a statement toABC Minneapolis station KSTP. “As a family, we are shattered, and words cannot capture the depth of our pain.”Harper’s parents added that no other family should have to endure what they have.“We urge our leaders and communities to take meaningful steps to address gun violence and the mental health crisis in this country,” they said. “Change is possible, and it is necessary – so that Harper’s story does not become yet another in a long line of tragedies.”The shooting took place during a mass that marked the first week of school. Police said the suspected perpetrator, Robin Westman, fired into the church from outside, through the windows. The doors of the church were locked during the service, which probably saved “countless lives”, according to investigators.A Minneapolis hospital on Friday said it was caring for six of the shooting’s victims – including five children. One child remains in critical condition, one adult was in serious condition and four children were in satisfactory condition, Hennepin Healthcare (HCMC) officials said in a statement reported by the local news outletKARE.KARE reported that HCMC treated 10 of the shooting’s victims. Children’sMinnesotasaid to KARE on Friday that it had treated seven child victims – six of whom had been discharged.An exact motive for the shooting is still unclear. However, police and investigators said Westman had a “deranged fascination” with mass shooters and was obsessed with the idea of killing children.A search warrant for the church said there were three guns seized as evidence: a semiautomatic pistol, a pump-action shotgun and a semiautomatic rifle, as NBCreported.There were also items that may have been intended to be used as a smoke bomb, including a gas container and a metal pull pin. The shooter was found dead in the back of the church with a bullet wound to the head.In a news conference on Thursday, Joseph Thompson, the acting US attorney general for Minnesota and arecent appointee of Trump, said that in writings left behind, “the shooter expressed hate towards many groups, including the Jewish community and towards President Trump.”“I won’t dignify the attacker’s words by repeating them, they are horrific and vile,” Thompson added.The attack has again reignited calls for stricter controls upon guns, particularly assault weapons, that enable the sort of regular mass carnage in schools, churches, movie theaters and other places in the US that would be unthinkable in most other countries around the world.“There is no reason that someone should be able to reel off 30 shots before they even have to reload,” said Jacob Frey, the mayor ofMinneapolis.“We’re not talking about your father’s hunting rifle here. We’re talking about guns that are built to pierce armor and kill people.”Explore more on these topicsMinneapolis school shootingMinnesotaMinneapolisGun crimeUS school shootingsnewsShareReuse this content"

Cook learned of her removal from the board via a post on social media, they said.Trump is out to end the Fed’s autonomy. Here’s how he’s trying to get his wayRead moreUS district judge Jia Cobb is overseeing the case, which is widely expected to be ultimately decided by thesupreme court. While it makes it way through the courts, Cook is seeking a temporary restraining order against Trump’s attempt to “immediately” dismiss her from the Fed’s board.Cobb spent Friday’s hearing questioning the lawyers on what they believe constitute as “cause” and “pretext” for the case.Abbe Lowell, Cook’s lawyer, said Trump and his ally Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, fired her after they haphazardly accused her of mortgage fraud. Pulte, using his access to mortgage records, said Cook illegally claimed that she had two primary residences to get a better mortgage.Lowell called the attack the administration’s “weapon of choice” after they tried to accuse the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, of fraud over recent renovations at the Fed. He pointed out Trump has been vocally opposed to the Fed’s policies on interest rates, even though the central bank is explicitly and historically a non-political institution. He cited a recent quote from Trump, who during a cabinet meeting Thursdaysaid: “We’ll have a majority very shortly, and that will be great.”“These are not independent matters in this case,” Lowell said. “If all we have is a tweet, and it says ‘might’, ‘maybe’, ‘could’, ‘possibly’, ‘potentially’ – and there’s no notice, there’s no opportunity [to be heard], it’s all based on this litigation by tweet.”Meanwhile, justice department lawyer Yaakov Roth argued that, as president, Trump’s ability to remove federal officials is broad.“Congress does not have the authority to restrict the removal of a federal officer,” Roth said. “There’s nothing in the president’s statements, either contemporaneous or after, that suggests that [Cook’s] removal was for any reason other than the reason given in the letter.”Cobb appeared to suggest a decision could come in coming weeks, after both sides present their case.Early on Friday morning, Trump filed a request to the judge to deny Cook’s request. In its own filing, the Fed did not take a stance on the case but urged Cobb to make a “prompt ruling”.Trump wrote to Cook on Monday, telling her that he was removing her from her position “effective immediately”, based on the allegation from one of his allies that she had obtained a mortgage on a second home she incorrectly described as her primary residence.The president has spent monthsattacking the Fed, where most policymakers – including Cook – have so far defied his calls for interest rate cuts. He has spoken of rapidly building “a majority” on the central bank’s board, calling into question the future of its longstanding independence from political oversight.‘Pattern of lawfare’: Trump is targeting opponents with mortgage fraud claimsRead moreFiring Cook, whose term is not due to expire until 2038, would enable Trump to nominate a replacement. But she has argued the president has “no authority” to remove her.“An unsubstantiated allegation about private mortgage applications submitted by Governor Cook prior to her Senate confirmation is not [cause],” her lawyers argued in the complaint. “President Trump’s letter purporting to fire Governor Cook did not cite appropriate cause for removing her from the board of governors.”The White House claimed on Thursday that Cook had been “credibly accused of lying” by the administration. But the accusations are unconfirmed, and her lawyers said Trump and his officials had not explicitly alleged that any error on her mortgage paperwork was intentional.It comes as the Fedgears up to resume rate cutsas soon as next month, albeit not at the scale or pace Trump has repeatedly demanded – and its chair,Jerome Powell, has cautioned that the president’s tariffs and immigration crackdown have disrupted the global economy and knocked the US labor force.Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS interest ratesJerome PowellUS economyUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Flights, ticket sales, reservations and operations will continue, the airline said on Friday.Spirit had been attempting to rebrand as a higher cost airline to keep pace with post-pandemic travel trends that have challenged the viability of the ultra-low-cost model.But Spirit’s recovery was further hit by uncertainty from Donald Trump’s tariffs and budget cuts, which have cooled consumer spending and driven down domestic airfares.The airline was forced to raise going-concern doubts earlier this month.“Since emerging from our previous restructuring, which was targeted exclusively on reducing Spirit’s funded debt and raising equity capital, it has become clear that there is much more work to be done and many more tools are available to best position Spirit for the future,” said chief executive Dave Davis.The Florida-based airline first sought bankruptcy protection last November after years of losses, failed merger bids and mounting debt, becoming the first major US carrier to do so since 2011.It posted a $1.2bn net loss last year, with its troubles compounded by the collapse of a $3.8bn merger with JetBlue Airways and RTX’s Pratt & Whitney engine issues that forced it to ground many of its Airbus jets.Spirit began in 1964 as a long-haul trucking company before shifting to aviation in the 1980s, initially flying leisure packages under the name Charter One Airlines.It rebranded as Spirit in 1992 and built its reputation as a discount carrier for budget-conscious travelers willing to skip extras like checked bags and seat assignments.But the pandemic upended that model, as demand shifted toward more comfortable, experience-driven travel, leaving ultra-low-cost carriers struggling to adapt.Explore more on these topicsBusinessAir transportUS economyEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Here’s what we know about the end of the exemption.What is de minimis?The de minimis exemption allowed packages valued at less than $800 to be shipped into the US tariff-free. The exemption comes from the Tariff Act of 1930.US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which oversees tariff collection and package inspection at ports and airports,estimatedthat 1.36bn shipments into the US were de minimis in fiscal year 2024. Thetotal valueof de minimis shipments hit $64.6bn that year – the second highest after 2020.Which retailers are affected?The end of the exemption does not affect major retailers like Target, Costco and Walmart because those companies typically ship in bulk containers that exceed $800 in value and are already being taxed.Instead, the exemption largely applied to businesses that have a direct-to-consumer model, including Chinese e-commerce brands Shein and Temu and small businesses overseas.Other businesses, like manufacturers that directly sold to consumers on platforms like Amazon and Walmart’s storefronts, also accounted for a big chunk of de minimis packages.Shipments from China once made up more than half of all de minimis shipments entering the US, though Trump ended the exemption for China and Hong Kong in May. In late July, Trump signed a surprise executive order announcing he would end the exemption for all countries.What does this mean for prices?These companies are now making the challenging pricing decisions that major retailers have been mulling over for months: how much should prices go up because of tariffs?Erin McLaughlin, a senior economist at the Conference Board, said that though items at low-cost retailers like Shein and Temu are likely to stay cheaper than traditional retailers, shoppers are still likely to notice price increases. Shein and Temu now have to act like traditional retailers, which have more complicated shipping chains.“They will still offer some of the cheapest apparel and other things because those were cheaper to begin with, and even if you’re buying things through a more traditional retailer, there’s still tariffs on them,” McLaughlin said. “But maybe the variety might be a little bit smaller because the goods have to be stored in a warehouse.”Why is the exemption being stopped?The White House said the exemption was a loophole that hurts American manufacturers while also posing a risk to national security, claiming bad actors use the exemption to smuggle illegal drugs into the country.“Many shippers go to great lengths to evade law enforcement and hide illicit substances in imports that go through international commerce,” Trump said in anexecutive orderending the exemption for all countries.Unlike Trump’s tariff orders, the de minimis exemption received bipartisan scrutiny after the number of shipments soared during the pandemic. Last year, the Biden administrationproposed rulesthat would reduce the number of de minimis shipments and “stop the abuse” of the exemption.The Tariff Act of 1930 set the de minimis threshold at any package that was valued at $1. In 2015, the threshold went from $200 to $800, allowing companies to ship a high volume of low-cost goods without tariffs.This is why postal services outside the US said they werehalting the shipment of small packages.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Etsywarnedsellers that tariffs may increase pricing and encouraged them to communicate with buyers on how tariffs will affect prices.“As you communicate with your buyers about their orders, keep in mind that some buyers may not have paid tariffs before,” the company said.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsE-commerceUS politicsDonald TrumpTariffsexplainersShareReuse this content"

A nationalpollconducted by the AFL-CIO and David Binder Research found trust in labor unions is at 55% – larger than the 36% of respondents who said they trusted theDemocratic partyand the 35% of respondents who said they trusted theRepublican party.“People are waking up to the fact we don’t have to just sit back and take it and the labor movement is the place to go to channel that activism, to build what’s next and we’re putting forward a vision for what the economy can be,” added Shuler.“When people see tanks rolling into Washington DC, when we were promised lower costs, they’re like, this makes no sense,” said Shuler. “We’re getting billionaires standing up at the front row of the inauguration, basically taking over agencies, our economy and our country. So I think that no matter what party you belong to, that is a unifying thing that everybody wants, the freedom, fairness and security that all working people deserve.”“The billionaire agenda, the corruption we’re seeing, is changing the way government is functioning. It’s leading to real-time and impactful ramifications for regular people,” said Lisa Gilbert, co-president of Public Citizen. “The gutting of Medicaid, all the firings we’ve seen of federal workers, the ravaging of families through Ice raids. It’s just all coming together to cause people to stand up and say, ‘we are the people of this country. It is workers over billionaires.’”Gilbert noted they currently have 984 events scheduled, with the aim to reach over 1,000 by Labor Day, a mass organizingeffortthat has been weeks in the making.“We’ve been standing together over and over again to talk about the authoritarian slide that this administration is ushering in in our country. We expect a lot of energy this weekend. This is really just the beginning of an ongoing fight against what’s being taken away from regular people,” she said.Explore more on these topicsUS unionsProtestTrump administrationDonald TrumpChicagoLos AngelesNew YorknewsShareReuse this content"

The employees, scared that they might be targeted and racially profiled, asked if they could go home.Within hours, Hernán had to close their doors, and the restaurant hasn’t been open since.“Literally afterPresident Trumpbrought the national guard on DC, everything stopped,” said Hernán, who requested his last name not be used due to fears of Ice retaliation. “Everything disappeared because the bike delivery guys, they’re scared. They’re not on the streets right now. My people, most of my cooks are Spanish[-speaking] and they don’t want to go to DC right now.”Hernán, who also owns a restaurant inMaryland, said he was hoping to be able to reopen in a few weeks if and when the Trump administration’s takeover of the DC police ends and immigration enforcement arrests become less frequent. But the future is unclear for him and many restaurant owners in the US capital.When immigration shows up at daycare: crackdown in DC terrifies families and workersRead moreAlready suffering fromfewer customersdue to the administration’s almost three-week-long crackdown, restaurants are also having to contend with staff shortages because manyimmigrants, both documented and undocumented, fear coming into DC and being on the streets, and some have been detained by Ice.Trump has attempted to claim that the crackdown is benefiting restaurants. “Half the restaurants closed, because nobody could go, because they were afraid to go outside,” he told reporters on Monday about Washington before his intervention. “Now those restaurants are opening and new restaurants are opening up.”Across the city, the opposite is true. Some restaurants, like Hernán’s, have had to close their doors. But more have had to make do with fewer workers, fewer delivery drivers and fewer customers.“Restaurants will close because you have troops with guns and federal agents harassing people … making people afraid to go out,” José Andrés, the well-known Washington restaurateur, wrote on social media.Immigrants account for 253,000 workers, or 36% of the workforce, in DC’s restaurants, hotels and related sectors,according to Migrant Insider, which cited data from FWD.us. Included in that total are 42,000 self-employed immigrant entrepreneurs running local food and service businesses.Maketto, an Asian restaurant and marketplace in north-east DC, posted on social media on Monday that its immigrant workers had been affected.“Last week, two of our beloved team members were detained while simply walking home from work,” the restaurant wrote. “They remain in custody, and our hearts are with them and their families.” The restaurant did not respond to a request for comment.Hernán said the pause in business was incredibly hard on a small, family-owned business, especially after the slow summer months. He’s looking for people who live in DC, speak Spanish and English, and are willing to come into work so that they can reopen. “But I don’t know if we can find people,” he said.About a mile away, near the Columbia Heights neighborhood, a sign in Spanish on the door of Elizabeth Pupusería & Deli hung up last week read: “We are closed temporarily during the terrible situation in our larger neighborhood. We hope to serve you again soon. Let’s take care of ourselves and stay safe in our homes.”Elizabeth Rodriguez, a Salvadorian immigrant who owns the restaurant and has been in Washington for roughly 20 years, told the Guardian that the restaurant was fulfilling some orders that prior customers call in, but its doors were not open to the public.“It’s a very ugly thing because the nerves, the nerves go up,” Rodriguez said in Spanish about the situation in DC. “The clients don’t come for the same reason. Our business relied on construction workers because they are the big groups that came to bring various orders for all their colleagues. And they haven’t worked all month.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She hasn’t been able to pay any of her staff these last two weeks – only she and her daughter-in-law are coming in.“We are seeing what we can do so as not to close definitively,” she said. “I know that it is only supposed to be one month, but suddenly it is very complicated because the rent, the bills, you have to pay them the same.“We are asking God for this to change because if we don’t, we can’t pay many months of rent,” she added.The restaurant doesn’t typically allow delivery, but Rodriguez is thinking about changing that if it reopens because so many people don’t want to leave their homes. But even that is difficult, she said.“Today I said, ‘Today is the right time to add delivery,’ so I called DoorDash and he told me that he doesn’t have workers because most of them have been taken and others are afraid to leave.”Ice has reportedly been targeting delivery drivers on mopeds, worsening the crisis for restaurants.Several videos of Ice detaining delivery drivers have spread across social media, and the Washington Postreported, citing anonymous police sources, that Ice is accompanying officers with DC’s Metropolitan police department to conduct traffic stops of moped drivers to check their immigration status.“You don’t want to go outside,” Yonatan Colmenarez, an asylum seeker who came from Venezuela two years ago and has driven a moped around DC, told the Post. “It gives you a kind of emotional damage; you’re not sure who they might be.”Explore more on these topicsWashington DCUS immigrationRestaurantsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It was the 22-year-old’s first career retirement, coming as he led by two sets to one before disaster struck late in the third.‘Hash court’ and high drama: how weed became the US Open’s new distractionRead moreAfter landing heavily on his left arm while stretching for a ball, Shelton grimaced and told his father and coach, Bryan: “I did something to my shoulder. I don’t know what it is.” He later admitted the pain was “really high” and said: “I’ve never retired before. I’m not a guy who would retire if I could continue.” Despite a mid-set visit from the physio and a tactical switch that saw him attempt 13 serve-and-volley plays in the fourth set alone, he could not protect his advantage. Mannarino leveled the contest and, as the crowd braced for a decider, Shelton bowed his head on the changeover and called it off. The Frenchman advanced 3-6, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, ret.Shelton left Louis Armstrong Stadium with his shoulder wrapped in ice, a towel over his head and fighting back tears. Still, he struck a philosophical tone: “I was playing really well, I was in form, a lot of confidence … but I’ve got a lot to be grateful for. You won’t hear me pouting about how bad things are with the summer that I’ve had.”For the 37-year-old Mannarino, ranked 77th in the world, it was a bittersweet breakthrough: his first win over a top-10 opponent at a major in 23 attempts and his first appearance in the second week of the US Open. He will face the Czech No 20 seed, Jiri Lehecka, for a place in the quarter-finals.If that setback was not dispiriting enough for the home crowd, Tiafoe soon followed. The 17th seed, a semi-finalist in New York in two of the past three years, fell flat against German qualifier Jan-Lennard Struff before an overflow crowd on the Grandstand court. The 35-year-old struck 14 aces and never allowed Tiafoe to find rhythm, closing out a 6-4, 6-3, 7-6 (9) upset to reach the last 16 here for the first time.View image in fullscreenFrances Tiafoe suffered his earliest US Open defeat since 2019 on Friday afternoon.Photograph: Maddie Meyer/Getty Images“I played extremely passive today. I didn’t put any pressure on him at all,” Tiafoe said. “It’s going to be hard to swallow how I played today and being out of the US Open this early. I haven’t been this down in a very, very long time.” He also bemoaned the quick conditions on Grandstand, saying he was “late on everything” and never found his timing.Struff, who had already toppled the No 11 seed Holger Rune, extended an unlikely run after failing to win a match at Flushing Meadows since 2020. His reward could be a fourth-round meeting with Novak Djokovic, who was due to face Cameron Norrie in Friday’s night session. For Tiafoe, it marked his earliest exit in New York since 2019.The American had not even realized Shelton had retired until told in his press conference. “That always sucks to go out like that,” he said. “Especially in a grand slam [in a match] where he was probably going to win.”The twin blows leave just two American men standing. Fritz, last year’s runner-up in Queens and a Wimbledon semi-finalist in July, was scheduled to play Swiss qualifier Jérôme Kym on Friday night. Paul, a 2023 Australian Open semi-finalist, had survived a five-set epic against Nuno Borges that ended in the early hours of the morning.Andy Roddick’s 2003 triumph remains the most recent men’s major title for an American. On a bruising afternoon in Queens, the odds of that drought coming to an end next week narrowed considerably.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025TennisUS Open tennisUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Jacksonville kicker Cam Little has a chance to crush the record for the longest successful field goal.He drilled a 70-yarder against the Falconsduring preseason and comfortably clears 72 yards during warmups.CAM LITTLE 70-YARD FIELD GOALStream on@NFLPluspic.twitter.com/OCIZ1W5M5f— NFL (@NFL)August 10, 2025TheNFLinsists preseason stats don’t count towards the archive. Fine. But if there’s one number thatshouldmake the official ledger, it’s Little’s effort against the Falcons. It’s not as though he was booting it through second-string uprights.The 22-year-old should get a chance to turn his asterisk title into the real deal during the regular season. Justin Tucker holds the current record at 66 yards, which seems like light work for Little. Whether new Jags head coach Liam Coen will be comfortable calling for a 70-yarder during a real game remains to be seen.Nate Landman on life as an African NFL player: ‘People don’t believe me at first’Read moreCoen may only rely on Little’s distance when it’s needed for a go-ahead score. Even if Coen is conservative, Little’s range still gives the Jaguars’ offense another unorthodox weapon. With thenew touchback rule, Jacksonville are only one conversion away from being in potential field-goal range. That warps the math for opposing defenses, who already have to worry about Brian Thomas Jr, Travis Hunter, and Dyami Brown ripping the lid off their coverage. Defenses adjust their approach when an offense approaches field-goal range. What is that line of demarcation against Little? Second-and-five from the 40?Little hitting from 70 yards this season is plausible. And hecouldconvert from even further. Mark 21 December on your calendars. The Jags are heading to Denver, where the high altitude has helped multiple kickers break records. Given a chance, Little could shatter Tucker’s mark.Patrick Mahomes watchEvery season, Mahomes breaks a fresh set of records. Up next: Aaron Rodgers’s mark as the fastest quarterback to 250 career passing touchdowns (121 games).Mahomes sits at 245 after 112 regular-season games. That leaves him with five touchdowns to tie, six to own the record outright. He should have it wrapped up by September. In 23 career September games, Mahomes has thrown 62 touchdowns, averaging an absurd 2.7 per game. Based on that average, he would be on course to break the record by Week 2, when the Chiefs host the Eagles.There has been some consternation about the Chiefs’ offense. Last season’s unit was the weakest of Mahomes’s career. Despite another trip to the Super Bowl, KC’s offense was a slog. An undermanned offensive line capsized the team’s vertical passing game, forcing Mahomes to move the ball in five-yard increments. The Chiefs finished last in the league in explosive play rate last season, despite adding speedster Xavier Worthy in the draft.Those same questions linger this year. The new-look offensive line may take time to gel, andRashee Rice has been suspended for six games.Rookie left tackle Josh Simmons will be crucial. If he can offer league-average play, the Chiefs should be able to squeeze more out of the passing game. If he struggles, they will be forced to return to the stilted offense that ground through last season.With Mahomes and Andy Reid on board, it’s best to bet on the former. Outside the offensive line, the Chiefs have focused on adding more speed to their offense, adding former Patriots flameout Tyquan Thornton to their receiving corps. Worthy and Thornton clocked the two fastest times in the preseason, according to NFL Next Gen Stats. Fifth-round pick Brashard Smith, a former wide receiver turned running back, has brought some extra sizzle to the offense. The big-picture outlook is clear: put burners on the perimeter and let Travis Kelce work underneath as Mahomes’ comfort blanket.Regardless of any teething problems along the offensive line, putting explosive receivers around Mahomes is as good a plan as any in the sport. The Rodgers record will be the first to fall, but Mahomes is also chasing a fourth-straight Super Bowl appearance, a feat matched only by Jim Kelly and the Bills.The 500 clubTwenty-two quarterbackshave crossed the 500-yard passing thresholdin a single game. Despite all the rule changes to aid the passing game, none has topped Norm Van Brocklin’s 554 yards from 1951.Could this be the year?It’s tough. The change to the touchback rule will decrease the number of drives where an offense has to drive the length of the field. The formula required to break the record involves a team’s defense being cooked (quickly) and then abandoning its run game. It’s possible, but Van Brocklin’s record is probably safe.More achievable is the mark for themost500-yard games. Ben Roethlisberger owns the record with three. And unlike most quarterbacks who’ve sniffed 500, Roethlisberger’s performances weren’t garbage-time sugar highs. Which brings us to Joe Burrow.Burrow already has two 500-yard games to his name. If the Bengals are to contend for the AFC North, he will probably need another couple. Sure, they havekept Trey Hendrickson, but the Bengals’ defense remains a sieve on paper. There are holes all over the secondary and question marks across the front. Unlessnew DC Al Golden can patch together a serviceable unit, the Bengals will only go as far as Burrow’s arm (and the hands of Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins) can take them.Chasing ThomasSpeaking of the Bengals’ receivers. Michael Thomas’s 149 receptions in 2019 still tops the record books. Cooper Kupp came close with 145 in 2021.Chase is next in line. If the Cincinnati defense is as porous as projected, the Bengals will rely on their passing attack to keep them in games. That’s bad news for the win-loss column, but good news for Chase and his co-star Tee Higgins. The duo combined for 200 receptions and 2,619 yards last season, the highest total of any tandem in the league.The Bengals will need a repeat. Only four duos in NFL history have crossed 3,000 yards combined. Burrow has enough auxiliary weapons to share the love, but Chase and Higgins will still receive the highest dose of targets. Higgins averages 75 catches a year, while Chase posted a career-high 127 last season. Breaking Herman Moore and Brett Perriman’s 3,174 yards combined from 1995 will be a stretch, but hitting 3,000 yards is possible. And if the offense is forced into pass-heavy scripts, Chase could have a shot at breaking Thomas’s mark.There are other contenders. The Vikings will start the season with a depleted receiving corps, which will (somehow) bump up Justin Jefferson’s league-leading target share. Don’t sleep on Amon-Ra St Brown, either. The Detroit receiver finished last year with 115 receptions. With a new offensive coordinator and improved depth at receiver, St Brown may not see the same volume this season. But the Lions’ faltering offensive line could force them to be more of a pass-first unit than they have been previously under Dan Campbell.View image in fullscreenRussell Wilson could be rewriting history soon.Photograph: Pamela Smith/APThe unwanted sack recordOf all the disappointing moments of Aaron Rodgers’ Jets career, this one will have stung: he passed Tom Brady for the most career sacks taken. Rodgers enters his 18th season with571 sacks.Rodgers leads the way, but Russell Wilson is closing in. Wilson lurks just 11 sacks behind Rodgers, despite being drafted seven years later and starting 49 fewer games. It’s a fun subplot to the two aging vets trying to crank out one more season. Can Rodgers keep his sack total low enoughto have Wilson surpass himbeforethe Giantsyank Wilson for Jaxson Dart?Go for it, KeiseanThe NFL’srevised kickoff rulehas been one of the most underdiscussed aspects of the preseason. As noted, a touchback will now be spotted at the 35-yard line. The hope is that it will rejuvenate the return game. The static start remains, with the league looking to limit full-throttle collisions.Last season, the first with a static start, there were only seven return touchdowns. Teams were happy to concede a touchback rather than put the ball in play. But with the touchback moving five yards up the field, the risk-reward calculus has changed. Already, teams, most notablythe Panthers, have dabbled with creative strategies to neuter kick returns. But the expectation is that there will be more action.As the league grapples with strategies around the rule change, we should see an early explosion in the return game. Devin Hester still holds the single-season record with six non-offensive touchdowns, all coming on returns. No returner in the league is Hester. And despite the changes, the current rules still stifle returns compared with Hester’s era. But the rule change has increased the odds of a returner threatening Hester’s number.If one player can do it, it’s Green Bay’s Keisean Nixon.Nixon is a returner and a starting corner, playing in a disguise-laden defense designed to force takeaways. Although he has just three career interceptions, the Packers’ scheme gives corners a chance to punish quarterbacks’ mistakes. To even sniff Hester’s record, a player needs to start on defenseandbe an electric returner. Nixon checks both boxes.For his part, Nixon no longer wants to return kicks. “I’m kind of over it; I don’t really want to do it no more,” Nixon told ESPN in January. “CB1 is not returning kicks”. That’s understandable. But returning kicks is valuable again. History beckons, Keisean!Unlike pick-sixes, turning returns into scores is a discrete skill. Interception totals typically match the skill of a defender, but turning those interceptions into touchdowns is more about luck, timing and the other 10 guys on defense – unless you’re Deion Sanders. DaRon Bland holds the record for pick-sixes in a season (five), in a year in which he was roasted in coverage snap-to-snap.Nixon won’t have a Bland-level season. But if he can snag a pick-six or two, he would have the best shot at Hester’s crown – so long as the Packers can convince him to return kicks.Explore more on these topicsNFLJacksonville JaguarsPatrick MahomesKansas City ChiefsAaron RodgersCincinnati BengalsGreen Bay PackersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The parents and girls described telling coaches of inappropriate behavior at Gardner’s new job, an academy that produced Olympians and is owned by renowned coach Liang “Chow” Qiao.Yet Qiao not only kept Gardner on the job – he promoted him.Associated Press interviews with four parents whose daughters trained under Gardner and a letter obtained by the AP from Gardner’s former employer to clients at her gym revealed that concerns about the coach were reported to gymnastics authorities as far back as 2018 – four years before he was kicked out of the sport.One girl told Qiao during a meeting in 2020 that she had been touched inappropriately by Gardner during training but Qiao said any such contact was inadvertent and intended to save athletes from injury, a parent told AP.“She felt totally invalidated,” the parent said of the response from Qiao, who built his reputation coaching Olympic gold medalists Shawn Johnson and Gabby Douglas and China’s women’s national team.The watchdog responsible for investigating wrongdoing in Olympic sports confirmed to AP that Qiao and several other coaches were privately sanctioned for failing to report sexual misconduct allegations against Gardner after learning about them.Qiao did not return AP emails and phone messages seeking comment. Gardner, 38, has been jailed since his Aug. 14 arrest pending federal court proceedings in Mississippi. He hasn’t entered a plea, and court records don’t indicate if he has a lawyer. He did not return AP messages seeking comment before his arrest.One parent recalled attending a 2019 meeting with the parents of two other girls with Qiao to discuss their daughters’ concerns, including that Gardner was making them uncomfortable in the way he touched them while spotting and by talking about inappropriate subjects.The parent, like the others, spoke to AP on condition of anonymity to protect their daughters. The AP generally does not identify sexual abuse victims.The meeting came more than a year after Gardner’s former employer at a gym in Purvis, Mississippi, Candi Workman, said she discussed concerns with a USA Gymnastics attorney about “troubling behavior” involving Gardner’s “coaching and grooming behavior.”Gardner was removed from the sport in July 2022 after the US Center for SafeSport received a sexual abuse complaint and issued a temporary ban – a move it called “the only reason Gardner was barred from coaching young athletes” until his arrest.The center forwarded that information to Iowa police, and it was another three years before the FBI arrested Gardner on charges of child sexual exploitation. Among the most damning evidence were allegations that he installed a hidden camera in the bathroom of the Mississippi gym to record girls as young as 6 undressing.Gardner’s rise and the sport’s inability to root him out came even as news of Larry Nassar’s decades-long sexual abuse of gymnasts was in the headlines and gyms were implementing safeguards to better protect athletes. It was the inability of USA Gymnastics and the US Olympic Committee to police predators, along with inaction by the FBI after learning of the abuse, that led to SafeSport’s founding in 2017.“This is the same type of behavior where girls aren’t believed. They are cast aside. They are tamped down,” said Megan Bonanni, a lawyer who helped secure a $138.7m settlement for Nassar’s victims over the FBI’s failures.“What we’re seeing with Gardner, it’s multiple institutions failing to act with the urgency that child safety demands. ... Local police, SafeSport, USA Gymnastics and this gym. All of them.”In her first comments on the case, Workman, the Mississippi gym owner, told gymnasts and their parents in a recent letter that she reported “troubling behavior” by Gardner to then-USA Gymnastics lawyer Mark Busby in January 2018.Workman wrote that her concerns were related to “grooming,” which USA Gymnastics defines as a process where a person builds trust and emotional connections with a child for the purpose of sexually abusing them.Workman did not elaborate on what she reported and hasn’t returned messages from AP seeking comment. Busby, whose job at the time related to athlete safety and is now in private practice, declined to comment when reached by AP.The SafeSport center said it was notified by USA Gymnastics in January 2018 that one of its affiliated gyms had resolved a report involving Gardner. But the center said it didn’t investigate further because the report was not related to sexual misconduct and it did not receive detailed information.Despite that, Gardner was able to leave Mississippi for a better job in another USA Gymnastics-affiliated facility – Chow’s Gymnastics and Dance Institute, the West Des Moines, Iowa, gym that had become a mecca for top gymnasts.Chow’s Gymnastics said Gardner passed a standard USA Gymnastics background check when he was hired in 2018.Concerns about his behavior in the gym began soon after, yet Gardner was consistently given more responsibility. Girls in one training group pushed for other adults to intervene, which resulted in the 2019 meeting between parents and Qiao.But not long after that meeting, Chow’s Gymnastics promoted Gardner in January 2020 to head coach of a key girls’ team, telling parents in an email obtained by AP: “He has demonstrated the leadership and put good effort to do his job well.” Gardner was also director of the Chow’s Winter Classic, a meet that draws hundreds of gymnasts to Iowa every year.Chow’s Gymnastics kept Gardner on the payroll after he was arrested in August 2021 for second-offense drunken driving, a crash in which he ran another car off the road and his blood alcohol content recorded more than three times the legal limit for driving. Gardner was sentenced to a week in jail and two years of probation.In a statement, Chow’s Gymnastics said it acted “promptly, responsibly and in full compliance” after it received notice in April 2022 that Gardner was to be barred from one-on-one or unsupervised contact with athletes while SafeSport investigated unspecified misconduct.Chow’s Gymnastics said that it enforced those measures and removed Gardner as head coach. The gym said it fired Gardner in July 2022 after SafeSport strengthened Gardner’s restrictions to a temporary suspension from coaching and all contact with athletes.“Although there had been no finding of misconduct at that time, Chow’s Gymnastics chose to err on the side of protecting its athletes,” the statement said.SafeSport said the sanctions in 2022 against Qiao and the other coaches who failed to report sexual misconduct allegations included warnings, required education, probation, and suspension in one case.The center does not normally comment about specific cases but said in a statement to AP that it has “the ability to correct the record in light of the recent public letter issued by Chow’s Gymnastics and Dance Institute.”The gym’s statement infuriated some parents and former Chow’s pupils who said concerns about Gardner had been widely known. Several of Gardner’s students left the gym beginning in 2019 in what parents called a mass exodus.The parents of one gymnast recalled witnessing Gardner touch another girl’s buttocks while standing behind her during practice. Gardner told the parents that his hand slipped by accident, and the father recalled warning Gardner that there “would be no accidents with my daughter.”When that girl eventually quit the gym due in part to Gardner’s conduct, the father recalled restraining himself when Gardner came out to the parking lot to say he was sorry.Bonanni, the attorney for survivors of Nassar’s abuse, said she is troubled by the slow response in the Gardner case and expects more victims to come forward.“The damage caused by this kind of abuse is permanent, and it’s really long-lasting,” she said. “It changes the trajectory of a young person’s life.”Explore more on these topicsGymnasticsUS sportsUnited States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC)ShareReuse this content"

It’s two fingers in an L shape, framing a box with the No 7, a replication of Son Heung-min’s signature celebration. Nearby, fans are banging on drums, shouting “Ole ole ole ole, LAFC I love you. Wherever even in my dreams, I’ll follow you,” in a mixture of Korean and Spanish, a chant adapted from one belonging to fans of the Suwon Samsung Bluewings in the K-League, Korea’s top division.Growing up in Argentina, Cho was accustomed to soccer being the dominant focus. His friends all supported Boca Juniors. Cho emigrated to America at the age of 17 and settled in Koreatown, where Lionel Messi’s popularity piqued his interest. But it wasn’t until he met other Los Angeles Football Club fans at church that he grew to be a loyal, weekly watcher. Now, his Son Heung-min art will adorn the stands at BMO Field, LAFC’s home stadium where the former Tottenham Hotspur star will make his home debut this weekend.Son’s signing has broken many records: a league-record transfer fee that reportedlyexceeds $26mand jersey sales thatsurpassthe likes of LeBron James and Cristiano Ronaldo. It’s also brought a ripple effect into Koreatown, where the majority of Southern California’s 320,000 Korean Americans live.“I grew up in Argentina and I love Messi, but having Son represent at that kind of level is really humbling. It’s a really proud moment for us as Koreans,” Cho said.View image in fullscreenDaniel Cho, the designer of the Son-inspired flag, stands next to Sam Seig and Angel Salgueroi at a Los Angeles Football Club watchparty in Koreatown.Photograph: Courtesy Daniel Cho/Daniel Cho, the designer of the Son-inspired flag, stands next to Sam Seig and Angel Salgueroi at a Los Angeles Football Club watchparty in Koreatown on August 16, 2025.A moment long in the makingIn some ways, LAFC fans have been preparing for Son’s arrival for years.In 2018, Ben Chi got an invitation from Rich Orosco, LAFC’s chief brand officer, about a mysterious VIP guest. As a previous manager for merchandise at the club, Chi helped launch what was then known as a Korean supporter group, the Tigers. Although the group started as a dozen Korean American soccer fans, it quickly expanded to represent the full diversity of Koreatown residents.Disguised as a meeting with the executives of Riot Games, the gathering turned into a meet and greet with Son himself.“I just couldn’t keep it together,” Chi said of the meeting.‘They have 24 months to milk the hell out of it’: will Son signing open up Asia for MLS?Read moreChi believes that LA itself is a big part of the reason why Son made his move, whether it’s due to fervent supporters, plenty of Korean heritage, or material comforts.“He spent a lot of time in Germany. He spent a lot of time in London. LA can give him a sense of home without actually being home,” Chi said. “He can continue his football journey without feeling like it’s coming to a close in Korea.”Son, of course, is more that just a phenomenal Asian soccer player, or one of the most famous Koreans alive. But there is no doubt that there is a surge in business interest related to his identity.LAFC have completely sold out Son’s primary black jersey online and at the BMO Stadium store, according to a club spokesperson. LAFC more than doubled their subscribers on YouTube, with 70% of the new audience joining from Korea. Son’sTapping Glass” video, announcing his signing, gave the club’s TikTok over 12.5m views and more than 135,000 new followers.“Because he is Korean and there’s a lot of small and large Korean businesses, people want to attach their being or their entity with his likeness and with all the hype that’s surrounded by it right now,” said Jeremy Kim, a partner at Coffee MCO coffee shop in Koreatown.While LAFC and Son have not announced any new LA-based sponsorships, Kim said that he has heard of “a lot of movement, a lot of talks” of different people showing up to the club’s offices for partnership meetings. “If you are a business that has millions in revenue a year, although you may not be named nationally, you are still trying to see if it’s possible to attach a bit to that.”Tourism agencies specializing in Korea-US travel are already seeing a spike in interest.“For us as a travel agency, this ‘Son Heung-min effect’ has opened up a new breakthrough, and we see it as a very meaningful opportunity,” said Pyoungsik Bahk, the president of US Aju Tour. Aju Tour has received more than 400 requests from interested tourists from Korea who want to see Son play and continues to sell special package tours for LAFC games in September and October.Not to be outdone, competitor Samho Tour is also developing add-ons for existing tour packages for Korean and Korean American out-of-state travelers, including adding LAFC home matches for West Coast sightseeing tours in LA and San Diego. Both agencies have had a hard time securing block seating because of thetenfold price increase.When Shohei Ohtani signed a $700m contract for 10 years with the Dodgers in 2023, his presence ushered in new Japanese tourism boom, with the number of tourists from the country doubling from2023 to 2024, according to the LA tourism board. This year, Nikaido became thefirst Japanese shochu brandoffered at Dodger Stadium. You can also now findTsukiji Gindaco’s traditional takoyaki, or fried octopus balls at the concessions.

In 2021, the club signed right-back Kim Moon-hwan, who played for two seasons before he moved to the K-League. While Kim did bring a certain level of excitement, Son’s status as a global star is on another level entirely. David Dong, the owner of BiergartenLA, a German-Korean fusion gastropub in Koreatown, said that before the Chicago-LAFC match, his restaurant received a lot of calls from people interested in watching Son play. By half-time, the restaurant was full with a waitlist to get in.“The past two games, we’ve seen a lot more Koreans and we’ve seen families coming together. We see kids coming, we see parents coming. We are staffing up more than usual. We didn’t anticipate the reception to be this big,” Dong said.Lee has seen similar interest. “My mom works with older ladies at the Korean market and they’re all talking about it. They’re so hyped about this Korean man that they’re enamored with,” he said.Even the Harmonica Grannies, a group of Koreatown retirees who have played theUS national anthem at NHL games, are excited about the prospect of playing in front of Son someday. Many of the retirees, born in the 1940s, still remember playing soccer at a young age in Korea.“Korea was very poor [when they grew up] and soccer was virtually the only sport, as one ball could bring together 10 or 20 children to play. That is why the joy of scoring a goal is still remembered vividly throughout their bodies,” said Hyunok Lee, president of Koreatown Senior and Community Center.All say that in the case of Son, soccer provides a more intergenerational bond between family members than other recent Korean imports that have gained popularity in the States, like K-pop.“You have something to bond about, you have something to watch together, something that crosses those boundaries that would normally be there,” Jeremy Kim added.View image in fullscreenLAFC fans hope Son can be a leader for a team with championship ambitions.Photograph: LM Otero/APThe ‘perfect bridge’ for a more unified LAFernando Delgado remembers pulling up to a watch party at a local Koreatown radio station during the 2018 World Cup.

We just hear everybody shouting ‘Coreano, hermano, ya eres Mexicano [Korean, brother, you’re Mexican now],” Delgado said. “It was an honor, celebrating that win altogether.”Delgado now serves as co-president of the LAFC Tigers supporters group. For him, Son represents a humble leader who can empower theyounger generation of playersat the club. He described this while watching Son’s second match for LAFC, against the New England Revolution, and as he explained this dynamic, as if on cue, Son tapped the ball to his left, providing an assist for teammate Mathieu Choinière.“He’s not like the person boasting or trash-talking out of the field. He’s very respectful and demonstrates that respect and embodies it,” said Delgado.Lee hopes to see Son become the “perfect bridge” and “amazing ambassador” for the city, getting more involved in local charity initiatives since he is so universally loved as a global personality. Son has also been known for his involvement in philanthropic efforts, including donations fornatural disastersand awareness campaigns related tohomelessness. Recently, fans told the Guardian that they saw him in avideo calling for more donations for food aid in Palestineon the UN World Food Programme social media as a Global Goodwill ambassador.“Soccer is all about community. All of the stuff we’ve been through the last year, it’s important to feel a sense of community,” Lee said.Kyeongjun Kim from the Korea Daily contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsLos Angeles FCMLSSouth KoreaUS sportsLos AngelesWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Should I, after three straight second places, have the strength to force the moment to its crisis? Hmm. Maybe not. With all due apologies to the living descendants of TS Eliot, the love song of Mikel Arteta still doesn’t really scan or rhyme or have a clear endnote as yet, even as the six-year anniversary of his appointment as Arsenal manager approaches.This is normal enough. It is obviously incorrect to conclude, as many have, that Arsenal’s managerhas to win a trophy this seasonor be remembered not just as a fraud, but as a Lego-haired billion-pound-spend fraud, the worst kind of fraud there is. Sport doesn’t work in simple metre. Uncertainty is key to its fascination.In reality the Arteta era has brought fresh energy, the team regeared,Champions League status re-established. The winning of cups and pots is hostage to endless variables. The best does not rule out the good. Others must also succeed.Calafiori strikes after goalkeeper’s error as Arsenal grind to win at Manchester UnitedRead moreBy the same token the idea of early-season title deciders is best dismissed as punditry gush, marketing pitch, whiffle around the lighted dais. What can August really tell us? Most teams are in flux right now. Are Chelsea good? Nobody knows. Winter into spring remains the real testing ground, the moment players and managers are asked to stare a little deeper into their own reflection.And yet, and yet, and yet, sometimes all these things can actually be true, or close to true. AndLiverpoolversus Arsenal at Anfield on Sunday afternoon really does look like a key note, not just in terms of final points tallies, but in Arteta’s own trajectory. Because something does need to shift here.There is by now something a little haunting about the uncertainty around this team’s ultimate endpoint, something tender and unformed about the sight of Arteta out there on the touchline in the same primly tailored black jacket and shoes, like a police sniper trying to blend in at a parents’ evening, revolving his hands in that familiar choreography of alarm and dismay.What are we looking at here? What role is Arteta destined to play? Is he the architect of an era? Is he Prince Hamlet? Just another ensemble player? Perhaps even the fool, the man who talked endlessly about winning but somehow forgot to win, the coach who made his players listen to You’ll Never Walk Alone while they trained before one of his early trips to Anfield, then went up there and dutifully lost 4-0?There are good reasons to regard Sunday as a genuine opportunity to shape that dynamic. For a start this isn’t really the third game of a new season. For Arteta it is instead the 117th game of 152, three seasons of work on the same host body that have led in a straight line to this point.View image in fullscreenViktor Gyökeres bullocks and breaks lines in scoring his goals.Photograph: David Price/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesAnd this is the kind of game that can offer a genuine point of ignition. Liverpool are a perfect example of how that can work. There is an on-this-day point here, the kind of Ominous Anniversary stuff football loves to weave into its stories. On Sunday it will be almost exactly six years since an Arsenal team managed by Arteta’s predecessor also travelled to Anfield.That Jürgen Klopp Liverpool team were at a similar point in their lifespan to the current Arsenal: also coming off three seasons of progress, also desperate to end a title drought, also rebalanced around some key recent signings.In the eventLiverpool ran right over Unai Emery’s team, won 3-1, strolled about the place bathed in champion aura, and obliterated the rest of the field from that point. That fixture was, like this one, the third Premier League game of the season. It was also, and here we must cue the eerie, conspiratorial music, Klopp’s own 117th league game of his first three full seasons in charge.At this point the comparison falls away into pattern seeking and general numberwang. Liverpool were champions of Europe at that point. Klopp had been at Liverpool for three full seasons. Arteta has five under his belt. Klopp was also an established alpha manager, winning the league something that always seemed stitched into the arc. Arteta is not this. He’s a chalk sketch, an idea waiting to happen. But the league is also a little different now. And Arteta has a chance to learn something else from Arne Slot’s luminous debut season last year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Anfield this weekend is followed by Nottingham Forest and Manchester City at home and Newcastle away. It will be a high-wire act to get through this more or less intact while bedding in new players. But it is already clear other teams will drop points, that the season is generally more random and rushed and squeezed.Last season Arsenal began like a damp box of matches, dropping 12 points in their first 10 games. This time around they have an opportunity to assert from the off what seems undeniably true, that they have the best-balanced squad of any top team, and in the process take the season by the throat as Liverpool did last time.More to the point, there really are no excuses now. Arsenal have all the tools. Even injuries look like opportunities.Kai Havertz, Bukayo Saka and Martin Ødegaard may be out? Well, here come Eze, Gyökeres and Noni Madueke, all of whom may have played in any case, and who may even be an upgrade in the right form.The midfield looks strong. The defence is set. The goalkeeper is good. Best of all Arsenal’s signings are coherent. They address omissions. A team that have seemed at times trapped within their own structures, chasing the game with all the carefree abandon of a fly buzzing down a window pane, have brought in specialist risk takers.Eze is a genuinely inventive attacker, who needs to be encouraged simply to be this again, to be it more, to the max. The questions around Gyökeres have been along the lines of: is he an Arteta player? The point is that he shouldn’t fit too snugly. He should be awkward.If Gyökeres is physical and boisterous then this is a good thing in a team that can spend a little too long sharpening its scalpel. The goals he scores will tend to be the kind Arsenal wouldn’t have scored before. He bullocks and breaks lines. He does this quite often from the left. Just having a threat on that side may unlock something else in Saka, the world’s most double-teamed man.Arsenal put five past Leeds but lose Ødegaard and Saka to injuryRead moreAll of which sounds encouraging in outline. But fixing your weaknesses creates its own pressure and a significanttype of pressure for a coach who has measured out his managerial life so far in almost-but-not-quites. For Arsenal taking the league to the wire this time will be a question of will, fearlessness, the readiness to lean into those new strengths.Sunday is an obvious first chance. Liverpool will still be favourites to win the game. They’re the champions. They haven’t lost to Arsenal at home since the pre-Klopp era 13 years ago. The new attack looks thrillingly potent. But they have also shown their weaknesses this season. Liverpool’s midfield has looked open.At Newcastle on Monday nightthere was a slight sense of muddle under the barrage of high balls. Gyökeres and Eze, who may make his debut, are good against opponents who like to have the ball and keep a high line.There is at the very least an opportunity here for Arsenal; if not to decide anything right now, then to show a willingness to dare and to feel their own moment flicker a little closer.Explore more on these topicsArsenalLiverpoolPremier LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The young Australian is in a two-horse race to be Formula One world champion this year and his youth, personable nature and easy, dry wit belie a driver possessed of exceptional maturity and the clinical execution familiar in the sport’s greats.Piastri has given every indication he could join them and the resolute determination of the man who would be king is palpable.‘The three sharks’: Wolff excited at possible F1 return of Ecclestone, Horner and BriatoreRead more“I have emotions, I still feel everything that everyone else feels. It’s just that, being blunt, I think a lot of emotions are not that helpful,” he says with candour.Which admission may be considered a little shocking from many 24-year-olds but it is an integral part of what has propelled Piastri to a two-way title fight with his McLaren teammateLando Norris. The Australian currently leads by nine points going into this weekend’s Dutch Grand Prix after a tight fight marked by his equanimity, where he has taken setbacks and victories with the same, almost preternatural calm.“I don’t think there’s any point dwelling on anything longer than you have to,” he says. “It’s important sometimes to get that frustration out, to celebrate, to do whatever, but just because you won last weekend or just because you lost last weekend doesn’t mean that the same thing is going to happen this weekend.”This season, only his third in F1, has been revelatory, marked by this even-handed approach and a ruthless consistent delivery that have brought him six wins and six podiums in 14 races. Aftera spin in the wet in the season-opener at Melbourne, an error promptly consigned to the dustbin of history by the Australian, Piastri has delivered with pretty much impeccable precision.View image in fullscreenIn only his third season in Formula One, Oscar Piastri has driven to six wins and six podium places this year.Photograph: Mark Thompson/Getty ImagesHis race engineer, Tom Stallard, the former Olympic rowing silver medallist, has described him as notable for being both “calm and intense”. While the architect of McLaren’s success, team principal Andrea Stella, summed up his strengths after a dominant win in Bahrain earlier this season by aptly noting: “No hesitations, no inaccuracies, everything that was available he capitalised on.”Piastri’s attitude might be considered somewhat cold-blooded. As a person, he is clearly anything but. However, the strategy is doubtless effective. It’s an approach sport psychologists would recognise but it seems one honed by circumstance as he single-handedly pursued his career having moved to the UK when he was 14. His father, Chris was with him for six months, before returning to Australia and after which Piastri looked after himself.Once I learned to control things I could control and not worry about everything else in life it probably naturally translated to racingOscar Piastri“There’s definitely been a lot of lessons through experiences, when you’ve been racing for 15 years now, there’s a lot of tough moments in there,” he says. “There’s obviously the challenges of just going racing but then there’s the challenges of moving from home. Learning how to navigate life alongside racing, being far away from your family and friends, which I’m sure has moulded me to some degree as well.“I never had any dramatic life experiences in my childhood but even just little things of having to make decisions for yourself and problem-solve. Once I learned to control things I could control and not worry about everything else in life it probably naturally translated to racing.”That was on display in Baku last year whenPiastri gave a masterclass of drivingcontrol under enormous pressure. Having taken the lead from Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc, he then defended it for 30 laps as the Monegasque driver ducked and dived and all but hurled himself at the Australian’s gearbox. To no avail as Piastri took his second and still perhaps the best win of his career. His reaction to Stallard was a simple, unflustered exclamation of “Yes!” over the radio as he took the flag.Table of points won by Piastri and NorrisThere is depth here too. Piastri is a thoughtful character and slowly considers a response when asked how he assesses himself and his approach. “There’s obviously all the work that goes on behind the scenes of how to actually drive a race car fast,” he says. “But an important thing is always kind of dissociating the results of a weekend from how I felt I performed.“So there’s been races I’ve won this year or in my career that I would probably rank as worse performances than races I’ve finished fourth or fifth. Just getting myself in the right mindset, essentially being quite calm, quite relaxed is what I think I need.”Comparisons then have unsurprisingly been made between Piastri and Alain Prost – “The Professor” – and they are valid on many levels. The Australian is as measured a perfectionist on track in the mould of the four-time champion Frenchman and with a similarly calculating and considered air. Ten race meetings remain in the run-in, each of which could be vital in the title fight and much as Piastri knows it, he remains unconcerned.View image in fullscreenOscar Piastri (right) insists that he and his teammate Lando Norris will stay friends during their battle for the title.Photograph: Clive Rose/Getty Images“There is going to naturally be tension,” he says. “There’s naturally going to be pressure and emotions from that but it doesn’t necessarily weigh heavily on me. I’m honestly just more excited. If I was not in a championship fight, I’d be trying to attack things the same way. Obviously the tension around the position we’re in is naturally going to be higher but I’d be trying to do the same thing regardless of where I am in the championship.”That there is more to the young man than an iron will over his emotions, however, is also clear by Piastri’s popularity. His laid-back public persona is engaging and likable and has struck a chord with F1’s new generation of young, enthusiastic fans, a demographic in which Norris too shares a similar popularity. One of them will be champion and the pair have, unusually, remained friendly even as they are going head to head this season. But will it last?“There’s obviously going to be tension at points, ultimately we’re fighting for something that we’ve both dreamed of since we were kids,” says Piastri. “But our relationship is honestly probably stronger than it has been from the start. There’s obviously going to be a loser to this championship and that’s going to be not that pleasant for whoever that is but however this championship goes it’s been a good fight already and I think there’ll be a lot of respect both ways.”No exaggerated theatrics then, simply a very reasonable kid, being eminently reasonable. Which is Piastri writ large. There will not be histrionics in what is likely to be a nail-biting contest but rather the poker-face of a player at ease with himself amid the maelstrom of a hopefully memorable title fight.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneOscar PiastriMcLarenLando NorrisMotor sportAustralia sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But with tennis sidelined in favor of awkward small talk, it risks alienating its core supportersOwen LewisFri 29 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 29 Aug 2025 05.01 EDTShareOn the first day of this year’s US Open, Alexandra Eala came back from 5-1 down in the third set to upset Clara Tauson in front of a rapturous crowd, Novak Djokovic rope-a-doped a fresher opponent barely half his age, Rebeka Masarova hit an overhead smash into the only racket-sized area inside the lines that would ensure she lost the point, and Daniil Medvedevall but incited a riotin the stands of Louis Armstrong Stadium while down match point.Amidst the overstimulating slate of matches, the US Open quietly published the first episode of the dating video series Game, Set, Matchmaker on their official YouTube channel. In it, host Ilana Sedaka, a figure skater and influencer, had a blind date with Ronnie, a lacrosse coach. They exchanged bright smiles and music tastes. They bonded over their love of Drake – what were the odds? Though the date took place on US Open grounds with players practicing in the background, very little of the conversation concerned tennis. It is Ronnie’s first time at the US Open: “This place is insane,” he said. Slap it on a poster.“Are you a tennis fan?” Sedaka asked midway through. “I just got, kind of got into it last year,” Ronnie said. At video’s end, Sedaka offered Ronnie a ticket to the US Open so he could join her on a second date. Ironically for a piece presumably intended to generate interest in tennis, it cut off as they walked onto the grounds. The next episode, a charmingly awkward date between influencer Emma and fitness trainer Natalie, featured no tennis talk but 30 seconds or so on the NFL.The videos begged the question of why exactly the US Open had provided the platform. Perthe New York Times, a United States Tennis Association spokesperson’s reasoning for the series was that it is “trying to attract an entirely new audience, reaching fans at the intersection of tennis, pop culture and entertainment”. The trouble is that tennis seems absent in the first two episodes of Game, Set, Matchmaker aside from the backdrop. The videos sputtered to modest viewcounts, outpaced by virtually all of the match highlight reels alongside it on the same channel. It seemed that those who came to the US Open’s channel did so to watch some of the US Open.It’s difficult to imagine anybody becoming a tennis fan on account of these episodes under any circumstances, but the rollout of Game, Set, Matchmaker couldn’t have helped. The episodes’ release schedule wasn’t readily available, and mere days before the pilot dropped, the format changed from a Bachelorette-style series, in which Sedaka would go on dates with different men, to eight distinct couples on their first dates. (Maybe Ronnie proved an unexpected keeper?) But many fans had less of a bone to pick with the format than the idea itself – why was this relevant to a tennis tournament, again? The US Openset a new attendance record in 2024, welcoming more than one million fans through its gates. Tennis participation in the USis spiking. The overall prize pot at the US Open is up 20% from 2024, itself then a record high. Game, Set, Matchmaker implies a lack of faith in a product that by all appearances is doing very well.Game, Set, Matchmaker isn’t the first attempt to find new tennis fans by eschewing the tennis of it all. Break Point, the short-lived tennis Netflix series, was cripplingly reliant on player access and allergic to showing tennis footage from a recognizable angle. An episode in which Carlos Alcaraz defeated Djokovic in a pulsating five-set Wimbledon final bizarrely featured Holger Rune as its protagonist. The show depicted the flow of a match as a trio of momentum swings: one player seized the initiative, mentally floundered, then recovered to seize victory. Forehands and backhands were neglected; tactics may as well not have existed. The show seemed geared more towards convincing viewers to follow various players on social media than to watch them play tennis.As if anticipating their own intense disappointment with Break Point, hardcore fans repeated that they were not the target audience, like a mantra, in the lead-up to its release. This was true; the goal was to create new fans, not comfort existing ones. But too often, this goal is used as an excuse for disappointing existing fans, or presenting a distorted picture of reality. In April, Netflix released an Alcaraz-focused documentary called My Way, presenting his tumultuous 2024 season. Alcaraz won Wimbledon that year when Djokovic netted a backhand return off a second serve. My Way instead depicted match point as a cinematic, hard-hitting rally that ended with Alcaraz demolishing a forehand winner. If Netflix felt it had to embellish the match to the point of misleading the viewer, you wonder why they bothered making the documentary in the first place. Other sports have dabbled in the Netflix treatment, too, in attempts to emulate the wildly successful Drive To Survive. None have matched that success; like Break Point, cycling and rugby docs were canceled.Themixed doubles tournamentpreceding this US Open, too, aimed to capture viewers through means aside from the tennis they played. The Open cannibalized the format with singles stars, forcing out almost all of the doubles specialists who had tailored their skills to the format – and who, unlike top singles players, rely on these tournaments to make a living. But even that wasn’t enough. Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz partnered for the tournament; being young, attractive stars, they were inevitable fodder for fanfiction and shipping. Most would just expect such fantasizing to come from fans, rather than official tournament accounts. The US Open leaned into the partnership, hard, and luckily for them Alcaraz and Raducanu played ball rather than running for the hills. The tactic successfully sacrificed dignity for outsized attention. On one point, against Jack Draper and Jessica Pegula, Raducanu defended a series of attacks only to be passed by a Draper backhand. Thinking the point was over, Raducanu hung her head, and into her peripheral vision raced Alcaraz to rescue the rally with a forehand winner around the net. They laughed delightedly, white teeth flashed. I forwarded such telegenic clips of Alcaraz and Raducanu to my tennis-curious partner, who didn’t watch the tournament but later offered “I ship Emmaraz.” I even caught myself enjoying the pair’s first-round loss.These style-over-substance tactics are often a slap in the face, either to the mixed doubles players who had spent their lives training for and excelling at the format, or to the hardcore fan. They’re also about fame and fandom more than the sport itself. The film Challengers had many virtues and achieved the rare coup of thrusting tennis into mainstream discourse, anddid not shy away from the sport itself. The film returned to the pivotal showdown between two protagonists throughout its runtime, taking care to highlight key moments. We saw the match take shape. We saw the players’ contrasting styles. We saw sweat drip from their bodies. We saw tennis as it was: a prolonged, unpredictable crucible of stress dotted with moments of brilliance. The film ended with players and spectators alike celebrating a particularly spectacular point.Nonfiction tennis is frustratingly resistant to doing the same, despite a dream cast of stars.After years of catastrophizing about a world after Serena Williams and the Big Three, a handful of supernaturally talented successors have fallen into the sport’s lap. Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have taken to playing in the final of every big tournament lately, drawing comparisons to great rivalries of old. Iga Swiatek and Aryna Sabalenka have each enjoyed spells of dominance on the WTA yet have no shortage of talented competitors. When tennis is at its best, people tend to enjoy it. The US Open and other tournaments would do well simply to highlight such instances and do their best to get them in front of as many eyes as possible. If someone isn’t interested in that, tennis probably isn’t for them, and that’s OK, too.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025US Open tennisTennisUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They have moved quickly to land Xavi Simons, who has been touted as a certainty to join Chelsea for much of the past month, and must be relieved not to have fallen victim to yet another late hijack.There were understandable nerves at Spurs as they raced to complete a £51.8m deal to sign Simons from RB Leipzig. Previous attempts to bolster Thomas Frank’s options in attacking midfield had not gone well. Where next after Eze and Gibbs-White? Spurs have made a hugely encouraging start under Frank, who has won his first two league games by an aggregate score of 5-0, but they needed something extra in the final third. Son Heung-min has gone; James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski are out. Mohammed Kudus has impressed since joining from West Ham for £54.5m but he is at his best on the right. The arrival of extra creativity is highly welcome. The element of surprise around Simons has given Spurs fans rare joy.Spurs stun Etihad again as Johnson and Palhinha strikes sink Manchester CityRead moreFrank was still treading carefully at his press conference before Saturday afternoon’s home game against Bournemouth. He would not talk about Simons, even though the Netherlands international was clearly at the training ground. Frank smiled. Asked about a potential signing, he confirmed there was a new international in the building: Djed Spence, who has just received his first England call-up.Smartly dodged. Frank was less evasive on other issues, saying that Spurs are unlikely to be in the market for another centre-back. He talked about the importance of having options in every position. Spurs, who must deal with thedemands of the Champions League, had huge injury problems last season. Simons will give them vital depth.Chelsea looked long and hard at him. There was constant talk about the 22-year-old waiting for the west London club to make their move. The suggestion was that Chelsea were waiting to sell Christopher Nkunku.Yet Chelsea believed that strengthening at left-wing was a bigger priority. They have focused on securing a £40m agreement for theManchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho. The situation with Simons was more relaxed. There was never a bid from Chelsea, who have caused surprise by opening talks to loan Brighton’s Facundo Buonanotte.View image in fullscreenThomas Frank will be delighted to have signed Xavi Simons.Photograph: Marc Atkins/Getty ImagesSpurs saw an opportunity. They advanced on Wednesday, contacting Leipzig. A bid was submitted on Thursday and Simons was brought to London. Was it really happening? The memory of Chelsea stealing in front of Spurs to sign Willian from Shakhtar Donetsk in 2013 lingered. Willian had already done his Spurs medical.This time, though, Chelsea had no intention of spoiling the party. They will watch on with interest. The obvious question is whether Simons can adapt to English football. Leipzig do not seem especially bothered about losing him. There have been reports in the German media criticising Simons’ attitude, although that can be interpreted as the standard briefs against a player making no secret of his desire to leave. Frank was asked about his “No Dickheads” policy.“I actually don’t think there are any people who are a dickhead,” he said. “You’re probably a psychopath if you are. Most people have not been guided well enough. A lot of them need to get guided. It’s human nature. We want to be part of a clan. Part of something. You feel you are accepted, you want to do more.”The challenge with Simons is to mould him into a consistent performer. He has never quite found a home. He came through Barcelona’s academy but left for Paris Saint-Germain in 2019. Next came PSV, although not for long. The bouncing around continued, PSG re-signing Simons in 2023 and immediately loaning him to Leipzig, who eventually bought him permanently this year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is said he is at his best in a 4-3-3. He had a variety of roles for Leipzig: sometimes a No 8, sometimes on the left, sometimes a cog in a box midfield. Frank can give him clarity.The Spurs manager is flexible and adaptable. He used a solid 5-3-2 when Spurs facedPSG in the Super Cupand an open 4-3-3 when they beat Burnley at home on the opening day. In last weekend’s triumph at Manchester City Frank used a high press and a physical midfield of Rodrigo Bentancur, Pape Matar Sarr and João Palhinha.“I think when you see players perform their best, most likely they play in one position,” Frank said. “But that is not to say they can’t play across a front four or front three. Modern football is much more flexible now.”Frank sees different ways to mould his midfield. It is interesting that Spurs have gone for an array of profiles in the final third. Gibbs-White, Eze and Simons have different strengths. Simons has to find his place. He has had a restless career, stability eluding him. Choosing the Spurs project gives him a chance to rediscover the level that meant he was feted as one of the best playmakers in Europe when he was striving for his breakthrough at Barça. It gives him a chance to be part of something.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurTransfer windowfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Tuchel has also dropped Kyle Walker and Curtis Jones and there was no room for Jack Grealish.Trent Alexander-Arnold left out of England squad for World Cup qualifiersRead moreTuchel was keen to draw a line under the Bellingham episode, which eruptedwhen he discussed the midfielder’s “edge”in a live interview with TalkSport, one that can make the player blow up during matches and come across in a way that “can be a bit repulsive”. Tuchel admitted his mother sometimes had mixed emotions when watching Bellingham play. What Tuchel most wanted to stress was that his choice of word in his second language had been poor and he was sorry.“I used this word unintentionally,” he said. “There was no message, no hidden agenda. I fully understand that it’s my responsibility, that I created the headlines and I’m sorry for the upset. I should have known better. I should have done better. If someone makes the effort to listen to the whole answer he would clearly understand the appreciation that I have for the player.“When I was aware of the headlines, I made contact straight away [with Bellingham]. Jude focuses now on his rehabilitation and we focus on Andorra and Serbia. Is it sorted? I hope so. It was in English so I don’t think my mum was fully aware of it. She had the right to be annoyed at me.”Tuchel described Alexander-Arnold as a player who “needs to feel trust and love from his manager and teammates, from his club, his country, the fans”. He made the point that the right-back had a lot going on when he called him up for the first time in June for theaway game in Andorraand thefriendly against Senegalat the City Ground. He would give him minutes only against Andorra – as a 64th-minute substitute. Alexander-Arnold had just signed for Real Madrid, he was preparing for his unveiling straight after the camp when he would speak in fluent Spanish and then it was off to the Club World Cup.Yet Tuchel also made it plain that the decision to drop Alexander-Arnold was based on merit, with Reece James and Livramento in better form. He also suggested that another right-back, Ben White, might have been selected if he had not been injured, thereby ending a lengthy international exile.“I spoke to Trent, it was a difficult phone call but I wanted that he hears it from me, which he appreciated,” Tuchel said. “He was very clear that he’s desperate to come back and play forEngland. It is a competitive decision, first and foremost.”Tuchel reserves the right to adopt different approaches with different players, which he appears to have done with Myles Lewis-Skelly. The 18-year-old left-back has been retained in the squad, despite having lost his starting place at Arsenal to Riccardo Calafiori this season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But now it comes with a responsibility from us to not drop him on the first occasion just because he does not start. It is a fine line.”Tuchel’s tenure has featured three wins out of three in qualifying and the loss against Senegal. His football has generally failed to quicken the pulse, which he attributes in part to him calling up a large number of players and the difficulty in building any rhythm across the March and June get-togethers, the latter being especially tough in terms of timing.The fixtures will come thicker and faster in the autumn and Tuchel, having picked a leaner 24-man squad, is determined to instil clearer patterns and identity – and to see a spirit of collective sacrifice.“The players need to drop their club hats, the way they play in their clubs and buy into our ideas,” Tuchel said. “We will see them. I’m very sure of that because they will be very clear.”Explore more on these topicsEnglandJude BellinghamThomas TuchelnewsShareReuse this content"

Meanwhile, two of his forwards – Rasmus Højlund and Antony – neared the Old Trafford exit on Friday.Amorim offered the remarkable insight into his personality at the end of a week in which he stirred uncertainty over his future with comments made after his teamlost at Grimsby in the Carabao Cup. On Friday he said he intended to continue at United after the international break and thought he would do so but that he could not make any promises on his future.Manchester United agree £40m fee with Chelsea for sale of Alejandro GarnachoRead moreAfter the Grimsby gameAmorim said “something has to change”and that “my players spoke really loud about what they want”. Asked about those remarks as he prepared for Saturday’s home game against Burnley, he expressed no regret.“Every time that we have in the future one defeat like that, I’m going to be like that,” he said. “I’m going to say that sometimes I hate my players, sometimes I love my players, sometimes I want to defend my players.“This is my way of doing things and I’m going to be like that. In that moment I was so frustrated and annoyed. And I know you have a lot of experienced people talking about the way I should perform with the media, to be more constant, to be more calm. I’m not going to be like that.”Amorim believes United’s problems start in the players’ heads. “I feel the players are always thinking about the past,” he said. “They think there is something in the water here or in the food. It’s in our minds. We just need to think about the next game. We dropped a level [against Grimsby]. Now we have to respond in the next game.”After playing Burnley, United resume their season on 14 September at Manchester City. Amorim was asked whether he could confirm he would be in charge after the break. “I don’t know what is going to happen,” he said. “That is my idea. But again, I am not going to promise you anything – what is going to be the future. But I’m the manager of Manchester United and I think that is not going to change.”The Portuguese said he understood how his post-Grimsby reaction had caused uncertainty regarding whether he would resign. “If you have this kind of behaviour, you have to understand that you have things that are good [from] that type of behaviour, that you have the other side of the coin,” he said. “So I understand that.View image in fullscreenManchester United have agreed a season-long loan deal with Napoli for Rasmus Højlund.Photograph: Visionhaus/Getty Images“And again, sometimes I want to quit, sometimes I want to be here for 20 years.

I don’t need anyone.” After likening his extreme feelings for his players to those he has for his children, saying “sometimes I hate my kids”, he suggested improved results would make him less likely to “suffer”. “We just need to win some games and then things will be easier to do.”Amorim’s inflexible adherence to a 3-4-3 shape can draw criticism. He has said that formations do not matter so was asked, then, why he was unwilling to change. “If I feel it is best to change [I will],” he said. “We need to be so good in this way of playing and then we are going to adapt. When everyone is doing this with his eyes shut then we are going to do different things. This is the fun part.”United agreed a season-loan deal with Napoli for Højlund on Friday. The deal includes an obligation to buy worth €44m (£38m) if Napoli qualify for the Champions League. The player still needs to accept the move to the Serie A side and could stay in Manchester. The club also accepted a £25m bid for Antony from Real Betis, a huge loss on the Brazilian, who was signed on 1 September 2022 for £82m, though there is a 50% sell-on clause.As the Guardian reported this week,Kobbie Mainoo wishes to leave. But Amorim said he valued the midfielder. “I want Kobbie to stay,” he said. “He needs to fight for his place, and we need Kobbie. So that is not going to change. I understand that the players that are not playing at this moment are disappointed. You have to fight during the week [in training].”Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedRuben AmorimnewsShareReuse this content"

I would never make a promise like that to any player.”Nonetheless Newcastle’s almost-completedcapture of the £70m Germany striker Nick Woltemadefrom Stuttgart has cleared the way for Liverpool to make a record bid for Isak. An offer approaching £130m could finally conclude their summer-long pursuit of the Swede, who spent most of the close season refusing to train with or play for Howe’s team.Until as recently as last week some Newcastle executives had appeared determined to keep Isak but that stance has now softened appreciably. The mood shifted on Monday when the club’s minority owner Jamie Reuben was joined by representatives of the majority stakeholders, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, at Isak’s Northumberland home It is understood Isak proved resistant to their attempts to broker a rapprochement and was not interested in the offer of a lucrative new contract.Although Howe attempted to play a straight bat, he suggested Isak’s determination never to play for Newcastle again dictated that it may be the right moment for a richly talented player he had initially hoped to keep to exit Tyneside. “Of course I would have a preference,” he said regarding whether Isak remained or departed. “But ultimately you have got to look at all the information. I have a footballing preference but then you have to take everything else into account. You can’t just be oblivious to things that have happened.View image in fullscreenNewcastle’s Joelinton leaves the field in tears on Monday, but his groin injury is not as bad as first feared.Photograph: Scott Heppell/Reuters“But I have no control over it. That’s for other people to decide. I’m not in control of those discussions. I’m focusing on trying to bring new players into the team.”Tellingly, Howe – who has not spoken to Isak for about a fortnight and has had no contact with the 25-year-old since that provocative Instagram post – is hoping Newcastle’s continued pursuit of Brentford’s Yoane Wissa and the Wolves centre-forward Jørgen Strand Larsen will equip him with a second attacking signing capable of partnering Woltemade.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sandro Tonali has only an outside chance of passing a late fitness test on a shoulder problem.More positively, Joelinton’s groin injury is not regarded as long term and Howe hinted his squad’s collective morale had strengthened in Isak’s absence. “The squad dynamic is very strong at the moment,” he said. “I wouldn’t have said that in the first two weeks of pre-season, though.”Perhaps significantly, Isak participated in that opening fortnight before embarking on his solitary strike. “The players have been through a lot this summer and there was a lot of distraction but, since then, they’ve been really strong,” Howe said. “We’re in a really good place now. I think the squad still needs a bit of work just in terms of finishing touches to make this a really successful window.”Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedEddie HoweTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

Thanks to the style Cifuentes wants to implement, that was for the most part of the opening exchanges.Survival was the Spaniard’s primary ambition while in charge at QPR. Having succeeded Ruud van Nistelrooy after Leicester’s slide into the second tier, it is now about revival.With only eight minutes gone, Fatawu rifled in the opener. Some hesitant defending from Ethan Laird caused confusion in Birmingham’s rearguard, in turn allowing the teenager Louis Page to slip the ball to the Ghana international, who casually cut inside before smashing it into the top corner of the net.View image in fullscreenAbdul Fatawu (left) scores Leicester’s opening goal in the eighth minute.Photograph: David Davies/PABirmingham finally began to build some rhythm midway through the first half but they still struggled to properly test a rearguard marshalled by Jannik Vestergaard.If the visitors have a weakness, it is failing to create the number of clearcut opportunities Davies would like. One appeared to have presented itself midway through the first half when the ball fell kindly at Tomoki Iwata’s feet on the edge of the box. But, rather than shoot, the Japanese midfielder elected to try to pass instead. It summed up their work after Fatawu’s goal – plenty of promise but very little threat.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

No major league has held a domestic game on foreign territory, despite prolonged attempts from the Spanish top flight to do so. Uefa’s signoff would clear a huge section of path, although the plan also requires approval from Fifa, US Soccer and Concacaf.European football: Mbappé and Vinícius fire Real Madrid past OviedoRead moreThere is a broad acceptance within Uefa that the proposal will be difficult to reject without altering its statutes. Even then the plan appears to have irresistible momentum. Potential legal arguments against moving matches abroad have lost weight since the US-based promoter Relevent Sports agreed a settlement with Fifa in April 2024 to dismiss the global governing body from a lawsuit challenging its policy of barring league games from being staged in other countries.It means the proposal, first made byLa Ligabefore being approved and submitted by the Spanish federation (RFEF), stands a high chance of being accepted. It is unclear whether that would be on a one-time basis or whether the broader principle of taking league games overseas would be agreed to.If Uefa decides not to obstruct the move it is likely discussions will begin regarding potential limits to the number of times domestic games can be held in other countries. Potential ideas include allowing two games a season to be moved as long as they are between the same teams, so that perceived home or away advantage is neutered.Meetings involving the various stakeholders are understood to have taken place on the sidelines of thedraws for this season’s Uefa club competitions, which were held in Monte Carlo, and are expected to continue over the weekend. Executives from Relevent Sports, which was appointed this year as Uefa’s worldwide marketing and sales partner for the period between 2027 and 2033, have been conspicuous throughout the season launch event on the Côte d’Azur.Any move to approve the match, which would take place at the Miami Dolphins’ Hard Rock Stadium, would sit uncomfortably within Uefa’s corridors of power. In an interview this week the Uefa president, Aleksander Ceferin, said: “I don’t think it’s a good thing.” Ceferin expressed unhappiness with the plan but, in line with other key figures within Uefa, admitted legal recourse was limited.The Italian football federation has given approval for a match between Milan and Como to take place in Perth, western Australia, in February. The reasoning provided is a venue clash with the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games. The viability of that fixture will also enter Uefa’s thinking.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As injury after injury rolled in during the first four months of last season, Miquel cut an increasingly baffled figure at her side’s constant run of bad fortune and her lack of centre-forward options. Jutta Rantala, Lena Petermann and Noémie Mouchon sustained season-ending injuries; Shana Chossenotte was troubled by recurrent injury issues; and Deanne Rose and Hannah Cain continued their recovery from long-term problems. The defensive midfielder Saori Takarada and Ruby Mace were among those given a try-out in the No 9 role as Miquel tried to find a solution.An impressive 1-1 draw at home to Chelsea in December proved a turning point. A strong finish meant Leicester recorded their highest WSL points tally, securing 10th place. They were a team built on solid defensive play, quick transitions and a strong trust in young players – a hallmark of Miquel’s style – and the foundations looked to have been laid for the coming campaign.There has been player turnover this summer and recruitment has been a challenge. Seven players have left, leading to a loss of experience. Petermann, Takarada and CJ Bott returned home and the departures of the ever-present Sophie Howard to FC Como and Yuka Momiki to Everton will have been a blow.Only three players have come through the door. The 18-year-old goalkeeper Katie Keane is one of the Republic of Ireland’s brightest young talents and made the move from Shamrock Rovers. The experienced midfielder Celeste Boureille arrived from Montpellier and Heather Payne also signed.Leicester’s problems could mount rapidly given their tough start. They face Manchester United and Chelsea in the first three games, a challenge that has become more difficult in recent days.How they finished in the past five seasonsHow they finished in the past five seasonsThe managerThe rumour mill is circling around who Miquel’s replacement could be, with Matt Beard a strong contender after his shock departure from Burnley. As it stands the team are manager-less at a time when several key rivals are recruiting significantly. Whoever comes in will have their work cut out and will need to get a young team up to scratch very quickly to avoid a washout.Off-field pictureThe appointment of Lee Billiard as director of women’s and girls’ football was regarded as a coup after his four-year spell at Aston Villa as Leicester look to build for success on the pitch and commercially. Now without a manager and assistant manager – Amaury Messuwe also departed – he will be busy as the season approaches, with the squad also needing to be bolstered. Will the decision to remove Miquel prove to be the making or breaking of his tenure at the club?Last season’s resultsLast season’s resultsStar signingIn a relatively quiet summer to date, Payne has been the signing that has caught the eye. The Republic of Ireland international arrived after two years at Everton and getting over recent injury struggles. A versatile wide player, the 25-year-old has the attacking attributes to thrive as a winger but can equally be used as a full-back or wing-back. With more than 50 caps, she adds to Leicester’s growing international contingent and played a significant role in Ireland’s inaugural World Cup appearance in 2023.View image in fullscreenHeather Payne in action for Republic of Ireland against Turkey in the Nations League last February.Photograph: Stephen McCarthy/Sportsfile/Getty ImagesStepping up:The 17-year-old Nelly Las has had a year to remember for club and country and signed a new contract this summer. Her transition from Leicester’s academy, which she joined at the age of nine, to the senior setup has appeared seamless. She made her debut in the League Cup in October 2024 and has since been a regular in the matchday squad. A dynamic full-back, Las can play on either flank and was also utilised further forward by Miquel. She was a core member of the England squad that finished fourth at the Under-17 Women’s World Cup last autumn before helping the Under-19s qualify for next year’s U20 World Cup.It was a good summer for…Olivia Clark and Cain made history this summer as part of the Wales team that competed at Euro 2025. Clark, a goalkeeper, played in two of Cymru’s three matches. Cain, a forward, was a starter in their opener against the Netherlands before coming off the bench against France and England. She announced herself on the European stage with a finely taken goal against the Lionesses. Although Wales lost all three group games, it was a memorable summer for Rhian Wilkinson’s side, a first taste of major tournament football on which to build for the future.View image in fullscreenHannah Cain in action for Wales against England at Euro 2025 in Switzerland.Photograph: Eurasia Sport Images/Getty ImagesMain initiative to attract more fansLeicester will continue to play at the King Power Stadium, with season ticket and matchday packages provided.

I’m very confident that he’s played in the league for so many years.“We have to put him in the positions and scenarios where he can deliver those moments which are the reason why we brought him here: to give us something different, something unexpected, and we will adapt to more what is necessary as we know the outcome of that is really big.”Arsenal agreed a deal with Bayer Leverkusen to sign Hincapié on an initial loan, with an option to make the Ecuador defender’s move permanent next summer for €52m (£45m).Hincapié, who is understood to have already agreed personal terms for his move to north London, is expected to complete his medical over the weekend before becoming Arsenal’s eighth signing of the summer. His impending arrival is likely to lead to the departure of Jakub Kiwior to Porto in a loan deal that includes an obligation for the Poland defender to make the move permanently next summer for up to €27m, with interest also building in Oleksandr ZinchenkoView image in fullscreenPiero Hincapié is close to offering Mikel Arteta another versatile defensive option.Photograph: Jürgen Fromme/firo sportphoto/Getty ImagesArteta’s side have already spent more than £250m on new players in this transfer window and Arsenal had been looking to structure their move for Hincapié as an initial loan so they do not fall foul of Uefa’s regulations on financial fair play. They are believed to have discussed the deal with Leverkusen officials on Friday and reached an agreement over the 23-year-old, who had a release clause of €60m but expressed his wish to leave. Hincapié, who can play as a left-sided centre‑back or left-back, joined the Bundesliga club from the Argentinian side Talleres in 2021 and has 46 caps for his country.Kiwior had interest from Crystal Palace but preferred to join Porto, who have agreed to pay around £2m to take the 25-year-old on loan for the season before he completes his permanent move. Arsenal did not want to sanction his departure until they had secured a replacement and are now stepping up their efforts to offload other fringe players before Monday’s transfer deadline.Marseille have enquired about signing Zinchenko, although the Ukrainian’s wages could be a stumbling block. Fulham and Palace have both been in talks over Reiss Nelson, while Stuttgart are expected to step up their efforts to sign the Portugal midfielder Fábio Vieira before the end of the window.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The forward was out for more than three months after surgery on his right hamstring in December and has picked up the latest injury in his other leg.“He does not need surgery,” said Arteta. “It’s not as bad as the previous one. He felt something, so he will be out for a couple of weeks. But it is obviously a concern, a big one, especially when we talk about a sprinter and a player that gets into that zone very often in a football match, who needs that burst, that change of rhythm of pace to be as threatening as possible.“But we will learn again as to why it happened and make him stronger.

Liverpool won the league with four matches to spare and a 10-point cushion over Sunday’s opponents, Arsenal, but Slot has warned his players not to forget how difficult it was to break clear. Theadditions of Florian WirtzandHugo Ekitiké– and quite possibly Alexander Isak before the transfer deadline – were designed to make Liverpool a more dominant force.Blockbuster Champions League draw is intriguing but ultimately irrelevant | Jonathan WilsonRead more“I tell this to the players as well – not every game last season was Tottenham away[6-3]or West Ham away[5-0],” said Slot. “ Always if you win something, everybody only looks back at some great attacks or some great wins, but the amount of times we struggled last season in a game was a lot. To romanticise last season as much as we do – and sometimes we make this mistake inside the building as well; I mean the players – is incorrect. Last season was, every single time, a struggle. Most wins were only by one goal and we had to fight really hard for it.“We didn’t win the league as [Manchester] City did for so many years with every single game being 4-0 up at half-time. We had to fight really hard for it. We need to improve but we had to improve compared to last season and we need to improve because the competition has improved.”Slot, who confirmed Andy Robertson is Liverpool’s vice-captain this season, believes the early-season struggles of the defenders Ibrahima Konaté and Milos Kerkez are part of the adaptation process.View image in fullscreenArne Slot on Ibrahima Konaté: ‘His consistency [in bringing the ball out of defence] is definitely something he can improve.’Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images/ReutersOn Konaté, who could soon have competition from Marc Guéhi should Liverpool agree a deal for the Crystal Palace captain, he said: “He has things he can improve but starting this season with a different full-back next to him is different as well. His consistency [in bringing the ball out of defence] is definitely something he can improve, but that will improve the more we work together, the more he’s used to the right full-back next to him and the more he’s used to the other players that are in front of him as well.”As for Kerkez, the £40m summer signing from Bournemouth, Slot said: “In both games he has faced the biggest threat of the other team [Antoine Semenyo and Anthony Elanga]. It’s fair enough [to say he’s had a difficult start] but it’s not from him, it’s from us as a team.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, when one finally came it proved crucial, as Joe Burgess’s finish secured the points for Hull KR.Having been badly beaten at Leedslast weekend, this was the kind of response you would expect from a side that have been so dominant all season. They took their moments when they arrived, and were brilliant without the ball to move one step closer to another piece of history, havingwon the Challenge Cupfor the first time in 45 years earlier this summer.“It was a good game. It had a semi-finals feel and it got a bit edgy at the end, but it was a good game,” Peters said.

A run of nine wins in 10 meant they could have gone second with a win, but now they could be fifth by the end of the weekend. They have taken steps forward, but this showed they are still a fraction behind the very best sides.“The way we started the second half was poor,” their coach, Paul Wellens, said. “When you come here, it’s often an attritional battle and the way we started that second half, we were in trouble early.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As Wellens admitted, Saints’ discipline cost them in the second half. They were still holding Rovers’ attack at bay quite comfortably but three separate penalties gave Martin easy opportunities to open up a six-point lead. On a night when defences were firmly on top, that felt crucial.So too did Mikey Lewis’s pinpoint 40-20, which gave the Robins a chance to strike, and they finally opened the Saints up when Burgess finished a wonderful move in the corner to make it 12-2. To the visitors’ credit, they set up a grandstand finale when Deon Cross touched down in the corner, but they ran out of time.It means that while there are unanswered questions over thisSt Helensside’s ability to go the distance, Rovers are now only 80 minutes away from another piece of silverware.Explore more on these topicsSuper LeagueHull KRSt HelensRugby leaguenewsShareReuse this content"

But the FA Cup winners have been frustrated so far in their attempts to find a more experienced option.They have approached Manchester City over a deal for Manuel Akanji but the Switzerland defender has interest from Milan and Spurs so looks likely to move elsewhere, while Palace have also made inquiries about taking Mohammed Salisu on loan from Monaco. Liverpool have yet to meet Palace’s £40m valuation for Guéhi, who has one year on his contract, and Glasner wants him to stay.“From my side, he has to [still be a Crystal Palace player] because it’s not possible at the moment to find a Marc Guéhi replacement who can play straight in the Premier League, being a starter, being consistent,” said the Palace manager. “When we see our foundation of success in the last few months, it’s our defence … Marc is a crucial part. Getting the right replacement in now is almost impossible.”Palace are in the market for more attacking reinforcements.

The Italian Marco Frigo crossed the line more than one minute behind Ayuso in second, with another Spaniard, Raúl García Pierna, third.Ayuso broke away early in the stage before he was joined by a group of 11 riders, including his Australian UAE Team Emirates-XRG teammateJay Vine, who grabbed more points to tighten his grip at the top of the King of the Mountains standings. Ayuso made his telling move 11km from the finish.Jay Vine’s solo attack wins Vuelta’s sixth stage as Vingegaard loses lead to TraeenRead moreThe 22-year-old, who finished third overall in 2022 and fourth the following year, was just eight seconds behind the then leader, Vingegaard, in second place before Thursday’s downfall. While Ayuso is still almost seven and a half minutes off the red jersey, he has managed to win his first individual Vuelta stage, following up the team time trial victory on stage five.“It’s amazing to win a stage in the Vuelta, which is my favourite race,” Ayuso said. “The way I won the race, I will remember always. I’m super-proud.”Vingegaard had managed to get away from Træen in the final kilometres, but the Bahrain Victorious cyclist fought back. “It was a decent day,” the Dane said. “It was not an easy day and we wanted to try to save our energy a bit, so we decided not to do anything today.”Saturday’s stage eight will be a flat 163.5km ride from Monzón Templario to Zaragoza.Elsewhere, there was positive news regarding the condition of Chris Froome, with Israel-Premier Tech posting that the British cyclist was in “good spirits” after successful surgery following acrash in the south of Francethat left him with a fractured vertebrae, collapsed lung and five broken ribs.Froome, 40, crashed while on a training ride on Wednesday and was airlifted to hospital in Toulon, about 100 miles from his home in Monaco.View image in fullscreenChris Froome has had surgery after a serious crash on Wednesday.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAA statement from Israel-Premier Tech said: “Chris has successfully undergone surgery after his recent injuries.

Only four men have more Tour de France titles, with Jacques Anquetil, Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault and Miguel Induráin all five-time winners. Only Merckx, Anquetil and Hinault have more than Froome’s seven Grand Tour titles, which leave him tied with Induráin, Alberto Contador and Fausto Coppi.However, Froome has never recovered his best form since a serious crash during the 2019 Critérium du Dauphiné, which left him in intensive care with a fractured femur, elbow, ribs and pelvis.The last of his 46 professional career wins came at the 2018 Giro and his best result since that 2019 crash was third place on stage 12 of the 2022 Tour de France to Alpe d’Huez as Tom Pidcock took victory.Froome broke his collarbone at the UAE Tour in February and had previously hinted that 2025 could be his final year of competitive racing.

She has not suffered a bad loss at the major tournaments this year, losing to an incredible trio of players in Iga Swiatek (twice), Aryna Sabalenka and now Rybakina. With the exception of her tight two-setterwith the world No 1, Sabalenka, at Wimbledon, however, those meetings have not been close. While the draws have not been kind to her, Raducanu’s game has repeatedly not looked strong enough against supreme opponents with greater firepower.“I’ve lost to Iga twice, Aryna and Elena, so it’s tough,” the British player said. “But at the same time, that’s where I’m at with my ranking. I can play top opponents in the first, second or third round. So I’ve just got to do my best in the next few months until Australia to just keep working to try to close the gap.”Since she announced her new partnershipwith the Spanish coach Francisco Roigjust under four weeks ago, Raducanu has described her primary goal as improving to the point where she can consistently trouble the top players. But she notes that their collaboration is in its early stages and they have a lot of work ahead. “I think there are certain parts of my game which have gotten better for sure,” Raducanu said. “Today my weaknesses were highlighted, but I think it’s only been three weeks, and he can’t really work miracles. So I know we’re doing good work, and I just look forward to continuing.”On Wednesday Rybakina was not particularly impressive in a tight two-set win over the qualifier Tereza Valentova. Raducanu’s statusas a grand slam championdoes seem to inspire the game’s best to approach her with full focus. Considering her aspirations of being a top player in her own right, the challenge for Raducanu is improving to a point where she can raise her own level.View image in fullscreenElena Rybakina proved too powerful for Emma Raducanu during their third-round clash.Photograph: Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images“I think when the very top play against me, they have a point to prove that they’re at the top, and they’re there for a reason,” she said. “I think every time I’ve played one, they’ve kind of shown that. So at the same time while I’m improving, doing better, gaining maybe some more respect around, yeah, the top have definitely raised their game. But I’ll take that as a compliment that they’ve decided to really lock in against me, but at the same time it does show I have a lot more work to do.”Raducanu had good reason to hope that things may be slightly different this time. She arrived at Louis Armstrong Stadium as confident as she could be, losing six games in her first two matches. However, the world No 10 represented a completely different challenge.‘Next time, don’t wonder why I hit you’: Tsitsipas rages at opponent’s underarm servesRead moreFrom the start Rybakina’s devastating first serve neutralised Raducanu’s return, her biggest strength, and she also returned with constant depth, rushing her opponent after her own serve throughout the match. The Kazakhstani took control of almost every baseline exchange, powering the ball off both wings and forcing Raducanu further and further behind the baseline. When Rybakina is in full flight, she presses her opponents and Raducanu simply does not possess the weapons to counter her. By the second set, the British No 1 had clearly lost belief in her ability to win the match.But Raducanu rightfully leaves New York hopeful about her future. She is generally performing at a high level, appears to have fully bought into her new partnership with Roig and exorcised some significant demons this week by finally winning matches at the US Open for the first time since her 2021 title. With a live ranking of No 34, she is on the verge of being seeded at the grand slams again.In contrast to Raducanu’s positive recent strides, 2025 has actually been a turbulent year for Rybakina. Her season started with the news that her longtime coach, Stefano Vukov, had been suspended from the tour by the WTA due to alleged verbal abuse towards her. The player has repeatedly expressed her opposition to the ruling and continued to work with him away from tournaments.Shortly before the Cincinnati Open this month, Vukov successfully appealed against the ruling, meaning he is free to accompany Rybakina at tournaments again. Since the case was closed, she has produced some of her best tennis of the season and this supreme performance only reaffirmed her status as a clear title threat in New York.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025US Open tennisEmma RaducanuTennisUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The comments, which Ostapenko justified as a reaction to Townsend not apologising for a shot that hit the top of the net, have prompted accusations of racism.Ostapenko and Townsend confront each other after US Open match: ‘She said I had no education’Read moreOstapenko strongly denied that on social media, while Townsend also said she did not interpret the remarks in that way, but Osaka gave the Latvian a verbal volley when asked about the incident.“I think obviously it’s one of the worst things you can say to a black tennis player in a majority white sport,” said Osaka after reaching the third round at Flushing Meadows for the first time since 2021 with a 6-3, 6-1 win over the American Hailey Baptiste. “I know Taylor and I know how hard she’s worked and I know how smart she is, so she’s the furthest thing from uneducated or anything like that.”Ostapenko is known as one of the feistiest characters on the women’s tour and Osaka added: “If you’re genuinely asking me about the history of Ostapenko, I don’t think that’s the craziest thing she’s said. I’m going to be honest.“I think it’s ill-timing and the worst person you could have ever said it to. And I don’t know if she knows the history of it in America. But I know she’s never going to say that ever again in her life. It was just terrible.”Asked about the incident, Townsend hopes the attention around the confrontation and her calling attention to it can be a positive for the US Open and tennis in general. “If I’m someone who can draw huge crowds into the stadiums as a name that can bring people to come and buy tickets and support the game, then that’s a crown that I’ll gladly wear,” Townsend said.“Whatever that it is, whatever type of attention that it brought, it’s doing the right things, which is bring people to see the sport and bringing people in to support and that’s what it’s all about.”View image in fullscreenTaylor Townsend during a 7-5, 6-2 doubles win with Katerina Siniakova against Aldila Sutjiadi and Nadiia Kichenok on Thursday at Flushing Meadows.Photograph: Frank Franklin II/APWhen asked if she thought the comments had racial undertones, Townsend said she didn’t take it that way but acknowledged: “That has been a stigma in our community of being ‘not educated’ and all of the things, when it’s the furthest thing from the truth.”Even privately, Townsend said other players came up to her to broach the subject and express their support. Online, she gained thousands of social media followers.“It’s cool to know that people see you and people are watching and more than anything,” Townsend said. “I was hoping that it was received a certain type of way, and it was, so it was just external validation that I handled things the right way and that’s what I’m the most proud of and the most happy with. I wasn’t looking for that, and in my answers and when I decided and I spoke and I said what I said I wasn’t looking for those things, but it’s nice to know that I made people proud.”‘Next time, don’t wonder why I hit you’: Tsitsipas rages at opponent’s underarm servesRead moreAryna Sabalenka has also addressed the incident, revealing she had spoken to Ostapenko following the row. “I have to say that she’s nice,” the Belarusian said. “She just sometimes can lose control. She has some things in life to face and some struggles. I was just trying to help her to face it more in a mature way, trying to help her to settle down and just was someone she could speak to and just let it go.“I really hope that one day she will figure herself and she will handle it much better. I’m pretty sure, looking back, she’s not happy with her behaviour.”Ostapenko was back on court at Flushing Meadows on Thursday in the doubles and may have feared a hostile reception from the crowd but that did not turn out to be the case, with cheers rather than jeers.The former French Open champion declined to fulfil her press obligations afterwards, with organisers citing medical reasons.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025US Open tennisNaomi OsakaUS sportsTennisRacenewsShareReuse this content"

In the build up to their US Open second round match, the third seed kept Fearnley waiting for more than 10 minutes before finally showing up for their match, where he defeated Fearnley 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 to reach the third round.Despite competing hard and showing flashes of his talent by attempting to dominate the baseline with his forehand and close down the net, Fearnley ended his first US Open main draw appearance with another valuable lesson against one of the best players in the world. Across their 2 hours and 28 minutes on court, Zverev ground the Briton down with his consistency, solid counterpunching and dominant serving, outplaying his more volatile opponent by giving away so few points easily.Coco Gauff fights through tears and serving woes to reach US Open third roundRead more“I think it was pretty obvious what I was trying to do – come to the net and disrupt his rhythm – because I think he’s just very, very solid and he’s not going to give me much,” Fearnley said. “And then I was obviously fluctuating, and it’s tough to kind of keep that level throughout the whole match. And I gave myself chances, but I just didn’t capitalise. Obviously he’s a great player, so can’t be too disappointed, I guess.”This match also provided a glimpse into the gamesmanship that top players sometimes implement against lower-ranked opponents. Before each contest at the US Open, players must congregate outside a corridor inside Arthur Ashe Stadium that leads to each court. When their names were called over the loudspeaker, Fearnley immediately appeared at 6.50pm. He would spend another 10 minutes waiting quietly for his opponent. Zverev was ordered on three occasions to report for his match before he finally arrived.View image in fullscreenAlexander Zverev serves against Jacob Fearnley at the US Open.Photograph: Matthew Stockman/Getty ImagesAsked if he was irritated by his opponent’s tardiness, Fearnley hesitated before choosing his words carefully. He noted that top players often move at their own pace, which he learned for the first time before his match against Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon last year.“I kind of expected it,” Fearnley said. “I mean, it was the same [against Zverev] in Australia, and he kind of is always like, ‘I’m sorry about that’, but he knows what he’s doing. It was the same with Novak in Wimbledon. They take their time, which is, I don’t know if it’s within the rules or not.“I don’t really know what the rule is, I just don’t. But … If they call me, I show up, because I don’t know necessarily what’s going to happen. But no, he’s well within his right to take his time. I kind of expected it. My coach expected it. Every time I played him, he kind of did the same.”Raducanu’s upbeat year offers another chance to test herself against the bestRead moreFearnley is still just 14 months into his career as a professional player and the 24-year-old is still in the process of gaining experience each week. Alongside his considerable potential, he has certain shortcomings to address. After striking 18 double faults in his four-set first round win over Roberto Bautista Agut, against Zverev he struck 12 double faults, including on numerous important points.“In practice, I can sit there all day and make 100 second serves in a row,” he said. “It’s not an issue. But there’s just something about seeing the lights, seeing the courts, that gets a little bit tricky. And also having Alex Zverev on the other side of the net, and with that noise, that crowd, it’s sometimes difficult.“I’ll keep working on it but I’ll figure it out eventually. I know there’s a lot of players that have had similar things in the past, but they’ve seemed to work through and I’m sure I’ll do the same.”Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025TennisUS sportsAlexander ZverevnewsShareReuse this content"

No more tiresome weekly stints of vacuuming, and no more last-minute panic sessions when you have visitors on the way. Instead, your compact robot chum regularly trundles out from its dock, sucking up dust, hair and debris to leave your floors looking spick and span.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Over the past few years, robot vacuums have become much more affordable, with basic units starting at about £150. They’re also doing more than they used to, mopping areas of hard flooring and charging in sophisticated cleaning stations that empty their dust collectors and clean their mop pads for you.In fact, the biggest effort required by you is deciding which one to buy. That’s where I can help. I’ve tested seven of the most popular models to help you find the best robot vacuum for your space.The best cordless vacuum cleaners for a spotless home: 10 tried and tested favouritesRead moreAt a glanceBestrobot vacuum cleaner overall:Eufy X10 Pro Omni£699 at EufyBest robot vacuum for power cleaning:Samsung Bespoke Jet Bot Combo AI+£719 at John LewisBest robot vacuum cleaner for small homes and small budgets:Beko VRR61414VB RoboSmart£299 at CurrysWhy you should trust meI’ve spent almost three decades reviewing technology, home and garden products, covering everything from PCs, printers and tablets to lawnmowers, coffee machines,steam cleanersand fans. I’ve tested a wide range of smart-home appliances and devices, and I know the features that make them more effective and easier to use – and those that don’t bring any real value.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘I spilled flour and crunched cereal on a mat to up the challenge for the robot vacuum cleaners’: the Eufy X10 Pro Omni’s takes on the mess, before (left) and right (right).Photograph: Stuart AndrewsOur team scoured the stores and spoke to manufacturers to pull in the leading robot vacuum cleaners. I then gave our test subjects the workout of their little robot lives in my three-bedroom, two-floor home. Over three weeks I had them cleaning every room, switching vacuums and docks around to give each a shot at the upstairs and downstairs spaces.The house has a mix of wooden and composite hard flooring, rugs and carpets, with various awkward, dusty corners as well as two cats shedding inconceivable quantities of hair. What’s more, the living room is a fiendish obstacle course, with two sofas, a packed TV cabinet, an Ikea Poäng armchair and a vintage suspended egg chair to navigate. Even with some lighter furnishing removed, these robot vacuums had their work cut out.I used a smartphone sound meter to measure noise levels, and a plug-in power meter to see how much energy the docks or chargers used while idle and when charging. I also spilled flour and crunched cereal on to a barrier mat to check the suction and cleaning power of each model, treading in the crumbled shredded wheat to up the challenge. I used the apps to check the vacuums’ mapping and scheduling capabilities and to add rooms, zones and no-go areas.After testing, the cleaners were either returned to their sources or donated to the British Heart Foundation.The best robot vacuums for 2025View image in fullscreenBefore (right) and after (left) the Samsung Bespoke Jet Bot Combo AI+ tackled flour and crunched up cereal on a mat.Photograph: Stuart AndrewsBest robot vacuum overall:Eufy X10 Pro OmniView image in fullscreen£699 at Eufy£599 at AmazonThe X10 Pro Omni is not a bad price for a self-emptying, self-cleaning robot mop and vacuum. The base station washes and dries the heads between uses, refilling the internal water tank and emptying the dust collector. It uses a front-facing camera and laser technology to sense its way around your floors, spotting and identifying items, such as socks or cables, that it can then avoid. It’s powerful, with 8,000Pa of suction force, and its twin rotating mop heads can apply 1kg of downwards pressure, to give your hard floors a serious scrubbing when they need it.Why we love itThis Eufy machine does almost everything for you, as long as you periodically empty the base station’s dust bag and dirty-water tank and refill the clean-water tank. Like the Samsung, reviewed further down, it’s great at mapping out your home and dodging potential obstacles, but it’s also better than the Samsung at cleaning on the first pass. The side brush and vacuum can shift dust and hair in seconds, while the mop left my hard floors sparkling, even dealing with dried-on spots of juice.The app gives you plenty of control, allowing you to set up cleaning scenarios to focus on different areas. You can also tweak cleaning options such as suction power if, say, you’ve got a deep pile carpet to clean and you don’t think it’s really making an impact. The brush and roller seem particularly resistant to getting clogged with hair.It’s a shame that …mopping isn’t so effective on the low water setting – switching up to medium will get you better results. It’s also bigger and louder than rivals, struggling to fit under low furniture and hitting 68dB on max power. Cleaning and drying the mop can be a long and noisy process.Suction power:8,000PaRobotdimensions:327 x 353 x 114mm (WDH)Dock dimensions:365 x 480 x 360mm (WDH)Maximum noise level:68dBABattery life:three hoursPower consumption (charging):26.4WBest for power cleaning:Samsung Bespoke Jet Bot Combo AI+View image in fullscreen£719 at John Lewis£899 at SamsungIt’s hard to miss Samsung’s robot mop and vacuum cleaner, not least because its white base station is more of a mansion than a house, standing over half a metre tall. It’s also unnervingly speedy and has a habit of playing jingles when it starts or finishes, or on any event in between.It uses a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) scanner and two 3D cameras to navigate your home, and it features twin rotating mop heads, which attach magnetically to the bottom of the unit. These are steam-cleaned and dried when the robot returns home.Why we love itIt’s a strong all-rounder. It doesn’t have as much suction as the mighty Dyson, reviewed below, but makes up for it by hunting hair, dust and debris relentlessly until it’s gone. The rotating mop heads do a fantastic job of removing marks and stains from kitchen floors, and they lift up when not in use to avoid rubbing on the carpet.It’s also great at navigation, picking up and even identifying potential obstacles, before carefully manoeuvring around them. Even my troublesome egg chair didn’t cause this machine any issues. With the dock’s integrated dust bin and water tanks, it’s also no great effort to maintain.It’s a shame that …the base station is enormous, and this model is among the most expensive on test. It also struggles with rugs more than the other top vacuums, regularly pulling up the edges and creating a rumpled mess that it subsequently had trouble traversing.Suction power:6,000PaRobotdimensions:359 x 364 x 100mm (WDH)Dockdimensions:444 x 510 x 547mm (WDH)Maximum noise level:68dBABattery life:three hoursPower consumption (charging):45.8WBest for small homes and small budgets:Beko VRR61414VB RoboSmartView image in fullscreen£299 at Currys£198 at AmazonShort of space? Beko’s compact cleaner doesn’t need much: it’s just 34cm across and 8cm high, with a small, simple dock for charging. There’s no mop and not a huge amount of suction power, but it uses laser tech to map out and make its way around your rooms, automatically detecting rugs and carpets then boosting up the suction power. It’ll also get into nooks and under low furniture that halts bigger robot vacuums in their tracks.Why we love itIt’s relatively tiny and inexpensive, but don’t dismiss the Beko as a toy. Thanks to chunky wheels and ingenious suspension, it’ll make its way over tricky rugs and thresholds without any worries, and its rotating side brush has enough oomph to compensate for a meagre 2,000Pa of suction.While it’s not the best vacuum for deep cleaning, it’s great at heading out daily to keep dust under control. Battery life isn’t epic, but two hours should be more than enough for the two floors of the average home, and it can always head back to its dock and start again later. It’s also quiet, putting out 60-61dB even at maximum power.View image in fullscreenThe mat before (left) and after (right) the Beko VRR61414VB RoboSmart did its thing.Photograph: Stuart AndrewsIt’s a shame that …long hair can bind itself around the side brush and roller, and it struggled to shift all the flour in the spot-cleaning test. You’ll also need to empty the internal dust collector yourself – although it has a large capacity, the vacuum works better if you do so after every session.Suction power:2,000PaRobotdimensions:342 x 342 x 800mm (WDH)Dock dimensions:154 x 146 x 90mm (WDH)Maximum noise level:61dBABattery life:two hours 10 minutesPower consumption (charging):13.2Wskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

It’s also great at vacuuming close to furnishings and skirting boards, and it has clever features to map out the dustiest areas of your home and increase its suction when it hits them.The internal dust collector is easy to remove and empty, and it has a built-in Hepa filter to trap the tiny particles that aggravate common allergies. It’s easy to schedule and manage cleans with the MyDyson app, too.View image in fullscreenThe grubby mat before (left) and after (right) the Dyson 360 Vis Nav spruced it up.Photograph: Stuart AndrewsIt didn’t make the final cut because …it’s a bit of a bruiser that won’t fit under low furniture, and while it’s good at navigating obstacles, it left sections of our test rooms entirely untouched. It’s also ludicrously expensive for a robot vacuum with a basic charging dock.Suction power:65AW;robotdimensions:322 x 332 x 99mm (WDH);dockdimensions:265 x 102 x 180mm (WDH); maximum noise level:70dBA;battery life:one hour five minutes;power consumption (charging):61WShark PowerDetect NeverTouch Pro 2-in-1View image in fullscreenBest for:convenience£799.99 at Shark£617.96 at AmazonShark’s beefy bot came so close to making the grade. It has the same self-cleaning and self-emptying features as the Samsung and Eufy models, and it empties into a larger dust bin rather than a bag. It can detect carpets and hard floors and will mop and/or vacuum accordingly, and it has smart features to spot and tackle hidden dirt or stubborn stains.It also gets extra points for having an intuitive app that takes you through setup and cleaning, and even suggests amusing names for your robot friend. We’ll remember you, Colonel Dustard.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s effective but slow to clean, and sometimes had issues making its way back to its base station. And while the app is helpful, it doesn’t give you much control. It can map only one floor, which is fine if you live in a flat or an open-plan bungalow, but otherwise limiting.Suction power:not stated;robotdimensions:365 x 338 x 106mm (WDH);dockdimensions:364 x 478 x 446mm (WDH); maximum noise level:60dBA;battery life:1 hour 40 minutes;power consumption (charging):23.4WEzviz RE5 PlusView image in fullscreenBest for:big features at a low price£169.99 at AmazonThe RE5 Plus gives you a lot for a budget model, handling the vacuuming and mopping with the aid of a self-emptying base station. It’s smaller than similarly equipped models, though you’ll have to wash the mop pads and refill the water tank yourself.With LiDAR navigation, it’s good at threading its way under your furniture, and it’s quiet, never putting out more than 61dBA. It’s a talkative little robot, with notifications and error messages delivered with a crisp English accent and optional Google and Alexa voice commands.It didn’t make the final cut because …Ezviz isn’t particularly well known for its cleaning products, and the app isn’t all that intuitive, even if there is plenty of control over settings available. The RE5 Plus also had issues getting over rugs, and in the spot vacuuming tests it left a little too much flour and debris on the carpet.Suction power:4,000Pa;robot dimensions:345 x 345 x 95mm (WDH);dock dimensions:220 x 180 x 380mm (WDH);maximum noise level:61dBA;battery life:three hours;power consumption (charging):19.3WWhat you need to knowRobot vacuums fit into two categories: those that just vacuum, and those that mop as well. My advice would be to focus on the vacuum part, and on the ability to suck up dirt and grime. The mopping is good enough to remove surface spills and superficial marks, but it won’t replace yoursteam cleaneror manual mop. What’s more, some of the less flexible mop mechanisms can leave you with a soggy carpet as the robot vacuum makes its way around your floor.Cleaning powerSuction power counts and most manufacturers will specify the maximum suction force for each cleaner in Pascals (Pa) – or air watts (AW) in Dyson’s case. However, it’s not the whole story. Different cleaners will use different combinations of rollers and rotating brushes to whisk dirt and dust off the ground and into the vacuum intake.Some are also noticeably better than others at cleaning near the edges of a room and adjusting their suction power to match the levels of dust with which they have to deal. Most robot vacuums can do multiple passes if they need to, but this obviously adds to the cleaning time.View image in fullscreenBefore (left) and after (right) the Ezviz RE5 Plus tackled the dirty mat.Photograph: Stuart AndrewsNavigation and emptyingThe second key factor is navigation. Robot vacuums use a mix of optical and laser sensors and physical bumpers to make their way around the room, moving past obstacles and making sure they cover every area. More advanced models feature 3D cameras that map the room, giving them a clearer idea of the geography and their exact position within it. Either way, navigation skills vary dramatically, with some cleaners prone to getting lost or confused under your furniture.Vertical navigation skills are just as important, as robot vacuums will probably have to make their way over rugs and low-lying thresholds. Some of the more limber models can push, flip and clamber their way over impediments, while others just get tangled up.Robot vacuums don’t have much space onboard for their dust collector, so they need more regular emptying than the average cordless vacuum. The pricier models work around this by having a larger dust collector or bag in the base station or dock, so that when your robot vacuum puts itself to bed for a recharge, the dock will automatically empty the dust collector and, where necessary, clean the mop head and refill the water tank.Battery life and appsBattery life isn’t a huge deal with modern robot vacuums. Most will easily make it around one floor or more of an average-sized home without a recharge, and they automatically return to base if they’re caught short. However, a larger battery and a more efficient motor can be helpful if you have a bigger space to keep in shape.Onboard controls can be useful when you just want to clean an area quickly, but you’ll spend most of your time managing your robot vacuum from a smartphone app. At the very least, these should have features to customise any room maps, adding zones that need more thorough cleaning and no-go areas where you don’t want the robot vacuum to get stuck.Scheduling features are also very welcome, allowing you to set times when you want your plucky robot to put itself to work. And accessible controls, to change the settings or run quieter at night, can make your new friend even easier to live with.Can robot vacuums clean multiple rooms at a time?They can, though the way this works can vary from model to model. Most robot vacuums navigate and map a whole floor at a time. Once that’s done, you can use the app to label different rooms then send your robot to a given location.Many let you map multiple floors, and you don’t usually need to move the charging station between floors – just carry the unit upstairs or downstairs. If you have any steps between rooms (like I do in my living room), this often needs to be mapped as a separate floor.Even where mapping isn’t supported, you can usually work around it by carrying the robot vacuum into the other space and setting it to clean. It may not clean as efficiently or effectively, but it will navigate the space and get the job done.How do robot vacuums compare to regular vacuum cleaners?As with cordless vacuums, robot vacuums come with a trade-off between size, battery life and suction force. Because they have to trundle around under their own steam for long enough to cover a decent-sized area, this inevitably limits the power of the vacuum motor.Even powerful robot vacuums top out at 65AW (or 6,000 to 8,000Pa) and that’s often in their battery-draining turbo modes. By comparison, some cordless cleaners offer suction levels up to 250AW, and mains-powered vacuums can go even higher.Confusingly, most manufacturers don’t offer the same suction power across their whole range. Irrespective of which model you buy, though, you may still need a manual vacuum cleaner to purge your carpets of pet hair and really stubborn grime.Stuart Andrews is ajournalistwithmore than three decades of experience in computing and consumer tech.

Not by leading a hardened team of oddball veterans in an assault on a despot’s intergalactic outpost, nor by completing a series of well-written tasks to build up my warrior mage so they can defeat some ancient malignant omnipotent deity.I have done it by completing easy races on a bicycle. Sounds ridiculous? Welcome to Wheel World.It seems the epitome of arch to criticise a video game for its ridiculous plot when I am happy to have plumbers save worlds by stomping on mushrooms, or hedgehogs doing similar while wearing snazzy sneakers. I even took Arbroath FC to the European Cup final in Championship Manager once. But the plot of Wheel World seems so clumsily stuck on I suspect 10% of the code is pure Blu-Tack.There is a spirit in your bike who looks like a skull and therefore is called Skully. Because it’s that kind of game. You need to win the seven lost parts of his Legendary Bike by beating the cyclists who have them, so Skully can enter the Soul Sewer to reach Mount Send and perform the Great Shift ritual to fly to the moon and save the universe. Just typing that plot makes my fingers vibrate with the clunkiness. It’s lo-fi hipster hippy claptrap. And it didn’t need to be like this.View image in fullscreenTen percent Blu-Tack … Wheel World.Photograph: Annapurna InteractiveThe original plot of what was initially called Ghost Bike involved memorials placed by the roadside to mark the deaths of cyclists. That sounds much better but it was ditched in favour of lighter fare. Now,according to the Messhof studio boss Mark Essen, “There’s some silly lore in there, and there’s a creation myth, and deities people pray to, but it’s like, take it or leave it.”If the people making the game aren’t bothered about the story, how am I expected to be?But who cares, eh? This is a racing game: they don’t need plots do they? Not if they supply fingernail-munching, edge-of-the-seat rollercoasters of excitement.But this doesn’t.It’s not a terrible game, not by any stretch. It’s a decent if far too easy attempt to put Tony Hawk on two wheels in a world that looks like a blander version ofJet Set Radio, and if you have Xbox Game Pass it’s “free”. It passed the “sitting and thinking of it when I am not playing it” test, which is my main indicator if I am in to a game or not. But every time I went back to it, my whelm was distinctly under rather than over. You don’t have weapons or crazy power-ups, there’s no multiplayer mode, you can’t knock other cyclists off bikes (they don’t even seem to be knocked over by cars in the same way you are), and although there are a myriad of witty bike builds, you don’t need them. I completed the game using one that made me crazy fast and one that gave me good grip and handling. That used 14 bike parts. The game has more than 170.View image in fullscreenGet your skate on … Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater.Photograph: ActivisionIt’s just not escapist enough for me because I can do a lot of the things in this game in real life. I can get on my bike right now, race after another cyclist, ring my bell at him and say: “Hey, Lone Wolf, I challenge you to a race.” Just like you do in Wheel World. Actually, real life may be more exciting because there is a chance the other cyclist will kick my head in for being obnoxious.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I can play football, but not with the players or tricks I could use in Fifa. I will probably never be the captain of a spaceship – apologies for the lack of ambition – so I loved playing everything from Elite to Mass Effect.I’m not saying that all games should feature smart bombs and dragons. I get the appeal of farm, train and bus sims: they allow you to take an interest and make it interactive. There are only so many people who can be Network Rail operators in real life, so fair play to you if you want to spend two hours a day doing so virtually. I don’t even mind if you wear a special hat when you do.I can’t help but feel there is a cool bicycle game out there waiting to be made. The control mechanic will always be imperfect because holding down a button to pedal isn’t remotely realistic, while rotating a thumbstick round and round to make you cycle faster, like a circular-motion version of Track & Field, would get irritating (and painful) really fast.There could be a cycle courier version of Crazy Taxi, or a game that replicates the joy of having a bike when you are a kid: all about wheelies, backies and clothes-pegging different football cards in the spokes to make a motorbike sound, almost like the bike parts of the wonderful Bully. Until then, I will survive on the memory morsels of Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX on the PlayStation, the original two-wheeled Tony Hawk rip off.Explore more on these topicsGamesCyclingSports gamescommentShareReuse this content"

The Séance Of Blake Manor falls into that second camp: an atmospheric take on an 1890s Irish murder mystery.You play Detective Ward, who has been sent to the titular Blake Manor to investigate the disappearance of Evelyn Deane two nights before a seance is due take place. Mystics from across the globe have gathered at the crumbling mansion to converse with the dead on All Hallows’ Eve, but are they really capable of doing what they say they can? And what was that shadowy figure? There’s more than one secret to unravel.View image in fullscreenYou need to be in the right place at the right time … gameplay in The Séance of Blake Manor.Photograph: Spooky Doorway“Think of it as gothic or folk horror,” says narrative lead Dave McCabe. “It’s that creeping dread that you’re in a place you shouldn’t be and every step you take isn’t safe.”Time ticks down as you explore the house and talk to each of the guests, so you need to work hard to figure out what’s happening. Sometimes you’ll need to solve puzzles by moving objects or finding hidden passwords. Other times you’ll need to be in the right place at the right time to catch crucial information.Permeating all that mystery and Victorian spiritualism is a miasma of Irish folklore. “We picked one key point in Irish mythology for the setup of our story,” says Paul Conway, lead artist and CEO of developer Spooky Doorway. “It’s why this particular place is the nexus of ancient magic and supernatural events, but I can’t say what it is without revealing too much!”“We definitely touch on a lot of Irish mythology, pagan beliefs and ghost stories,” McCabe adds. While those aspects don’t always directly affect the story, that otherworldly presence lingers in the background. Irish traditions, such as carved turnips that are far more monstrous than the pumpkins of today’s Halloween, are dotted around the estate. You encounter a flash ofsomethingearly on, and the library is rammed full of old tales and legends to peruse at your leisure. Just don’t take too long, or your time to solve the mystery will run out.The developers are proud of their heritage and want to inspire players to explore more of it. “I hope it adds another layer to the perception people have of Ireland and Irish history – that it’s not all St Patrick’s Day and flat caps,” McCabe says. “And maybe some people will come over and see a few haunted castles.”The Séance Of Blake Manor is in development forPC.

It’s time to rethink who really controls moneyFri 29 Aug 2025 12.30 EDTLast modified on Fri 29 Aug 2025 13.26 EDTShareDonald Trump’sattemptto sack the Federal Reserve governor, Lisa Cook, is the familiar authoritarian trick of bending institutions to serve the leader’s immediate ends. The widespreadcondemnationis deserved. This is not some daring experiment in popular control of monetary policy. Yet what should follow censure is reflection. For the furore over Ms Cook has revealed a peculiar reflex: to defend the Fed’s independence as though it weresynonymouswith democracy itself.But is independence of the Fed, or central banks generally, really that?Eric Levitz at Voxthinks so, or at least that it is close enough. He argues that Congress sets the Fed’s objectives; independence applies only to the means. Without independence, politicians would be free to game rates for votes – asRichard Nixondid in 1972, leaning on the Fed to juice growth before the election. On this view, independence is not anti-democratic but prudent delegation.The historianAdam Toozesays that argument misses the point. The Fed, he says, is not a neutral technocracy: its regional boards give business elites formal seats at the table, while labour and consumers are marginal or absent. Independence is not independence from politics; it is independence from electoral accountability. To defend this arrangement as democracy’s bulwark, Prof Tooze maintains, is to confuse professional consensus with popular legitimacy.Theleftwing economist Michael Robertsgoes further. In his blog this week he argues that central bank independence was never really about technocratic efficiency at all. It blossomed in the neoliberal era because it suited finance. He notes that the 1980s and 90s saw a sharp rise in central bank independence while inflation fell. The correlation has been taken as proof of causation. Yet Mr Roberts argues that the decline in prices owed more to slowing global growth and the end of one-off supply shocks.Central banks proved no better than anyone else at forecasting crises: the former Fed chair Alan Greenspan admitted the 2008 crash left him in “a state of shocked disbelief”. Turkey’s recent bout ofhyperinflationwas blamed on presidential meddling – but Mr Roberts suggests the real culprits were trade deficits, political instability and a collapsing lira. Monetary policy is too blunt an instrument, as manycommentatorsconcede, to deal with today’s volatile world. So where does this leave informed opinion? Certainly not with Mr Trump. To replace one form of unaccountability with a demagogic strongman is no gain. The real task is to ask what a democratic politics of central banking would look like.The academic Saule Omarova’sPeople’s Ledgeris one radical answer: treat the Fed as a public utility, offering universal bank accounts and explicitly aligning its balance sheet with public priorities. ANational Investment Authoritycould channel long-term finance towards infrastructure and decarbonisation, rather than leaving investment decisions to Wall Street. Efforts could be made tobroadenboard representation beyond business, requiredistributional impact assessmentsand tighten “for cause” clauses so that presidents cannot hound governors from office on flimsy pretexts.Mr Trump’s assault must be denounced – and Ms Cook defended. But if voters stop there, a deeper lesson will be missed.Central bank independencewas never democracy incarnate. At best it was a compromise suited to an earlier era. Today’s challenge is to rebuild monetary authority on firmer, more democratic ground.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But now it’s time to call it what it isFri 29 Aug 2025 12.30 EDTLast modified on Fri 29 Aug 2025 21.39 EDTShareIf this were happening somewhere else – in Latin America, say – how might it be reported?Having secured his grip on the capital, the president is now set to send troops to several rebel-held cities, claiming he is wanted there to restore order. The move follows raids on the homes of leading dissidents and comes as armed men seen as loyal to the president, many of them masked, continue to pluck people off the streets …Except this is happening in the United States of America and so we don’t quite talk about it that way. That’s not the only reason. It’s also because Donald Trump’s march towards authoritarianism is so steady, taking another step or two every day, that it’s easy to become inured to it: you can’t be in a state of shock permanently. And, besides, sober-minded people are wary of sounding hyperbolic or hysterical: their instinct is to play down rather than scream at the top of their voice.There’s something else, too. Trump’s dictator-like behaviour is so brazen, so blatant, that paradoxically, we discount it. It’s like being woken in the night by a burglar wearing a striped shirt and carrying a bag marked “Swag”: we would assume it was a joke or a stunt or otherwise unreal, rather than a genuine danger. So it is with Trump. We cannot quite believe what we are seeing.But here is what we are seeing. Trump has deployed the national guard on the streets of Washington DC, so that there are now 2,000 troops, heavily armed, patrolling the capital. The pretext is fighting crime, but violent crime in DC was at a30-year lowwhen he made his move. The president haswarned that Chicago will be next, perhapsBaltimore too. In June he sent the national guard and the marines intoLos Angeles to put down protestsagainst his immigration policies, protests which the administration said amounted to an “insurrection”. Demonstrators were complaining about the masked men of Ice, the immigration agency that, thanks to Trump, now has a budget to matchthat of the world’s largest armies, snatching people from street corners or hauling them from their cars.Those cities are all run by Democrats and, not coincidentally, have large Black populations. They are potential centres of opposition to Trump’s rule and he wants them under his control. The constitution’s insistence that states have powers of their own and that the reach of the federal government should be limited – a principle that until recently was sacred toRepublicans– can go hang.Control is the goal, amassing power in the hands of the president and removing or neutering any institution or person that could stand in his way. That is the guiding logic that explains Trump’s every action, large and small, including his wars on the media, the courts, the universities and the civil servants of the federal government. It helps explain why FBI agents last week mounted a 7am raid on thehome and office of John Bolton, once Trump’s national security adviser and now one of his most vocal critics. And why the president hinted darkly that the former New Jersey governorChris Christie is in his sights.View image in fullscreenMembers of the national guard patrol near the White House in Washington DC, 29 August 2025.Photograph: Shawn Thew/EPAIt’s why he has broken all convention, and possibly US law, by attemptingto remove Lisa Cookas a member of the board of the Federal Reserve on unproven charges of mortgage fraud. Those charges are based on information helpfully supplied by the Trump loyalist installed as federal housing director and who,according to the New York Times, has repeatedly leveraged “the powers of his office … to investigate or attack Mr Trump’s most recognisable political enemies”. The pattern is clear: Trump is using the institutions of government to hound his foes in a manner that recalls the worst of Richard Nixon – though where Nixon skulked in the shadows, Trump’s abuses are in plain sight.And all in the pursuit of ever more power. Take the firing of Cook.With falling poll numbers, especially on hishandling of the economy, he craves the sugar rush of an interest rate cut. The independent central bank won’t give it to him, so he wants to push the Fed out of the way and grab the power to set interest rates himself. Notethe justification offered by JD Vancethis week, that Trump is “much better able to make those determinations” than “unelected bureaucrats” because he embodies the will of the people. The reasoning is pure authoritarianism, arguing that a core principle of the US constitution, the separation of powers, should be swept aside, because all legitimate authority resides in one man alone.Of course, the greatest check on Trump would come from the opposition winning power in a democratic election, specifically Democrats taking control of the House of Representatives in November 2026. Trump is working hard to make that impossible: witness this month’sunabashed gerrymander in Texas, where at Trump’s command, Republicans redrew congressional boundaries to give themselves five more safe seats in the House. Trump wants more states to follow Texas’s lead, because a Democratic-controlled House would have powers of scrutiny that he rightly fears.Meanwhile, apparently prompted by his meeting with Vladimir Putin, he is once again at war againstpostal voting, baselessly decrying it as fraudulent, while also demanding a new census that would exclude undocumented migrants – moves that will either help Republicans win in 2026 or else enable him to argue that a Democratic victory was illegitimate and should be overturned.In that same spirit, the Trump White House now argues that, in effect, only one party should be allowed to exercise power in the US. How else to read the words of key Trump adviser Stephen Miller, who this weektold Fox Newsthat “The Democrat party is not a political party; it is a domestic extremist organisation.”It’s the same picture on every front, whether it’s plans for anew military parade in Trump’s honouror thefiring of health officialswho insist on putting science ahead of political loyalty. He is bent on amassing power to himself and being seen to amass power to himself, even if that means departing from economic conservative orthodoxy to have the federal government take astake in hitherto private companies. He wants to rule over every aspect of US life. As Trump himselfsaid this week, “A lot of people are saying, ‘Maybe we’d like a dictator.’” The former Obama adviser David Axelrod is not alonewhen he says, “We have gone from zero to Hungary faster than I ever imagined.”The trouble is, people still don’t talk about it the way they talk about Hungary, not inside the US and not outside it. That’s partly theIt Can’t Happen Heremindset, partly a reluctance to accept a reality that would require, of foreign governments especially, a rethink of almost everything. If the US is on its way to autocracy, in a condition scholars might call “unconsolidated authoritarianism”, then that changes Britain’s entire strategic position, its place in the world, which for 80 years has been predicated on the notion of a west led by a stable, democratic US. The same goes for the EU. Far easier to carry on, either pretending that the transformation of the US is not, in fact, as severe as it is, or that normal service will resume shortly. But the world’s leaders, like US citizens, cannot ignore the evidence indefinitely. To adapt the title of that long-ago novel, it can happen here – and it is.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It is an effort that has taken many forms, including arecent lettersent by the White House to the Smithsonian announcing that there will be a review of the national museums’ semiquincentennial plans to “insure alignment with the president’s directiveto celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions”. It is only the latest move ina broader campaignto commandeer the nation’s historical memory,a campaign mirrored in statehousesandschool boards across the country, where history curricula have become a central front in the culture wars.Unfortunately, the battle over the past – how we should understand it and, more importantly, how we should teach it – is a conflict for which most Americans today are woefully unprepared. That is because for more than two generations, the US educational system has systematically devalued the liberal arts in favor of vocationally oriented Stem education. By doing so, we have failed to accomplish the primary goal of education in a democracy: creating citizens capable of the difficult work of self-government. Of course vocational training and Stem education are vital to individual livelihoods and national prosperity. But when they become the sole focus of education, at the expense of the liberal arts, they leave citizens unprepared for the demands of democratic life.The liberal arts derive their name from the Latinars liberalis, which literally means “the trade skills of a free person”. For the ancient Greeks and Romans, and more importantly their Enlightenment admirers, citizenship was a trade, a vocation that required particular skills, just like any craft. Among the skills a citizen needed were critical thinking, a command of rhetoric and historical literacy. Importantly, historical literacy does not just mean memorizing dates and facts, but the ability to evaluate arguments, weigh interpretations against evidence, and connect past to present.The decline of the humanities has also contributed to the collapse of empathy in American society. Literature and history, in particular, cultivate the ability to see the world through another’s eyes. Of course, empathy can be learned in other ways, but the humanities are uniquely powerful in diverse societies, where civic life depends on the capacity to empathize with those who are profoundly different from ourselves.This is why theTrump administrationand its allies have zeroed in on history education. They know what the enemies of free and compassionate societies have always known: people who understand what lies in the pages of history are far harder to oppress and far harder to coax into cruelty.In the place of teaching history, they wish to place propaganda aimed at assuring that the critical thinking, compassion and perspective cultivated by real historical education are denied to America’s students. It is a kind of education American students have been denied for too long, which is why the American public is so vulnerable to this administration’s escalation.Public education in the United States was not initially created to give students “job skills”, as so many on both sides of the political aisle today would have you believe. Teaching the skills necessary for a particular occupation, undeniably essential to economic health, was long viewed as the responsibility of private business and industry, which directly benefited from a trained workforce. Publicly funded schools existed to assure that students would have the skills needed to participate as responsible citizens of the republic. For this reason, the liberal arts, including history, were at the heart of the curriculum.This began to change in the late 1950s, as cold war paranoia fueled a shift in educational priorities towards science, mathematics, technology and engineering aimed at preventing the US from falling behind the Soviet Union in these areas. These subjects, eventually branded Stem, would gain additional traction over the course of the next 60 years as changing economic winds seemed to suggest that career prospects in the rapidly expanding “technology” sector were the best assurance of a stable, if not prosperous, future. The fact that future employment prospects were even a consideration was evidence of another, less often articulated, change that was occurring.Our understanding of education was being shifted to a view in which every part of the curriculum must have an immediate economic utility. It was, whether anyone realized it at the time or not, a dangerous and unconsidered change to the fundamental goals of education that assumed the assurance of economic prosperity required more public attention – and public funding – than the safeguarding of political liberty.It was a gamble that has cost us dearly. The reason that so many of us have become increasingly susceptible to foreign propaganda, “fake news” and just plain bad arguments can be easily explained by the fact that much American curriculum simply fails to teach students how to think critically and deprives them of the important historical and geographic information that would allow them to spot when they are being deceived.One of the great ironies of our era is that the economic benefits of Stem-focused education have proven to be an illusion. It is now clear that within a generation, many non-research based Stem jobs (and plenty of the research-based ones) are likely to simply vanish in the face of AI. And a public without a liberal arts education may simply lack the imagination to work their way out of this radical reordering of the economy. We will have traded our freedom for prosperity and ended up with neither.But it is not too late. Maga’s assault on history can be the line in the sand – the moment we recognize what we have nearly lost. The surest way to defeat the dark forces now gathering in our politics is to make education once again serve its true purpose: preparing citizens for freedom. The liberal arts have always been at the heart of that mission. If we want to remain a free people, we must restore them to their rightful place at the center of American education.Katherine Kelaidis is a research associate at the Institute of Orthodox Christian Studies in Cambridge, EnglandExplore more on these topicsUS educationOpinionHistoryTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

The US has the power to end itFri 29 Aug 2025 11.36 EDTLast modified on Fri 29 Aug 2025 11.37 EDTShareAglobalhunger-monitoring groupdeclared last weekthatGaza’s largest city and its surrounding area were suffering from an “entirely man-made” famine, mostly caused byIsrael’s deliberate starvation strategy and continued siege of the territory. This news won’t surprise anyone who has paid even scant attention to theimages and videosof emaciated children and desperate parents that have been coming out of Gaza for months.But the firstconfirmation of famineby the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), which includes the World Food Programme, the World Health Organization and other aid agencies, is an important institutional marker. Years from now, it will serve as a reminder of how Israel used starvation as aweapon of warwhile western powers did nothing. And it will be a source of shame for all those who will inevitably claim that they didn’t realize the extent of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, despite dozens of Palestinian journalists beingkilled for conveyingthat reality to the world.Donald Trumpcan stop this famine – the US is Israel’s largest weapons supplier and most important political supporter. But he has chosen not to. Instead, Trump is backing the Israeli prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, inhis latest planto sow more death and destruction by invading Gaza City and displacing 1 million Palestinians. Last month, the US president saidchildren in Gaza“look very hungry”, adding that scenes of suffering showed “real starvation”. Trump contradicted the Israeli government’s spurious claim that warnings about impending famine were fake news.Want to know why Israelis are indifferent about Gaza? Just watch Israeli TV | Roy SchwartzRead moreYet the Trump administration stayed silent after the IPC issued its latestreport last week, confirming that Gaza City and its environs are in the midst of a full-blown famine. In order to declare a famine, the IPC requires that an area must crossthree critical thresholds: at least 20% of households face an extreme shortage of food; at least 30% of children suffer from acute malnutrition; and at least two adults or four children out of every 10,000 people die each day due to starvation, or disease and malnutrition. Since the IPC was founded in 2004 to warn of global food shortages, it had confirmed only three previous famines: in Somalia in 2011, South Sudan in 2017 and Sudan last year.By the time a famine is declared, it’s often too late to stop an exponential rise in deaths due to starvation and malnutrition. When a drought-driven famine hit Somalia between 2010 and 2012, about half of the 250,000 people killedhad already diedby the time the IPC found that the country had crossed famine thresholds.During past famines, the IPC’s declaration helped drive global attention and prompted international donors to rush aid to affected regions. But the world’s attention is already focused on Gaza, and the UN and other aid groups saythey have enough foodnear Gaza’s borders to feed its entire population of 2.1 million for nearly three months. Israel simply refuses to allow much of that aid into the besieged territory – a deliberate starvation campaign supported by the Trump administration.The Israeli prime minister and his government continue to defy global outrage because they have Trump’s unwavering supportAs Tom Fletcher, the UN’s humanitarian aid chief,put it last week: “Food stacks up at borders because of systematic obstruction by Israel.” He added that the Gaza famine was “caused by cruelty, justified by revenge, enabled by indifference and sustained by complicity”. Fletcher then appealed to world leaders to pressure Netanyahu to lift the siege.That plea was ultimately intended for Trump, the only leader who can force Netanyahu to end Gaza’s suffering. But the Israeli prime minister and his government continue to defy global outrage, largely because they have Trump’s unwavering support.Since early 2024, the UN and international relief groups have been sounding alarms about the potential for widespread starvation in Gaza because of theIsraeli military blockadethat started within days of the October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.As I wrote recently, Joe Biden ignored these warnings while his administration tried to undermine criticism of its unconditional weapons shipments to Israel. Throughout 2024, when parts of Gaza reached the brink of starvation, Israel would ease its siege allowing some food and supplies to reach desperate Palestinians – and averting a descent into full-blow famine.But Netanyahu abandoned that strategy in early March, when he imposed a new siege on Gaza, withTrump’s tacit approval, depriving Palestinians of food, medicine and other basic needs. Netanyahu, who worried that his extremist government coalition would collapse if he agreed to a permanent truce with Hamas, quicklyresumed Israel’s war, breaking a ceasefire that was in place for two months. Since then, Israel has inflicted a more severe siege and starvation campaign on Gaza.On 18 August, Hamas announced that it hadaccepted a ceasefiredeal that is virtually identical to one that Israel and the US had proposed a few weeks earlier. But as he has done fornearly two years, Netanyahu is dragging his feet and making new demands to obstruct negotiations and torpedo any potential deal. Ultimately, Netanyahu wants to prolong the war and stay in power.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Speaking to reporters at the White House on Monday,Trump saidthe Gaza war would reach “a conclusive ending” in the next two or three weeks.Netanyahu has been promising – and failing to deliver – a “total victory” over Hamas for more than a year. “Total victory over Hamas will not take years,” he said confidentlyin a speechin February 2024. “It will take months.” Since then, Netanyahu expressed lofty ambitions to reshape the entire Middle East, but he continued to defy international and domestic pressure to specify Israel’s postwar plans for Gaza or how the war could end short of his amorphous goal of “total victory”. And that was a deliberate tactic: from the beginning, Netanyahu’s allies wanted a protracted war that would end with Israel occupying Gaza andethnically cleansingits Palestinian inhabitants.Last week, a top Biden administration official confirmed inan interviewaired by an Israeli TV channel that, soon after the October 2023 Hamas attack, Netanyahu was preparing for a grinding guerrilla war in Gaza which could last “for decades”. Matthew Miller, the former state department spokesperson who often defended the administration’s unconditional support for Israel, also said that Netanyahu had repeatedly sabotaged US-brokered ceasefire negotiations. (An Israeli TV report found the prime minister nixed deals or near-agreementsseven times.) But the Biden administration consistently blamed Hamas for refusing to accept a ceasefire, and rarely called out Netanyahu for his obstinacy, thinking it would harden Hamas’s position.For 15 months, Biden provided the Israeli premier with political cover and billions of dollars in US arms, becoming more deeply complicit in Israel’s use of starvation as a weapon and other war crimes. Today, Trump is repeating the same ineffective and immoral strategy, enticed by Netanyahu’s empty promise of victory while famine spreads inGaza.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies, and a journalism professor, at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsGazaOpinionDonald TrumpBenjamin NetanyahuJoe BidenFamineHungerTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

Then they came for Cracker Barrel.Whether it’s the museums or the corporations – or the universities, law firms, federal departments and agencies – the attack lines of the Trump culture war and its culture warriors are the same. The vicious full-scale assault on the Cracker Barrel restaurant chain after the company naively wandered on to the battle zone by altering its “Old Timer” logo exposes the cynicism of the whole operation and its ulterior motive to impose an authoritarian regime over every aspect of American society.On 19 August, Donald Trump launched his purge campaign against the Smithsonian with apostdenouncing it as “the last remaining segment of ‘WOKE’ …where everything discussed is how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was, and how unaccomplished the downtrodden have been.”Within 24 hours, the son echoed the father, but with a different target in the crosshairs. The day after Trump denounced the Smithsonian,Donald TrumpJr took umbrage at Cracker Barrel, joining a rightwing social media mob.Cracker Barrel’s sales had gone flat partly due to its creaky image, symbolized by a logo featuring a geezer in overalls seated cross-legged and leaning on a barrel, promoted as the “Uncle Herschel” of the store’s founder. At the company headquarters in Lebanon, Tennessee, the“Uncle Herschel Memorial”features statues of “Uncle Herschel” seated on a bench listening to a Cracker Barrel waitress. Marketing research, however, showed that the rickety ambience was off-putting to a younger suburban clientele. So “Uncle Herschel” was retired, the logo cleaned up with just the brand name front and center, the interiors with dark brown log cabin walls whitewashed and more brightly lit.‘A proxy for America’s culture war’: why Cracker Barrel’s new logo sparked ire on the rightRead moreBut this marketing facelift, a common corporate design “refinement”, as it is known, was a new frontier beyond “the last remaining segment of ‘WOKE’”. Don Jr retweeted a post by an account called theWoke War Roomattacking Julie Felss Masino, the Cracker Barrel CEO: “She scrapped a beloved American aesthetic and replaced it with sterile, soulless branding. She should resign and be replaced with leadership that will restore Cracker Barrel’s tradition.”If Don Jr had ever eaten at a Cracker Barrel, he would have had to leave the confines of Manhattan and Palm Beach. There is not a single Cracker Barrel to be found in any borough of New York City, or on Long Island either. His personal experience with “tradition” is not located in the biscuit mix section of the country store. If Don Jr’s complaint is with “soulless branding”, it does not extend to the sale of the$DJTJR(Donald J Trump Jr) crypto memecoin. But this bit of brazen hypocrisy is lost in the ocean of the Trump family’s grifting.When the right launched its version of Mao’s Cultural Revolution, now with the power of theTrump administrationbehind it, nobody predicted that Cracker Barrel would become collateral damage. The Tennessee-based chain, founded in 1969, trafficked in faux rustic pre-second world war nostalgia, an image from before the existence of supermarkets, shopping malls and the interstate highways where most of the restaurants are located. Cracker Barrel was a little theme park. Customers entered through a retail outlet that resembled a country store. On the restaurant’s walls hung old advertising signs, farm implements and framed antique photos of 19th-century folk with a grim American Gothic look. The menu consisted of “homestyle food”, including “the best classic meatloaf” with mashed potatoes and gravy.But in the 1990s and early 2000s the business suffered protests after thefiring of employees suspected of being gayand reached an agreement with the justice department to change its management practices after allegedly segregating Black diners. The clientele that favored the kitsch decor also dwindled. In response, the company shed its old prejudiced practices and recently unveiled its makeover to update its tired image. That provided the pretext for the calculated Maga explosion.Hillsdale College, a rightwing citadel in eastern Michigan that has been vehement in ramping up the culture wars, posted on X the plain Cracker Barrel logo on one side of a frame with a statue of George Washington splattered with red paint on the other under the line: “Same energy.” The Hillsdale account added: “Cracker Barrel is a beloved cultural icon, tied to the lifestyle and memories of truth-seeking Americans.”According to this college, a center of conservative thought, the restaurant chain is apparently the cultural equivalent of the Smithsonian, or should be exhibited there, and its customers who have pulled in for the chicken fried steak are “truth-seeking Americans”, presumably as opposed to those who stop for the chicken wings at Chili’s. The culture war doesn’t stop at the logo’s edge.TheWoke War Roomthat aroused Don Jr used the attack line that Cracker Barrel perpetrates a “DEI regime”. The CEO’s picture was placed next to the rainbow logo of the LGBTQ+ Alliance. The post also noted that America First Legal, a far-right group founded by Stephen Miller, Trump’s deputy involved in Ice raids, the culture war against universities and apparently much else, hadfiled complaintswith the Equal Opportunities Employment Commission and the Tennessee attorney general alleging racial discrimination by Cracker Barrel because of its DEI policy. The Maga mob piled in with misogynistic tweets against the female CEO.A Maga social media influencer, Robby Starbuck, advancing himself within the rightwing constellation as an anti-DEI activist,threatened: “Oh my goodness. When you see what we’ve got on Cracker Barrel … Wow. I don’t think anyone knew it was as bad as the stuff we received. We’re talking total capture by leftism at the exec level. We have photos, videos, etc. Should I put it all in 1 video or release 1 by 1?”In 2022, Starbuck, whose given name is Robert Newsom, was excluded from running in the Republican primary for the Tennessee fifth congressional district by the Tennessee Republican party, which found that he was not “a bona fide Republican”. His exclusion was upheld by theTennessee supreme court.On 23 August,Fox Newsfeatured his video denouncing Cracker Barrel for its involvement in gay pride events – “a microcosm of the parasitic operating procedure of leftwing activists” with a “soulless, godless, hedonistic vision of the future”. This month, he began advising Meta “on efforts to curb what they describe as political bias in its AI tools”, according to theWall Street Journal. His advisory role comes amid a defamation settlement after a Meta AI chatbot inaccurately said he had been involved in the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol. He has only been part of social media mobs.Stoking the ferocity of the onslaught against Cracker Barrel,Starbuck spoke with Christopher Rufo, who has positioned himself among the chief culture war activists on the right. He had been the key adviser to the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, in his crusades to ban books, attack the Walt Disney Company as “woke” and assail universities.Rufo is a certain kind of zealot who has achieved his greatest influence under Trump, like Miller and Project 2025’s Russell Vought, now the head of the office of management and budget, self-styled ideological commissars with a Bolshevik mentality.In aspeechin 2022 at Hillsdale College, which Rufo titled Laying Siege to the Institutions, he boasted of his “very aggressive” campaign against Disney. “You have to be ruthless and brutal in pursuit of something good,” he said, in a Leninist spirit, describing a “narrative war” with American corporations and institutions. “We get in there, we defund things we don’t like, we fund things we do like.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I have never set foot in a Cracker Barrel and, as such, have little stake in what is emblazoned above its doorways,” Rufo wrote inCity Journal, the magazine of the Manhattan Institute, a conservative thinktank where he is a senior fellow. “The logo change might have caught the public’s initial attention, but the underlying political story had real stakes. If companies that depend on conservatives adopt radical left-wing policies, they must face the consequences.”Rufo decided that Cracker Barrel was a worthy target for the overarching culture war. “Some might dismiss the Cracker Barrel campaign as minor, or even embarrassing … But there is enormous value in making an example of the company and cementing a fear that conservatives can spontaneously lash out at any institution that crosses the line. Today, it’s Cracker Barrel; tomorrow it might be Pepsi, Target, or Procter & Gamble.”Cracker Barrel’s “Old Timer” logo had to be manufactured into a cause célèbre for a larger purpose. “Even if we don’t care about Cracker Barrel in particular,” Rufo wrote, “we should all care about the ideological capture of American institutions and use whatever power we have to reverse it. And for that to occur, the Barrel must be broken.”With that call to arms, Rufo gives the game away. He doesn’t really take the conspiratorial fiction seriously. It is useful only as an instrument for bludgeoning those designated as objective enemies in order to build toward absolute power. In the gradation of his hierarchy of conservative principles, the highest value is cynicism. Rufo’s rhetoric has the characteristic tone of Stalin’s statement on 29 July 1936 declaring his Great Purge: “The inalienable quality of every Bolshevik under present conditions should be the ability to recognize an enemy of the Party no matter how well he may be masked.”On 26 August, Trump entered the fray, saying that Cracker Barrel should “admit a mistake … Make Cracker Barrel a WINNER again. Remember, in just a short period of time I made the United States of America the ‘HOTTEST’ Country anywhere in the World. One year ago, it was ‘DEAD.’ Good luck!”That evening, Cracker Barrel executives reportedly called the Trump White House to offer unconditional surrender. “They thanked President Trump for weighing in on the issue of their iconic ‘original’ logo,” Taylor Budowich, the cabinet secretary,posted. “They wanted the President to know that they heard him … and would be restoring the ‘Old Timer.’ So smart! Congrats Cracker Barrel and America!” The White House issued an official statement announcing the restoration as if it were a decisive presidential action: “Congratulations Cracker Barrel!” Nobel prize!“Uncle Herschel” was back, the “woke” conspiracy again defeated, another victory in the culture war.

But ending the horror in Gaza still relies on the worst people in the worldMarina HydeThis humanitarian catastrophe is barely of passing interest to Donald Trump. The curse of our times is how little we can do about itFri 29 Aug 2025 07.36 EDTLast modified on Fri 29 Aug 2025 21.30 EDTShareDay 222 of Donald Trump’s presidency, and Russia’s war in Ukraine – which he promised to end on day one –shows no sign of having got the memo. This was not a single-use Trump promise; he madeit at least 53 times. Yet the US president has failed to keep it, either literally or in his favourite manner: figuratively. Can you figuratively end a war? Not even, apparently.What his most recent round of failure means, however, is that Trump ispivoting back to another war, the grotesquely horrifying and unlawful humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in Gaza. Not the way he’d phrase it, possibly. This week he swerved commenting on either Israel’s invasion of Gaza City or the mounting declarations that famine and starvation are clearly under way in the territory, and instead announced: “I think within the next two, three weeks, you’re going to have a pretty good, conclusive ending.” Righto. Trump’s recipe for an ending to the horror has hitherto seemed to resemble the famous business plan of theSouth Park gnomes. Phase 1: Collect Underpants. Phase 2: ?. Phase 3: Profit.In the US president’s version, this ran along the following lines. Phase 1. Grotesquely horrifying and unlawful humanitarian catastrophe. 2. ? 3. Beach resort. Strange to look at theYalta conference photoof Churchill, Stalin and Roosevelt and think how much more quickly the three allied wartime leaders could have wrapped things up had they shunned various complexities and understood the world as a simple selection of waterfront real-estate opportunities. And yet, perhaps even stranger to imagine that while we don’t have a group selfie of Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin and Benjamin Netanyahu, the curse of our times is that the fate of so many appallingly desperate and persecuted people in the world hinges on three men who might well be imagined to be in jail were they not in office.But these are the realities. The path to peace inGazaruns through Trump, not social media posts, or window flags, or creatives “using their platform”, or any of the other gestures that, while the wishful might cast them as speaking truth to power, in fact only throw our era’s increasingly pervasive sense of powerlessness into even sharper relief.Nor, in any non-gnome sense, does it run anywhere near Ed Davey’s announcement this week that after much thought and prayer, he wouldnot be attending the king’s banquetfor Trump during his forthcoming state visit. It goes without saying that Trump wouldn’t have the first clue who the Liberal Democrat leader is. (More pressingly for Davey, and perhaps more in his power to do something about, is the polling this week that showed that 35% of his own Lib Dem voters alsohaven’t the first clue who heis when shown a photo of him.) But Davey believes boycotting dinner is the best way he can “send a message to both Trump and Starmer” that they cannot wish the catastrophe unfolding in Gaza away. He means well, yet this gesture still feels one rung above a tweet – or, indeed, aGuardian newspaper column, which is how he announced it. Regrettably, neither of the above are levers in international conflict.Being unable to plot a path to answers means a question dominates our turbulent age: is being well-meaning enough? Is it, in fact, all I can be? Have I acquitted my responsibilities in the face of historic horror by posting about it, or attacking someone else for not posting about it, or by suggesting that someone cannot care about any subject on which they have not done a post? Perhaps it’s nice to think so, but I fear that far from being the most engaged, those who live like this are the most beaten. Some of the worst people in the world – at least, some of the worst people without access to state armies – run the social media companies, and the idea that spending comfortable hours policing their platforms, working for them for free, is taking a stand or showing you care in any useful way tips beyond bizarre into cultural sickness.Social media claimed to connect and empower people – a populist promise if ever you heard one – and yet what many of us hear our friends and family say all the time in conversations about the news is that they feel powerless. People have been atomised and narcotised by this supposedly unifying and uplifting technology, and when the great perspective of history is afforded to our descendants and perhaps even our future selves, we might well find that most of our present crises were catalysed by it rather than cured by it. This morning I saw a much-shared cut-out of Travis Kelce kissing Taylor Swift in their engagement photo, superimposed on top of a war-demolished building, above a bell hooks quote: “All our silences in the face of racist assault are acts of complicity.” Dear me. Stick it in a time capsule, along with an apology note for the cultural rubble it’ll have to be dug out of.At operational level, however, things don’t change. The path to peace still goes through politicians with power. Many of them are still terrible people. They will still have to have unpleasant and even “toxic” conversations in which horse-trading and moral compromise are inevitable. And yet these things are still desirable, because this is the way it has always ended. This is the way the bombs go silent, the way the children stop starving, the way the hideous carnage ends. It is a long, perilous and precarious path – but history has made it familiar, because it is the only one that actually gets anywhere near where we need to go.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

That April, it put Robert Eugene Carter to death for killing a police officer as Carter tried to flee a robbery he had just committed.At the time, the law in the nation’s capital made the death penalty mandatory for first-degree murders of the kind Carter committed. Hedied in the electric chair.If Donald Trump has his way it won’t be long before Washington DC sees a return of capital punishment. During a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, the presidentpromisedto bring it back.Hesaid: “If somebody kills somebody in the capital, Washington DC, we’re going to be seeking the death penalty.” This comment was almost an aside in the midst of a conversation about selling government buildings to private real estate developers who, he said, would get rich when he finished making Washington a “crime free city”.“By the way, speaking of that,” the president continued as if his memory was triggered by talk of ridding Washington of crime. “Anybody murders something in the capital, capital punishment, capital, capital punishment,” he repeated as if soullessly enjoying the wordplay on a deadly serious subject.“That’s a very strong preventative,” he claimed, ignoring the mountain of evidence pointing to the fact that the death penaltyis not an effective deterrent. He mused that the country might not be “ready for it”, but that asserted “we have no choice”.And with typical Trump flourish he insisted that “everybody that’s heard it agrees with it”, though it was not clear what he was referencing, capital punishment or its supposed preventive power.The president’s promise that all murderers would get the death penalty in DC runs afoul oflongstanding supreme court precedentthat says death sentences can never be mandatory. Moreover, it plays into the complex racial politics that always attaches to the uses of capital punishment in the United States.Before saying more about both of those issues, let’s look at the history of the death penalty in the District of Columbia.According to the Death Penalty Information Center: “The first recorded execution in Washington, D.C. was the hanging of James McGirk in 1802.”McGirkkilled his pregnant wife and the twins she was carrying. His Irish heritage was at the forefront of public discussion of his crime and the way it should be punished. One newspaper highlighted the fact that McGirk “was neither born nor educated in America”. It asked: “How long can we expect our native youth to remain uncontaminated”?In 1865, Mary Surratt, who conspired to assassinate president Abraham Lincoln,washanged in the District. And another presidential assassin, Charles Guiteau,was put to deaththere in 1882 for killing president James Garfield.All told, from McGirk to Carter, 118 peoplewere executedin Washington by civilian or military authorities. Not surprisingly, race played a key role in that history.After 1962, the death penalty was no longer a mandatory punishment for murder in the city. And in 1981, the city councilabolishedcapital punishment entirely, a decision ratified by the votes a decade later.But the preference of the voters does not seem to trouble the president. In this case, he doesn’t need to worry about that because of DC’s status and the federal government’s oversight of it.That means that the US attorney’s office, under the supervision of the Department of Justice, not local officials,would be in charge of turning the president’s plan into reality. And no one should be surprised that the president wants the death penalty to be part of his plan to rid Washington DC of crime.On the first day of his second term, heissuedan executive order directing the attorney general to “pursue the death penalty for all crimes of a severity demanding its use”.Does that mean all murders and all murderers?In 1976, the supreme court made clear that itdid not think so. The court struck down a North Carolina statute that made the death penalty mandatory for first-degree murder.What justice Potter Stewart said in that case is particularly instructive as we consider what Trump discussed on Tuesday.“The history of mandatory death penalty statutes in the United States,” Stewart wrote, “reveals that the practice of sentencing to death all persons convicted of a particular offense has been rejected as unduly harsh and unworkably rigid. The two crucial indicators of evolving standards of decency respecting the imposition of punishment in our society – jury determinations and legislative enactment – both point conclusively to the repudiation of automatic death sentences.”Stewart explained: “At least since the Revolution, American jurors have, with some regularity, disregarded their oaths and refused to convict defendants where a death sentence was the automatic consequence of a guilty verdict … Nineteenth century journalists, statesmen, and jurists repeatedly observed that jurors were often deterred from convicting palpably guilty men of first-degree murder under mandatory statutes.”And he highlighted the District of Columbia’s 1962 rejection of mandatory death sentences as an important indicator of “contemporary standards of decency”.Because of its severity and gravity, death sentencing must, Stewart said, “allow the particularized consideration of relevant aspects of the character and record of each convicted defendant before the imposition upon him of a sentence of death”.Respect for such constitutional niceties has never been the president’s strong suit, especially when it would get in the way of a policy he wants to pursue.Beyond its patently unconstitutionality, restoring capital punishment for everyone who commits murder in Washington DC would meanbringing back one of this country’s most racist practicesto a place where more than 40% of the residents are Black people.We know that raceplays a role at every stage of the capital punishment process. Black defendants are more likely to be charged with capital offenses and to receive death sentences than are white people, especially when the people murdered were themselves white.But the racial effects don’t stop there. Black people sentenced to death are more likely to be chosen for execution and tohave their executions botched.Trump may not know those particulars, but he very likely knows how the death penalty sits with many Black people. As the criminologist James Unnever and his colleaguesnote: “There is a clear racial divide in support for the death penalty, with whites favoring and Blacks opposing this sanction. This divide has persisted for decades and remains statistically and substantively significant even when controls are introduced for the known correlates of death penalty attitudes.“A meaningful portion of this chasm is explained, however, by racism, with whites who manifest animus to blacks being more likely to embrace the lethal punishment of offenders.”If federalizing law enforcement and putting armed soldiers on the streets of Washington DCsent a powerful signal of white dominancein a city with a substantial Black population, Trump’s words about the death penalty reinforced that message. When the time comes, it will be up to the courts to defend the supreme court’s precedent on mandatory death sentences and to put a stop to the racial politics that restoring it to DC would represent.In the meantime, it is well worth remembering that the last person executed there was a 28-year-old Black man whokilled a white police officerand was subject to a mandatory death penalty.Austin Sarat, William Nelson Cromwell professor of jurisprudence and political science at Amherst College, is the author or editor of more than 100 books, including Gruesome Spectacles: Botched Executions and America’s Death PenaltyExplore more on these topicsCapital punishmentOpinionDonald TrumpWashington DCRacecommentShareReuse this content"

He was hobbling, hands clenched, face contorted and plastered with sweat. He was in the depths of the 2023SydneyMarathon. Thirty kilometres down and 12 more to go. I remember thinking: “Why on earth would anyone put themselves through this?”Fast forward two years and in a matter of hours, I will find myself on the same route that almost broke him.Eighteen months ago if you asked me if I could run a marathon I would have smugly told you I’m “anatomically not built for running”.Marathons were completely outside my wheelhouse. I witnessed my dear friend suffer. Why would I willingly put myself through that? Yet here I am, about to attempt a distance that onlyaround 1%of the population ever completes.What changed?Somewhere in the swirl of my desire to spend more time outside and running’s cultural boom, like thousands of others, I found myself running.

The next thing I knew I had signed up for a half marathon. The goalposts for what my body could achieve kept expanding and it felt incredible.Then the Sydney Marathon announced its elevationto Abbott World Marathon Major status. For the first time, Sydney would join the legendary company of London, Berlin, Boston, Chicago, New York and Tokyo. The offer to take part in its inaugural year felt too special to ignore.The choice to do it wasn’t just about the challenge of 42km. It was about experiencing my city transformed – its streets shut off to cars, alive with celebration and full of the kind of collective energy that lingers long after the finish line.However, I do wish somebody told me that training for a marathon isa marathon in itself.Runningthat distance isn’t something you can fluke. You could try, but most experts would strongly recommend against it. Not to mention the world of pain you’d be in.You need weeks of consistent running to build a strong base and gradually increase your weekly mileage. Add in strength sessions so your body can handle the load, speed work to make you faster and a healthy dose of stretching and foam rolling and suddenly your calendar is chock-a-block. If you are time-poor do not train for a marathon.My long runs on the weekend slowly increased in distance and before I knew it I completed a 30km run and didn’t disintegrate to dust. But with that benchmark also came the complete inability to get off the couch for at least 24 hours.Beyond the shock and delight of discovering what my body could do, running gave me something I didn’t expect. My training became something much deeper after the sudden unexpected death of my father. Running gave me structure when grief left me hollow.Sydney marathon’s debut as major is timed perfectly with Australia’s running boom | Elise BeacomRead moreI found comfort in the pink hues of morning light, meditation in the rhythm of my feet on the pavement and pride in finishing runs I once thought were beyond me. Even when I felt as if I couldn’t keep going emotionally, my body showed me that I physically could.I got through many of the hard long runs with some of Sydney’s run crews who transform a solo sport into a family. On those runs, I wasn’t defined by my grief. I was part of a community, moving together, doing what we collectively love and in those hours I felt free.The marathon demands that you push when you want to retreat. The training teaches you resilience that seeps into other corners of your life. It’s no longer just about finishing a race, it’s about knowing you’re stronger than the part of you that wants to stop.As I walk towards the start line on Sunday with about 35,000 others to embark on the insane 42km journey, I know my stomach will churn with equal parts excitement and fear. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t terrified, but the fear doesn’t intimidate me.Thefastest runners do it in two hours, most of us take four to five. The training has taught me it’s not just about running the distance, it’s about resilience, connection and proof that even when life feels impossible, we can endure it.Issy Phillips is a Sydney-based writerExplore more on these topicsMarathon runningOpinionRunningSydneycommentShareReuse this content"

At least he makes an effortRachel ConnollySo-called experts are warning women about men who try too hard to look like feminists. There are worse red flags than thatFri 29 Aug 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 29 Aug 2025 21.31 EDTSharePicture a man sitting opposite you on public transport. He wields a copy of The Will to Change by bell hooks, and he takes care to parade the front cover or the spine lest any nearby strangers miss the title. He is in his 20s or 30s and conventionally attractive; maybe he has a dangly earring or two. There on his knee rests a tote bag. This man would not engage in loutish, careless behaviour like “manspreading” or placing all his stuff on the seats. And the tote bag probably bears the logo of an ethical brand or a bookshop. The bag is probably adorned with social-justice badges. If he showed you what music he is listening to, it might be, say, Lana Del Rey or Clairo.Here we have the performative male – a new kind of vaguely problematic man to watch out for. And one who is the subject of all manner of viral TikToks and memes, and media coverage everywhere from GQ to the New York Times, which reported on a recentperformative male contest in Seattle. For some reason when I picture him he always has curly hair. Big bouncy lustrous curls. You can probably add your own details, but you get the picture. The idea is that the performative male is a guy who goes about looking feminist and woke. The catch is that his aesthetic is curated to appeal to what he thinks women might like rather than being a totally earnest expression of his interests.Imagine that! A person choosing clothes and accessories to increase their attractiveness in the eyes of the gender they are trying to sleep with. Very insidious and unusual behaviour. I can tell you right now I have never once in my life participated in such a charade. I will admit, too, that some of this coverage has made me feel baffled by what is apparently considered desirable. The performative male is said to wear severalLabubusand drinkmatcha. I don’t really understand why this would lure women in. It’s even been suggested a performative male might stow tampons on his person. But if I met a cisgender man who made a point of carrying tampons around with him I’d probably telephone the police.My first thought, when I came across this trend, was: God, straight men cannot win. My second was: yes, this aesthetic is very common – not just with men but with women too. A parade of images flashed before me of all the young women and men I have seen self-consciously clutching their unbroken copies of Angela Davis and so on in coffee shops and on the bus. “A lot of the time they don’t know what they’re talking about,” one of the hosts of the Seattle performative male contest told the NYT, speaking about the kind of men who adopt this look. “It’s just an aesthetic for them.” But I would gently submit that a substantial proportion of the women who take care to post highlighted and pencilled-over pages of bell hooks to Instagram do not put much of the ethos of her work into practice in their own lives either.After all, performative righteousness is not solely the preserve of young men. I have often felt that the parallel vapidness and popularity of online social-justice messaging has created an entire generation (or two) of people obsessed with the idea of telegraphing their own worthiness rather than practising it.As the performative male trend has gained traction, I have received a few PR emails about it on behalf of “experts” with funky job titles offering to help counsel young women to spot toxic signs and red flags in the opposite sex. These missives, which I receive every time a new dating trend is coined, are always full of my own personal red flags. One such email on behalf of a “relationship coach” explained that the performative male is dangerous because he “speaks the language of emotional availability but doesn’t practise it”. I am happy to say that, for all its shadowy allusions to grave transgression, I have no idea what this sentence means.Labubus, The Bell Jar and tampons: the ‘performative male’ attracts attentionRead moreThe email included some red flags to watch out for in men:1) Constant need for external validation2) Actions that don’t match words3) Avoids real vulnerabilityThis is typical of the way pop psychology spreads online, with lists of traits specific enough to sound authoritative but vague enough that they could apply to almost anyone. Yes, these three red flags could be said to apply to plenty of the men I know, and plenty of the women too. But what has any of this got to do with a man drinking an iced blueberry matcha in public? There is a cottage industry of these “experts” who prey on and foster the neuroses of anxious young women. Likewise, many of the influencers I see on my timeline who specialise in dating advice about who to avoid and how to spot toxicity seem to be neurotic, lonely people doling out tips which offer nothing more than a road map to a paralysing fear and suspicion of other people.Ill-intentioned people come in many different guises. Some toxic men will indeed carry a Daunt Books tote bag, but if you see a red flag in every one, you will write off a lot of decent, well-intentioned people. The truth is that out in the world you will get hurt and get hurt and get hurt. And in doing so, you will learn how to make better choices.Rachel Connolly is the author of the novel Lazy CityExplore more on these topicsMenOpinionRelationshipscommentShareReuse this content"

We mobilised 800 people to support the asylum seekers, who waved back at us from the hotel to show their gratitude. On the other side of the road, about 250 people had gathered to demand the hotel be closed. Speakers there called refugees “illegal”, “invaders” and “parasites”.Seeing and hearing our opponents, the anti-racists responded with a spontaneous chant of “Nazi scum, off our streets”, which our side was able to sustain for more than an hour. I understand why people wanted to express their contempt for the people who tell lies about refugees, but the chant didn’t strike me as effective when I heard it, and the more I have thought about it since, the more convinced I am that it was the wrong strategy.There were fascists present at the demonstration – one banner advertised a small hard-right group – but they were not the organisers; they hung back, mute, at the edge of the protest. The crowd did chant in support of Tommy Robinson. The latter, I suspect, is probably the link that organisations like Stand Up to Racism lean on when labelling the current anti-refugee movement as fascist. (Many of the protests, their spokesperson has said, “are organised by known fascists and Hitler admirers”.) But Robinson, unlike the fascists of the 1970s, doesn’t leaven his speeches with reworked passages from Mein Kampf.He isn’t a “Hitler admirer”, nor is he perceived as such by the movement. He used to boast of having a Churchill quotetattooed on his arm.The strategy of labelling our enemies fascist depends on a context where the mainstream is willing to isolate and shame Nazis. Those are not the times we are living in. So a smarter, more tailored message is necessary.Take Robert Jenrick, the shadow lord chancellor, who recently attended an anti-refugee protest in Epping.Anti-fascists released a photographfrom the protest featuring Jenrick with Eddy Butler in the background – Butler is a former election candidate for the British National party and was the guru behind its “rights for whites” campaign in the 1990s. What was most revealing about the incident was what came next: a “source close” to Jenrick said hedid not know who Butler was; Jenrick kept the photographs of his time in Epping showing on his X profile. He made it clear he wasn’t embarrassed, and the story dissipated to nothing.If the movement was perceived as fascist – by Jenrick, or by the other Conservative and Reform politicians who have associated themselves with it, or by the Labour ministers who have conceded the right’s main demands and agreed to close the refugee hotels – then it would not be as confident and unrepentant as it is. And behind the politicians who have flattered the street movement are a much larger group who share its insistence on describing migration in negative terms. Keir Starmer, the prime minister,tweetedthan a dozen times in August about migration – every one of his messages has presented it as problematic, “illegal” or the work of criminal people smugglers.1:19Protesters clash at asylum hotel demonstrations across the UK – videoIn the weeks since the Barbican protest, the anti-refugee movement has kept up its momentum. Calling them Nazis – even when there were fascists present at the edges of their event – has done little to undermine them. They don’t believe they are fascists; they don’t have organised fascists in their leading circles. The term seems to them exaggerated, laughable.You may say I’m expecting too much of one term; even if the fascist label had worked, and got under our opponents’ skins, there is no way we would know it was working. But in the 1970s, it was common for former supporters of the National Front to break with that campaign and to cite its fascism as their reason for leaving. Here is one defector quoted in the East End Advertiserin 1977, explaining that she abandoned the far right when she saw pictures of Front leader John Tyndall dressed in a Nazi uniform. “I won’t stand for any of this Sieg Heil nonsense,” the former NF member said. (This was, of course, a mere 30 years after the blitz; east London still bore the physical scars left by German bombs.) If the same tactics were working 50 years later, anti-fascists would be meeting people like that and making sure their stories were in the press.Flags as symbols of prejudice, not pride – and a distinct air of menace. Welcome to England 2025 | John HarrisRead moreWhen we deal with the far right now, we are facing a movement that is pushing forward a group of female leaders – that feels different from five years ago, let alone 50 years since. In Islington, one of the speeches came from a woman described as running a local nursery (it was read out on her behalf). The contemporary far right is focused on pushing a single narrative about refugees, all based on the same logic – that the people in the hotel are single men, are foreigners, and on both scores are likely to be sexual predators.This argument wins supporters, and it shields them from accusations that they are extremists. The only way to confront this is to meet it head on, by rejecting any idea that foreign men – or Muslims – are more prone to sexual offences than their British counterparts. The logic of the argument is racist – it relies on the assumption that just because they are migrants, or asylum seekers, or not white (and with no other supportive evidence), they must be more prone to sexual violence than the men who already live here.And the simplest, one-line refutation of it is to look at the men who were arrested for offences in the various race riots that followed events at Southport last year. Of those men, a staggering 40% had beenreported to the police for domestic violence. There is, in other words, probablyno single group of people – not in Britain or anywhere else – who are more prone to violence against women than the people now standing outside the hotels denouncing refugees.This, rather than shouting Nazi, is the argument most likely to undermine the anti-refugee protests. We need to be using it in our leaflets, when we talk to people, and on our protests.David Renton is a barrister and the author of The New Authoritarians: Convergence on the RightDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

And they don’t give up when things get toughScott McDonald is chief executive of the British CouncilFri 29 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 29 Aug 2025 10.14 EDTShareOn Wednesday night, our office in Kyiv wasdamaged in a Russian missile attack. It was a stark reminder of the risks that an organisation such as ours faces in conflict-affected areas. I was relieved to hear that all colleagues were safe and accounted for. One colleague was injured and admitted to hospital but thankfully he is in a stable condition.Working under such conditions around the world is challenging, and yet, time and again, our colleagues and partners demonstrate courage and commitment in carrying on despite the dangers. Their resilience is extraordinary. We are working to find ways to minimise disruption and continuing to support our team there.Persistent air alerts mean some of our colleagues are required to remain in shelters, but sadly this is nothing new. The war has taken an enormous toll on the Ukrainian population, including a deterioration in quality of life, severe psychological and emotional challenges, and the disruption of social connections and education.But the unyielding spirit of the people is always evident. Take, for instance, a British Council event that took place in September last year, when we set up a pop-up event in Lviv in partnership with Molodvizh, the city’s largest youth event. Tragically, during a missile attack a few hours before the event, a representative of a partner organisation was killed, along with her family. This greatly affected everyone, but it was felt by all the partners that it was important the event should continue.Despite these perilous circumstances, British Council colleagues and partner organisations continue our work with education, teaching, English language learning and cultural programmes right acrossUkraine, as we have done for the past 30 years. When a country is at war the protection of its culture is ever more important, and the British Council is a key partner in supporting Ukraine.We are working with partners to train more than 15,000 teachers in Ukraine in techniques to help young children living with trauma. We also deliver theUK-Ukraine school partnerships programme, funded by the UK government, which connects about 3,000 pupils and 100 teachers in both countries. Through a shared love of reading, the initiative develops cultural understanding, builds resilience and supports emotional wellbeing.We have also delivered 10,000 online courses in English for displaced Ukrainians in the UK and have connected Ukrainian arts and cultural organisations with their British counterparts, showcasing their work internationally and supporting Ukrainian cultural expression.As an arms-length body of theForeign, Commonwealth and Development Office, we support the UK’s foreign policy interests – but we are designed to operate over the long term, independent and not constrained by short-term government cycles. Today, the British Council works in 200 countries and territories, with people on the ground in 100, reaching more than 600 million people, and connecting them with the UK’s arts and culture, education and English language.My colleagues work in the most complex and often dangerous places, whether in Myanmar, Iraq, the occupied Palestinian territories, Venezuela or Bangladesh. And they don’t give up when the going gets tough. If we are absolutely forced to withdraw from a region, we return as soon as possible. This means that our history has not been without tragedy. In 1971, guards were killedprotecting our office in Dhakaduring Bangladesh’s liberation war. More lives were lost during theTaliban attack on our officein Kabul in 2011. There have been shootings, arrests and detentions. We will always be grateful to the people who have stood with us against those who will go to the most violent ends to disrupt our work.Over the past 90 years there have been periods of friction, war and conflict and some of relative peace. I fear the years ahead hold significant challenge. But that is when the British Council needs to deliver more than ever.This war has damaged Ukraine’s infrastructure, putting the right to education of millions of young people at stake. The British government recentlycommitted to a 100-year partnershipwith Ukraine, signifying the breadth and depth of relationships between our countries. The work of the British Council is more important than ever – it will continue throughout the war, office or no office.Scott McDonald is chief executive of the British CouncilDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

No less than Lady Gaga, whose music helped the debut series go viral. She plays Nevermore Academy teacher Rosaline Rotwood and will unleash the spooky new song Dead Dance, destined to be this year’s Halloween hit.Netflix, 3 SeptemberMitchell And Webb Are Not HelpingView image in fullscreenRidiculously silly fun … David Mitchell, Lara Ricote, Kiell Smith-Bynoe, Krystal Evans and Robert Webb in Mitchell and Webb Are Not Helping.Photograph: Channel 4A huge moment for Peep Show fans: almost a decade after their last series together, David Mitchell and Robert Webb are finally reunited and back at it in a new sketch show.

Domnhall Gleeson is Ned Sampson, the excitable new editor of failing Midwestern newspaper the Toledo Truth Teller, which shares its office with a loo roll company. His bored and useless team is played by an ace cast including Tim Key, Gbemisola Ikumelo and Oscar Nunez (who has left Dunder Mifflin and is now the paper’s exasperated accountant). Will he be able to inspire them? Not without plenty of cringe comedy moments.Sky Max/Now, 5 SeptemberTaskMare of Easttown mastermind Brad Ingelsby has created another addictive, drug-laced crime drama. His latest HBO miniseries stars Mark Ruffalo as a silver fox FBI agent put in charge of a taskforce of tyros, investigating a string of disturbingly violent home invasions in suburban Philly. It soon becomes a battle of wits between two troubled men, as Ruffalo hunts down Ozark’s Tom Pelphrey, the seemingly unassuming family man who leads the masked, armed gang.Sky Atlantic/Now, 8SeptemberOnly Murders in the BuildingSomeone call the city council because there sure are a lot of homicides happening at the Arconia apartment block.

His upcoming tell-all documentary covers the years he went from the highest-paid TV star of all time to a drug-fuelled meltdown where he infamously referred to himself as a “warlock” with “Adonis DNA”. Testimony comes from friends, enemies, family, his dealer and, most importantly, himself.Netflix, 10 SeptemberThe GirlfriendView image in fullscreenA glossy guilty pleasure … Robin Wright and Laurie Davidson in The Girlfriend.Photograph: Courtesy of PrimeGone Girl: the mother-in-law remix.

She wants your life”). A wealthy woman doubts the motivations of her son’s new girlfriend – expect tension, twists and a glossy guilty pleasure. Is she being justifiably protective or wildly paranoid?Prime Video, 10 SeptemberBlack RabbitForget The Bear – Netflix has cooked up the hot new restaurant drama of the season. Black Rabbit opens with a stick ’em up at a swanky party in the eponymous New York eatery, then never lets up. Jude Law and Jason Bateman star as chancer brothers Jake and Vince Friedken, whose lives unravel at speed. It’s a wild ride, packed with arson, blackjack, embezzlement … and the world’s fanciest hot dogs.Netflix, 18 SeptemberThe LowdownView image in fullscreen‘A truthstorian’ … Ethan Hawke in The Lowdown.Photograph: FXIn 2011, citizen journalist and self-styled “truthstorian” Lee Roy Chapman published an incendiary exposé of the founder of Tulsa’s secret connections with the Ku Klux Klan, forcing the city in Oklahoma to rethink its past. Ethan Hawke now stars as “the man who knew too much” in a stylishly gritty fictionalisation. Even more mouthwateringly, this knotty neo-noir has been created by Native American film-maker Sterlin Harjo, the prodigiously talented co-creator of trailblazing teen-com Reservation Dogs.Disney+, 23 SeptemberSlow HorsesView image in fullscreenWill he bring down MI5? … Christopher Chung and Hiba Bennati in Slow Horses.Photograph: PRWhen deluded “sex god” Roddy Ho (Christopher Chung) gets honeytrapped, it sets off a chain of events for the Slough House spies that almost brings down MI5. We’ve reached the fifth season of the espionage drama that has become a TV juggernaut, and there’s plenty to look forward to, from Kristin Scott Thomas’s Diana throwing shade in every scene to Jack Lowden’s River trying to look normal in a techno club, death by a can of pink paint and, of course, closeups of Jackson Lamb’s foul feet. Praise be to Gary Oldman for giving this heroically slovenly role his all.Apple TV+, 24 SeptemberHouse of GuinnessView image in fullscreenTime to split the G … Emily Fairn in House of Guinness.Photograph: NetflixTime to split the G with Steven Knight’s new Guinness dynasty drama.

So obviously, their next step is chilling viewers to the bone by creating a thriller set in a correctional institute for teens. Toni Collette stars as the facility’s leader and, judging by her hair-raising vibe in the trailer, expect to start sleeping with the lights on.Netflix, 25 SeptemberThe SavantView image in fullscreenEssential viewing for our age … Nnamdi Asomugha and Jessica Chastain in The Savant.Photograph: Elizabeth FisherOscar-winning actor Jessica Chastain stars in this new series based on a fascinating Cosmopolitan article from 2019. It follows a secretive profiler working for the FBI to identify the men plotting mass killings online, with such an uncanny ability to tell the difference between serious threats and those who fetishise violence that she’s known as the Savant. Given the alarming rise in incels, pickup artists, far-right misogynists and the red pill community, this feels like essential viewing.Apple TV+, 26 SeptemberChad PowersView image in fullscreenBig-hearted sports comedy … Glen Powell in Chad Powers.Photograph: Daniel Delgado/DisneyNFL superstar Eli Manning made a YouTube skit where he donned a disguise and showed up college jocks with his football skills. Now the real-life prank gets the full Ted Lasso treatment, fleshed out into a big-hearted sports comedy. Glen Powell stars as a disgraced quarterback who dons a wig and tache to go undercover as the titular Powers, joining a struggling team to revive their fortunes – and, in the process, his own career. Steve Zahn steals scenes as his coach.Disney+, 30 SeptemberBlue LightsSirens wailing and stab vests on, the Belfast police drama comes nee-nawing back for its third series – and, word has it, it’s the best yet.

But can the pair really make it if Joanne isn’t Jewish? We’ll find out along with Joanne’s razor-tongued sister Morgan (Justine Lupe) and Noah’s dopey brother Sasha (Timothy Simons) – who may or may not be about to have an affair. Plus, Brody’s wife Leighton Meester joins the cast.Netflix, 23 OctoberDown Cemetery RoadView image in fullscreenA deadly conspiracy … Emma Thompson and Ruth Wilson in Down Cemetery Road.Photograph: Matt Towers/AppleThe combo of Mick Herron’s books and Apple’s budget has already paid dividends with the smash-hit spy drama Slow Horses.

In How Are You?, Partridge flies back to the UK after a 12-month trip to Saudi Arabia and realises that he isn’t as happy as he thinks. What follows is a state-of-the-nation mental health documentary, presented by a man with one eye on his career. This cannot come quickly enough.BBC, OctoberIt: Welcome to DerryView image in fullscreenJust when you thought it was safe to go back into the sewers … Taylour Paige in It: Welcome to Derry.Photograph: HBONothing to do with Derry Girls, sadly, or Sister Michael would surely defeat the evil entity. This prequel to Stephen King’s seminal horror follows a Black family as they move into a cursed white suburb in Maine circa 1962. Racist neighbours aren’t the only lurking threat, as we finally learn the origin story of Pennywise the clown (Bill Skarsgård). Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the sewers …Sky Atlantic/Now,OctoberRiot WomenView image in fullscreenThe most exciting show Sally Wainwright has ever worked on … Rosalie Craig in Riot Women.Photograph: BBC/Drama Republic Ltd.Sally Wainwright’s comedy drama about a group of menopausal women who start a punk band in West Yorkshire.

Well, unlucky. His new project is also set in Albuquerque – albeit a starkly contrasting one. In this darkly comic, genre-straddling sci-fi series, Rhea Seehorn (AKA Better Call Saul’s Kim Wexler) stars as “the most miserable person on Earth” who “must save the world from happiness”. Hopes are high for a Severance-style mind-bender. As Gilligan says: “There’s no crime, no methamphetamine. It’s going to be fun and different.”Apple TV+, 7 NovemberThe Beast in MeView image in fullscreenA delight … Claire Danes and Matthew Rhys in The Beast in Me.Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix © 2025Homeland fans, assemble!

Looks like she may have found the subject of her next book.Netflix, 13 NovemberThe Beatles AnthologyThirty years after it first aired on British television, The Beatles Anthology series – known as the definitive documentary on the Fab Four – has been remastered by Peter Jackson’s production company. It also has previously unseen material in a brand new ninth episode, with behind-the-scenes footage showing Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr coming together for the release of the original show.

The first four episodes drop in November, with three more following on Christmas Day and the finale on New Year’s Eve. Details are scant, but expect a maximalist spectacle as the Upside Down comes for Hawkins itself; more action, more characters, more monsters and more runtime than ever before.Netflix, 26 NovemberFalloutView image in fullscreenBuckle up for one hell of a ride … Aaron Moten as Maximus in Fallout.Photograph: Lorenzo Sisti/PrimeThis super-fun and stupidly violent video game adaptation about survival in a post-apocalyptic world was a blast to watch last year.

With Macaulay Culkin and Justin Theroux joining the cast and juicy backstories to discover, buckle up for one hell of a ride.Prime Video, 17 DecemberAll Her FaultSuccession’s Sarah Snook acts in and executive produces this Andrea Mara adaptation, about a woman who discovers that her son is missing. Maybe one person took him, but maybe the entire community is implicated. Snook leads an outrageously starry cast, with Dakota Fanning, Abby Elliott and Michael Peña all taking supporting roles.Sky/Now, date TBCAll’s FairIt’s a bold move: casting Kim Kardashian as a lead role in a drama boasting Naomi Watts, Glenn Close and Sarah Paulson.

When the 25-year-old arrives in Vienna ready for superstardom, his radical talent sends religious court composer Antonio Salieri (Paul Bettany) into a tailspin – and he vows to bring Mozart down. With Black Doves and Giri/Haji creator Joe Barton at the helm, it’s set to be a symphony of high drama.Sky/Now, date TBCDreaming Whilst BlackView image in fullscreenRipping up the rulebook … Adjani Salmon and Babirye Bukilwa in Dreaming Whilst Black.Photograph: Gary Moyes/BBCThe first series of this Bafta-winning sitcom announced the arrival of one of the freshest, most distinctive voices in British comedy in years. Adjani Salmon’s tale of a struggling Black film-maker trying to make it in the industry was surreal, hilarious and packed with so many barbs at the privilege endemic to the world of TV it’s amazing it ever got made. And now it’s back for a second attempt at ripping up the rulebook. This time round, its lead is producing period dramas in an era when production companies supposedly champion diversity – except things aren’t quite like that …BBC, date TBCFilm ClubView image in fullscreenMore than just friends? … Aimee Lou Wood and Nabhaan Rizwan in Film Club.Photograph: Ben Blackall/BBCShe’s already had a stellar 2025 with The White Lotus and Toxic Town.

When Noa lands his dream job on the other side of the country, the pair must decide whether they’re more than just friends.Suranne Jonesplays Evie’s eccentric mother, with Adolescence’s Owen Cooper as an annoying neighbour.

She now teams up with Doctor Who’sJodie Whittakerfor this six-part heist thriller. Having spent the past 10 years in a Spanish prison, skilled confidence trickster Jones is released on compassionate grounds after a cancer diagnosis and reunites with former criminal sidekick Whittaker for one last job – a multimillion-pound art theft. A zippy tale of crime capers and complex female friendship, set in the picturesque mountains of southern Spain.ITV1, date TBCMaliceBased on talent alone, Malice should be enough to make you pay attention. Written by James Wood (of the deathlessly wonderful Rev), this is a psychological thriller about a male nanny who infiltrates a rich family with bad intentions. The parents are played by David Duchovny and Carice van Houten, and the nanny – wait for it – by Jack Whitehall. Malice represents an intriguing turn to drama for Whitehall. If he can stick the landing, this should be great.Prime Video, date TBCMr ScorseseView image in fullscreenIt doesn’t get any more A-list than this … Mr Scorsese.Photograph: Melinda Sue Gordon/AppleAfter decades making documentaries and movies about other people,Martin Scorsesegets a series all about himself. This definitive five-part portrait covers his life and work from his student years to the present day. Director Rebecca Miller was granted “unrestricted access” to Scorsese’s personal archives and describes the project as “one of the defining experiences of my life as a film-maker”. The call sheet of interviewees – Sharon Stone, Jodie Foster, Margot Robbie, Cate Blanchett, Robert De Niro, Mick Jagger, Steven Spielberg, Daniel Day-Lewis, Leonardo DiCaprio – couldn’t be any more A-list.Apple TV+, date TBCSmall ProphetsView image in fullscreenExtremely special … Pearce Quigley and Lauren Patel in Small Prophets.Photograph: Matt Squire/BBCFollowing Detectorists and Worzel Gummidge comes Mackenzie Crook’s intriguing new comedy. A Manchester man with a missing girlfriend is given a recipe for a potion that allows him to tell the future. Given Crook’s fondness for folky pastoral textures, Small Prophets – which features animated sequences and a rare yet welcome acting turn from Michael Palin – sounds like it could end up being extremely charming and special.BBC, date TBCThe BeautyProlific show runner Ryan Murphy takes a break from true crime and camp horror to adapt a graphic novel into a Black Mirror-ish conspiracy drama. An STI dubbed “The Beauty” makes those infected more physically attractive but eventually kills them. Is it part of a sinister government plot? Why are the detective duo investigating the disease’s origins being targeted by federal agents, corrupt politicians and a ruthless assassin? Evan Peters, Rebecca Hall, Jeremy Pope and Anthony Ramos star, while Ashton Kutcher appears as a tech billionaire.Disney+,date TBCThe Chair CompanyExpect this comedy from multiple Emmy-winning comedian Tim Robinson to vibrate with the same hilariously awkward energy as his sketch show I Think You Should Leave. It follows an employee who undergoes an embarrassing workplace incident, only to end up investigating a far-reaching conspiracy. Which sounds a lot like the setup for an ITYSL sketch – unsurprising given the show is co-created by Zach Kanin, the other co-writer of the Netflix hit. Brace yourself for an entire series of brilliant cringe comedy.Sky/Now, date TBCThe Death of Bunny MunroView image in fullscreenBrace yourself for excellence … Rafael Mathé and Matt Smith in The Death of Bunny Munro.Photograph: SkyIf you can remember how flat-out incredible Channel 4’s Somewhere Boy was, then be doubly prepped for excellence here. That show’s writer, Pete Jackson, has adapted Nick Cave’s darkly tender 2009 novel into a six-part series, about a sex-addicted travelling salesman who travels around East Sussex with his son under the shadow of an approaching serial killer. Matt Smith stars too, if you needed any further convincing.Sky Atlantic/Now, date TBCThe HackView image in fullscreenBehind the headlines … Toby Jones as journalist Alan Rusbridger in The Hack.Photograph: ITVToby Jones and David Tennant star as the Guardian journalists who broke the phone-hacking scandal that ended up shutting down the News of the World in a drama that goes behind the headlines. But alongside that, it weaves in the story of Daniel Morgan, the private investigator found murdered by axe in a pub car park in 1987. Writer Jack Thorne describes it as “a fight for the truth” that matters so much in our “age where the truth seems more in danger than ever”. Given that it’s created by the team behind Mr Bates vs the Post Office, we expect nothing less.ITV1, date TBCThe Iris AffairView image in fullscreenUnapologetically exciting … Tom Hollander and Niamh Algar in The Iris Affair.Photograph: Matteo Graia/SkyLuther proved that Neil Cross is at his very best when he’s serving us heightened genre thrills, which is exactly what The Iris Affair sounds like. An “unapologetically exciting” chase thriller set in Italy, it pits Niamh Algar’s enigmatic genius against Tom Hollander’s wealthy tech entrepreneur. Cross promises that Iris is “a lead character the like of which I don’t think we’ve ever met before on TV,” but, even if we have, at least it’ll be pretty to look at.Sky/Now, date TBCThe Night ManagerNine years have elapsed since this adaptation of John le Carré’s novel gripped the UK. Tom Hiddleston’s return as the army-trained luxury hotelier turned informant makes this second series (and an upcoming third) a tantalising prospect, despite no longer being based on Le Carré’s writing. The latter shouldn’t matter a jot, though, if it can recapture the most captivating watercooler moment of its first outing. We’re talking, of course, about the infamous sex scene that became known as “Hiddlebum”.BBC, date TBCThe Seven Dials MysteryAlmost a century on from its original publication, Agatha Christie’s detective novel has been granted a lavish Netflix adaptation. Adapted by Chris Chibnall, the series will count Martin Freeman and Helena Bonham-Carter among its cast. Less celebrated than other Christie works, the book has been adapted for screen before – John Gielgud starred in a 1981 ITV film – but hopefully this relative obscurity will help the show escape the trap of familiarity.Netflix, date TBCThe Witches of EssexPresenting, acting, DJing, interviewing – Rylan has done it all. Now the toothsome TV treasure turns his hand to historical investigation, teaming up with Prof Alice Roberts to dig into the most intense spate of witch hunts in British history. The 16th and 17th century witch trials in his home county saw thousands of vulnerable women persecuted for sorcery. Many were burnt at the stake. Made by Louis Theroux’s production company, this three-parter should be grimly fascinating.Sky History,date TBCTrinityWhile the world patiently waits for more Line of Duty, Jed Mercurio has been cooking up something else entirely. Trinity is a big Netflix conspiracy drama about a naval officer who becomes involved with the secretary of defense. Gugu Mbatha-Raw plays the officer, Richard Madden plays the minister and, if previous Mercurio shows have been any indication, the series will play out in a blast of rattling accelerating tension.Netflix, date TBCTrespassesView image in fullscreenBrilliantly evocative … Tom Cullen and Lola Petticrew in Trespasses.Photograph: Steffan Hill/Channel 4Rising star Lola Petticrew was Bafta nominated for last year’s IRA drama Say Nothing.

What do I get out of it?” an exasperated Francis Ford Coppola asks Shia LaBeouf on the set ofMegalopolis. “I don’t get money. I don’t get fame; I already have fame. I don’t get Oscars, I already have Oscars. What do I get that I want?” LaBeouf eventually gives up. “Fun!” Coppola says. “I wanna have fun!”MakingMegalopolisdoesn’t look like most people’s idea of fun as Coppola attempts to corral actors, crew, costumes, locations, lavish sets and special effects all in service of a sprawling sci-fi-meets-ancient-Rome story that no one fully understands. Throw in the fact that the film-maker spent $120m of his own money on the passion project by selling off part of his winemaking business to raise funds, having spent nearly 50 years trying to get it made, and that the production was beset with delays, technical headaches and bust-ups, and you feel this is more than most 83-year-olds should have to go through.But watching Coppola making Megalopolis oftenisrather fun – perhaps more fun than the end product, to be honest. Just as the documentaryHearts of Darknesscaptured the chaos and strife behind the making of Coppola’s legendary Apocalypse Now back in 1976, so Mike Figgis’s new film Megadoc takes us on to the set of Coppola’s latest, grandest adventure. If we don’t quite get heart attacks and typhoons this time round, we do get as raw and intimate a portrait of an auteur at work as we’ve had for some time.That’s partly down to the nature of the project and the personalities behind it – but it is also a testament to Figgis’s skill as an intuitive, self-effacing, and observant film-maker. “I have a huge problem with the way documentaries are shot now; they’re shot like bad B-movies,” says Figgis, just before Megadoc’s premiere at the Venice film festival. “I know from my own experience that in order to get funding for a documentary, you have to kind of submit a script, which seems to me the antithesis of what a documentary should be; it should be a journey of discovery.”Figgis says he has known Coppola for decades. They first met in the 1990s, after he cast Nicolas Cage – Coppola’s nephew – in his hit movie Leaving Las Vegas. When he heard Coppola was about to start work on Megalopolis at last, Figgis wrote to congratulate him. “Almost as a little afterthought, a bit of a joke, I said: ‘If you need a fly on the wall, just let me know.’” A few months later, he recalls, Coppola called him out of the blue saying: “‘When could you be here? Do you have a visa? Can you come now?’ It’s a very Francis thing.”View image in fullscreen‘The process for him has always been one of experimentation’ … a view through the camera during the filming of Megalopolis.Photograph: Elliefilm Megadoc LLCDays later, in November 2022, with a small crew and his smallest camera, Figgis arrived in Atlanta where Coppola and his cast were just getting started on rehearsals. “When I first turned up, I wasn’t introduced, so nobody knew who I was.” As well as seeing Coppola at work, Figgis’s film is a window on to his actors, including Adam Driver, Aubrey Plaza, Jon Voight, Dustin Hoffman, Giancarlo Esposito and Laurence Fishburne. We get to see them in and out of role, interacting with Coppola, with each other and with Figgis. Driver keeps his distance, Plaza is mischievous and playful, but it’s LaBoeuf that Figgis zeroes in on as good material.Where most of the cast respect and trust Coppola and go along with his wishes and whims, LaBoeuf “was the one actor that really – very bravely, actually – challenged the process on many, many levels”, says Figgis. LaBoeuf, a notoriously volatile figure, persistently questions Coppola’s direction, his character’s backstory, his blocking, even his own performance (“some of these takes are just trash”). LaBoeuf also confesses he is terrified of getting fired, mindful that Coppola famously replaced Harvey Keitel with Martin Sheen a month into shooting Apocalypse Now. He survives, and there’s even affection between the two men, but by the end Coppola is so exasperated with him he throws up his hands and walks off the set, saying: “If you don’t need me tonight, I’m happy to go home.”As Figgis readily admits, “all the really good docs about film-making have been stories about disasters, so every time something negative happened I was thinking: ‘Oh, that’s good for the documentary.’”Fortunately for Figgis, if not for Coppola, there were more crises on the horizon. The production almost collapses halfway through when Coppola fires the visual effects supervisor, Mark Russell, and half the art department leave with him. At its heart, the split was perhaps a clash of two incompatible styles of film-making: the art department were accustomed to working on big, state-of-the-art effects movies, such as Marvel films, which require a lot of planning and collaboration (and money); Coppola’s preferred mode is more like experimental theatre, allowing for instinct and spontaneity. “That’s where the size of the film didn’t do him any favours,” says Figgis, “because the flexibility that he needs to go with that mindset isn’t supported by such a big production.”The net result was a lot of frustration and wasted time, all on Coppola’s dime. “Every day his regime was, he would get up early, make lots and lots of notes, and then he’d turn up and make everyone a bit crazy by going: ‘I’ve changed my mind. I don’t want to shoot that today actually. Can we get Adam Driver?’ ‘No, it’s his day off.’ ‘How long is it going to take to get him on the set?’ ‘Three hours.’ ‘OK. What should we do?’” Figgis recalls. “He’s in his 80s, so he’s basically just sitting there waiting, which for me was a joy, of course, because in those periods, he’s very happy to talk, have a moan or tell stories about Brando or whatever.”View image in fullscreen‘Every time something negative happened I thought: “Oh, that’s good for the documentary”’ … Coppola and Mike Figgis filming for Megadoc.Photograph: Elliefilm Megadoc LLCMeanwhile, throughout the shoot, Coppola was staying in an old Atlanta hotel that he had bought and decided to renovate – so he would go home every night to another, parallel project. “He invited me to live in the hotel,” says Figgis, “and someone said: ‘Mike, they start work at six in the morning. There’s dust everywhere. It’s so noisy, you won’t get any sleep.’ So I declined and got a hotel in Atlanta.”When Figgis suggests to Coppola that he seems to thrive on chaos, however, he immediately rebuts the notion. “He says: ‘I’m very good with chaos. I make order out of chaos.’ But he then dodges the question of: ‘Did you actually create the chaos in order to fix the chaos?’ But that’s not unusual for film-makers or artists in general, who kind of throw everything up in the air and see how it lands.”There was another troubled aspect of the shoot that Figgis’s film doesn’t address. When I spoke to former crew members who had worked on Megalopolis before its premiere at Cannes last year, several reportedconcerns about Coppola’s behaviour on set, not least a bacchanalian party scene during which witnesses say the director tried to kiss some of the topless and scantily clad female extras. The film’s executive producer Darren Demetre told the Guardian at the time that Coppola “walked around the set to establish the spirit of the scene by giving kind hugs and kisses on the cheek to the cast and background players. It was his way to help inspire and establish the club atmosphere.” Some extras recalled their experience of working on the film differently; one cast memberdescribed it to Varietyas “super weird and uncomfortable”.Figgis did not witness any inappropriate behaviour, he says. “My obsession was film-making and the process. There are hundreds of people [on set], and there’s adoring fans everywhere who want to take a selfie with Francis and all the rest of it. And he likes that. Outside the film-making thing, he’s a very warm and affectionate person. So I had no sense of what emerged later. And, you know, I was a little bit puzzled by it, I have to say.”Some critics praised Megalopolis, others were less enamoured (the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw found it“bloated, boring and bafflingly shallow”). Even Figgis admits he never fully understood the script: “It was like reading a Russian novel.” The movie has not been a commercial success: to date it has made $14m. But then Apocalypse Now was not hailed as a classic until long after its initial release. Perhaps Megalopolis will undergo a similar process of rehabilitation, with its themes of authoritarian control, political scheming and utopian idealism. If it does, Figgis’s film will doubtless be a part of that.View image in fullscreenA last, defiant moonshot … Adam Driver in Megalopolis.Photograph: 2024 Caesar Film LLCWhatever his views on the script, Figgis is full of admiration for Coppola as a film-maker. “The process for him has always been one of experimentation and actually, putting that into perspective, who else is doing that? Nobody. Whether you like the film or you don’t like the film, no one of that stature is doing it.” Others agree. In the documentary, George Lucas tells Figgis: “My whole career is based on watching Francis.” But he says they are complete opposites: “I’m a plodding along, careful what I’m doing, plan it out … and he’s a jump-off-the-cliff guy.”Watching Coppola contend with all the challenges and setbacks on set, making his way through a stressful four-month shoot, contending with the illness of his wife of 60 years, Eleanor (who died in April 2024), all while maintaining superhuman energy levels for an man in his 80s, it feels as if simply getting Megalopolis made, and walking the Cannes red carpet one last time, was success enough for Coppola. Perhaps it will come to be seen as the last, defiant moonshot from a larger-than-life film-maker who always cared more about art than money.Does Figgis think Coppola had fun? “Well, he didn’t look very happy a lot of the time,” he says. “But there were times I saw him chuckling and I thought: ‘Oh, he is sort of having fun now.’ Because he’s got a bunch of actors around him, they’re all kind of vibing with each other, it’s raining, and there’s, like, this chaos to be dealt with. He would have had more fun had everybody been more prepared for what he actually wanted, except he didn’t quite know what he wanted at the outset. But ultimately, I think he’s glad he made the film, because it was something that was sitting there on his back burner, and he wanted to get through it and articulate those ideas.” He laughs. “But I think we all have a different idea of fun.”Megadoc screened at the Venice film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmMegalopolisFrancis Ford  CoppolaMike FiggisDocumentary filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Instead, it’s a poignant watch in which love shines throughLucy ManganFri 29 Aug 2025 11.37 EDTLast modified on Fri 29 Aug 2025 14.39 EDTShareOn paper, it looks dreadful. A Diane Sawyer interview with the second wife of a beloved actor who has a life-changing disease, timed to coincide with the launch of said wife’s book about her experiences as a carer. Pass the bucket, give me strength and have some dignity are just some of the instinctive responses.So it is with trepidation verging on dread that one approaches Emma and Bruce Willis: The Unexpected Journey – A Diane Sawyer Special. But, much like the other recent potential schmaltzfestMy Mom Jayne(Mariska Hargitay’s film about her mother, Jayne Mansfield, who died in a car crash when Hargitay was three), it turns out unexpectedly well. Yes, Sawyer does not help. She is the doyenne of the sympathetic/emetic head tilt and master of the pained expression. Her furrowed brow invites us to imagine she is being forced at gunpoint to ask the intimate questions her producers and the lowest common denominator demand, and her self-penned scripts are inexcusable. “His quiet dream girl shared his working-class values though they were from wildly different backgrounds,” she intones softly over photos and footage of the film star and his soon-to-be fiancee, Emma Heming, from their early days together, “before the joyful ride began”. Alas: “No one in life knows when there is a shadow about to creep in.”The shadow here, of course, is Willis’s diagnoses in the last few years, first with aphasia – after which he announced his retirement from acting – and then with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), a rare form of dementia, for which life expectancy is generally five to eight years.The 40-minute programme (once ads are stripped out) contains highlight reels of Willis’s career, reminding us of his bullish charm as a 29-year-old star on the rise in Moonlighting, his astonishing charisma as the action hero of the Die Hard franchise, and of his finer-grained work in the likes of The Sixth Sense and Pulp Fiction. There are also clips of his forays into music, lots of lovely video footage and photographs of him as a clearly devoted family man (his divorce from Demi Moore and relations between the first and second iterations of the clan have been amicable).We get glimpses of the lives of others with FTD and their carers, as well as contributions about the nature of the disease from Dr Bruce Miller, an expert in the field (who does not treat Willis, so there can be no breaching of confidentiality).But at its heart is the interview with Emma Heming-Willis, who comes across as a poised, thoughtful, articulate woman struggling under an enormous burden of grief and responsibility. She talks carefully but honestly about Willis’s health and says she first noticed something was wrong when her hitherto endlessly warm and affectionate husband started to withdraw from her and the children and become indifferent to people. FTD, explains Miller, attacks the parts of the brain responsible for empathy and language first, and removes the patient’s awareness of their deterioration.Heming-Willis talks with striking bleakness about how hard it is to remember the fun they used to have and how it is less distressing to focus on the status quo than to look back. “The sadness, grief, resentment is a common thread we all share,” she says of her fellow carers. She urges people to consider that, if it is hard for her with all the support and resources at her disposal, how much harder it must be for those who have to manage virtually alone.Nevertheless, and though it sounds almost Sawyeresquely trite, the love shines through. From Willis himself in the photos and the family videos, from Heming-Willis as she speaks about him, from the anecdotes and memories of meeting Moore and the three children from that marriage, and the photos of all the girls with their dad at various times – including recent ones from his new home, a bungalow in which he lives with round-the-clock care. Although, says Heming-Willis, he is mobile and physically healthy, his language has virtually gone and because of the damage FTD wreaks on the parts of the brain that identify and recognise risk, patients are no longer safe alone.It is a heartbreaking story, repeated in families around the world. The number of people with dementia – in its various forms, united by their remorseless cruelty – is set to triple by 2050. “It is,” says Miller, “the disease of our age”. That Heming-Willis is using her resources to look outwards, raise awareness and ameliorate such hardship as she can is a measure of the woman – and perhaps, too, of the man who loved her so.Emma and Bruce Willis: The Unexpected Journey is on Disney+Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewBruce WillisDocumentaryFactual TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

Can he get past the security guard at the Roundhouse, where he once walked a tipsy Tennessee Williams to his car?ByRyan GilbeyFri 29 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 29 Aug 2025 05.23 EDTShareIt is a weekday morning and I am standing besidePierce Brosnanon a deserted backstreet, watching a woman in a hairnet and white wellies hosing down the entrance to a fishmarket. The former James Bond is in full flow. “You know the scene inMobLandwhere I’ve got my foot on that guy’s throat and Tom Hardy is shooting the shit out of everyone?” He is talking in his rich, buttery burr about the recent series in which he and Helen Mirren play the heads of an Irish crime family. “We shot thatrighthere!” He waves at the woman, who silences her hose temporarily. “Hi, hello,” he calls out. “I shot a television show here called MobLand.” She smiles back at him. “Yes,” she replies sweetly, as though indulging a confused uncle. “No idea, has she?” he chuckles. The hose springs back to life with a hiss.Brosnan, 72, was raised in Navan, County Meath but is now generally to be found at one of his homes in Hawaii or Malibu, and is in London for the release ofThe Thursday Murder Club, the film adaptation of Richard Osman’s cosy crime bestseller. Brosnan teams up with Mirren, Ben Kingsley and Celia Imrie as retirement-home sleuths whose weekly divertissement solving historical cold cases turns serious when fresh corpses start popping up. Today, he has agreed to a one-off meeting of the Wednesday Nostalgia Club, strolling around the area of north London where he cut his teeth and earned his stripes. “Down the lane of memory,” he says cheerily.View image in fullscreenAt the fishmonger’s where Brosnan shot a fight scene in the gangster series MobLand.Photograph: Jamie Salmons/The GuardianOur first port of call isCamden Arts Projects, the Grade II-listed former Methodist church that was once the site of Drama Centre London. It is now an exhibiton and screening space , but inside Brosnan finds the same stage where he auditioned successfully more than half a century ago. He strides on to it and gazes around the vast white hall, peering up at the empty balconies as though picturing the ghosts of audiences past. “Coming here was the making of me,” he says.His snowy hair is swept back, and he looks slick and tanned. In 1973, the year of his audition, he cut a very different figure: shoulder-length locks, goatee, earring. When he arrived at theDrama Centre, he already had several years’ experience of experimental theatre at the Ovalhouse theatre, now Brixton House, in Kennington. That spell on the fringes informed his performance in The Thursday Murder Club as “Red” Ron, a former trade unionist. “I recognised Ron because of my days in street theatre and agitprop. Theatre companies performing outside the Ford factory, all that stuff.”What he lacked was formal training. He auditioned first for Webber Douglas, another drama school. “I was so nervous, I fell off the stage. When I got to the Drama Centre, I thought: ‘Pay attention, Brosnan.’” Armed with a soliloquy from Macbeth, he impressed the centre’s co-founder, Christopher Fettes, who became his teacher and mentor. Fettes, who died last year at 94, once said it was “shocking” that Brosnan left the stage behind for cinema. Then again, he also considered James Bond to be “a bit below” Brosnan’s talents.View image in fullscreen‘Broody Brosnan’ … Circa 1978, shortly after Tennessee Williams boosted him from understudy to a role  in The Red Devil Battery Sign at the Roundhouse.Photograph: Jeremy Fletcher/RedfernsThe actor concedes the first point. “Christopher wanted me doing obscure 19th-century plays, but my dream was always movies.” Daniel Craig, Brosnan’s immediate successor as 007, made a point of returning to theatre. “I was impressed that Daniel had the bottle to go back out there. I thought, ‘Why the heck didn’t I?’ You have to really want it, and I didn’t.”Was Fettes right about Bond being beneath him? “It’s very kind of Christopher. But thank God for Bond. It’s given me longevity. It’s given me the world in many respects.” As if to prove his point, he steps outside into the morning light and dons his spiffy Jacques Marie Mage sunglasses. “I didn’t pay for these. They were free. My son said: ‘Oh my God, Dad. Theystartat 700 bucks.’”On opening night, he sent me a telegram: ‘Thank God for you, my dear boy. Love, Tennessee WilliamsBrosnan played Bond four times, beginning withthe impressive GoldenEye in 1995and ending seven years later withthe risible Die Another Day. He had a unique challenge: his incarnation was the first to be asked to reckon with the chauvinistic sins of Bonds gone by. He had to uphold the character’s heroism in between occasional bites of humble pie.Bond had figured in Brosnan’s life here and there before he got to play him. There was a cinema trip with his stepfather to see Goldfinger at the ABC Putney in September 1964. The previous month, 11-year-old Brosnan was reunited with his mother after living with relatives in Ireland while she completed her nursing training inLondon. “I later discovered that Ian Fleming died in August, the same month I got here.” He raises both eyebrows in a manner that wouldn’t have disgraced Roger Moore. When Moore vacated the role in the late 1980s, it was Brosnan’s for the taking. Except the network behind his US television hit Remington Steele, in which he was charming as a conman turned detective, refused to release him from his contract. His loss was Timothy Dalton’s gain, at least for a few years.Our next stop is the Roundhouse, the live music venue and former theatre where Brosnan starred in the British premiere of Tennessee Williams’ The Red Devil Battery Sign in June 1977. The playwright personally promoted Brosnan, originally an understudy, to the main cast. “On opening night, he sent me a telegram: ‘Thank God for you, my dear boy. Love, Tennessee Williams.’” It must have made up for having his name misspelt on the posters as “Pierce Brosman”, I suggest. He responds with a rueful laugh.View image in fullscreenTime out in Camden en route to the Roundhouse.Photograph: Jamie Salmons/The GuardianThe security guard at the Roundhouse looks unfazed when I tell him who I have with me, but permits us to nose around anyway. “I remember finishing the show one night and bumping into Tennessee,” says Brosnan as we loiter in the foyer. “He couldn’t find his way out of the theatre, so he held my arm and I walked him to his driver.” Williams died six years later at 71. “Well, he liked a tipple. You would go to his house at night and everyone would be at his feet while he regaled us with these lyrical stories.” A pause. “None of which I can recall because I was tippling, too.”The Red Devil Battery Sign opened exactly a week after the release of the Sex Pistols’ God Save the Queen. “Punk wasn’t my bailiwick,” he says. “Pink Floyd were part of my landscape of learning and transformation. I was a hippy.” Around his neck is a string of beads which may or may not be the ones given to him by a monk 15 years ago during a nasty bit of turbulence on a private plane.To finish our conversation, we head to a pavement cafe in nearby Primrose Hill, where Brosnan admires the dogs trotting by. This prompts a brief reverie on his favourite Instagram video. “It’s a guy who dresses his dog in a hoodie and then puts his own hands through the sleeves, so it looks like the dog has hands.” He sips his latte. “It’s really quite brilliant.”View image in fullscreenA scene from The Thursday Murder Club, from left: Celia Imrie, Helen Mirren, Naomi Ackie, Pierce Brosnan and Ben Kingsley.Photograph: APWe get back to the topic of The Thursday Murder Club. Brosnan still isn’t sure why Chris Columbus, who directed him in Mrs Doubtfire and Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief, thought of him for Ron. “Chris just said: ‘Grow a beard.’ So I did.”Columbus isn’t the only blast from Brosnan’s past in the new movie. Decades before MobLand, he and Mirren appeared inThe Long Good Friday, though they didn’t share any scenes. Whereas Brosnan and Paul Freeman, who stars in The Thursday Murder Club as a vet whose wife is dying, have got “previous” – as the East End hoods of that 1980 thriller would put it. “It was my first film,” Brosnan sighs. “I wasn’t given a script. My agent said: ‘Get down to Lewisham bath and take your trunks.’ And there was Paul.” The Thursday Murder Club brings them together for the first time since Brosnan had the temerity to stab Freeman to death in the swimming baths. It also puts Brosnan back in his trunks again for a water aerobics workout to Disco Inferno. “Some people think I give one of my best performances in The Long Good Friday,” he muses. Because he doesn’t have any lines? “Exactly! Don’t give me any lines. Just tell me: look camera left, look camera right.” And brood. “Yes. That’s me. Broody Brosnan.”View image in fullscreenBrosnan in full flight as James Bond in Die Another Day, 2002.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyPossibly Brosnan’s smartest moves during his Bond tenure were to make canny choicesbetween007 films. He had his head detached from his body in Mars Attacks! and kissed Sarah Jessica Parker, who had had hers attached to a chihuahua. Then he flashed his bum and got doused in champagne by Rene Russo in the smart, snazzy remake of The Thomas Crown Affair, and was gleefully untrustworthy as a crooked MI6 agent in The Tailor of Panama. (The late Observer film critic Philip Frenchconsidered Brosnan“better at coarse, sleazy charm than suave sophistication”.) This meant he had less baggage to shake off after Die Another Day. The world already knew he was more than just a walking tuxedo. Very clever, Mr Bond.In fact, it’s one of Brosnan’s tips for whoever plays the role next. “It’s essential to be creative outside of Bond,” he says. Any other advice? “Get a good lawyer.”His eclecticism has continued, whether it means painting his toenails as a gone-to-seed hitman in The Matador, belting his lungs out in Mamma Mia! or returning to the intelligence agencies, as boss rather than foot-soldier in Steven Soderbergh’s witty thriller Black Bag, in which he barked at Michael Fassbender and sparked with Cate Blanchett.View image in fullscreenLast stop of the day at a cafe in Primrose Hill.Photograph: Jamie Salmons/The GuardianTalking of which, wasn’t Blanchett astonishing, he says, in the recent production of The Seagull at the Barbican? “I was bedazzled! The friend I was with said, ‘You’ve got to go round and congratulate her. She’ll know you’re in.’ So we joined the queue. Barricades, the lot. The guy on the door said: ‘Are you on the list?’ My friend said: ‘This is Pierce Brosnan!’ There were tourists snapping away, taking my picture. ‘Sorry, mate. Not on the list. Can’t come in.’ My friend was getting indignant. I said: ‘Walk away.’ I sent Cate a note instead. She was mortified.”Security guards and fishmongers alike may not recognise him. But once Brosnan has been whisked off to his next appointment, a family of American tourists call out to me as I’m paying the bill: “Was thatPierce Brosnan? Wow!” Proof that his star hasn’t dimmed.

Now a rising star, he talks about growing up, embracing discomfort and forging his own pathFri 29 Aug 2025 08.00 EDTShareWhen Cooper Hoffman was in his teens, he didn’t have any grand plans for the future, though there was one thing he knew for sure: he did not want to be an actor. Why? “I didn’t want to do it because my dad did it so well, and it felt like I’d be going up against him. It would feel like I was inherently stepping into something competitive.”Given Hoffman’s father isPhilip Seymour Hoffman, Oscar-winning star of Boogie Nights, Almost Famous, The Master and Capote, you can see why he would feel that way. But then Paul Thomas Anderson, the Boogie Nights director who is a friend of the family, and whose children Cooper played with when he was growing up, asked him if he would read for a part. It was the lead in the 2021 film Licorice Pizza, about a teenage boy smitten with a woman in her mid-20s. It would not just be his first starring role, but his first role in anything. Hoffman ended up taking the job and was nominated for a Golden Globe for his efforts. In the years since, he says, he’s come to realise he’s not in competition with his dad at all. “I’m just doing the same thing he did, but in my own way.”Talking via video call from his publicist’s offices in Los Angeles, Hoffman – who is now 22 – is articulate, self-possessed and subtly cautious with his answers; he keeps them brief and is not afraid of silence. This feels understandable, given the interest not just in him but in his father, who died from a drug overdose in 2014. Dressed in a pale blue sweater, with his sweep of strawberry blond hair arranged just so, Hoffman already has what you might call a Hollywood sheen. Since his screen debut four years ago, he has evolved from apple-cheeked youngster, at once goofy and charming, to serious adult actor with an enviable CV. Yet, much like his dad, there’s a softness and vulnerability to his features that is far removed from the average chisel-jawed screen hero.View image in fullscreenBig strides … Cooper Hoffman and David Jonsson in The Long Walk.Photograph: Murray Close/LionsgateHe is here to talk about The Long Walk, the film based on the first novel written by Stephen King in the late 60s, when he was 19. Initially rejected by publishers, the book didn’t see the light of day until 1979, by which time King was a bestselling author. Set in a dystopian America, the novel tells of a brutal walking contest undertaken by a group of teenage boys who must maintain a speed of 4mph (3mph in the film). Those who slow down or stop get three warnings; then, if they don’t resume the required pace, they are shot dead. The winner is the last boy alive, who is granted a single wish and a life-changing cash prize.The adaptation, directed by the Hunger Games’ Francis Lawrence, follows the progress of the entire group, though the drama centres in particular on Hoffman as teenager Ray Garraty, who has entered the competition despite the pleas of his mother, and fellow frontrunner Peter McVries, played by David Jonsson. The pair swap stories, share confidences and develop a sweet fraternal bond. Save for the odd flashback, the entire film plays out on the road, as the walkers deal with debilitating cramp, bleeding feet and exhaustion, all while watching their peers get ruthlessly picked off. Hoffman says he is loth to complain about the filming schedule, which occurred in sequence and required him and his co-stars to walk several miles per day while wearing less than ideal footwear.I want to do things that feel difficult. I get overambitious and want to do a trial by fire“Yeah, my boots couldn’t hack it,” he smiles. “I mean, it was hard but we were just making a movie, you know? We’re not solving cancer. But it was incredibly uncomfortable. You’re wearing a lot of clothes in hot weather and walking for hours so your feet hurt at the end of the day.”With most of the cast members in their teens or early 20s, there was a camaraderie on set that Hoffman notes was “in no way competitive. You showed up to the table reading, and you showed up to the first day of walking, and you looked around and you’re like: ‘Everyone’s really doing this. I’ve got to show up for them.’”Hoffman and Jonsson’s characters do what they can to boost morale and offer a helping hand. But there is a darkness to Hoffman’s Garraty, whose participation in the walk is connected to his grief at the premature death of his dad. That can’t have been a stretch, I say, given his own experience. “Yes, of course,” Hoffman replies, his lack of hesitation suggesting he’s anticipated this line of questioning. “It’s hard not to think about it when it’s on the page, when it’s right there in front of you. But as an actor, you have to look at it truthfully. And to attach all of my burden on to this character would be wrong, because my situation is different to his. Yes, we share a commonality, but it happened in very different ways.”View image in fullscreenCourt in the act … Cooper Hoffman with his father, Philip Seymour Hoffman, at a basketball game in New York in 2013.Photograph: James Devaney/FilmMagicHoffman was just 10 years old when his father died. To watch his dad on screen now, he says, “is great. He’s a great actor, but the characters he plays aren’t him.” To lose a parent so young, he says, “is a hard thing to go through”. He pauses. “What I will say is that my favourite movie of his is The Master, and I watch that quite frequently. I very much enjoy seeing his face in that movie.”Though Hoffman caught the acting bug comparatively late, he and his younger sisters, Tallulah and Willa, grew up in New York immersed in the worlds of film and theatre. His mother is Mimi O’Donnell, a former costume designer who now works in podcasting. She and Seymour Hoffman met when he was directing a stage production of In Arabia We’d All Be Kings. O’Donnell wrote about her late husband and their family life forVogue in 2017, and recalled his request that the family never be apart for more than two weeks at a time, even when he was filming. “More than once,” she wrote, remembering the period after Cooper was born, “I found myself asking, ‘You want to bring the baby to what?’ Or, ‘You want us to come to Winnipeg in the winter while you’re shooting?” And he’d say, ‘Just bring him. We all need to be together.’”Hoffman smiles. “Yeah, that was our version of ‘bring your son or daughter to work day’,” though he adds that he was so little he has few memories of those visits. He can just about recall going to the Oscars with his father and hating the afterparty. “To be fair, again, I don’t remember a lot of it. I don’t think I liked the Oscars [ceremony] either, just because of how young I was and I had to sit still for a long time and wear a suit that I didn’t want to wear. But I don’t feel that way now.”View image in fullscreenSlice of luck … Cooper Hoffman in the 2021 film Licorice Pizza.Photograph: Melinda Sue Gordon/MGM PicturesBefore acting took over, Hoffman had a handful of jobs that included being a general dogsbody at a bar in New York near the family home. “I would come in every day before the bar would open and set up, because I wasn’t actually allowed to be there when they were serving alcohol.” During the actors’ strike two years ago, he briefly got a job in construction, which he was surprised to find he enjoyed, and where he “made a lot of friends”.He was 17 when he was cast in Licorice Pizza, in which he played teenage actor turned entrepreneur Gary Valentine, who falls for a photographer’s assistant (played by musician and fellow screen newbie Alana Haim). TheNew Yorkerhailed Haim and Hoffman’s “high-intensity yet gracefully poised performances”, while theGuardian’s Peter Bradshawcalled Hoffman “eerily assured”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Even though being on set felt “more natural than I expected it to be”, the experience was “like boot camp. You’re getting told what a mark is. You’re getting told where to look, about eyelines and how to walk and what kind of little tricks [camera technicians] use to make something work. You’re in this wonderland of film, being in a Paul Thomas Anderson movie, and it’s something that I realise is an immense privilege.” While he tried not to think too hard about how his performance was being received, there were times when “I was just freaking out. I threw up one day on set because of how nervous I was. There was an inherent fear of messing up and being looked at.”He still gets nervous when auditioning, likening it to getting ready for a date. “You shower, you make sure you smell nice and look nice, you want to come in and be your charismatic self, and then you want to wow them with your acting. And then the audition ends and you’re like: ‘Well, I hope they like me as much as I like them.’” After Licorice Pizza, Hoffman enrolled at an acting school in New York, largely because “everyone was telling me to go to”, but ended up leaving halfway through. “I found I just didn’t want to be in school. I wanted to go act.”Luckily, since Licorice Pizza, the jobs have kept coming. He was NBC executive Dick Ebersol in last year’s Saturday Night, which told the origin story of Saturday Night Live, and played a rookie hitman alongside Christoph Waltz in Old Guy. At the start of this year, he made his off-Broadway stage debut in Sam Shepard’s Curse of the Starving Class, about a family down on their luck. After years spent watching plays and musicals, he had long thought theatre was “a brave thing to do. And I was like: ‘I want to be that brave and earn my stripes.’” Once again, he was thrown in the deep end; the play featured a live sheep on stage. “And I had to get naked and walk across the stage and kill it,” he says, with an amused sigh.Hoffman has noticed a pattern in himself where, he says, “I get overambitious a lot of the time and want to do a trial by fire. I didn’t train, so I needed to learn on the job. I kept finding myself wanting to do things that felt difficult. [With the play] it would sometimes feel incredible and sometimes it would feel like the worst thing ever.”A similar thing happened with the upcoming film I Want Your Sex, an erotic thriller where he stars alongside Olivia Wilde and Charli xcx. He plays Elliot, a young man who takes a job as a sexual muse to a renowned artist, played by Wilde. “She plays my dominatrix,” he says, with a look that suggests he was several miles outside his comfort zone. Did he surprise himself? “Yes, I did. I’m pretty proud of myself on that one. It’s one of those things where you’re so uncomfortable in a scene, but the character has to be enjoying it. It’s so hard to get yourself to a place of enjoyment when there’s a lot of people in the room seeing something vulnerable happen. But I feel like I did get there.”Asked if he thinks he is a born actor, and whether acting talent can be inherited, Hoffman pauses and shakes his head. “I think that puts too much of a lock on what an actor can or cannot be. Just because you’re born into something doesn’t mean you have it, and just because you’re not doesn’t mean you don’t.” On the inevitable comparisons with his father, he says: “My mom gave me the best acting advice I’ve been given, which was: ‘You’re enough.’ She said: ‘The reason why people will watch you, the reason people will care about you, is because of you and the life that you’ve lived.’ And you know, I think that’s true.”The Long Walk is in cinemas on 12 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmPhilip Seymour HoffmaninterviewsShareReuse this content"

The two tell us how they have enriched each other’s musical worldsFri 29 Aug 2025 06.52 EDTLast modified on Fri 29 Aug 2025 10.18 EDTShare‘When I was growing up, I couldn’t listen to any bands or artists in my language,” says Katarina Barruk. She is one of only a handful of remaining speakers – and the only one of whom is an internationally celebrated singer – of Ume Sámi, one of the nine living Sámi languages that today is on Unesco’s critically endangered list. It’s spoken by a handful of Sámi communities living across the part of Sápmi (the territory of the Sámi peoples across northern Scandinavia) that’s now in north-east Sweden. “We have been working so hard to get to the point where you can hear the language at the Royal Albert Hall,” says Barruk. “It’s amazing.”And not only to hear the language, but experience it sung by Barruk in her own music, recomposed and remade with theNorwegian Chamber Orchestra. They’ll be led by the violinist and conductor Pekka Kuusisto,in a Promthat will take the audience on a journey “into my universe”, she says, “so that people can understand that this language is alive”. The Prom is a symbol of hope and defiance for Ume Sámi and its speakers, and for the Indigenous peoples of Sápmi as a whole, she tells me. “I want to give something hopeful to my own people.”My whole family is coming to the Prom. My brother, even, who’s a reindeer herder and can never usually travelKatarina BarrukIt’s also a big moment in her own life. “The whole of my family is coming. My brother, even. He’s a reindeer herder and he never has time for travelling, but the end of August is the only time of year he can leave. It’s really huge to hear the Ume Sámi language in one of the world’s biggest concert halls.”But for Barruk, the significance of the Prom isn’t only about representing her language: it’s about creating a new chapter of cultural survival for her people. Her songs, all in Ume Sámi, are based on joiking traditions, the traditional vocal art of the Sámis, and mix the joik’s skirls of high-register cries with melodies of depth and soulfulness.View image in fullscreenKatarina Barruk: ‘It’s huge to hear the Ume Sàámi language in one of the world’s biggest concert halls.’Photograph: https://www.katarinabarruk.com/Her second album,Ruhttuo, released in 2022, was a fusion of a contemporary soundworld with timeless traditions. That’s the basis of the Proms collaboration, too: “I’m not only doing traditional joik in the concerts. My vocal practice is really affected by my personal exploration of how I can play my instrument – my voice. When I was growing up, all the vocal sounds I made were always supposed to mean something: a place, a person, a mountain, an expressive state. So I was always emotionally exhausted after the concerts. But now I can sometimes make sounds for the sake of making interesting sounds, and then it becomes even more fun.”But at theProms, she will be singing songs “about dreams, about time, about being in the present tense. And there is one traditional joik, Miärralándda (Coastal Lands). There is also a piece about my great-grandmother, whose sister was one of the people who took the initiative to have the first Sámi gathering. I have strong foremothers in my family who have always been fighting for Sámi rights.”Barruk’s music is a parable of Sámi culture’s place in the world now. “My music is always affected by western music. You are always part of that society. The question is how much do you assimilate to fit in, as an Indigenous person? How much can you work to help each other and use the new ways that are available to lift up our voices?”Exclusive: watch a clip of Katarina Barruk and the Norwegian Chamber orchestra’s collaborationThat means recognising the fragility and threats to Sámi people, and to Ume Sámi speakers in particular. Neither Finland nor Sweden has ratified the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention of 1989. Norway has, but Barruk says that it has continued to violate the rights of Sámi people. And across Sápmi, she says, “they are getting rid of the Indigenous people” to make way for mining in the boreal forest. Reindeer herders and Sámi people have had to move to make way for mining, and the environmental desecration that brings – and for wind farms, too. “When you are ‘green transitioning’, you are often getting rid of the Indigenous people,” she says.These are issues of survival and self-determination that are burned into the inspiration behind Katarina’s compositions and performance. “When I started making music, I always thought about my community, my people, my culture. I love them so highly and I know what kind of dark times we are living in, and how we are fighting on a daily basis.”View image in fullscreenPekka Kuusisto (centre) and the Norwegian Chamber Orchestra performDSCH, an all-Shostakovich programmeat the Queen Elizabeth Hall in June 2024.Photograph: Pete WoodheadSo what can the musicians of the Norwegian Chamber Orchestra, who first collaborated with Barruk in Oslo in 2023, add to her searing music? “It’s amazing to hear the music you’ve written played by so many human beings, and how that changes the dynamic,” she says. The piece that comes after the song about her great-grandmother, Barruk says, “feels like it’s playing in her honour”. That music, Kuusisto tells me, is Max Reger’s version of Bach’s chorale setting O Mensch, Bewein Dein Sünde Groß, music that’s an exorcism of humanity’s sin and pain.Barruk, her band and Kuusisto share the stage with the orchestra in the first half of the concert, alternating her songs with classical and contemporary pieces from Caroline Shaw to Michael Tippett to Philip Glass, which Kuusisto has chosen for their tradition-transcending resonances. He says his choice of music is an exploration of how “composers respectfully re-read ancient knowledge and earlier traditions”: the way that Tippett reimagines Purcell in Sellinger’s Round, and how Shaw puts Ravel and Mozart in suspended musical animation in Plan and Elevation, analogies of how Barruk rethinks the ancient traditions of Sámi music. “Every generation has to reinterpret concepts that previous generations have taken for granted,” he says, “including things such as religion and nationalism, which play a big part in the treatment of Indigenous people worldwide – plus, are more often than not the driving forces behind war.”When Katarina sings, it’s an act of preserving a culture. It’s incredible to witness music-making in which the motivation is so different from what we’re used toPekka KuusistoThere are stories of oppression in Kuusisto’s setlist, too. Kuusisto will play Hannah Kendall’s Weroon Weroon, written for him in 2022, in which “you basically put the violin under arrest”, he says. In her programme note for the piece, Kendall explains that “the strings of the violin are bound together with three aluminium dreadlock cuffs; afro hair accessories that distort the sound so that pitch production becomes unstable and unpredictable. A new creolised instrument is formed as a result.” The violin is denatured, forced into sonic contortions: a musical mirror of colonial oppression.View image in fullscreen‘Every generation has to reinterpret concepts that previous ones have taken for granted’ … Pekka Kuusisto, with musicians from the Norwegian Chamber Orchestra.Photograph: Ⓒ Bård GundersenThe second half, for the orchestra alone, ends with the darkness of Shostakovich’s eighth quartet, a scream of the individual against Soviet tyranny.Kuusisto says that working with Barruk has changed him and the orchestra. It’s all too easy for the culture of orchestral playing to become complacent, a job rather than a vocation, he says. But “when Katarina sings, it’s an act of preserving a culture. It’s an incredible thing to witness music-making in which the motivation is so radically different from what we’re used to. In fact, I would venture that we are not even so used to thinking about what the motivation is in our work in classical music at all. Which is why Katarina is vitally important for us, to make us think about what we are doing, and why we are doing it. It’s one of those experiences where we collectively feel we are standing on more solid ground.”For Barruk, “it’s huge and impactful and powerful that the Ume Sámi language has survived against all odds”, she says. “It’s alive even when it is not supposed to be, if the programmes to eradicate it had worked in earlier centuries. And that brings another level to my music, because I am able to sing in an Indigenous language. There is such a resilience within our people.”For one night this summer, Barruk and Kuusisto’s Prom will turn the Royal Albert Hall into an outpost of Ume Sámi and the people of Sápmi: their traditions, their hopes, and their defiant and urgent cultural future.Katarina Barruk, Pekka Kuusisto and the Norwegian Chamber Orchestra areat the Proms on 31 Augustand live on Radio 3, and then on BBC Sounds until 12 October.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicProms 2025PromsFolk musicinterviewsShareReuse this content"

As a new generation carry its spirit forward, the originators remember the beats and beddingJoe MuggsFri 29 Aug 2025 03.01 EDTLast modified on Fri 29 Aug 2025 03.42 EDTShare‘Iremember looking up over the DJ booth in this huge squat,” says Mario Aguero, “and seeing a sea of mattresses with people lying on them, like some kind of Guinness record attempt. Which was great until someone stood up to go to the bathroom. Then they’d be lurching everywhere.”This was the scene at Telepathic Fish in early 90s London, and co-promoter Kevin Foakes winces as he picks up the memory. “We’d dragged quite a few of the mattresses off the street.” The influential music journalistDavid Toophad come along, “and his report said the first mistake he made was to sit down on a wet mattress”.Waterlogged bedding for unwary horizontal punters doesn’t seem to suggest a key moment in British music history. But Telepathic Fish’s parties became a hub for an entirely new zone of club culture: chillout.The word now evokes anonymous music for health spas, interchangeable Ibiza Poolside Chill or Relaxing Piano type playlists, or perhaps pranged-out ravers yammering in a decidedly un-zen superclub “chillout room”. But a new Telepathic Fish compilation,Trawling the Early 90s Ambient Underground, shows how adventurous chillout music originally was, and a wave of new events from London to Berlin and New York – some complete with duvets and pillows – are keeping Telepathic Fish’s spirit and soft furnishing choices alive.View image in fullscreen‘We didn’t have neighbours, so we thought we’d throw a party’ … Mario Aguero, Mixmaster Morris & Aphex Twin in the flat above the shop, 1993.Photograph: Kevin FoakesBack in 1992 Foakes was at Camberwell College of Arts with his friend David Vallade, while Aguero had come down from the Madchester-era north and was working at a computer graphics company. They were all into the crustier end of rave, such as London institution Club Dog and squat raves by Tribal Energy and Digidub, and were living together in a three-storey house above a shop “with no neighbours, so we thought we’d throw a party,” Vallade says.By their second event, they had a name, Telepathic Fish, and more than 300 guests paying £1 to get in (they each also got a hand-cut holographic foil fish lanyard). Their near neighbour and DJ, Mixmaster Morris, played a chillout room upstairs, stacked with old TVs, and the night was a huge hit. “That was our favourite part by a long way,” says Aguero. “It was social, fun, weird, and the music could go absolutely anywhere.”View image in fullscreen‘She plugged us in to something bigger’ … the new flatmate Chantal Passamonte, who later became Mira Calix.Photograph: Kevin FoakesBy their next party, in mid 1993, they had a new flatmate, Chantal Passamonte – later the acclaimed producer and sound artistMira Calix. After arriving from South Africa, she’d thrown herself into London’s music networks, working in record shops and interning at the label 4AD. “That is when things really kicked up several gears,” says Foakes. “We were just three lads doing a party, but she instantly plugged us into something much bigger.”They graduated to a vast squatted former dole office in Brixton, and Telepathic Fish became an entirely horizontal event. “We jettisoned the dancefloor!” says Aguero. But they realised they needed something for people to look at if they weren’t dancing, so they booked Matt Black from Coldcut to be a video jockey. “We only had a vague idea what that was, and it turned out he’d never done it in public before,” Foakes says. “So it was a trial by fire, but he did it, and every party after that.”The futurism of Black and Aguero’s graphics met low-tech stencilling, camouflage netting and those sometimes moist mattresses, all glowing under UV light for a deeply stoned crowd. Foakes says, “The best record buying advice I ever got was Morris telling me: if you see an old record with hippies and synthesisers on the cover, get it!”, and the room was duly filled with dreamy Detroit techno, proto-trip-hop and space-dub woven into film soundtracks, minimalist classical and Krautrock.View image in fullscreen‘We jettisoned the dancefloor!’… Matt Black, the video jockey for Telepathic Fish’s parties, pictured in 1993.Photograph: Kevin FoakesThe team cite Oscillate in Birmingham and Sonora in Glasgow (run byJD Twitch, later of Optimo) as peers, as well as the chillout areas in crusty clubs and free parties. The influence of the Orb and the KLF loomed large too; Alex Paterson and Jimmy Cauty were the DJs in the ambient room at Paul Oakenfold’s club night Land of Oz. But over a series of squat events and then guest spots at clubs and festivals – plus all four of the team working at the scene’s hub, record shop Ambient Soho – Telepathic Fish became a major focus for the era’s experimentalism.Aphex Twin played there, just as Warp Records was cementing him, Autechre and others as left-field superstars. The Ninja Tune label which Black had founded with Jonathan More – now, alongside Warp, the most important in UK electronic music – found its feet partly with Telepathic Fish as a testing ground, and Foakes became both Ninja Tune’s in-house designer, as well as releasing records under the name DJ Food. Aguero and Vallade would find success in video games and illustration respectively.View image in fullscreenScene hub Ambient Soho on Berwick Street in London, 1994.Photograph: Kevin FoakesThe events ended in 1995, and while chillout rooms cropped up across clubland, the concept of an entirely chillout nightclub dissipated. “It was always a cottage industry,” says Vallade: the odd squatter selling cans or cups of chai on a trestle table notwithstanding, it wasn’t really commercial in a way that could hold up against the professionalisation of club culture as the 90s wore on.Ambient electronica started getting ever artier and more experimental, and trip-hop replaced it as the de facto stoner soundtrack. Ibiza had its own parallel chillout tradition thanks to its famous sunset sets at Cafe del Mar (plus its mixtape/CD series), where DJ Jose Padilla would play Aphex Twin alongside Ennio Morricone and Astrud Gilberto, but gradually Balearic chilling became synonymous with pedestrian beats you might hear as hold music for a multinational bank.Thirty years on, though, the Telepathic Fish compilation emerges amid refreshed interest in cosmic sounds and laid-back events. DJ/producerMark Barrottflies the flag for the original Ibizan chillout spirit with blissful sets atHostal Del Torre, with names very much in the Telepathic Fish tradition such as Boards Of Canada and µ-Ziq next to Nina Simone and Mazzy Star. Elsewhere, inspired by home gatherings and after-hours sessions at London’s Brilliant Corners, with bedding included, Errol and Alex Rita ofTouching Bassstarted ambient-leaning listening event A Loose Ting: “Making music feel really nice in a small space, a little haven for a few hours away from the rest of the world and the madness in it right now,” Errol says.Speaking during sets is discouraged at A Loose Ting, just as it is at the private loft gatherings of New York’sPlanetarium, where the audience mainly reclines. Organiser Justin Carter notes with pride the gentle rustle of appreciation you can hear at intense moments on recordings of his sets. There are no light shows or stencil art, but it does hark back to the trippiness of 90s chillout. A big inspiration for Planetarium is the use of psychedelic drugs in therapy, Carter says, “This framework where you put on an eye mask and you go into this space and you’re encouraged to go deep.” Similarly, at Planetarium, “you’re sitting with music that is like a guide or a therapist. It’s a quiet experience.”View image in fullscreen‘Sensory rave spas full of fountains, harpists and vibrating mattresses’ … Aoife McGuinness, Jessie Dymond Barber and the team at Overflow in Berlin.Other events are directly inspired by the multimedia madness of 90s chillout. In Berlin, Aoife McGuinness and Jessie Dymond Barber set upOverflow, a studio hosting “sensory rave spas” full of fountains, harpists, vibrating mattresses and light installations, helping clubbers “nurture their bodies”, as Barber puts it. But Overflow is certainly not just for reverent sitting and listening, and has a sense of fun and mischief: “It’s not only very floaty, beautiful,” says McGuinness, “but brain tingly, sideways, weird stuff.”Work your erk’n’jerk! Inside the UK club nights for dancing, not social media posingRead moreBack in the UK, Wil Troup, founder of label and online magazinethe Ransom Note, fondly remembers original 90s chillout rooms at places such as Brixton’s Fridge; his younger colleague Tia Cousins discovered them more recently at theWorld Unknownparties run by acid house survivor Andy Blake. Troup and Cousins’ shared love of ambient sound blossomed into their remarkableMusic to Watch Seeds Grow Byrelease series, and also into the Watching Trees micro-festival they founded with Optimo. Here, experimental music and immersive visuals – such as dappled sunlight being projected at night – give “a different type of experience” to your average rave-up in a field, says Troup. “Like, why do we have this expectation that the dancefloor has to go all night? Here people disperse, they talk, it can be a beautiful social thing in its own right.” There’s no question the mission of Telepathic Fish is alive and well in a space like this – albeit with fewer soggy mattresses.Telepathic Fish – Trawling the Early 90s Ambient Underground is released on 5 September on Fundamental Frequencies.

All I wanted was to be a squirrel in the Mossflower Woods!The books that changed me as a teenagerI read China Miéville’s Perdido Street Station and The City & the City when I was in college. I had been falling out of love with fantasy – I felt too old for Redwall, and I thought I’d outgrown the genre – but Miéville’s work opened the door to the enormous world of adult fantasy literature that grappled with the problems I was now interested in.The writers who changed my mindI had never been wildly interested in books that are primarily or even largely about romantic relationships, but in the past few years, works by Sally Rooney, Banana Yoshimoto and Mieko Kawakami have changed my mind. They have opened my eyes to the potential in describing the subtle shifts in any interpersonal encounter, and I’m working out how to do that in my own writing now.The authors I came back toIt took me a while to understand Vladimir Nabokov’s brand of humour. I tried Pnin when I was in college and it just didn’t work. I gave it another try last month and I couldn’t stop giggling. It also took me a while to find the charm in Victor Hugo’s bloviating. In high school, I only read the bits of Les Misérables about the Friends of the ABC (I had a crush on Enjolras, just like everyone else.) Recently I read the unabridged edition, and I’m old enough now to enjoy every rabbit-hole sentence about Waterloo, argot and the Parisian sewer system.The book I rereadDavid Mitchellwas my favourite author at college – I raved about The Bone Clocks to everyone I met. Cloud Atlas didn’t work so well for me, but I recently reread both, and this time I was stunned. Cloud Atlas (and its woefully underappreciated film adaptation) is so gorgeous and life-affirming. It was nice to find Mitchell’s writing is just as magical for me now as it was back then.The book I could never read againI’ve just bought a copy of Arnold Lobel’s Frog and Toad Are Friends for my friend’s toddler’s birthday party. But who am I kidding? I still love those books!The book I discovered later in lifeIt took me a long time to get around to Charles Dickens’s A Tale of Two Cities, which I only finished this summer despite my love of his other work. It is overwritten, melodramatic, deeply silly camp. I love it.The book I am currently readingMario Vargas Llosa’s The Time of the Hero, on the recommendation of my French translator. He lives in Spain and also does Spanish to French translations – we bonded over our love of Borges, and he insisted I read Vargas Llosa too. I’m also on an existentialism kick, so Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Gabriel Marcel and Albert Camus are high on my list.

Featuring his backing band the Chrome Hearts, it was recorded during a sound check at a concert on Chicago’s Northerly Island.“There’s big crime in DC at the White House,” Young sings in the chorus, as a comment on Trump’s previous legal difficulties, as well as a sarcastic reference to Trump’s current crackdown on crime in Washington DC.Trump declared a “crime emergency” in DCearlier this month, seized control of the city’s police force and deployed national guard troops. He claimed the move was aimed at “halting the precipitous rise in violent crime”, though in January the city’s police department and US attorney Matthew Graves had announced a 30-year low for crime there.“Don’t need no fascist rules / don’t want no fascist schools / don’t want soldiers walking on the streets,” Young sings. “Got to get the fascists out / got to clean the White House out … no more money to the fascists, the billionaire fascists”.Riffing on Trump’s “make America great again” slogan, Young adds: “No more great again.”Young has previously criticised Trump in song, updating his 2006 song Lookin’ for a Leader in 2020 to include lyrics about him. “America has a leader building walls around our house / Who don’t know Black lives matter and we got to vote him out,” Young sang, characterising Trump as “scared of his own shadow”.The 2006 original was targeted at then-president George W Bush, calling for “someone who’s straight and strong / to lead us from desolation and a broken world gone wrong”, and mooting Barack Obama for the task. It was included on the album Living With War, on which Young criticised Bush in the plainest terms possible with the song Let’s Impeach the President.Trump used Young’s song Rockin’ in the Free World when announcing he was running for president in 2015 – possibly taking its anthemic chorus at face value rather than understanding the ironic meaning of a song charting social collapse during the Reagan era. Young said he supported Bernie Sanders for president and Trump dropped the use of the song, saying he “didn’t love it anyway”.But it reappeared on the playlist at a 2020 rally along with another Young song, Devil’s Sidewalk. Young sued Trump over the use, with the lawsuit stating that Young “cannot allow his music to be used as a ‘theme song’ for a divisive, un-American campaign of ignorance and hate”. Young later voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit.Young, who became a dual US-Canadian citizen in 2020 and called Trump “a disgrace to my country” that year, expressed worry earlier in 2025 that his criticism of Trump would mean he would not be allowed back into the US. “When I go to play music in Europe, if I talk about Donald J Trump, I may be one of those returning to America who is barred or put in jail to sleep on a cement floor with an aluminium blanket,” he wrote on his website.Explore more on these topicsNeil YoungPop and rockDonald TrumpCanadanewsShareReuse this content"

It premieres out of competition on the Lido on Friday evening.The drama is set in the world of higher education and stars Roberts as a beloved professor who finds herself at a personal and professional crossroads when a star student (the Bear’s Ayo Edebiri) makes an accusation of assault against her friend and colleague (Andrew Garfield). The cast also includes Michael Stuhlbarg and Chloë Sevigny.Unsurprisingly, the film’s exploration of conflict and power dynamics spilled into a press conference on Friday, where the first question to Roberts was whether the drama undermined feminist principles.View image in fullscreenThe main cast of After the Hunt, Michael Stuhlbarg, Ayo Edebiri, Julia Roberts, Chloë Sevigny and Andrew Garfield, at Venice film festival before the film premieres.Photograph: Elisabetta A Villa/Getty Images“Not to be disagreeable because it’s not in my nature,” Roberts responded with a smile. “I don’t think it’s just reviving an argument of women being pitted against each other or not supporting each other. There’s a lot of old arguments that get rejuvenated in this movie in a way that does create conversation.“The best part of your question is that you all came out of the theatre talking about it. That’s how we wanted it to feel. You realise what you believe in strongly because we stir it all up for you. So, you’re welcome,” the star said jokingly.Guadagnino added: “We are looking at people in their truths. Everyone has their own truths. It’s not that one truth is more important than another.“And from the perspective of film-makers and artists, how do we see the clash of truth, and what is the boundary of these truths together? It’s not about making a manifesto to revive old-fashioned values.”There were several more questions about the film’s politics and whether it was attempting to stoke controversy. Roberts and Edebiri were also asked what had attracted them to playing “troubled women”.“Trouble is where the juicy stuff is,” Roberts said. “It’s like dominos of conflict, once one falls, then suddenly everywhere you turn, there’s some new piece of conflict and challenge. That’s what makes it worth getting up and going to work in the morning.”Emma Stone declares belief in aliens during Bugonia film promoRead more“That’s how you grow,” Edebiri said. “That’s the type of movie I enjoy watching.”Roberts explained that working on After the Hunt reminded her of Bruce Beresford’s 1983 drama Tender Mercies, which followed a former country music star whose career and relationship with his ex-wife and daughter are wrecked by alcoholism.“I just thought there was something magical about the idea that a camera just landed in a place and happened to document what was going on where it landed. That’s how I feel about this movie,” she said.“It’s not so much that we’re making a statement. We’re just sharing these lives for this moment, and then we want everyone to go away and talk to each other. That, to me, is the most exciting bit because we’re kind of losing the art of conversation in humanity right now.”Elsewhere, Guadagnino was asked why the opening credits appeared to hark back to the classic font used in the credits of many films directed byWoody Allen. “The crass answer would be why not,” he replied.Jay Kelly review – even a George Clooney sizzle reel can’t save this dire Noah Baumbach effortRead more“When I started thinking about this movie with my collaborators, we couldn’t stop thinking of Crimes and Misdemeanors or Another Woman, or even Hannah and Her Sisters. And there was an infrastructure to the story that felt very linked to the great oeuvre of Woody Allen between 1985 and 1991.“It also felt like an interesting nod to thinking of an artist who has been facing some sort of problems with his being. And what is our responsibility in looking at the work of an artist that we love like him? And by the way, that font is a classic,” Guadagnino said.Explore more on these topicsJulia RobertsVenice film festivalLuca GuadagninoAndrew Garfield#MeToo movementFeminismWoody AllennewsShareReuse this content"

I mean, what an extraordinary thing.”Here We Go Again: the enduring appeal of Mamma Mia!Read moreHouse of McQueen, opening off Broadway on 9 September, explores how McQueen, a taxi driver’s son from working-class London, rose to the top of the fashion industry with a combination of provocative spectacle and flawless craftsmanship.Cloud adds: “He’s like an analogue person in a coming digital world. The oyster dress still has his DNA on it, I’m sure, because he sewed it himself. It’s not like he sent the design off to Japan and had them make it in a factory. A lot of the fashions are one of a kind because of that.”The young Lee McQueen – he later switched to his middle name, Alexander, because it sounded posh – left school at 16 and apprenticed as a tailor on Savile Row, where legend has it he scrawled obscenities inside the lining of a jacket destined for Prince Charles.McQueen pursued a master’s degree at the prestigious art and design college Central Saint Martins, where his graduation collection, inspired by Jack the Ripper, was bought by the fashion stylistIsabella Blow, who became his patron and mentor.His early collections caused shock waves. In Highland Rape, dishevelled models staggered down the runway with their Scottish-inspired clothing ripped to expose breasts and nether regions. He said: “I don’t want a show where you come out feeling like you’ve just had Sunday lunch. I want you to come out either feeling repulsed or exhilarated.”In 1996 McQueen got his big break, becomingchief designer at Givenchy, where he clashed with the constraints of a heritage house but produced memorable, sometimes unsettling shows.View image in fullscreenA scene from House of McQueen.Photograph: Deirdre McArthurHe founded his own label,Alexander McQueen, that grappled with death, nature, folklore, and the tension between beauty and horror. His theatrical runway shows included a model encased in a glass box surrounded by butterflies, robotic spray-painting on the catwalk and holographic projections of Kate Moss.He won four British Designer of the Year awards and a CBE in 2003. But he struggled with mental health and substance abuse and killed himself at the age of 40.House of McQueen starsLuke Newton, best known for playing Colin in Netflix’s Bridgerton,as McQueen and Emily Skinner as his mother, Joyce McQueen. The show is executive-produced by Rick Lazes while Gary James McQueen, the designer’s nephew, serves as creative director.Cloud was approached to write the script in January 2020, and having been awed by the exhibitionAlexander McQueen: Savage Beautyat New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art, had no hesitation about jumping on board. “I wanted to do it immediately because I didn’t know much about Lee. I was eager to dive into how he did this and where this all came from.“As a fellow artist spending a life trying to fix the world with my writing, I related to his struggle, to his having been born in the East End of London. He wasn’t supposed to get out of that neighbourhood yet he did.“He did it by believing in himself. Joyce McQueen had a lot to do with that. She plays a big role in the play. I related to the story, I related to his anger, I related to the things that inspired him and how he worked through that.”She adds: “That struggle between art and commerce was lifelong for him and painful. He was a person who did wear his heart on his sleeve. I love people like that. Those people who feel that deeply are gems, are treasures.”Using a non-linear narrative structure, and enhanced by ﬂoor-to-ceiling LED panels, House of McQueen considers the mentors, collaborators, and peers who had a profound influence on McQueen’s life and boundary-pushing career.View image in fullscreenAlexander McQueen in 1999.Photograph: Louis Lanzano/AP“He wasn’t alone. He was nurtured. He was nurtured by a fabulous mum, a supportive but difficult household. Support and appreciation come in different styles. A difficult father might just be your biggest fan. I guess I want people to walk away going ‘what a loss’ and ‘what a great artist’ and understanding what it takes to make great art.”The show’s director,Sam Helfrich, says these interactions form a “landscape of memory” of people who “caused him great pain and heartache and guilt and tragedy” but also provided “moments of beauty, moments of joy, moments of fantasy”.Helfrich says: “They’re all people who could have easily said, ‘I’m not interested in you,’ and the whole thing would have come to a halt. But one after another after another there are these people in this world who see something.“That’s where the magic comes in. What do they see with a piece of cloth in their hands? What did they see with some punky kid standing before them asking for a job? These are important moments. Making those into theatrical moments was interesting to me.”Even so, McQueen’s move to France and relationship with the fashion house Givenchy was tumultuous. Helfrich reflects: “That exchange between art and commerce, the struggle to be an artist and also to make money and serve the needs of people like the House of Givenchy or Gucci, is all part of the mix.“Lee didn’t always make perfect decisions. There’s a scene in the play where he meetsTom Fordand that’s a very complicated scene. It’s a scene where for the audience, you leave the scene thinking, ’Was that the right decision, was that the right thing to do? Is that a compromise? Did he just somehow diminish himself as an artist? Or maybe he didn’t.’ It’s a complicated scene where you think maybe Lee’s not always perfect and doesn’t always treat people nicely either.”At the end of his life, two deaths devastated McQueen. Blow took her life in 2007 and, in early 2010, McQueen’s beloved mother died. Only days later – on the eve of her funeral –the designer killed himselfafter taking drugs. The play does not seek to draw firm conclusions about his motivation.View image in fullscreenLuke Newton in rehearsals for House of McQueen.Photograph: Thomas HedgesHelfrich says: “It’s easy for all of us to be armchair psychologists and say these are the reasons why. But hopefully the play presents a more complicated portrait than that and doesn’t end on an obvious ‘Oh, well, it was inevitable,’ because by the time you get to that point in the play we don’t want it to happen: there’s too many great things going on right now so this can’t be happening. That’s what I want people to think.”Helfrich regards the show as “a theatrical event and not a biography” and drew on deep experience in directing opera productions in New York, Salzburg and elsewhere. He directed John Adams’Nixon in Chinaat the Eugene Opera.He says: “The project does feel operatic in many ways, even though it’s not an opera. It’s got a lot of scope and it’s a big story. It to me is a very Verdi and Shakespearean story in many ways. I was attracted to it for that reason and I think they were attracted to me for the same reason. My thinking is very operatic.”Cloud, for her part, says her career has been spent making people with seemingly obscure lives into epic heroes. “So it kind of fit with this in the sense that I wanted to concentrate on Lee’s humanity and familiarity as a human,” she explains.“He’s not this untouchable epic person. He’s a real human being with flaws. He was difficult and he was funny and he was irrational and neurotic and all the things that we all are. I find that heroic.”House of McQueen is now in previews at the Mansion at Hudson Yards in New York and will open officially on 9 SeptemberIn the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

The logistics must have been nightmarish – shame the show is so vibelessHannah J DaviesFri 29 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 29 Aug 2025 00.02 EDTShareMegan Thee Stallion. Patti LaBelle. Kylie Minogue. Two-fifths of the Spice Girls. These are just a smattering of the multiplatinum sellers in the all-singing, all-dancing trailer for KPOPPED, which, honestly, looked epic. If I had been reviewing this new Lionel Richie-produced singing contest based on those 109 seconds alone – complete with roaring stage pyrotechnics and Megan performing a K-pop version of her smash hit Savage – it would have been an easy five stars.Sadly, the series that follows isn’t quite as irresistible. Each of the eight episodes sticks tightly to the same format: an established Korean boy or girlband is split in two, with each half paired with a different “western” solo artist to reimagine one of the guest’s hits. They then perform said cover together, along with military-precision dance moves. At the end of each episode, a studio audience decides which song was “kpopped” the most effectively (exact metrics aren’t provided, but it essentially boils down to “which is the most up-tempo, and maybe a little menacing to boot”). Where bands like Boyz II Men are involved, the show forgoes having two guest artists, and each group just performs twice (once with each half of the Korean outfit), effectively competing against itself. I know, I know, it doesn’t make sense. Take that up with Apple.So the star power is high but the action forced and formulaic. There is usually some kind of acknowledgment from the guest stars that K-pop is “the in thing”, something their children or grandchildren know more about than them, while the Korean contingent talk vaguely about how iconic the guests are. There are low-stakes cultural exchanges, such as Megan eating unbearably spicy ramen;Kylie Minoguelearning a traditional Korean dance; and Emma Bunton and Mel B attending a tea ceremony. Two artist-approved covers are then magicked up, with lyrics and dance moves mastered in a mere 48 hours. Then it’s on to the live performances in front of starstruck audiences, who would surely listen to the likes of ITZY and Ateez belting out the phone book. Gangnam Style star Psy, billed as a co-host, is actually confined to prerecorded cameo appearances; it is the indefatigable Soojeong Son, a Korean-American actor, who comperes on stage.The result is harmless but also largely vibeless, and a fairly blatant attempt to cash in on the ubiquity ofK-pop. I’m not suggesting that we go back to the bad old days of Simon Cowell crushing the hopes and dreams of terrified normies on primetime TV. But KPOPPED shows that singing contests need friction, drama and maybe the occasional botched high note. Here, everything feels frictionless, even though the logistics must have been wild (“Did you make Patti LaBelle do this?” asks Tell It to My Heart singer Taylor Dayne, as she cooks snails). Unless you’re already a K-pop connoisseur, you’re unlikely to learn much here, except that the people involved work very, very hard, Korean girlbands are liable to give you body dysmorphia, and Korean boybands have the most impressively rigid curtain haircuts known to man. Megan – who does the odd bit of hosting here, too – describes K-pop as being “like boot camp”. Besides Jess Glynne describing it as a “system”, this is the nearest we get to any acknowledgment of just how regimented their counterparts’ pop careers are. (Maybe that’s not surprising, considering that Korean entertainment powerhouse CJ ENM co-produced the series).The best moments, then, are the ones that are a little chaotic.Boy Georgeattempting to sing in Korean. TLC’s T-Boz struggling to keep up with a high-energy dance break. Mel B deciding that synchronised choreo isn’t for her and just doing her own thing. Vanilla Ice amending the dance moves for Ice Ice Baby back to his original 1990 routine, leaving the members of Kep1er (pronounced kepler) in a tizz. And yet, these issues are quickly resolved, and performances go off without a hitch. Karma Chameleon in translation is even – shockingly – pretty decent.The final episode is a revelation, but not in a way that has anything to do with K-pop. Boyz II Men – it turns out – sound as excellent as they did 30 years ago, and their version of End of the Road with Blackswan singer Nvee (who is herself American) is truly a delight. It does sound suspiciously like the original, though. Not so much “kpopped”, then, as simply made in Korea.KPOPPED is on Apple TV+ nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewK-popKylie MinogueSpice GirlsMegan Thee StallionBoy GeorgeLionel RichiereviewsShareReuse this content"

Clare Carlisle found hers in a cave halfway up a mountain.It happened 20 years ago: walking on a Himalayan path, she met a holy man who lived in a cave nearby. Not your stereotypical sadhu, he didn’t have matted hair and wasn’t semi-naked but wore nice trousers and an acrylic pullover. Nor did he have any obvious wisdom to impart; at the last of their three meetings, he and Carlisle mainly got stoned and giggled about the chicken-like patterns on a cushion she had brought him as a gift. Yet, after leaving, she felt a “yearning” for something that they had shared: a sense that there could be a more “noble” way of living, or that we could experience “transcendence”, a higher perspective on life.Carlisle went on to have an eminent career as a philosophy professor and the acclaimed biographer ofSøren KierkegaardandGeorge Eliot. The holy man receded from her mind until she was invited to give the 2024 Gifford Lectures, a venerable series dedicated to the theme of “natural theology”. She decided to make the encounter her starting point for the six talks, and now for these six interlinked essays based on them.The opening essay sets the scene by telling the Himalayan story, while the remaining five lead us onward and upward. The most interesting step comes in the second essay, in which Carlisle uses her own experience of writing biography to point out a dramatic difference in two ways of thinking about human lives.Liberated from time, you can see life ‘under the aspect of eternity’While we are living our own life, it is a flowing, varied and incomplete thing. We are immersed in it, as if in a river. New experiences flood in on us or rain down like a “shower of atoms”, as Virginia Woolf wrote. But we cannot generally step out of the temporal flow to get a more elevated view of the entire shape and meaning of our experience. For a biographer writing about someone in the past, however, everything shifts. The life is completed and you are outside it. The details may be less rich than they were to the living person but the view over it is better. You can float up, as it were, to see what shape the person’s time-flow formed, as when a satellite picture shows the full course of a river. Liberated from time, you can see the life “under the aspect of eternity”, to borrow Spinoza’s phrase.Carlisle illustrates the difference with a children’s fable told in Karen Blixen’s Out of Africa. In brief: a man stumbles around in the mud for a while in the middle of the night. He loses his way, changes direction and trips over a few things before going back to bed. Only when he wakes up and sees the scene by daylight does he realise that his footprints have traced out a perfect picture of a stork. The point is that, by living, we create a meaningful picture without knowing it – unless we attain some inkling of that wider view through art or mysticism.This idea that we “manifest” something in life is explored through the rest of the book. Each essay leads us further up into the conceptual clouds and closer to the idea of transcendence. The Milieu looks at the various wider contexts a life can have – historical or social, for example. Incarnations examines spiritual possibilities as embodied by individuals. Arunachala partly concerns another cave-dwelling sage, Ramana Maharshi, who got over a personal fear of death to become a mystic and teacher. The final chapter, Transcendence for Beginners, ties it all together, asking whether we can have access to a noble or radiant realm while still in the midst of life.By this time, we have climbed quite a mountain of ineffability, but Carlisle has led us so gently step by step that we are willing to follow. Like William James – an earlier Gifford lecturer also fascinated by experiences that are hard to describe – she combines close readings of texts (notably those of Spinoza, Eliot and Proust) with examples from her own life. Sometimes, the citations fly past too quickly, but her extended analyses are both touching and enlightening: I especially liked her reading of Eliot’s Daniel Derondaand passages on the artistCelia Paul.Having arrived at the ending, we look back to see that we have traversed territory that is not completely religious but is not merely aesthetic or literary or psychological either. Like the man in Blixen’s fable, we see a picture traced by our steps, but I suspect it may vary for each reader, and even for the same reader at different times and in different moods. This is to Carlisle’s credit: we can make our own shape out of her words because she is never dogmatic and because she is clearly on an open-ended quest herself. All possibilities remain alive in this subtle, generous and humane book.Transcendence for Beginnersby Clare Carlisle is published by Fitzcarraldo (£12.99).

It’s a mixed-genre book of memoir, short fiction and poetry on the theme of parenting and new fatherhood, with lots of lucidity, humour and humility throughout.To 2049by American poet Jorie Graham is one of my favourite collections of recent times and rereading it recently was incredibly rewarding. Filled with slippery and existentially evocative lines such as “Years pulled their / lengths through us like long wet strings”, it had me pointing at some of the pages gasping: “I wish I wrote this!” (a condition I frequently suffer from, known as poem-envy).Another poetry collection I recently enjoyed isThe Island In The Soundby Scottish poet Niall Campbell. Campbell writes concise, soulful and lyrically observant poems that are (subtly) apocalyptic and (sonically) beautiful.Easy Beautyby Thai American author Chloé Cooper Jones is one of my favourite memoirs by a disabled author in recent years. It’s impressively scholarly, emotionally honest and very giftable for students, readers and writers looking for more nuanced disability narratives.The Quiet Ear by Raymond Antrobus is published by Weidenfeld & Nicolson.

I beat a heat wave at Oregon’s Deschutes River with a camp chair in the shaded shallows and feet in the water. A perfect setting in which to complete this hauntingly beautiful, gut wrenching yet inspiring book. Macfarlane’s language in places is brilliant prose-poetry. The stories of the rivers and the people dedicating their lives to protecting them are braided tales that somehow gave me hope even if the big picture feels less than hopeful.‘The blue blues have never left us’: a new book examines the color’s spanning ties to Black cultureRead moreImani Perry has become one of my favourite writers. Her prose is simply exquisite. Its beauty often delivers searing perspectives on US history.Black in Bluesis narrative history at its best. Perry tells an entirely different history of perseverance and cultural expression amid and despite the horrors of enslavement, Jim Crow policies and current racism in the US. Like Macfarlane, Perry tells a complex story that is by turns inspiring and enraging. To compel a reader to engage with difficult paradox over the course of a book is high achievement.Sarah Hall, authorIn the current, dismal void of integrous liberal politics, I’ve been reading books about systems change and citizen sovereignty. All Guy Shrubsole’s writing is inspiring, butWho Owns England?: How We Lost Our Green and Pleasant Land and How To Take It Backis really edifying, laying bare our historical and hierarchical social structures, land and wealth inequalities, and what these mean for both ecology and democracy now.On a similar note, it has always seemed odd to me that so few speculative fictions depict British republics – can’t we evenimaginean alternative to the monarchy? Mary Shelley’sThe Last Mandoes so, along with 21st-century hot air balloon taxis and other ingenuities. In the novel, plague exterminates the human race indiscriminately; an avenging female personification of nature. It’s worth remembering there’s more to this radical writer than just the F word.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

The story follows a man tracking this phantom creature for undisclosed, sinister purposes. It takes a cold look at our environmental failures and mercantile choices, and its rendering of the Tasmanian wilderness is spectacularly immersive.Finally, I lovedRaising Hareby Chloe Dalton – the account of a rescued European brown leveret. It’s tender and quietly miraculous. Dalton’s memoir invites the reader beyond personal connections with animals to the common ground where collective campaigning becomes a force that must inhabit the political void.Helmby Sarah Hall is published by FaberDave, Guardian readerWe startedThe StandbyStephen Kingas our first family holiday book club and, at this rate, we will still be reading during the Christmas holidays: spoiler alert, it is a long book.Having said that, we are all enjoying the ride through an apocalyptic USA. It’s my 14-year-old son’s first King book. Talk about going in at the deep end! It has turned out to be a great book to talk about too. There are so many similarities to Covid that the basis of the story seems very realistic. Of course, it being King, it segues into more fantastical realms, but it works. The cast of characters, in spite of most of the world succumbing to Captain Trips, is pretty big and King does a good job of helping the reader remember who is who.Explore more on these topicsBooksWhat we're readingRobert MacfarlaneHistory booksMary ShelleyStephen KingPoetryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There are some interesting insights into the gig economy but some very cliched and implausible representations of what happens when you become a literary author.With a kind of unvarying bland placidity, Bastien Bouillon plays someone who (like Courtès) abandoned a very successful career in photography in pursuit of his financially perilous dream of being a serious writer. We get a single shot early on of all his cameras on a shelf: he presumably does not sell any to alleviate his financial difficulties but we never see or hear about these valuable objects ever again.Bouillon has already had what the French callsuccès d’estimewith some well-reviewed but low-selling books, and his publisher (Virginie Ledoyen) says he needs to get some serious sales; she is unenthusiastic about his new manuscript and refuses to advance him any more money. Bouillon’s wife and kids have moved out, a situation he accepts with the same undemonstrative blankness as everything else. So he is forced to move to a cheaper place and do piecemeal labour to pay the bills while he works listlessly on his magnum opus; he deliberately chooses menial, meaningless work to ringfence the dignity of his new vocation as a serious author. He never quite answers the question of why he doesn’t just do literary-adjacent work such as teaching. Perhaps his pride will not permit him.So using a Taskrabbit-type website on which workers must humiliatingly undercut each other in bidding to do various manual-labour jobs for low fees, he scrapes a depressing living. But with an awful inevitability, he turns out to be writing a heartwarming book about what this existence is like, with vignettes of all these micro-employers, which is naturally entitled At Work. Did Courtès really submit a miscellaneous bunch of handwritten notebooks to his publisher for this – not typing it himself, no agent, nothing like that? Did he really continue to do online gig work even after it was published?Well, maybe: although his film deal surely means this era is at an end. It is a novel and a fiction feature after all, and neither are, as they say, on oath with the details. Either way, the film, though eventful enough, does not quite succeed in its tacit claim to be a study of poverty; the author behaves like a student who is stoically accepting some temporary dodgy accommodation.At Work screened at theVenice film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsGig economyFilm adaptationsAutobiography and memoirBiography booksFrancereviewsShareReuse this content"

It is in this dance of power that Teunkie Van Der Sluijs’s adaptation ofTheo Van Gogh’s 2003 film finds its thrill – albeit in scattered flashes. Reimagined for a modern-day setting, with reference to viral content, curated online profiles and followers, the play asks what it means to be truthful in a world of pretence.Old-school political journalist Pierre (a commanding Robert Sean Leonard) begrudgingly arrives in Brooklyn to interview the social media and film star of the moment, Katya (Paten Hughes). Meanwhile, the place he actually wants to be, Washington DC, spins into a political frenzy over the impeachment of the US vice president. Before even meeting his interviewee, Pierre has dismissed Katya as a vacuous, fame-hungry influencer. But as the evening rolls on, he realises she may be sharper than he has given her credit for.View image in fullscreenThe camera is central to Teunkie Van Der Sluijs’s direction.Photograph: Helen MurrayIt is a clash that sparks discussions about gender, celebrity and who really has influence. Sure, they’re knotty issues but it’s hardly new ground, and the script would benefit from a shot of something fresh. Leonard and Hughes make the stage into a battlefield; both are careful not to expose the wrong things. Their fast-paced spurs and spats are electric.The camera remains central to Van Der Sluijs’s contemporary direction. Screens are projected on to the back wall of Katya’s flat (a feat of architectural detail by Derek McLane), showing streams of likes for her content. She films herself talking directly to her fans, casually calling them “besties”. Trolls’ typed words pop up in Twitter-style captions, while the power of the lens is a constant fear. Even when the writing wobbles, the production maintains a state of uneasy, absorbing tension.Interview is atRiverside Studios, London, until 27 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreSocial mediareviewsShareReuse this content"

It instantly causedan uproar online– most notably among Carpenter’s young fans, who weren’t on Tumblr in 2015, or weren’t aware of the way the Sun newspaper wrote about Madonna every day of the 1990s and 2000s, and therefore didn’t realise that discourse around whether pop stars should or shouldn’t be allowed to sexualise themselves is older than pop music itself, and almost always inane.Anyone hitting play on Man’s Best Friend in search of another barrel-full of ragebait might be alarmed, not because it is particularly provocative, but because it is strangely old-fashioned. Carpenter is fond of blue turns of phrase (“Gave me his whole heart and I gave him head”), and the wordiness of her lyrics is indicative of someone who grew up in an era of constant stimulus. But Man’s Best Friend makes it clear that she regards pop music as a craft as much as it is an art.View image in fullscreenDogged by uproar… the cover art for Man’s Best Friend.Few A-list albums released in recent years are as tightly stitched and locked-in as this one; played almost entirely with live instruments and packed with so many hooks that it feels as if it might burst at the seams, it seems a true creative arrival for Carpenter. The most significant provocation here may be a newly minted star, beloved by gen Z, going against industry orthodoxy and packing an album with unusual instruments, including clavinet, sitar and agogo, and making distinct allusions to Abba and Fleetwood Mac’s Tusk.To date, Carpenter has been known for hits such as Nonsense and Espresso, which largely succeeded off the back of solid hooks and whip-smart wordplay. Man’s Best Friend feels like a rejoinder to anyone who suggested Espresso was simplistic froth: these songs are disarmingly complex, almost weaselly in their ability to make intricate, unconventional structure sound effortless. Lead single Manchild is the kind of pop song that super-producer Max Martin might call “incorrect”: its second verse has a completely different melody than the first, which is different again from the bridge; the whole thing gallops along to a rumbling, country-fried groove and all the while Carpenter is rhyming things like “hard to get” and “incompetent” and trilling her way through the phrase “fuck my liiiiiiiife!”Carpenter’s music has always been smarter than she gets credit for, but Manchild is astounding in its construction and stickiness. It’s also a song that requires active listening. The first few times I heard it, I thought it was a dog’s breakfast, simply because it is so busy; it really only clicked for me after a few listens, when I had enough time to process all the seemingly counterintuitive moving parts. The same goes for My Man on Willpower, a lush Eurodisco song that pairs lyrics about sexual frustration and rejection with Boney M-esque schmaltz, and House Tour, which takes the quotidian brilliance of Diana Ross’s It’s My House to its natural extreme with the lyric “The couch is really comfy, comfy / Got some Chips Ahoy if you’re hungry?”Although there are sonic allusions to Abba across Man’s Best Friend, Carpenter and her collaborators –Jack Antonoff, Amy Allen and John Ryan – seem to have taken a kind of metaphysical lesson from the Swedes: even bubbly, daytime radio-friendly songs deserve to be treated with care and attention to detail. Carpenter’s main lyrical concern on this record is right there in the title – men treat the women they date like dogs – and she treats it with a lightheartedness that matches her tongue-in-cheek, Betty Boop-esque image. But these songs are expansive and durable in their execution: Antonoff drafted the members of his band Bleachers, in-demand session musicians in their own right, to play across these songs, and their presence elevates them greatly, turning stellar pop tracks into teeming productions you wish you could hear the individual stems of.We Almost Broke Up Again Last Night, about the kind of generically rocky relationship that many of my friends seem to be in, is a small scale epic, cresting with a grand guitar solo and skyward-soaring strings. After producing such a sustained run of records with the likes of Taylor Swift, Lorde, Lana Del Rey and many more, Antonoff seems to bepersona non grataamong pop fans right now who see him as overexposed and predictable, but Man’s Best Friend makes a strong case for his continued presence. He, Carpenter, Allen and Ryan work together like a finely tuned machine; Man’s Best Friend, to me, feels like a producer/artist pairing on par with his work with Del Rey on her instant-classic Norman Fucking Rockwell!. The tolerances between her writing and his production on this album are minuscule, and makes its predecessor, the solid Short’n’Sweet – which spent 49 weeks in the UK Top 10 and produced three No 1 singles – sound practically rudimentary in comparison.‘I’m a tyrant!’ Pop superstar Sabrina Carpenter on freakish fame, fighting Disney and writing the song of the summerRead moreThe trade-off, when Carpenter is this much in the zone, is that everything about her music that rankles with people – the over-reliance on profane language, the overstuffing of songs with innuendo, the vaudevillian hamminess – is here in spades. That stuff could get tiresome across previous albums, but the difference on Man’s Best Friend is that everything else is so finely tuned, and so delightfully detailed, that it is easy to get over the occasionally lazy, internet-worn line (“I get wet at the thought of you / being a responsible guy”) or the fact that many of these songs cover noticeably similar ideas. Then again, there’s a Trojan horse quality to Man’s Best Friend: it’s so distinctly Carpenter that you might not even realise it’s one of the year’s singular, musically provocative pop records.Explore more on these topicsSabrina CarpenterPop and rockJack Antonoffalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Only Europe’s best new breakout starRachel AroestiFri 29 Aug 2025 05.01 EDTShareShe may unite two of the mid-2020s most pervasive cultural trends – the so-called “green wave” of zeitgeist-dominating Irish actors, authors and musicians; and the irreverent embrace of country music by pop stars such as Beyoncé, Lana Del Rey and Chappell Roan – but you don’t need to spend much time in the company of 29-year-old Ciara Mary-Alice Thompson to realise she’s a total one-off. Who else would come out with a chugging indie earworm called The Jamie Oliver Petrol Station, in which an irrational hatred of the celebrity chef and his Shell deli franchise (“That man should not have his face on posters!”) leads her to grasp frantically at slippery observations about social anxiety and her own aesthetic sensibilities? Even the most conventional song on Euro-Country, the cool R&B-pop of Running/Planning, is laden with bonkers lyrics about creating an imaginary boyfriend, ripping his head off and then promising to buy said head a Nintendo and “all the games”.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Euro-Country.Photograph: CMATBaby/AWAL/PAThompson – who won instant acclaim in Ireland with her 2022 debut If My Wife New I’d Be Dead, and cemented her status in the UK with its Mercury-nominated follow-up Crazymad, for Me – is not kooky in the manic pixie dream girl sense, or leftfield in an alienating radical way. Instead, she is deeply relatable in her weirdness. On the saccharine soul of Take a Sexy Picture of Me, she captures the formative nature of toxic femininity by recounting an attempt to wax her legs with tape aged nine, while on Ready she’s mired in the message – pedalled by Gwyneth et al – that women must engage in infinite self-perfection at the expense of actual living. In Coronation St, waiting for her life to start, over strummed guitar, she feels like a soap barmaid with no lines. In fact, Corrie gets more than one shout-out on her third album, which is enriched by a jumble of cultural references – Dorian Gray, Veruca Salt, Calpol, Kerry Katona – both a sign of camp humour and a voracious mind seeking to explain and evoke thoughts that exist just beyond the fringes of everyday conversation.CMAT: Euro-Country – videoOne of these emotional landscapes is also geographical: among Euro-Country’s major preoccupations is Thompson’s complicated feelings towards her homeland. Combining mundane regional commerce and gaudy, chintzy folk art, the album cover prods at Ireland’s mystical reputation by depicting the musician stepping out of a town centre fountain in hyper-saturated colour. But then she’s engaging in droll romanticism of her own on opener Billy Byrne from Ballybrack, the Leader of the Pigeon Convoy, which applies an echoey filter and gently building synth backdrop to a recording of a man discussing wind conditions, suffusing his words with a soporific warmth that is at once familiar and otherworldly.One song later, on the title track and inarguable peak, Thompson is fusing a potted history of the country’s economic woes (“I was 12 when the das started killing themselves all around me”) with sour reminiscences about her own stultifying adolescence in County Meath (“All the mooching ’round shops, and the lack of identity”), all of it relayed in a mixture of beautiful, vaguely yodelly tones, Lana-esque melancholia and chipmunk backing vocals that recall Norwich experimentalists Let’s Eat Grandma. And it’s funny. And it’s catchy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

Miraculously, Euro-Country’s distinctive lyrics never upstage the music, which is often subtle but just as fastidiously inventive – from Janis Joplining’s maximalist blues to Tree Six Foive’s propulsive goth-folk – and always a great showcase for Thompson’s lovely voice.Still, Euro-Country is exceptional because of how Thompson constantly strives – sometimes wryly, sometimes earnestly, always entertainingly – to capture messy psychological entrails that don’t fit the template of the typical pop song. Pared-back indie number Lord, Let That Tesla Crash is a tribute to an old housemate who died, but any threat of mindless sentimentality is instantly eviscerated as Thompson admits: “I don’t miss you like I should.” Her grief is tangled with emotional avoidance and unreciprocated affection (a recurring theme); her pain sublimated into fury directed at the Tesla owner who has parked outside their old home. It’s classic CMAT: a roiling sea of charm, chaos, substance, sadness and piercing insight – and yet more proof this nascent star is in a class of her own.Explore more on these topicsCMATPop and rockalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Their third album packs more of the trademark hybrid of rock, metal, punk and hip-hop that elbowed them to the front of a still male-dominated genre, but pushes at their boundaries and tiptoes towards pop.View image in fullscreenNova Twins: Parasites & Butterflies.Working with Foo Fighters/Charli xcx producer Rich Costey and a supporting cast including former Nine Inch Nails drummer Ilan Rubin and (via their first use of sampling) Iranian singer Mahsa Vahdat, the sound is bigger and more blatantly anthemic.Sopranoplayfully flirts with sugary harmonies and semi-operatic pop. Hummingbird – a kaleidoscopic collage of multi-layered vocals, unusual guitar processing and inventive percussion – sums up their spirit of adventure: “Spread your wings.”Lyrically, there’s more openness and introspection. Parallel Universe allows a glimpse of the toll on mental health of years in the business: “You loathe all the things you hide within yourself,” Love sings. The particularly anthemic Monsters still packs the attitude that saw off the naysayers who think this kind of music should not be made by young Black women, but adds vulnerability: “I’m not afraid of monsters, but I’m afraid of myself.” Elsewhere, tracks such asPiranhastill ramp up the brutally catchy riffola and big grooves. Longstanding fans can be assured that the Twins rock as hard as ever, just in a different way.Explore more on these topicsPop and rockMetalalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Almost every word is greeted with a similar response, such is the sense of anticipation and fervour around her arrival.Rae has set foot on a stage only a handful of times – the viral TikTok dancer and social media heavyweight turned pop star is now touring for the first time. Any sense of apprehension as to whether she is up to the task is quickly quashed. The pulsing synth-pop of Fame Is a Gun sets the tone for an evening dominated by irresistible hooks, winking fun and carefully choreographed dance moves that gracefully slink around the songs.On record, Rae’s music – early Lana Del Rey meets late-period Madonna via Britney – is often too dreamy and floaty to feel like out-and-out club tracks, but when performed live, such textural subtleties are dialled down in favour of a more direct and pounding approach. Tracks such as Summer Forever, though, catch a wonderful middle ground between bass-heavy rhythms and hazy soundscapes.When Rae invites audience members to scream her part on the remix of Charli xcx’s Von Dutch, the decibel levels can’t be far off popping every lightbulb in the building – the response is ecstatic. Despite being green, Rae is an assured performer on stage. From the raunchy High Fashion – with beats that fizz, crack and pop – to the almost 90s R&B girl group vibes of Headphones On, her voice glides along comfortably and confidently.Addison Rae: Addison review – 2025’s most refreshing star revels in pop’s shallow pleasuresRead moreDespite her Louisiana roots, Rae leans into her Los Angeles pop star persona with almost comedic levels of valley girl shtick, laying on the audience praise and gratitude thick, while shooting out million dollar bills with her face on it from a confetti cannon. It is deeply fun stuff.The closing one-two of Times Like These and Diet Pepsi are a potent finale. On a beautiful version of the former, Rae breathily sings: “My life moves faster than me, can’t feel the ground beneath my feet.” But based on the hyperaccelerated speed of her career so far, she is doing a remarkable job of keeping up.Explore more on these topicsPop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Instrumentalists such as Nala Sinephro, Alina Bzhezhinska, Marysia Osu and Brandee Younger have recently released records that reference the decades-old legacies of harp pioneers Alice Coltrane and Dorothy Ashby while creating new fusions of ambient electronics, soul and free jazz. The latest entry into this burgeoning genre is London-based trio Flur. Comprised of harpist Miriam Adefris, saxophonist Isaac Robertson and drummer Dillon Harrison, the group produce a distinctly off-kilter take on the harp combo, harnessing the lushness of its sound as a counterpoint to angular melodies and textural rhythm.Having cut their teeth as band members for the likes of flautist Shabaka Hutchings, producer Floating Points and vocalist Ganavya, the group revel in a downtempo restlessness on their debut album, Plunge. The songs Nightdiver and Over Under play through a meditative selection of sweeping harp string runs before Robertson’s atonal, long-drawn saxophone lines stop the compositions from settling into a predictable mood. Then Bolete interweaves percussive harp plucking with Harrison’s fractal groove and jarring scrapes of synth sounds, and Hold Fast Old Kelp riffs off a lo-fi electronic loop that is so sparse it feels on the verge of falling apart.It is this sense of anticipation and unpredictability that makes Flur so engaging. Their ambience is cut through with unease and their dynamism combined with a loping swing. In this trio’s hands, the harp is more than just a soft and comforting sound. With headline live shows still to come, their evolution of the instrument’s potential seems unbound.Ammar KaliaThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenRich, moody soul … Alabama Shakes.Photograph: Bobbi RichAlabama Shakes – Another LifeA decade after their last album – and newly a trio –Alabama Shakesreturn with a showstopper that builds from spotlit tension to rich, moody soul and a furious, cathartic peak.Laura SnapesChat Pile & Hayden Pedigo – Radioactive DreamsThe long-teased collaboration between the Oklahoma City noise band and the fingerpicking guitarist finds the gorgeously gloomy middle ground between their respective sludge and wide-open spaces.LSSpoon – Guess I’m Fallin in LoveBoth nasal and throaty, aloof and pained, Spoon’s Britt Daniel still has one of the coolest voices in rock.

In addition to her spellbinding solo releases, she is an eager collaborator, working with the likes of Efterklang, the improv quartet Amor Muere – which she co-founded in her adopted home of Mexico City – and with her romantic partner, guitarist Hector Tosta, as Titanic. On the latter’s superb 2023 debut,Vidrio, they pioneered a genre-agnosticism that veered from squealing free-jazz saxophone to hammering drum grooves and aggressively processed cello, always anchored in Fratti’s soaring falsetto. It heralded the arrival of a group who embraced experimentation as much as earwormy melodies.View image in fullscreenTitanic: HagenOn Hagen, the duo double down on their convictions, complementing their unusual arrangements with a newfound pop shimmer. Opener Lágrima del Sol sets the tone: sparse hand claps and shards of distorted guitar mark the rhythm for Fratti’s lilting nursery rhyme melody, then clattering drums burst through. When the song feels on the verge of falling apart, it suddenly takes on shades of 80s synth-pop, with Fratti singing softly over Phil Collins-worthy toms and twinkling keys. This kind of joyous surprise recurs throughout the record. Escarbo Dimensiones develops from a minimal arrangement of drums, bass and atonal vocals into soft funk that nods to Sade.La Dueñaslips from distorted cello and cymbal washes into a dramatic synth ballad that channels Kate Bush’s yearning vocals; La Trampa Sale erupts from a trudging beat into an arena-sized, reverb-laden chorus.‘Doubt is exciting’: cellist Mabe Fratti on chaos, curiosity and climbing volcanoesRead moreCathartic moments of darkness temper their pop side: Gotera wrangles thundering metal blastbeats beneath Fratti’s elongated melodies; Gallina Degollada delivers unrelenting, menacing drums and growling bass. This startling balance underscores Hagen’s remarkable achievement: a reimagining of pop music that revels in lingering unease, challenging yet infectious.Also out this monthColombian musicianLucrecia DaltreleasesA Danger to Ourselves (RVNG Intl), an intimate collection of longing vocal melodies accompanied by sparse drum loops and textural harmony. It’s downtempo and full of strange instrumental flourishes that draw the listener in. Moroccan producerGuedra Guedra’s latest album,Mutant (Smugglers Way), continues his exploration of north African rhythms, weaving dabke and gnawa percussive patterns into electronic drum programming and synth melody, creating a propulsive dancefloor explosion. West African percussion ensembleBalimaya Project’s debut collaboration with Colombian groupDiscos Pacífico All Stars,Calima (Jazz Re:freshed), is a fascinating fusion of African and Latin traditions, meandering from highlife to rumba, talking drum and Latin jazz horns, all held together by a relentless sense of groove.Explore more on these topicsMusicGlobal album of the monthExperimental musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Both works are wonderfully approachable, though Aho’s work is the less adventurous, his orchestral writing more motoric, his gestures more rhetorical and fundamentally tonal than Lindberg’s, in which references to earlier clarinet solos, from Debussy to Gershwin, are cunningly secreted.Julian Bliss’sperformances of both works, withTaavi Oramo(a clarinettist himself) conducting the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, are absolutely immaculate. It’s clear from the opening moments of the Lindberg concerto that the most extreme technical demands hold no terrors for him, and he matches that virtuosity with a velvety smooth tone in the lyrical passages in both works. PerhapsKriikku’s recording of the Lindberghas a shade more intensity than Bliss’s, but it’s a close-run thing.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

Not by leading a hardened team of oddball veterans in an assault on a despot’s intergalactic outpost, nor by completing a series of well-written tasks to build up my warrior mage so they can defeat some ancient malignant omnipotent deity.I have done it by completing easy races on a bicycle. Sounds ridiculous? Welcome to Wheel World.It seems the epitome of arch to criticise a video game for its ridiculous plot when I am happy to have plumbers save worlds by stomping on mushrooms, or hedgehogs doing similar while wearing snazzy sneakers. I even took Arbroath FC to the European Cup final in Championship Manager once. But the plot of Wheel World seems so clumsily stuck on I suspect 10% of the code is pure Blu-Tack.There is a spirit in your bike who looks like a skull and therefore is called Skully. Because it’s that kind of game. You need to win the seven lost parts of his Legendary Bike by beating the cyclists who have them, so Skully can enter the Soul Sewer to reach Mount Send and perform the Great Shift ritual to fly to the moon and save the universe. Just typing that plot makes my fingers vibrate with the clunkiness. It’s lo-fi hipster hippy claptrap. And it didn’t need to be like this.View image in fullscreenTen percent Blu-Tack … Wheel World.Photograph: Annapurna InteractiveThe original plot of what was initially called Ghost Bike involved memorials placed by the roadside to mark the deaths of cyclists. That sounds much better but it was ditched in favour of lighter fare. Now,according to the Messhof studio boss Mark Essen, “There’s some silly lore in there, and there’s a creation myth, and deities people pray to, but it’s like, take it or leave it.”If the people making the game aren’t bothered about the story, how am I expected to be?But who cares, eh? This is a racing game: they don’t need plots do they? Not if they supply fingernail-munching, edge-of-the-seat rollercoasters of excitement.But this doesn’t.It’s not a terrible game, not by any stretch. It’s a decent if far too easy attempt to put Tony Hawk on two wheels in a world that looks like a blander version ofJet Set Radio, and if you have Xbox Game Pass it’s “free”. It passed the “sitting and thinking of it when I am not playing it” test, which is my main indicator if I am in to a game or not. But every time I went back to it, my whelm was distinctly under rather than over. You don’t have weapons or crazy power-ups, there’s no multiplayer mode, you can’t knock other cyclists off bikes (they don’t even seem to be knocked over by cars in the same way you are), and although there are a myriad of witty bike builds, you don’t need them. I completed the game using one that made me crazy fast and one that gave me good grip and handling. That used 14 bike parts. The game has more than 170.View image in fullscreenGet your skate on … Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater.Photograph: ActivisionIt’s just not escapist enough for me because I can do a lot of the things in this game in real life. I can get on my bike right now, race after another cyclist, ring my bell at him and say: “Hey, Lone Wolf, I challenge you to a race.” Just like you do in Wheel World. Actually, real life may be more exciting because there is a chance the other cyclist will kick my head in for being obnoxious.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I can play football, but not with the players or tricks I could use in Fifa. I will probably never be the captain of a spaceship – apologies for the lack of ambition – so I loved playing everything from Elite to Mass Effect.I’m not saying that all games should feature smart bombs and dragons. I get the appeal of farm, train and bus sims: they allow you to take an interest and make it interactive. There are only so many people who can be Network Rail operators in real life, so fair play to you if you want to spend two hours a day doing so virtually. I don’t even mind if you wear a special hat when you do.I can’t help but feel there is a cool bicycle game out there waiting to be made. The control mechanic will always be imperfect because holding down a button to pedal isn’t remotely realistic, while rotating a thumbstick round and round to make you cycle faster, like a circular-motion version of Track & Field, would get irritating (and painful) really fast.There could be a cycle courier version of Crazy Taxi, or a game that replicates the joy of having a bike when you are a kid: all about wheelies, backies and clothes-pegging different football cards in the spokes to make a motorbike sound, almost like the bike parts of the wonderful Bully. Until then, I will survive on the memory morsels of Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX on the PlayStation, the original two-wheeled Tony Hawk rip off.Explore more on these topicsGamesCyclingSports gamescommentShareReuse this content"

Holiday hotspots are being ravaged by heat, fire, floods and drought as fossil fuel pollution warps the climate – and travelling to reach them in planes or on cruise ships spews far more planet-heating gas than anything else you and I are likely to do. (Rocket enthusiasts such as Katy Perry and Jeff Bezos, I assume, have not yet subscribed to Down to Earth.)It’s hard to relax by the beach in 40C heat with the stench of smoke fouling the air. For some travellers, a nagging sense of guilt will further sully what they hoped would be a break of mindless bliss.‘We have already entered the beginning of the age of non-tourism’View image in fullscreenDaily temperatures reaching 45C have caused destructive wildfires throughout Spain’s Ourense province.Photograph: Pablo Blázquez Domínguez/Getty ImagesIt was a dizzying array of dream destinations. Smooth-talking salespeople at the world’s largest tourism trade fair stood ready to whisk you out of a dreary German conference hall and take you to far-flung lands that seemed too perfect to be real. High mountains, white beaches, jaw-dropping deserts – the options were endless, and all too available.I had gone to the ITB Berlin to hear how the holiday industry was feeling about its future and the answer, for the most part, was unflinchingly cheery. The Swedish concept offlygskam, or flight shame, has failed to gain traction beyond a small share of climate-concerned tourists. Covid lockdowns brought only temporary pain to the aviation sector, which was bailed out with vast sums of public money when its planes were grounded. Traveller numbers in 2024 had returned to pre-pandemic highs. It had been a bad few years, everyone agreed, but things were finally looking up.One talk, however, struck a noticeably different tone. In a speech that the conference organisers billed as a “must-hear session for anyone who cares about the future of travel and our planet”, Stefan Gössling, one of the most-cited travel researchers in the world, calmly declared the approaching demise of the era of mass tourism.“We have already entered the beginning of the age of non-tourism,” said Gössling, a business professor at Linnaeus University who has consulted for the UN and World Bank, to an uneasy audience of travel agencies, car rental companies, cruise operators and hoteliers.Gössling argues that worsening weather is raising the cost of travel to levels that consumers’ wallets will soon be unable to sustain. It’s not just the odd heatwave here or wildfire there, he said, when I spoke with him after the talk, but the mounting cost of everything from food to insurance that will render travel as we know it unaffordable.It’s a big claim. The rising costs of extreme weather would have to outpace expected growth in global incomes by a large margin for his thesis to hold. That seems plausible if global heating reaches civilisation-threatening temperature levels that are 4C or 5C above the preindustrial average – in which case prepper bunkers will hold more appeal to me than all-inclusive resorts – but I find it hard to imagine at 1.5C or 2C, the levels to which world leaders have promised to reach.And yet. Europe experienced its worst wildfires on record this summer, on the back of a year in which political enthusiasm for climate action has plunged. Even “coolcation” destinations – popularised to beat the heat – such as Norway and Canada have been hit by staggering temperature extremes in recent weeks.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Flying is one of the hardest activities to clean up with technological solutions and efforts to keep disasters from spiralling will add to that cost. The price of a plane ticket is likely to balloon if it includes the cost of making planes greener or sucking carbon pollution back out of the atmosphere.That doesn’t paint a pretty picture for tourism industry executives. In blunt terms, they can either go green and raise prices or let the planet burn and raise prices. Either way, it may be time for the long-overlooked domestic holiday – cheap, convenient and often more relaxing – to finally make a comeback.Read more:‘We cannot do it the way our fathers did’: farmers across Europe struggle to adapt to the climate crisis‘Unlike any other kind of fear’: wildfires leave their mark across SpainEurope scorched by wildfires – pictures from spaceTo read the complete version of this newsletter –subscribe to receive Down to Earthin your inbox every Thursday.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentDown to Earth newsletterAirline industryExtreme heatWildfiresEuropeEurope holidaysExtreme weathernewslettersShareReuse this content"

Here, frequent travellers share their tipsGet our weekend culture and lifestyle emailDoosie MorrisFri 29 Aug 2025 16.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 29 Aug 2025 20.11 EDTShareFree accommodation in someone else’s home might seem like an easy hack for cheap travel, but there’s more to house-sitting and swapping than a free room.While sitting usually involves caring for pets in exchange for accommodation, swapping requires participants to make their own home available to others for the pleasure of staying for free in someone else’s.Angela Laws, a founder of Trusted Housesitters, the world’s largest house-sitting platform with more than 200,000 active members, wants to be clear with those considering giving it a go: “It’s not a free vacation. It’s not free travel. It’s not free accommodation. It is a mutually beneficial exchange between pet parents and sitters.” She stresses too that anyone wanting to take advantage of the benefits needs to appreciate and honour the responsibilities it entails.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningOn the other hand, if you have your own home, Emily Budin, an Australian living in the UK, has swapped her zone two London apartment for New York brownstones, a Christmas in Switzerland, chateaus in the south of France, Croatian villas – and more. She says, with caveats, the practice is a “super-easy” way to banish accommodation costs from your holiday budget. Swaps don’t always have to be simultaneous, which makes platforms like Home Exchange – made famous by the film The Holiday – much more convenient. Budin says its annual fee is about equivalent to one night in a decent hotel in a big European city.View image in fullscreenEmily Budin, an Australian living in the UK has swapped her zone two London apartment for New York brownstones, a Christmas in Switzerland, chateaus in the south of France, Croatian villas – and more.Photograph: Alexander Spatari/Getty Images“You can earn points while your house is empty,” Budin says. If you’re visiting family elsewhere, and use them to “pay” for a property during a time that suits your vacation schedule. Meanwhile, when you’re away, someone else might use their points to book your place, which will in turn earn you more points. This also means the swaps don’t have to be like-for-like. Budin says a reasonable quality property in a central location might command the same points per night as a more remote but more lavish one. If your place isn’t top tier, you can still bank your points to spend on more premium properties.If you’re renting, you can still join HomeExchange, but the onus is on the swapper to check if their rental agreement allows it.Communication is keyLaws says you can find a sit within 24 hours, but in her experience, “the more communication, the better”. If a listing aligns with your experience as a sitter, the first step is to reach out through the secure messaging system within the platform. Laws recommends a video call, where both parties can ask questions, take a virtual tour of the home, and even share their own living space.‘Warm and fuzzy’: would you cuddle a Highland cow?Read moreHannah Wilkinson, 32, started house-sitting to see Australia on the cheap with her boyfriend in 2023 and haschronicled the experience on Substack. Two years and nearly 30 back-to-back sits later, Wilkinson says the rare hiccups she has experienced could have been avoided by more thorough communication.Laws says the sit she is currently organising has involved at least five days of back and forth to ensure everyone is on the same page.For house swappers, similar advice applies. Budin says she doesn’t always bother with a video call, but does like to make expectations clear and be sure to ask about what her hosts expect of her via messages. She says even when “rules” aren’t explicitly outlined, it’s expected that you won’t be treating the property as if you’re a paying customer, but rather a personal house guest: “You’d be neighbourly, make sure to put the bins out, things like that.”View image in fullscreenTreat the property like you’re a personal house guest, Budin says.Photograph: Robynne O’Halloran/Getty ImagesBe flexibleWilkinson likens the house-sitting to backpacking: “You need to be organised, but you also need to be completely open to the unexpected.” She and her boyfriend, for example, spent a few weeks in Jindabyne simply because the opportunity arose.Swapping can also be pretty spontaneous, according to Budin, who says that if her husband were also a remote worker, she believes they could stay elsewhere “every other week if we wanted to”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She likes to lock things in about a month in advanceBudin says the preparation for swapping can be a “bit of a headache”. She ups her cleaners’ hours before and after having people stay at her place. While it’s not expected that all your personal effects will be removed, it’s customary to leave empty shelves in the fridge, pantry, closet and vanity, she says. “It doesn’t have to be like an Airbnb, but it definitely has to be livable.”View image in fullscreenBudin increases her cleaners’ hours before and after having people stay at her place.Photograph: Aire Images/Getty ImagesIs it weird?Budin says it’s all a state of mind. If you come to terms with people being in your space, house swapping is a legitimately good way to access properties you might not otherwise afford.“You’re either a house swapper or you’re not,” she says. “But for me, the benefits far outweigh the negatives.” She says while she has come home to surprises, like the house being messier than anticipated – and once finding a vibrator left behind in her dresser – she has never had anything broken or stolen. “I’m sure there’s been a few men that have worn my underwear, but what you don’t know won’t hurt you.”“There’s also insurances that are in place and a holding deposit that’s kept every time you swap,” she says. Emmanuel Arnaud, the CEO and co-founder of HomeExchange told Guardian Australia via email that the platform has facilitated nearly half a million swaps in 2024, up 42% on 2023, and that 99.7% of exchanges occur without incident.For Wilkinson, arriving at one house-sit to discover there was an expectation that the dogs would share her bed was “a bit much,” but she says this kind of detail can be ironed out in advance.View image in fullscreen‘I’m sure there’s been a few men that have worn my underwear, but what you don’t know won’t hurt you,’ Budin says.Photograph: makasana/Getty Images/iStockphotoPets are the priority when sittingOf house-sitting, Wilkinson says simply: “If you aren’t into pets, just don’t even consider it.” She has had to scrub poop out of carpets and once devoted weeks to caring for a blind pug whose health deteriorated rapidly in their owner’s absence. The experience, she says, was like “looking after a toddler”.Even with a healthy animal, she points out, “you’re going to have to give up at least an hour of your day”. While you can be strategic and look for sits with independent felines or older dogs that need less exercise, the fact remains that caring for pets is what you are doing in exchange for accommodation, so it needs to be seen as a job.Explore more on these topicsAustralia holidaysAustralian lifestylefeaturesShareReuse this content"

This one is inspired by the green tree snake, which is a gorgeous emerald colour, and the chilli thread garnish imitates its tongue. I definitely knew what this drink would look like long before I developed it, because I found myself leaning towards green flavours that have a great affinity with a smoky, vegetal mezcal. Green pepper and shiso enhance those herbal, peppery notes, while the apple liqueur and manzanilla bring a crisp, sweet fruitiness that rounds things out. I had so much fun with this one that it’s one of my favourite recipes to date.Tree snakeServes1For the mezcal infusion (to serve about 12)2shisoleaves350ml good mezcal– we useMezcal Verde Amarás1 green pepper, stalk, core and pith discarded, flesh finely sliced or choppedFor the drink30mlgreen pepper- and shiso-infused mezcal(see above and method)30ml manzanilla– we usePort of Leith10ml apple liqueur– we useLucky Liqueurs10ml agave syrup– we useBristol Syrup Co’s Nogave1 dash green food colouring(optional)1 pinch red angel hair chilli threads, or a little very finely shredded red chilli, to garnish (optional)To infuse the mezcal, put the shiso and mezcal in a blender, blitz for 10-15 seconds, then pour into a mason jar or similar. Add the sliced pepper, seal and leave to infuse for 48 hours, then strain through coffee filter paper – so long as it’s strained properly, the infused mezcal will have an almost indefinite shelf life, so there’s no need to store it in the fridge.To build the drink, measure the infused mezcal, sherry, apple liqueur and agave syrup into a shaker, add the food colouring, if using, then drop in a big handful of ice and shake hard. Double strain into a rocks glass filled with fresh ice (we use one large cube), garnish with the chilli, if using, and serve.Aidan Rivett, bar manager,Noto, EdinburghExplore more on these topicsCocktailsThe good mixerSpiritsFoodMexican food and drinkBritish food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

That fading sweetness pairs beautifully with the first flush of wild blackberries, however, and this galette makes the most of that overlap: slices of peach and a handful of blackberries sit on a gently sweetened ricotta base that’s flavoured with brown sugar, orange zest and a few sprigs of thyme. The ricotta bakes into something soft and creamy that catches those juices as the fruits slump.Peach, blackberry, ricotta and thyme galetteThis is best served when barely warm, with vanilla ice-cream.Prep15 minChill1 hr+Cook1 hr 20 minServes6-8For the pastry185g plain flour, plus extra for dusting¼ tsp fine sea salt⅛ tsp baking powder120g coldunsalted butter, cubed85g cream cheese1-2tbspdouble cream2 tsp cider vinegarFor the orange ricotta base150g ricotta30g light brown sugarFinely grated zest of 1 orange– save the juice for the peaches1 tsp thyme leaves, finely chopped⅛ tsp fine sea saltFor the peaches2 ripe peaches, halved, stoned and each half cut into 8 wedges2tbsp caster sugar1tbsp cornflour2 tsp orange juice2 tspthyme leaves⅛ tsp fine sea salt100g blackberries, halved if largeTo glaze1 small egg, lightly beaten1tbsp demerara sugarTo make the pastry, put the flour, salt and baking powder in a food processor and pulse a few times to combine and aerate. Add the cubed butter and pulse again until it is broken down into small pieces. Add the cream cheese and pulse until the mix looks like damp and unevenly sized crumbs. Add a tablespoon of the cream and the vinegar, then pulse until the mix just starts to come together into a dough (if it doesn’t, pulse in the second tablespoon of cream). Tip out the pastry on to a lightly floured work surface, gather and press it into one piece, then wrap loosely in clingfilm, press to flatten into a disc and refrigerate for at least an hour, and up to two days.Once chilled, make the ricotta base by mixing all the ingredients in a small bowl. Combine all the ingredients for the peaches except the blackberries in a second bowl, toss gently to combine, then set aside.Heat the oven to 210C (190C fan)/410F/gas 6½. Take the pastry out of the fridge, put it on a large sheet of baking paper, then roll it out evenly into a large, roughly 36-38cm-diameter circle that’s about 2mm thick. Don’t worry if the edges are irregular; that’s all part of the charm of a galette. Lift the baking paper along with the pastry on to a large baking tray, then spread the ricotta mix evenly on top, leaving a 4-5cm border all around the edge.Add the blackberries to the peach bowl, toss gently, then spoon the fruit on top of the ricotta. Carefully draw the border of the pastry up and over the fruit, roughly pleating it as you go and leaving the centre of the galette exposed. Brush the pastry border with egg wash, then sprinkle with the demerara sugar and bake for 40-45 minutes, until golden brown.Leave the galette to rest and cool a little, then slice and serve.Explore more on these topicsCakeThe sweet spotBakingFoodDessertFruitPastryCheeserecipesShareReuse this content"
