Winter fuel will lose us the next election, it was a terrible mistake. But it’s probably too late for a U-turn now.”On Tuesday the Welsh first minister, Eluned Morgan, will give a major speech that will criticise the welfare cuts, setting out a clear dividing line with Welsh Labour, which she will position on the left of the UK party.Downing Street figures acknowledge the concern that exists over the policy at all levels of the party – and among voters – and said there had been many conversations over the issue in recent weeks. However, they stressed this was not a formal review.“People are saying we haven’t done enough for them on the cost of living, and winter fuel is an example of it going in the wrong direction,” one source said.Another added: “The winter fuel cut has become totemic and talks to us being on the wrong side of working people. We need to show that’s not the case.”However, they cautioned there would be no kneejerk response to the election results, and any change to the policy was unlikely before autumn, and would be announced in the context of a broader financial package.The proportion of Labour voters going to Reform – about 8% – was roughly unchanged since September, they added.“We’ve got to make sure our response to the elections is the right one and not just overreacting to hot takes. Of course Labour MPs all heard stuff about winter fuel during the elections and are feeling bruised by that,” one No 10 insider said.Pressure from MPs for a major rethink of economic strategy is likely to mount in the coming days. “It might not be too late,” one MP said of a winter fuel U-turn. “I don’t think we would get credit for doing it but we might neutralise it as a major attack line.”“The mood in the PLP [parliamentary Labour party] is hardening on cuts,” another said. “It’s far beyond the usual suspects who are angry about this.”In No 10 there are concerns that any tweak to the policy could be damaging for Rachel Reeves, who removed the payment of up to £300 from 10 million pensioners within weeks of taking office, saying the money was needed to fill a budget black hole left by the Tories.One senior figure said the strength of feeling about the winter fuel cut was likely to have an impact on their broader plans for welfare reform, as previously loyal backbenchers were threatening to rebel in a vote on £5bn of cuts expected in early June.Reform UK is main opposition party, Nigel Farage claims after election winsRead more“It’s unfortunate that the vote is coming after the local elections as lots of MPs now feel that Downing Street doesn’t get it and that they don’t owe us anything,” they added.Dozens of MPs are understood to have sent private letters to Starmer urging him to change course on welfare cuts or to pause the cuts until after the summer when fuller details of investment in back-to-work programmes will be known.Concerned MPs have been holding fortnightly briefings with disability charities to understand the breadth of the impact of the cuts.Ministers have sketched out tentative plans for a second round of tough welfare reforms this autumn, though that could now be contingent on how large the rebellion is in June.Insiders argue further reforms would make the system more fair overall, and that there is public support for reining in the bill for health and disability benefits, which is set to reach £70bn by the end of the parliament.“We didn’t go big enough the first time round. The costs are unsustainable,” one No 10 source said. “It’s a fairness issue but also a fiscal one – how can we spend money on the public’s priorities, like schools and hospitals, if all the money is going on welfare?”A second government source said: “We should’ve done it all in one hit – we didn’t go far enough. We’ve had all the political pain for very little fiscal gain.”Department for Work and Pensions(DWP) officials believe the government would need to cut a total of £15bn from the benefits bill to make an impact on the rate of growth.Any mitigation of the winter fuel allowance cut alongside further cuts to disability benefits would be likely to spark further criticism from the party’s left.A cabinet minister warned: “The second tranche will be even more painful.”With the bulk of future savings set to come once again from cuts to disability benefits, including a freeze to personal independence payments, the government is bracing itself for more internal dissent.A reshuffle of cabinet ministers as well as the junior ranks could come as soon as the summer – in part because the prospect of junior ministerial roles becoming vacant might be a useful tool to persuade wavering MPs not to rebel on welfare cuts.But sources have told the Guardian that Starmer himself has become more conscious of a need for a reshuffle in his top team after becoming frustrated with the pace of delivery and a feeling that some ministers have become “institutionalised” in their departments.The prime minister complained at a recent cabinet meeting that ministers were seeking too many “write-rounds” – a process for seeking high-level cover for difficult decisions.Among those who are tipped to be moved are the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, and the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy.Peter Kyle, the science and technology secretary, is tipped for a move to education, having come under fire from MPs for a perceived closeness to big tech.Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the Treasury who is Rachel Reeves’s de facto deputy, could be his replacement.Explore more on these topicsBenefitsLabourLocal electionsLocal elections 2025newsShareReuse this content"

That compares with 250 in the same period in 2022, 60 in 2023 and 44 in 2024.People were asked to avoid the Merrivale and Okehampton areas for the time being, and Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service said the fire might behave unpredictably due to the changing weather.Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service posted an update to X on Monday evening saying: “Approximately 12,500 acres of moorland were destroyed by fire.“Crews assisted by Dartmoor rangers and Commoners using firefighting equipment attempted to extinguish the fire to protect the environment.“Crews used five Argo Cat vehicles, fogging units, leaf blowers and a drone.”Dartmoor national park posted a photo of the fire to X on Monday morning, saying: “The dry weather has left Dartmoor highly vulnerable to fire. Please don’t light BBQs or fires.”Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service’s area manager, Simon Young, told the BBC: “Wildfires are always challenging because they are inaccessible for our appliances to go on to our moorland,” he said.“It makes it very difficult, but we have specialist vehicles to make sure we have capability to get on to the moor and make sure we can do the job as safely as possible.“The wind has really played its part and we are currently under amber wildfire conditions nationally for the next three to four days.“We know the conditions are very dry under foot and with the wind it has just exacerbated it.”Meanwhile,SurreyFire and Rescue Service was called to a 1.6 hectare fire in the open at about 12.45pm on Monday on Turfhill, Lightwater in Surrey Heath.Explore more on these topicsWildfiresDevonSurreynewsShareReuse this content"

The figure was 305,619 in 2019, according to data obtained by the Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM) under freedom of information laws.A report by the RCEM also found the risk of a 12-hour wait in an emergency department in England increased with the age of the patient. People aged 60 to 69 had a 15% chance of waiting 12 hours or more. For those aged 90 and over, the likelihood rose to 33%.“The healthcare system is failing our most vulnerable patients – more than a million last year,” said Dr Adrian Boyle, the president of the RCEM. “These people are our parents, grandparents, great-grandparents.Tens of thousands waited more than 24 hours for hospital beds in A&E last yearRead more“They aren’t receiving the level of care they need, as they endure the longest stays in our emergency departments, often suffering degrading and dehumanising corridor care. It’s an alarming threat to patient safety. We know long stays are dangerous, especially for those who are elderly, and puts people’s lives at risk.”As well as long waits, the RCEM report found many older people were missing out on vital checks in A&E. Of patients aged over 75, only 16% were screened for delirium – a reversible condition linked to an increased risk of death. Fewer than half (48%) of patients were screened for their risk of falls.Dr Nick Murch, the president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said: “This situation, where over a million older patients are known to have endured prolonged periods of over 12 hours in emergency departments, frequently in unsuitable and undignified settings such as corridors, is a matter of grave concern.“It is clear that, despite the considerable dedication and hard work of multidisciplinary teams including emergency medicine, acute medicine and acute frailty services, these extended waiting times signify a profound failure within our healthcare system.“We must ensure that 12-hour waits in emergency departments again become an infrequent exception rather than the norm.”The RCEM recommends changes, including “front door frailty screening” in every A&E, which is already being introduced in Scotland.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This government is investing £26bn in the NHS and social care over the next two years, has ended the resident doctor strikes so staff are on the frontline, and is committed to cutting A&E waiting times so patients are seen faster.“Through our 10-year health plan, we will ensure that patients, including older people, are seen promptly in A&E, waiting times continue to come down, and more people get a GP appointment.”Explore more on these topicsNHSA&EOlder peopleHealthHospitalsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Its survey found 79% of pharmacists were having to refuse requests for antibiotics from patients at least once a day.A quarter of pharmacists said patients frequently returned partially used antibiotics, while 37% were aware of patients regularly hoarding them for a later date. Half-used courses of antibiotics were being posted on local social media groups, the NPA said.Other issues include patients requesting antibiotics from their pharmacy before going on holiday just in case of illness, and people returning from abroad with huge quantities of antibiotics for conditions not treated by them in the UK.Olivier Picard, the chair of the NPA, said: “These are concerning findings and shows there are widespread misconceptions about the role that antibiotics can play among some patients.“Although antibiotics may be an appropriate course of treatment for some conditions, for other ailments like viral coughs and sore throats, they may not be effective. This could also mean antibiotics may not be effective for treating more serious conditions, posing a risk to patient safety.“Pharmacists are highly trained medical professionals who see nearly 2 million patients a day and provide medication advice. They can supply antimicrobials in some circumstances, but only when they are clinically needed.”Diane Ashiru-Oredope, the lead pharmacist for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) at the UKHSA, said addressing public misconceptions about taking antibiotics was an important part of tackling AMR.“Antibiotic resistance is impacting people every day in this country. Not being able to effectively prevent and treat infections is one of the biggest threats to our health,” she said.Overcoming that threatwas still possible if everyone worked together to help keep antibiotics working, she said. “For example, only taking them when prescribed and as directed by a healthcare professional, not taking antibiotics for colds and flu and not saving antibiotics for future use – unused antibiotics can be returned to pharmacies.“Taking action not only protects our own individual health, it also protects everyone in our communities and future generations.”A Department ofHealthand Social Care spokesperson said AMR represented “one of the most significant threats to public health, with potentially devastating consequences if we don’t act now”.“Our pharmacists, along with other healthcare professionals, play a crucial role and we’re grateful for their vigilance in ensuring these vital medicines are only provided when clinically appropriate,” they said.Explore more on these topicsAntibioticsDrug resistanceHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

On 28 May 2022,Liverpoolsupporters said they feared for their lives as they were forced to enter Stade de France via a narrow subway and boxed-in lanes that could not accommodate the thousands of people that had arrived.This led to severe overcrowding which a French senate report later said posed “a risk of crushing”. Security and ticket checks were abandoned. This led to people without tickets, including some local young men who attacked Liverpool fans, to gain entry into the stadium.Shortly before kick-off, the turnstiles were closed, leaving many fans with tickets unable to get inside the stadium. As more people arrived, police used pepper spray and teargas on the crowd.After the match, Liverpool supporters complained of being robbed by local gangs and said police had offered no protection. The French government, police and Uefa placedthe blame on Liverpool supporters, claiming that the chaos was caused by thousands seeking entry with fake tickets.Darmanin apologised to Liverpool fans for the first time on Monday.Speakingto the LEGEND YouTube channel, he said: “It was a failure because I had not foreseen. That was a mistake on my part. I was led astray by my preconceptions.“The scapegoat was easy to find, and I apologise now to Liverpool supporters. They were quite right to be hurt. It was a mistake and a failure.”After the match, Darmanin made a statement saying the chaos had been caused by “30,000-40,000 Liverpool fans” with forged or no tickets and alleged there had been an “industrial scale” ticket fraud.Ian Byrne, the MP for Liverpool West Derby, told the Guardian: “Darmanin’s conduct afterPariswas unforgivable and I questioned his fitness in being a minister responsible for justice at the time.“He repeated all the lies about hooliganism, fake tickets to frame the blame on the Liverpool supporters who were once again victims of a state cover-up. It was only because of the collective fightback of Liverpool supporters and fine journalism that prevented the narrative Darmanin was spinning gaining traction.“The partial apology will be noted by Liverpool supporters but Darmanin’s actions will not be forgiven or forgotten.”A month after the game, Darmanin, apologised to “everyone who suffered from bad management” but stopped short of saying sorry to the Liverpool fans.“Should the Stade deFrancehave been better managed? The answer is yes,” he told the French radio station RTL at the time. “Am I partly responsible? The answer is yes. Of course, I readily apologise towards everyone who suffered from this bad management of the event.”AGuardian investigation in the aftermath of the gamedetailed the near disaster Liverpool fans faced, including reporting that children were among those pepper sprayed unprovoked by police.In March, a judge ruled that Liverpool fans affected by the game had the right to have their personal injury claims heard in the UK after an attempt by European football’s governing body to block it.Explore more on these topicsChampions League final 2022Football politicsLiverpoolUefaReal MadridParisFrancenewsShareReuse this content"

He remains in police custody and detectives asked for people who were on board and had any information to contact them.Hampshire police said: “The ship left Southampton at 6pm on Saturday 3 May. It was reported that at around 8.30pm, a 60-year-old man died following an altercation. His next of kin have been informed and are being supported by specialist officers.“As part of our inquiries, a 57-year-old man from Exeter has been arrested on suspicion of murder. He remains in custody at this time.DCI Matt Gillooly, the senior investigating officer, said: “We want to reassure you that this appears to be an isolated incident onboard, and we want to thank the crew for their cooperation and assistance with our inquiries.A spokesperson for MSC Cruises, which owns and operates the ship, said: “Following an incident onboard our ship, the relevant authorities were contacted, and we are cooperating fully with their investigations. We are providing full support to those impacted.”The ship had left Southampton heading on a two-day trip to Bruges. On a Facebook page for the vessel, the administrator said: “No one needs to speculate into an ongoing police investigation. Thoughts are with the family and friends affected.”The ship, which the company bills as a ‘“masterpiece at sea”, can carry 6,334 guests and 1,704 crew members. There are 2,421 cabins. Its cruises include trips around Europe and the Caribbean.It has four pools, capable of accommodating more than 1,000 guests, 21 bars and 11 dining rooms, including a new Indochine restaurant. The ship was officially named by the actor Sophia Loren.Lynda Hardiman-Pearce, a passenger on the ship, said she saw five police officers at Southampton docks when she disembarked. She said the cruise was “full of hen and stag parties” and she had been told an army medic who was on board tried to help the man who died.The police said: “If anyone who was onboard has information that could assist, please contact Hampshire and Isle of Wight Constabulary on 101 with reference 44250193676.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsSouthamptonnewsShareReuse this content"

She believes the celebration is particularly significant in teaching young people about the sacrifice made by those in the war.She says: “You’ve got to remember we wouldn’t be here if those people had not done what they’ve done for us. And I think unfortunately with the younger generation, it’s not something they’re really taught a lot about in school. I know they learn about world wars, but they don’t really know about the sacrifice people made.”UK marks VE Day 80th anniversary with large crowds and military pompRead moreHer husband, David Wilkinson, 73, a retired butcher who has lived on the street for 50 years, echoes a similar sentiment. He says: “It’s so important to remember all the people that have fought for this country, and a lot of them lost their lives. And to be fair, people on both sides, the Germans as well, they lost an awful lot of people.Wilkinson, whose father was in the Black Watch regiment, added: “I think everyone should think about everyone. The warshouldn’t have happened really, but unfortunately it did.”Gareth Mulreid, 45, who is visiting his parents on the street, believes occasions like this are becoming more important as time goes on. He says: “Now it’s getting older I’m realising we are going to get to a stage now where there won’t be anyone left from world war two.“I was born in 1980 – 35 years after world war two, which seems like not a long time really, in hindsight. So it’s a bit of a crazy thing to think it was that close to when I was born. It’s hard to imagine, but these people laid down their lives for people to be free today.Bev Craig, leader of Manchester city council, says: “As the decades go on and the second world war moves further from living memory, it makes it more important than ever that younger generations learn the lessons of history and keep alive the spirit of those who served our country.“This is why we have been keen as a council to encourage and facilitate street parties, community events and celebrations not just today but across the summer. From our planned civic commemorations to events in schools to today’s street parties, it’s great to see so many communities coming together to celebrate all that’s good about modern Manchester – that is what Manchester is all about.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Once “Operation Gideon’s Chariots” is under way, Israel will send its troops across much – if not all – ofGaza, and will seek to establish a “sustained presence” there, Israel officials said.Israeli officials are also talking openly about the displacement of Palestinians to southern Gaza, and their potential “voluntary” displacement from the territory altogether to allow the implementation of the reconstruction plan announced by the US president, Donald Trump, in January. The far-right Israeli finance minister,Bezalel Smotrich, told Israelis on Mondayto embrace the word “occupation”.All this will confirm many people’s long-held fears of Israel’s intentions in Gaza and prompt international outrage.The idea of a major new offensive in Gaza has been discussed and debated within the government and the upper ranks of the military for some months. So why has Israel’s government announced this plan so loudly? And why now?A key factor is the indirect talks being held with Hamas about a new ceasefire. The government of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, hopes that the Israel Defense Forces’ call-up of tens of thousands of reservists, the threat of the new offensive and the prospect of Israel seizing swaths of territory will force Hamas’s leaders to make concessions.If it fails to do so, then physical possession of terrain will offer useful leverage in future negotiations and allow Hamas to be squeezed further in the meantime. Israel’s twin war aims – to crush Hamas and free the 59 hostages it still holds – remain unchanged, though Netanyahu has signaled the former is the priority.Trump is due to visit the Middle East in 10 days, and Israeli officials said the offensive would start after the leader of their country’s most important ally had enjoyed the hospitality of Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar. Images of destruction and death from Gaza would make the president’s stay that much more diplomatically delicate. In reality, the complex logistics necessary to move and mobilise additional troops in Israel is likely to mean an even longer delay.Israel has also now gone public with its plan to allow some aid into Gaza, which has been brought to “the brink of catastrophe”, aid officials say, by two months of Israel’s tight blockade of food, fuel, medicine and everything else.The scheme involves creating big distribution sites run by private contractors in the south of Gaza, to which vetted representatives of each Palestinian family would travel to pick up food parcels. Israeli troops would guard the bases, likely to be situated in a vast zone up to 5km wide now being cleared along the border with Egypt.The scheme has been dismissed as unworkable, dangerous and potentially illegal under international law by leading humanitarian organisations. There has been no mention either of who might provide healthcare, sanitation, water, fuel and everything else necessary for life in the territory.Policy papers outlining and advocating the imposition of a military administration on Gaza have been circulating among senior officials in Israel for more than a year. Netanyahu continues to dismiss out of hand the possibility of the Palestinian Authority, which exercises partial authority in the occupied West Bank, governing the territory. Nor has he outlined any other kind of future political settlement in Gaza. The likely result, should the new offensive go ahead, would be that Israeli troops end up the de facto rulers of much of Gaza and its 2.3 million inhabitants.The Israeli prime minister also offers little to the majority of Israelis who call for a ceasefire deal to secure the release of the hostages. His coalition still depends heavily on the support of far-right parties who are very happy with the prospect of the new offensive and the prospect of a “sustained” Israeli presence in Gaza. Netanyahu now appears likely to remain in power for the 15 months or so until the next elections.More than 1,200 people died, mostly civilians, in the Hamas surprise raid into Israel in 2023 that triggered the war, and about 250 were taken prisoner, of whom 58 remain in Gaza. More than 52,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have died in the Israeli offensive there which followed.On Monday – among all the outrage and enthusiasm generated by Operation Gideon’s Chariots – the announcement that Israel’s security cabinet had decided not to establish “at this time”a state commission of inquiryinto the failures that allowed that attack to take place went almost unnoticed.Any inquiry should wait until the war has ended, Netanyahu told Israelis.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

Trump appears partly motivated byChina’s decision to limit imports of Hollywood filmsas part of its tit-for-tat trade war with the US, but a quota system into North America would appear, on the face of it, to be unworkable. Films are no longer manufactured objects that have to pass through a port of entry into the US, and their nationality of production is far from clear. Most film production – and indeed TV shows – are a complex patchwork of corporate investment, globally sourced labour and multinational revenue. Some are tiny, hand-to-mouth operations, others are gigantic behemoths whose turnover dwarfs the GDP of a minor island nation. Added to which, the digital evolution has allowed it to become a fully globalised industry that moves too fast to allow the imposition of consistent financial levies.1:04Donald Trump announces tariff on movies from 'other nations'  – videoHowever, Trump’s target does not appear to be foreign films per se, but rather the outsourcing of production by Hollywood studios who for decades have used overseas studios and locations to lower costs as well as take advantage of interesting or unusual backdrops. To take some random recent examples: the new Tom Cruise film Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning was mostly shot in the UK, at Longcross studios in Surrey and the Lake District, but also in Malta, Norway and South Africa, as well as an American aircraft carrier docked in Italy. Marvel’s new superhero blockbuster Thunderbolts* was filmed in Atlanta Georgia, but a key scene took place at Merdeka 118, a skyscraper in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and its score was recorded at Abbey Road studios in London.Revenue plays a large role in Hollywood thinking. While North America (comprising the US and Canada) remains the biggest single market,with around $8.8bn(£6.6bn) in box office takings in 2024, it is dwarfed by international income of around $21.1bn. It is capturing a significant proportion of this that has geared Hollywood to its internationalist thinking, from shooting in locales and casting actors designed to appeal to specific audiences, to continent-hopping global roll-outs with large-scale premieres taking place in different cities across the world.So the questions are being asked: what would make an individual movie incur tariffs? If it is released in cinemas (in which case expect a wholesale shift to streaming)? Would it include streaming releases (in which case a wholesale rebranding as “TV shows”?) And what would actually be taxed? Could an American-produced, (mostly) British-shot film such as Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire really incur import duty? Would distributors of non-American films have to pay a levy to release them in the US? In any case, if a film shows on streaming, consumers don’t pay directly to watch it, but for a subscription to a platform, so the idea of targeting an individual film’s streaming revenue appears meaningless.More pragmatically, Trump appears to be taking aim at the system of tax subsidies that allow Hollywood producers to accrue large sums if they shoot at studios in qualifying countries. It was recently revealed, for example, thatUniversal Studios received £89m from UK taxpayersafter agreeing to film Jurassic World: Rebirth in Elstree in Hertfordshire. This partly explains the decline in film production in Los Angeles – nearly 40% in the last decade, according to FilmLA – but the California film industry has also been under attack from other production centres in the US, where states such as New York and Georgia offer tax incentives. California governor Gavin Newsom, a regular target of Trump, recently announceda $750m schemeto try to reverse the industry decline in his state, and Trump’s announcement was in some ways clearly a shot across his bows afterNewsom filed a lawsuit in Aprilagainst Trump’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA) to impose tariffs in other industries.The current thinking is that Trump’s most realistic optionis to levy a tariff on any financial packages a film receives from a foreign government, rather than tax cinema tickets or streaming subscriptions. However, the effect of any tariff is likely to be dramatic.Recent figures from the British Film Institute (BFI)show that in 2024 £4.8bn($6.37bn) of production spend on film and high-end TV in the UK came from international sources, 86% of the total spent on film and TV made in Britain. In Australia,the film industry stands to lose up to AUS$767m.A programme of studio building in the UK, designed to increase capacity and therefore revenue, is likely to feel the chill almost immediately. And the effect on the domestic industry in the US is forecast to be adverse, as production costs rise without the injection of overseas tax incentives, with mid-level projects potentially wiped out.But whether,as Newsom suggests, this is all a “distraction”, or if this announcement turns into something more solid, a shocked film industry is waiting to find out.Explore more on these topicsFilmFilm industryTariffsDonald TrumpTrump tariffsanalysisShareReuse this content"

If only they hadn’t wheeled out a naked old woman …Lucy ManganMon 5 May 2025 17.00 EDTShareWell, here’s a tricksy little proposition! What happens when you give a television studio audience a prize pot of £250,000 to share equally among themselves, then tell them that all they’ve got to do to get it is remain silent (any words, gasps, laughs, exclamations will lose them £5,000 or £10,000, depending on the size of the transgression) while the show throws various acts at them precisely designed to elicit such responses?You get Silence is Golden, that’s what – an unexpectedly entertaining, unexpectedly nerve-jangling foray into the repression of all natural instincts in the face of relentless temptation. Presenter duties are in the safe hands of Dermot O’Leary, who both introduces the guests (the main ones in the episode available for review are comediansKatherine Ryan, Seann Walsh and Fatiha El-Ghorri) and tries to trick the audience – who are individually miked and being monitored on cameras – into making the usual whoops and cheers that typically accompany such a show.Is it a rip off of Prime Video’s hit Last One Laughing (comedians trying to make each other laugh in front of Jimmy Carr), the UK’s adaptation of Documental, the Japanese hit created by Hitoshi Matsumoto? Or is it a wholly coincidental invention arising from our universal understanding that an injunction against laughing in church is the fastest way to ensure we do just that? We may never know.Australian comic, singer and drag artist Reuben Kaye is the first challenge to the audience’s quarter-of-a-million-pound crown, and his act is near the knuckle enough on several occasions (he says “My erection is audible” as he stands in front of a handsome bloke who does very well to keep his counsel) to draw £30,000 worth of gasps and laughs).He also identifies the weak link – possibly the weakest link there’s ever been in the history of gameshows – in the audience. That weak link is called Will. Will likes to laugh. Will, it becomes clearer and clearer, was born to laugh. If you concentrate on making him laugh, he will laugh. If you concentrate your attentions elsewhere, he will laugh. He costs the audience a fortune. They are – silently, but very powerfully – livid. Dermot wonders if they should start looking for a security escort to take him home. Will laughs. Will shouldn’t.Fortunately, the group’s focus is pulled from this threat to their finances by a new set of villains: those who shout out in response to Dermot’s offers of cash and gifts to enrich themselves personally at the expense of the group’s pot. Absolutely fiendish. Chief fiend is Lorenzo, who does it multiple times and looks unfazed by his decisions and the fact that if looks could kill, he would have been bleeding out in the aisle before he had finished the first “Yes, please!” and pocketed the inaugural £200. I haven’t seen the like sinceNasty Nick made his move25 years ago (yes, sorry) in the first series of Big Brother. It’s quite thrilling in a way. A way that suggests I need to get out more, or that the next series of Traitors needs to hurry up and get here because I have appetites that need slaking.Ryan does some comedy, but her main turn is threatening a couple’s dog. The couple remain silent, knowing there is no chance that a TV production will let anything happen to their pet. I mean no disrespect to the mighty Ryan here, but I have absolutely no doubt that if the cameras were not there, or if Ryan’s own personal finances were involved, that dog would be in a sandwich the moment the first £5,000 was lost.The final segment identifies the strongest (Deborah) and the weakest (Will, obviously) performer in the audience and one is randomly selected to face the final challenge – but it’s Will. The remaining prize money is frozen and he will win or lose it all for the group if he can just survive one minute of jokes-and-anything-else-that-might-work onslaught from previous acts. No spoilers, but Lorenzo – you’d better start sleeping with one eye open.I’m not a big fan of the bit where they bring on a naked old lady to try to winkle out laughs or exclamations of disgust as she makes her way into the audience, but other than that it’s all good, clean, harmless fun. Probably. No, I’m sure Lorenzo will be fine.Silence is Golden is on U&DaveExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionDermot O'LearyKatherine RyanreviewsShareReuse this content"

But is this the point of no return?Graeme VirtueMon 5 May 2025 17.05 EDTLast modified on Mon 5 May 2025 18.16 EDTShareThis article contains spoilers for theThe Last of Usseason two. Please do not read unless you have seen episodes one to four.It’s natural to think of Ellie (Bella Ramsey) as the most direct character inThe Last of Us. Her immunity to the infection that has everyone else on edge combined with the inherent rebelliousness of a 19-year-old means she is rarely the most tactful of speakers. But sometimes it is Ellie’s incorrigible crush Dina (Isabela Merced) who gets straight to the point. As the pair gaze up at the grisly sight of bodies strung up with their intestines ripped out, Dina makes a very salient observation: “What the fuck is wrong with Seattle?”It’s certainly not been a very relaxing city break. At the end of last week’s instalment, Ellie and Dina (and Shimmer the horse) were moseying into Seattle expecting minimal resistance as they continued to hunt down Abby (Kaitlyn Dever) and her Washington Liberation Front (WLF) cohort. By the end of episode four, the pair have gatecrashed an escalating conflict between the WLF and the mysterious Seraphites cult, triggered a horde of infected in a claustrophobic rail tunnel and – perhaps scariest of all – spilled their guts to each other. At least there was time out for a Radio 1 Live Lounge-style acoustic cover. But it all starts with a flashback.Enter IsaacView image in fullscreen‘Make your choice’ … Jeffrey Wright (left) with Alanna Ubach post-grenade launch.Photograph: HBO/Home Box OfficeWe begin in the Seattle Quarantine Zone in 2018, trapped in the back of an armoured truck crammed with Fedra soldiers in riot gear. One is telling a long-winded anecdote packed with off-colour jokes about a community policing incident that ended in brutal violence (from season one, we know that Fedra spearheaded the official response to the outbreak but soon became a self-serving authoritarian force). The squad’s imposingly bearded sergeant Isaac Dixon (Jeffrey Wright) does not seem to see the funny side.When the Fedra vehicle is surrounded by unarmed locals, Isaac opts to go to talk to them alone, only taking a single raw recruit for backup. But this seems to be a prearranged meeting with a woman named Hanrahan (Alanna Ubach). Isaac is clearly looking to switch allegiances, and he underlines his point by tossing a couple of grenades into the back of the truck, killing his entire troop except for the panicked rookie. “Now make your choice,” Isaac growls at him.View image in fullscreenHoled up in a record store … Isabela Merced as a lovestruck Dina.Photograph: HBO/Home Box OfficeCut back to the present-day – 11 years later – and after a fruitless search for supplies in a pharmacy, Ellie and Dina are clopping through Seattle’s Capitol Hill district, trying to intuit what all the faded rainbow flags symbolise. When they spot WLF graffiti on top of a TV station, Ellie’s first instinct is to charge in all guns blazing. But the more strategic Dina suggests waiting until dark, and the pair (and Shimmer) hole up in a dusty record store. It’s there that Ellie discovers a relatively pristine acoustic guitar and starts playing a-ha’sTake on Me, a heartfelt rendition that moves Dina to tears. “All those lessons from Joel,” muses Ellie. He may have prioritised teaching her survival skills, but passing on a love of music is a sweeter way to remember him.Kitchen confidentialView image in fullscreen‘Strange benefits of the apocalypse’ …Isaac does a skin-searing interrogation.Photograph: HBO/Home Box OfficeWe cut to Isaac, still bearded but somehow looking even more burdened than in the opening flashback, as he potters at a gas stove. He rhapsodises about the high-quality Mauviel copper pans he has accrued (“The strange benefits of the apocalypse”) but this is not a cooking demonstration. Isaac has a naked, maimed man shackled to the wall and is in the process of interrogating him with a skin-searingly hot pan. We learn the name of the shaven-headed, whistling cult we first saw inepisode three: the Seraphites, nicknamed “Scars” by the WLF. The two factions have been at war since the fracturing of a previous truce and while Isaac’s side has the technological upper hand, it sounds as if the Scars are winning the psychological battle, attracting disillusioned WLF soldiers to their cause. Despite being horribly tortured, the Seraphite does not give up any intel. Isaac concludes the interrogation with a single gunshot. It’s not the most sympathetic of portrayals, although it does paint Isaac as a weary pragmatist rather than a sadist.Night movesView image in fullscreenRevenge mode … Bella Ramsey as Ellie.Photograph: HBO/Home Box OfficeUnder cover of darkness, Ellie and Dina infiltrate the TV station and discover that the WLF troops there have been killed, their mutilated bodies on deliberate display in the main studio. While Dina is throwing up, Ellie follows a blood trail and discovers the Seraphites have signed their work with an all-caps exhortation to “feel her love”, presumably a reference to their late prophet. Dina scoops up a WLF radio but it’s not long before a backup squad of soldiers arrives.Outnumbered and outgunned, our heroes attempt to slip away but end up engaging (we get to see Ellie do some of the martial-arts moves she was honing inepisode one). The only viable escape route is into a gloomy transit tunnel that looks like territory claimed by the infected. What follows is another headlong action sequence, atmospherically lit by the WLF’s fizzling red emergency flares. As an agitated horde bashes at the windows of a tilted train carriage, Ellie and Dina hustle through the interior, clambering up through an emergency hatch in the nick of time. But a rusty exit turnstile looks like it will be Dina’s downfall as a rabid clicker catches up to her. To Dina’s horror, Ellie jams her arm through the turnstile and takes the bite instead.No more secretsView image in fullscreenSceptical … Isabela Merced as Dina.Photograph: HBO/Home Box OfficeThey have escaped the WLF and the infected but at what cost? As they shelter in a nearby theatre, Dina keeps her gun fixed on Ellie, expecting her to turn at any moment. That’s when Ellie reveals her immunity, explaining that she has been bitten before and has been fine. Dina is understandably sceptical but after a few tense hours have passed and Ellie still seems to be Ellie, she shares a secret of her own: “I’m pregnant.” Perhaps because of these heightened emotions – or their recent near-death experiences – Ellie and Dina finally make a non-drunken physical connection, making out passionately on the floor.The next morning the young couple open up about everything over some breakfast beef jerky. Ellie shows Dina the previous bite on her arm, subsequently disguised by a burn scar and then a tattoo. Dina tips out the multiple pregnancy tests she lifted from the pharmacy at the opening of the episode: every one has a positive result. Her stoic ex Jesse (Young Mazino) is the father but as Ellie puts it, only half jokingly: “I’m gonna be a dad.”During this intimate conversation, their original mission to get payback for Joel’s murder feels a million miles away. But that’s when the WLF radio crackles into life, and they hear mention of Nora, one of Abby’s allies, being directed to a hospital in the middle of a war zone. Ellie snaps back into revenge mode. It feels like a pivotal moment, especially when Dina takes Ellie’s hand and says they’ll do it together. Season two is only seven episodes long so we have just passed the halfway stage. But is it also going to be the point of no return?Notes and observationsThe soldier telling the long-winded story in the opening flashback was played by Josh Peck, familiar to US audiences as one of the teen stars of 00s Nickelodeon sitcom Drake & Josh. He also popped up inOppenheimerin 2023.Take on Mepreviously featured in anotable flashback episode of season one. That was where we learned the fate of Ellie’s first love so the song may hold a special meaning for her.Debuting The Last of Us director Kate Herron has previous experience of abrupt time jumps: she directed the entire first season ofLoki.If the hacked-open WLF bodies hanging from the roof seemed horribly realistic, it’s probably because they were actual stuntmen in harnesses rather than dummies. That’s just one intriguing revelation in thisbehind-the-scenes featurette.A shoutout to Ryan Masson, the young actor who played the naked prisoner tortured by Isaac. He made a huge impact in a single scene; his bloodied but unbowed devotion made the Seraphites cult seem genuinely terrifying.What did you think? What are your hopes for the rest of season two? Will Shimmer the horse be OK in that record shop?

Sotheby’s, by holding the auction, was “participating in continued colonial exploitation”, it added.The ministry insisted on the immediate cessation of the auction, saying the gem relics “constitute inalienable religious and cultural heritage of India and the global Buddhist community”.It also called on Sotheby’s and Chris Peppé to issue a public apology to the Indian government and Buddhists worldwide, and for the full disclosure of all provenance documents and any other relics in the possession of William Peppé’s heirs or transferred by them to any other entity or individual.Failure to comply would result in legal proceedings in Indian andHong Kongcourts and through international bodies “for violations of cultural heritage laws”, the letter warned.The ministry added that it would launch a public campaign highlighting Sotheby’s role “in perpetuating colonial injustice and becoming a party to [the] unethical sale of religious relics”.View image in fullscreenThe Piprahwa gems.Photograph: Sotheby’sThe gems include amethysts, coral, garnets, pearls, rock crystals, shells and gold, either worked into pendants, beads and other ornaments, or in their natural form.They were originally buried in a dome-shaped funerary monument, called a stupa, in Piprahwa, in present-day Uttar Pradesh, India, on about 240-200BC, when they were mixed with some of the cremated remains of the Buddha, who died about 480BC.The British crown claimed Peppé’s find under the 1878 Indian Treasure Trove Act, and the bones and ash were given to the Buddhist monarch King Chulalongkorn of Siam.Most of the 1,800 gems went to what is now the Indian Museum in Kolkata. Peppé was permitted to retain approximately a fifth of them, which were described as “duplicates” of some of the others.On the matter of the gems’ provenance and ownership, the ministry’s letter noted that under the Buddhist religion, materials in sacred funerary mounds are “sacred grave goods … inseparable from the sacred relics and cannot be commodified.“We beg to note that the relics of the Buddha cannot be treated as ‘specimens’ but as the sacred body and originally interred offerings to the sacred body of the Buddha.”The ministry added that the sellers, who describe themselves as custodians of the gems “had no right to alienate or misappropriate the asset … an extraordinary heritage of humanity where custodianship would include not just safe upkeep but also an unflinching sentiment of veneration towards these relics”.Its letter said the proposed auction “offends the sentiments of over 500 million Buddhists worldwide”, violated ethics and disrupted sacred tradition.Peppé, who wrote a piece for Sotheby’sabout his family’s custodianship of the gems, has been contacted for comment.He previously told the Guardian that the “Piprahwa gems were relic offerings made at the time of the reinterment of the Buddha’s ashes over 200 years after his passing. I have not found any Buddhists who claim the gems are corporeal remains.”With regards to his and his two relatives’ right to sell the gems, he added: “Legally, the ownership is unchallenged.”Sotheby’s has been contacted for comment. It previously told the Guardian that it has conducted “requisite due diligence”, including in relation to provenance and legality.The Indian ministry of culture’s Instagram post stated that “Sotheby’s has responded to the legal notice with the assurance that full attention is being given to this matter.”Explore more on these topicsBuddhismIndiaHong KongSouth and central AsiaColonialismReligionnewsShareReuse this content"

Do you need special equipment? How do you know if you’re doing it right? What are the basics you need to master before you can take your practice to the next level?In the seriesHow to start, we ask experts to break down how to start, well, anything – including weightlifting, running, dating and talking to strangers.How to start runningView image in fullscreenRun for short periods, then walk to recover – this makes the workout more manageable.Illustration: Carmen Casado/The GuardianWhy start running?Running requires very minimal equipment to get started: just a pair of shoes. And it can start with walking; experts suggest working up to spending upwards of an hour walking.Four tips to get started:Alternate running and walking.Run for short periods, then walk to recover – this makes the workout more manageable. Over time, you can increase the period of time running, and aim to take fewer walking breaks.Avoid running too fast or too much.Keep a conversational pace, where you can talk and run at the same time and be sure to take time off as your body adjusts to the new routine.Get good running shoes.Buying in-person is best, especially if you can visit a running store where you can get properly fitted and try a wide variety of shoes.Don’t push yourself to run as long and far as you can.It can be draining and lead to injury.Next up:consistency is more important than running for a set number of days or at a particular pace. Enjoying the exercise is just as important. Add weight training to improve your muscles, and find a community to build your practice.How to start runningHow to start weightliftingView image in fullscreenTrying bodyweight exercises like to build a foundation of strength.Illustration: Carmen Casado/The GuardianWhy start lifting?Strength training is for anyone and research shows that it can also be essential to health and longevity, with the benefits including stronger bones and an increased metabolism.To get started, experts suggest first trying bodyweight exercises like squats, pushups, lunges and planks to build a foundation of strength.Qualified personal trainers can help with proper form, but a no-cost alternative would be reference to instructional videos online that break down each exercise. If hiring a trainer, be sure to find someone with certifications from reputable organizations – influencers may be fit, but they are not always knowledgeable.Four tips to get started:Machines at the gymare useful for beginners, as their fixed positioning can help beginners understand the movement patterns of each exercise.Start with lighter weight.Move to heavier weights when you have good form and feel comfortable progressing. At the end of 10 reps, if youcouldmanage two or three more, that’s a good weight to work with.Track your progress weeklyand don’t overdo it. Give your body time to rest between sessions. For beginner lifters, two to three sessions a week is usually plenty.Eat properly to fuel your workouts.Here’s how toget enough proteinto help build muscle – 1.2 gms of protein per kg of body weight is a good rule of thumb, says Dr Andrew Jagim, director of sports medicine research at the Mayo Clinic Health System.To level up:progressive overload – making your workout a little more difficult each session – will ensure you’re making progress over time. Without it, your body will adapt, and your muscles won’t continue to grow.How to start weightliftingHow to start therapyView image in fullscreenTherapy can be an effective way to address a range of concerns.Illustration: Carmen Casado/The GuardianWhy start going to a therapist?There are many reasons to seek out therapy, including feeling stuck or getting diagnosed with mental illness. It can be an effective way to address a range of concerns.Three tips to get started:Find a therapist.Google “psychotherapist near me” or connect with close, trusted friends to find an accredited professional.Figure out how you’ll pay for it.In the US, if you have insurance, the first challenge is often finding someone in-network and covered by insurance. Try asking your insurance company for a list of providers in your area.Start with an initial consultation.Many therapists offer free 15-minute phone consultations and experts recommend doing a full session with a potential provider so you can see how they work.Next up:you might need to try several therapists to find the best fit. Be picky – it’s an important relationship, and it can take time to find the right one.How to start therapyHow to start datingView image in fullscreenEstablish your own values and priorities before jumping into dating.Illustration: Carmen Casado/The GuardianWhy start dating?Experts say finding a partner takes time and effort – but there’s plenty of room for fun, too.Five tips to get started:Date yourself first.Establish your own values and priorities before jumping into dating, to better understand what you’re looking for.Use the apps.While there are three main ways to date – online, in person or via set up – dedicated apps and sites are the easiest way to meet the greatest number of people.Take good photos and make a thoughtful profile.Create a unique profile that highlights your interests and personality. Include six current pictures, with a mix of face and body shots.Chat – but not for too long.Aim for 15 minutes, twice a day, to chat – but don’t waste your time with people who aren’t engaged.Try a walk, drinks or coffee.Dinner is a big investment; instead, start small. Consider a walking date: it’s relaxed and offers flexibility if the date is going well to add drinks or dinner.Date a lot:Experts encourage dating multiple people at once as a way of keeping your options open and not slipping into a scarcity mindset that leads you to ignore red flags.How to start datingskip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, experts say tracking your finances can reduce stress and “you can start to pinpoint where money is going for your own happiness”, says Robin Snell, a certified financial planner and founder of Nested Financial and Tax Planning.Three tips to get started:Track every penny for 30 to 90 days.Taking stock of your spending means you can then redirect where your money goes.Be aware of three common budgeting challenges.People tend to fall into one of three buckets: they don’t earn enough income; they earn enough, but have high fixed expenses and need to cut back; or they have enough income, but are waylaid by poor spending habits but can improve through behavioral changes.Pay off high interest debt first.Any credit card debt or any debt with an interest rate of more than 7% should be paid off first. Then set specific financial goals – like saving for a car – and aim to save between 10 to 20% of your overall income.Next up:Making and sticking to a financial plan is the secret to longterm success. Start by automating as much of the process as possible: for example, setting aside a fixed dollar amount in different bank accounts for vacations, a future home or an emergency fund.How to start a budgetHow to start meditatingView image in fullscreenMeditation helps reduce anxiety, depression, insomnia and improves gut health among other benefits.Illustration: Carmen Casado/The GuardianWhy start meditation?Among the manybenefits of meditationare reduced anxiety, depression, insomnia and improved gut health, according to studies.There’s no set duration of time for meditation and it doesn’t require anything other than your own mind (and perhaps a timer – so you’re not wondering how much time has passed).Three tips to get started:Start small and stay consistent.Whether it’sfive minutes or 15 minutes, the best meditation is the one you’ll do.Sit comfortably, with your back upright.Rest your hands where comfortable, with eyes open or closed (if open, rest your gaze on a spot somewhere on the floor in front of you).Notice your thoughts, emotions and breath.As you settle in, notice your thoughts, emotions and breath. When your thoughts stray, notice it, let go of the thought and return to your breath.Make it a habit:To make it stick, look for in-person or online meditation communities; try podcasts, books and apps; or consider a guide. Meditation comes in many forms, including walking meditation and loving-kindness meditation. Find what works for you.How to start meditatingHow to start a conversation with a strangerView image in fullscreenKeep good eye contact, map out topic ideas in advance, and know that casual conversation is about finding connection.Illustration: Carmen Casado/The GuardianWhy start a conversation?We’re social creatures. Studies show small interactions with those around us can make us happier and more connected.When chatting with a stranger, keep good eye contact, map out topic ideas in advance, and know that casual conversation isn’t about being cool – it’s about finding connection.Three tips to get started:Ask questions– and don’t worry if they’re not unique and incisive.Don’t knock small talk.It can help you figure out what you have in common with the other person, but steer away from the common pitfall topics (politics, religion, sex).Know when and how to exit.Be mindful of your conversation partner’s body language and responses – if you’re doing all the work to maintain the chit chat, it might be a sign they’re not interested.Next up:Conversation is a skill. Like any, it takes practice. The line at a coffee shop or grocery store is an opportunity to chat with strangers.How to start a conversationHow to start reducing your carbon footprintView image in fullscreenThe effects of climate change are apparent all over the world.Illustration: Carmen Casado/The GuardianWhy start considering your environmental impact? The effects of climate change are apparent all over the world. 2024 was the hottest year on record. Average global temperatures rose to 1.6C above preindustrial levels, according to data from theEU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service(C3S).“Everyone has an impact,” says Darby Hoover, senior resource specialist at the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). “Corporations are made up of individuals, states are made up of individuals. We need action at all levels.” Start small and don’t worry about perfection. Walking instead of driving, or cutting your food waste are small changes that count.Three tips to get started:Remember the three Rs.Reducing consumption is the most important, then reusing and then recycling items.Eat more plants.Meat has an extremely high resource impact on the environment, but the most sustainable way to eat is the way that is sustainable for you. It’s better to consistently reduce your intake of animal products, than go cold turkey.Cut energy waste.Unplugging devices and turning off power strips when they’re not in use is an easy way to save energy.Next up:While all the above can help you reduce your environmental impact, experts agree that the most consequential action is using your voice to talk to community members about climate, and to vote for candidates who are strong on environmental policies in local and federal elections.How to start reducing your carbon footprintExplore more on these topicsWell actuallyHow to startRunningfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But have some become just too seedy? Our writer checks inOliver WainwrightMon 5 May 2025 11.09 EDTLast modified on Mon 5 May 2025 11.24 EDTShareDo whales make you horny? How about UFOs? Maybe you’ve always dreamed of having a tryst in a fairytale castle, or making love inside a gigantic biscuit tin? Whatever your weird fantasy may be, it can probably be catered for on a roadside somewhere in Japan, ifa new bookon the curious phenomenon of love hotels is anything to go by.French photographer François Prost has been on a 3,000km pilgrimage of passion, driving from Utsunomiya, north of Tokyo, to the island of Shikoku in the south, to document Japan’s unique architecture of furtive liaisons. What he found spans from manga-embellished motels and Christmas-themed love nests to pastel-hued stage sets worthy of Wes Anderson. And some things stranger than your most eccentric kinks could dream of.Some of the reviews don’t inspire confidence. ‘I found a pillow with dried semen,’ reads one“I find love hotels culturally fascinating,” says Prost, whose previous projects have included photographing thefacades of strip clubs in the USandnightclubs in Ivory Coast. “Japan is generally a fairly conservative society, but these are places of escapism, fantasy and almost childlike wonder. And you find them everywhere.”Estimates vary, but some put the number of love hotels – orrabu hoteru– in the country as high as 37,000. They pop up in city centres and rural villages, at busy highway junctions and secluded among fields in the middle of nowhere. As Prost’s photographs show vividly, they come in all shapes, sizes and stylistic genres.View image in fullscreenSea Stork Hotel, Machida, Tokyo prefecture, 2023.Photograph: François ProstSome are modelled on castles, topped with pink crenelations and turquoise turrets. Some look like alpine chalets, others like tiki huts, while plenty are modelled on cruise ships, promising to take you on a voyage to love paradise. Whether French chateaux get your juices flowing or you have a penchant for Arabian onion domes, there’s a place waiting for you to be greeted by an anonymous receptionist, pay for akyukei, or “rest”, and live out your carnal dreams.While most of the buildings in Prost’s book date from the 1960s onwards, the Japanese love hotel has its origins as far back as the 1600s. They began to emerge during the Edo period, in the form of discreet establishments known asdeai chaya, or lovers’ teahouses, where couples could meet away from the prying family gaze.They looked like regular teahouses from the outside, but were designed with secretive entrances and multiple exits, and – crucially, for a shoes-off-at-the-door society – somewhere for customers to hide their footwear so as not to be identified.View image in fullscreenWorthy of Wes Anderson … Hotel Flower Style in Nara.Photograph: François ProstBy the early 20th-century Shōwa era, these teahouses had transformed into themed, colourful places that offered a sense of escape from the daily routine. Japan’s postwar economic boom saw love hotels blossom into elaborate sexual amusement parks in the 1970s and 80s, with themes ranging from fairytale to sci-fi to medieval cosplay.The country’s high population density, small apartment sizes and tradition of living at home until marriage helped fuel the appetite for places for people to meet in private. Some have also put love hotels’ continuing success down to thesexual liberation of women in Japan, sometimes highlighting the cute, cartoonish nature of the decor – designed to feel safe and inviting, rather than tacky and sordid.Quite different from seedy pay-by-the-hour motels elsewhere in the world, love hotels aim to cater to everyone. In his 2005 book,Law in Everyday Japan, legal scholar Mark D West estimated that Japanese couples make more than half a billion trips to love hotels each year, suggesting that as much as half of all sexual intercourse in Japan could be taking place in these establishments. In turn, that would mean that a good deal of the country’s population were conceived on a rotating bed, in a beshackled boudoir, or inside a fantastical tropical grotto surrounded by model dinosaurs.View image in fullscreenHotel LaLa Resort, Kobe, Hyogo Prefecture.Photograph: François ProstProst’s photographs don’t take you inside the bedrooms (there are other books for that), but instead focus on the exterior iconography of the hotels. Far from fading into the background, they stand as loud roadside billboards, designed to be easily identifiable by libidinous couples at a glance from a moving vehicle.Who could miss the Hotel Artia Dinosaur, which rises on the corner of a highway intersection in Machida city near Tokyo, crowned with a huge T rex? A tableau of a Jeep being crushed by a velociraptor at the entrance sets the tone. Online reviews warn that the bedroom doors lock automatically once you’re inside, and you have to call reception to be let out – a feature common to love hotels, but here adding an extra frisson of danger, in tune with the Jurassic Park-inspired theme.Or might you live out your Moby-Dick fantasy at the huge pink concrete whale of Hotel Festa Qugiela, in Okayama, which waits ready to swallow you inside its grinning mouth? Or embrace the kinky King Kong spirit at the LaLa Resort in Kobe? It features a massive gorilla climbing up its bright red and orange-striped facade, and a model tiger keeping watch over the underground car park (a common feature so punters can be shuttled directly to their rooms).View image in fullscreenHotel UFO, Chiba Prefecture.Photograph: François Prost“The hotels are often designed so you don’t have to cross paths with anyone else,” says Prost. “You can go straight from your car into a lift going up, and there is always a separate lift to go back down, to avoid bumping into people. A lot of the hotels don’t even have receptionists any more – you book online, or choose your room from an automatic vending machine.”The faded decor and tatty appearance of many of the establishments makes you wonder if love hotels are becoming a thing of the past. A lot of them have the forlorn look of semi-abandoned amusement parks, with flaking paintwork and sun-bleached signage. And some of the online reviews don’t inspire much confidence.Who could resist the lure of Shibuya’s Sweets Hotel, a pink battenberg fantasy dripping with huge slices of cake, cookies and plastic icing? It turns out those aren’t the only treats on offer. “I found a pillow with dried semen,” reads one review. “The walls and doors were covered in scratch marks,” says another, “more fitting for a murder hotel than a love hotel.” “This place is gone now,” adds the most recent entry. “Too bad.”View image in fullscreenChapel Christmas, Narita Chiba PrefecturePhotograph: François ProstDespite some seedy failures, Prost says that love hotels are still just as popular as ever, and they are evolving to keep up with changing habits. “Nowadays, many young people go to love hotels to have parties,” he says. “They have karaoke machines, big TVs, massage chairs and hot tubs – people rent them in groups for a few hours.”TheBali An group, for example, offers big rooms forjoshi-kai, or girls’ nights out, complete with bars, 75in TVs and eight-person beds. The rooms also come with hammocks and camping equipment. After castles, cruise ships and cartoons, glamping appears to be the latest love hotel design trend, so you can sample the romance of the great outdoors without venturing outside.Love Hotelis out now.

It has a power that’s beyond us. We’re just the vessels’Interviews byRich PelleyMon 5 May 2025 10.29 EDTLast modified on Mon 5 May 2025 12.16 EDTShareCrispian Mills, singerIt’s not our song; it’s as old as the hills. The first time I heard it was in a Krishna temple as a kid. George Harrison was the first person I know of who recorded it – it’s the last track on 1971’sThe Radha Krsna Temple album. We were all living together as a band in Swiss Cottage, London, and that record got played all the time. So I had it absorbed.The first time we played our version was at Glastonbury festival in 1993. We’d smuggled ourselves in, in the back of somebody’s van, then blagged our way on to the stage in the Hare Krishna free food tent, which seemed appropriate. The arrangement with the droning chords and the chant in the middle pretty much happened on the spot. We continued to play it every night at every show for two years until we got a proper record deal.It’s not just a song: it’s a doorway into thousands of years of tradition with the promise of spiritual adventureIt’s one of those songs that continues to evolve and surprise you however many times you play it. It’s not just a song. It’s a doorway into thousands of years of tradition, woven with philosophy, ontology and history encapsulating the promise of spiritual adventure.We’re still discovering things now, because of the song’s origins. You have to have a mood of service towards it because it belongs to the world. It’s one of those songs where the band are getting as much benefit as the audience.As for the lyrics: Sanskrit is often called “the language of the gods”. Why on earth would you not want to try that in a pop song? Govinda is one of the “intimate” names of God, which translates as “reservoir of pleasure”. On the whole, any of the names with the prefix “Go” (meaning “cow”), like Gopal or Govinda, glorifies Sri Krishna’s youthful time as the divine cowherd, who protects the cows, plays his magic flutes in enchanted forests and steals the hearts of heavenly milk-maidens.It always got a reaction live. There was never a beige response. One of the turning points was when we were touring our debut album, K, to a sold-out show in Blackburn in front of 2,500 people in various states of intoxication with their arms in the air, singing this ancient spiritual folk song. I thought to myself: “God, we’re not in control of this, are we? This has got a life of its own.” It was the perfect, miraculous convergence of sublime and ridiculousness, and that’s what pop music should be.Alonza Bevan, bassistWe were playing around the north London Camden scene but also going out to the West Country and playing to a very different, often very hippy crowd. Our drummer is from near Glastonbury, so if we could play Glastonbury Assembly Rooms alongside some psychedelic sitar player, we’d jump at the opportunity.We’d always loved the hippy music of the 60s and 70s, and had been equally fascinated by Indian classical music and eastern mysticism. A friend introduced us to the Bengali musicians who ended up playing on Govinda, who were a Hindu family from east London.Govinda always feels fresh. We always finish live sets with itWe worked with John Leckie, who had produced the first Stone Roses album and before that, this brilliant psychedelic record by the Dukes of the Stratosphear. The verse is repetitive but we’d been listening to the George Harrison version for months, so it was quite easy to get down. There’s lots of the tambura – the four-string sitar from Indian classical and folk music that gives the droning sound – and the tabla (the hand drums) all over the record. We had to remember that we were still these whitey westerners, laying down our groove.It was great to get a song that’s entirely in Sanskrit on Radio 1, although I think most people saw it as one of those gimmicky songs. I remember people at early gigs shouting the lyrics as: “Go cash your giro giro.”Some old songs you get tired of playing live, but Govinda always feels fresh, so we always finish live sets with it. It has a power that’s beyond us; we’re just the vessels. All we have to do is play and let the universe do the rest of the work.Kula Shaker are performing atChalfest, Stroud, 18-19 July, andLakefest, Eastnor Castle, 6-10 AugustExplore more on these topicsPop and rockHow we madeHinduismReligionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

New.Appearance:Dead tough.Unattractively short eyelashes? I’m finally in vogue!Steady on, hotshot. Are your eyelashes naturally short?Unfortunately, yes.Then I’m afraid it doesn’t count. If you want true stubby lashes, you have to have them shaved off by a hairdresser.With an electric razor?That’s right. A loud and terrifying electric razor, held millimetres from your eyeball. Some people prefer scissors.I don’t think this is for me.Then you’re missing out. All the cool kids are doing it.All the cool kids?Well, technically all the extraordinarily fragile men who think minimal eyelashes make them look a lot more masculine – but let’s go with cool kids.And this is actually happening?Oh yes. A TikTok video advocating the practice went viral recently, and nowthe trend has been reportedeverywhere from Turkey to New Zealand. It’s definitely a thing.But aren’t eyelashes, you know, important?So important. They are filters that keep rainwater and debris out of your eyes, preventing irritation and infection. They also function as whiskers, alerting the eye when objects get too close, and triggering an involuntary blink.Sowhy shave them off?Because long eyelashes are perceived as “feminine”. And by that metric, we can also assume that eyeballs that aren’t permanently infected are also feminine.But aren’t long eyelashessupposed to be attractive?Yes! There are even fan sites rhapsodising overRobert Pattinson’s “killer lashes”. Then again, one small study found thatlonger eyelashes were more attractive on women than on men.So stubby lashes work for the people who do trim them, right?No!One Facebook useron a thread about the practice said: “It felt like I was going blind,” adding: “From experience if you shave them you’ll get a ton of eye boogers 0/10 do not recommend.”So then …Look, I don’t know what to tell you. There’s a weird brand ofultra-masculine “looksmaxxing”at the moment, for vain men who want to optimise their sexual market value. And have you heard ofmewing? It’s where you walk about with your tongue jammed to the roof of your mouth to give you a better jawline. There’s also chin surgery, Botox and tooth-whitening. Stubby lashes are just the next logical step.I hate to point out the obvious, but …But by focusing on painful and expensive body-altering practices, these men are ultimately just falling into the same spiral of insecurity that women have worked for centuries to escape?Yes, exactly that.So the real message is that shaved eyelashes might make you look more masculine, but getting them shaved is as feminine as you can get.It must be so exhausting to be male.Honestly, you have no idea.Do say:“Hot for spring/summer 2025: stubby lashes.”Don’t say:“Also hot for spring/summer 2025:weeping blepharitis.”Explore more on these topicsFashionPass notesMen's fashionBeautyMen's facial hairfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The university’s health faculty in Rome has close ties with Gemelli.“Thank you for the service in hospital, it was very good, keep it up,” Francis told the group, before turning to Becalli and adding: “When women are in charge, things go well!”It was not the first time Francis had publicly praised the role of women, and throughout his 12-year papacy he made strides in boosting the female workforce in the Vatican while appointing several women into the top echelons of its governance. He also gave women the right to voteduring synods, the periodic Vatican summits involving the world’s bishops.But in other areas, whether it be the handling of accusations of clerical abuse of nuns or his repeated assertions that women could never become priests, Francis leaves behind a disparate legacy.That women are still mostly passive participants in the church was made clear by their absence during his funeral mass in St Peter’s Square among the mourners filling the seats surrounding the altar and front rows on the side of the pulpit reserved for Catholic church leaders.View image in fullscreenA nun looks out of a window before the funeral ceremony of Pope Francis at Saint Peter’s Square in the Vatican on 26 April.Photograph: Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto/REX/ShutterstockInstead, nuns stood among crowds of pilgrims and tourists, mostly making do with following the service on TV screens.Meanwhile, the theme of women has so far been missing from the discussion among cardinals as they share visions for the future of the church during their daily pre-conclave meetings, at least according to briefings given to the press by a Vatican official.But as the men prepare to enter the Sistine Chapel to elect a new pope on Wednesday, all the while capturing the world’s attention, a team of women will be working behind the scenes to support them.In a mission led by the sisters who manage Casa Santa Marta, the guesthouse where the 133 sequestered cardinal-voters will reside during the conclave, their task will be to cook for the men and clean their bedrooms. The nuns will also assist them in managing their daily needs, especially the more frail among them, while providing spiritual support for their electoral duty through prayer.“It is the women who actually hold everything together,” said Gloria Branciani, a former nun. “But the Catholic church remains a patriarchal institution where women are barely even listened to.”Branciani should know. She left the nunhood after allegedly being sexually abused for years – including being forced into having threesomes – byMarko Rupnik, a once-prominent Jesuit artist-priest who was friends with Francis.Rupnik, who has been accused of abuse by at least nine women, was excommunicated in 2020 for absolving a woman with whom he had sex, only to be reinstated after he repented. Rupnik was finally expelled from the Jesuit order in June 2023 after the“degree of credibility”of the allegations against him was found to be “very high”. However, he remains a priest and is now based at a diocese in Koper, in his native Slovenia.Branciani had long reported the abuse, but claimed she was never listened to. There was hope in 2019 when Francis became the first pontiff topublicly admitthat priests had sexually abused nuns, but he failed in his pledge to do more to fight the problem.The Rupnik case is with the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, the Vatican body responsible for overseeing the church’s prosecution of serious crimes. But it has been slow to progress, with Rupnik’s alleged victims being told that judges were deterred from taking on the case because the women had spoken to the press.View image in fullscreenSisters manage the Casa Santa Marta guesthouse where 133 cardinals will reside during the conclave, their task to cook for the men and clean their bedrooms.Photograph: Abaca Press/Alamy“Gloria made the first complaint in 1993, and if it had been dealt with at that time we would never have needed to turn to the media … and how many victims would have been spared?” said Laura Sgrò, a lawyer representing Bracciani and other alleged victims, and the author of a recently published book about the case,Stupri Sacri(Sacred Rapes).Sister Livia Angelillis, a nun based in Tuscany, said the problem of clerical abuse against nuns had always been there, “whether in a light or heavy form”. “They were afraid to speak out – nuns tend to view priests as Jesus on Earth,” she said. “But Francis’s acknowledgment has at least given more women the courage to report it.”The major obstacle limiting the power of women in the church is the ban on them becoming priests. “They don’t have voices,” said Sgrò.The battle for female priests has long been fought by the Catholic Women’s Ordination (CWO), a global organisation that challenges misogyny in the church. Pat Brown, a spokesperson for CWO, said that while Francis was “wonderful” in so many ways, he appeared to have a blind spot when it came to giving women “justice”. “There is absolutely no argument why women can’t be priests – it is misogyny,” she said.Justice is exactly what Branciani would like to see from the next pope. “Words are all well and good but we need substance, starting with an immediate trial [against Rupnik]. But real reforms can only really begin once women can train to become priests.”Explore more on these topicsCatholicismPope FrancisThe papacyChristianityReligionnewsShareReuse this content"

Why would Labour want to mimic this nasty party?Frances RyanThe British public is more liberal and tolerant than you would believe from our politicians. Time for Keir Starmer to appeal to Britain’s best sideMon 5 May 2025 09.45 EDTLast modified on Mon 5 May 2025 11.50 EDTShareReform UK’s ascendancy to power has at times felt like watching the cliched slow-motion car crash: a wounded Tory party, the rise of rightwing populism across the globe, a damp squib of a Labour government, then – bam! – staggering local election wins accompanied byNigel Faragegrinning on the morning news.Except, rather than it being a soft collision, you could be forgiven for feeling some whiplash. With the full picture of Thursday’s results now in, one thing is clear: just seven years after forming out of the bones of Ukip and the Brexit party, Reform has had a sweeping victory across large swathes of English councils. Farage’s party gained almost 650 council seats, taking control of ten local authorities.In the coming weeks, there will be plenty of time for postmortems on how exactly we got here – the decades-long political and economic failings that have enabled a party whose selected candidates havecompared black people to “savages”andpraised Hitlerto get a hold on the levers of government.We should talk about all of it, the uncomfortable and the shameful: from big tech’s place in spreading misinformation and conspiracies, to the role of the BBC in platforming Farage over the years (while relegating the Greens), to ever-plummeting living standards and the seeming lack of interest of the major parties to raise them.And yet, for now, as we watch the map turn an ominous shade of turquoise, I can’t stop my mind from going over the comments Farage was making on the days running up to the elections.Asked at a press conference about the rising number of children with special educational needs and disabilities, and what could be done to help them,Farage replied: “It’s a massive problem. I have to say, for my own money, when you get to 18 and you put somebody on a disability register, unemployed, with a high level of benefits, you’re telling people aged 18 that they’re victims. And if you are told you’re a victim, and you think you’re a victim, you are likely to stay [a victim].”Reform UK to resist housing asylum seekers in its council areas, chair saysRead moreFarage’s comments on trans people and the recent supreme court ruling were comparatively measured (“an outbreak of common sense”, he called it on X), but the niggling unease such views foster among progressives is the same. Each nasty reactionary comment by Reform followed by the reward of an electoral gain feels as if it eats away at a diverse and decent society, pulling back hard-won tolerance while validating the worst prejudices. It is a dread that many of us will have felt over the last few days: that there is an ugliness infecting our politics – and an increasing chasm between the country we want to be, the country we actually are and the politicians we elect.Such ugliness is no longer merely rhetoric. Hours after former Conservative minister Andrea Jenkyns became the new Reform mayor of Greater Lincolnshire with a victory speech arguingtents are “good enough”for asylum seekers to live in, Farage pledged that Reform-run councils and mayoralties willblock asylum seeker accommodation.Local elections traditionally act as an unofficial referendum on national politics – a rare chance for voters in Wirral to “send a message” to Westminster. As the one-year anniversary of Labour’s landslide on the promise of “change” approaches, it is not hard to see that the conditions are ripe for cynicism, anger and protest. More and more people – already reeling from a decade that gave us austerity, Brexit and Partygate – are becoming deeply disillusioned not only about the state of Britain but about politics as a means to improve it. If you have no hope of getting on the housing ladder, your wages don’t cover the weekly shop or you live in pain but can’t even get a GP appointment, the lure of rightwing populism’s simple answers to complex problems is almost rational.This is only exacerbated by the fact that the positive things that Labour is doing for low-income voters – say, the employment rights bill and the rise in the minimum wage – are mentioned so rarely by ministers you would think they were state secrets. That in his first speech since the local elections, Keir Starmer chose to speak not about the cost of living crisis at a supermarket or waiting lists at a hospital but about Ukraine at a drone-manufacturing facility was a clear enough symbol of what led many voters to put their cross next to Reform.Here is the good news. Evidence consistently shows that the British public is progressive – and becoming more progressive still – in their attitudes on issues such as asylum and immigration,homosexuality,industrial action, andabortion.If Labour learns the correct lessons from the local elections, it will tell a story about the country that reflects this spirit, and launch a policy agenda that rebuilds hope and trust – from investment in public services, supporting disabled people into jobs rather than cutting their benefits, bold housing pledges and a fully fundedchild poverty strategyto making the case for safe and humaneasylum routes.The alternative is aLabourgovernment tacking ever further to the right, trying to beat populism by mimicking it. We will all be Farage’s victims then.Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist.Who Wants Normal?

Why are the royals such terrible communicators?Zoe WilliamsIs their motto ‘never complain, never explain’ or ‘never stop complaining, never stop explaining’? Either way, it’s not working for themMon 5 May 2025 09.44 EDTLast modified on Mon 5 May 2025 12.38 EDTShareThe royal family’s motto has been “never complain, never explain” for as long as anyone asking anything as tedious as a question can remember. Royal watchers trot it out as a devilish smart move by a public relations master-breed. They’ve cracked the code of how to retain their dignity, their mystery, their effortless superiority and, maybe in a fair wind, even divinity: simply never say anything.Personally, I always found it a bit of an impediment to having any feelings for them. Sure, don’t explain if you don’t want to, but complaining to each other is 90% of human intimacy. It’s hard to have a relationship without it, even an imaginary one.Maybe that’s the way they like us, at arm’s length. The more important thing about this strategy is how epically it does not work.Last week’sBBC interview with Prince Harryhad an excruciating amount of complaint and explanation, but everything was as mysterious at the end as it had been at the start. He alleged an establishment stitch-up, blocking the funds for his security detail, guiding the hand of the Executive Committee for the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures, yet never stooped to explain what the deep state stands to gain from this vendetta, nor why he and his family haveno problem going to, say, Portugal. He says he’d love a reconciliation with his father, but any idiot could tell him that the worst way to go about that is via a TV interview. Without conveying any concrete, falsifiable information, it somehow managed to be TMI: too much self-justification, too much feeling, too much chagrin, too much of everything.King Charles, meanwhile, is only nominally sticking to the rules himself. He may not have said anything, but friends have been fielded to say things on his behalf, which is a kind of Jennifer Aniston circa 1994 move. They sound pretty reasonable, the friends: “It’s not that the king won’t speak to him, it’s that he can’t,” said one, who was nameless but definitely “close”, according to the Times. “How can you have a private and delicate conversation when you know it is going to end up on a news special within hours?” Fine, makes sense, but it’s also tawdry; regular people who loved or had ever loved each other, who recognised a thousand different ways that life is short, would just pick up the damn phone. Again, nothing real is said and yet way too much is revealed, or seems to be.The great Harry and Meghan debate rages on – but I’m staying out of it | Zoe WilliamsRead moreWhich is the flaw in their fabled discretion all over – if you never explain small things as you go along, you end up having to explain incredibly large things all at once, or, worse, have them explained for you. As mockable as Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, may be, with herrainbow fruit plate, she is in no way the originator of this paradox. Charles and Diana could have done a much better job of communicating, in sorrow, their marital froideur. Then, a lot of the larger questions that mainly answered themselves – wait, why does he want to be a tampon? How many people in the marriage again? – wouldn’t have come up.The late Queen Elizabeth spent her life in studied reserve, hiding feelings that would have been inoffensive and very easy to articulate, so that when circumstances required her to emote, it was magnetically hideous to behold. I’m talking, of course, about the violent death of her estranged ex-daughter-in-law. It was a relationship about which, in the vacuum left by discretion, a lot of details had been filled in by common sense. Which is to say, didn’t Diana and the queen kind of hate each other? Couldn’t you see that from space?So, in September 1997, the sight of the queen, forced to express some heartfelt grief on the spot, was super awks, as the young people say. She came up with, “I admired and respected her, for her energy and commitment to others,” a cut-and-paste job that could have been said about any given member of the royal family at that point, even Prince Andrew.Prince Harry, of course, broke the rules ages ago. Even before he wroteSpare, his autobiographywith surprising descriptions of Prince William as a raging bull and unnamed royal officials as a white supremacy cult, he was telling it like he found it, on podcasts and documentaries. His feelings by the time he stepped down from royal duties were too large to be contained within a normal narrative, and everybody has come out looking downright peculiar.It’s time for a new mantra: complain about relatable things, in a modest way, and explain anything slightly unusual that’s going on, before it gets so out of hand that there’s no explaining it, except that you’re all barmy.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPrince HarryOpinionKing Charles IIIcommentShareReuse this content"

Citing a threat to “national security” from movies that aren’t shot in the United States, Trumpannouncedthat he would be enacting a 100% tariff on movies made anywhere else.Trump’s movie tariffs are designed to destroy the international film industryRead moreCharacteristically, this proclamation was not so bold as to make any sense whatsoever, lacking as it was any sign that Trump understands the difference between movies that are produced (at least partially) by US companies and shot in other locations, and foreign films that are produced elsewhere but released in the US (by, of course, US companies who obtain distribution rights). But the consensus seems to be that Trump is referring mainly to purportedly American productions that are lured to shoot in various international locations by tax credits that allow for substantial savings on big budgets. Andrew Pulver hasdetailed analysisof how that may work on a financial level, sifting through the detritus of Trump’s all-encompassing ignorance to explain why so many US films shoot overseas. Los Angeles film productions havedeclined in recent yearsso naturally, rather than creating incentives for more US shoots in the heart of the American film industry, Trump figures the best way to go about it is make it more expensive to shoot elsewhere.As with the idea that the US will simply materialize entire manufacturing industries if foreign goods prove too expensive, both the financial and creative reality of the situation is far more complicated. While many big productions are lured away fromLos Angelesby tax credits in England or Australia, and plenty of lower-budget movies shoot in less populated countries overseas to keep costs down, some of the Los Angeles downturn comes from movies shooting elsewhere within the United States. Atlanta, for example, has become a major production hub in recent years; large chunks of many Marvel movies have shot there, and Tyler Perry has a 330-acre studio lot for film and TV production.1:04Donald Trump announces tariff on movies from 'other nations'  – videoThe question is, are audiences yearning for more movies and shows that look like later-period Marvel or Tyler Perry movies? Granted, a lot of viewers pay almost no attention to how and why a movie looks a certain way. (This would still place most of them far above Trump in terms of art appreciation.) But particularly in the years of most prominent Covid-19 threats, a lot of movies opted to use Atlanta soundstages (or their equivalent in other areas) to cobble together movies without as many logistical headaches or risks. This is how you get a globe-trotting thriller like Red Notice that often seems to keep its stars in digitized captivity, as in a notoriously hideoussceneset in a bullfighting arena, obviously green-screened together from pieces. The only visually convincing piece among them? The crowd shots, which came from an actual arena in actual Spain. Trump may be tacitly asking for a return to pandemic-style production (maybe as a pre-emptive measure for when he helps bring about another pandemic).Of course, movies shot in the US aren’t required to head for an Atlanta parking lot, use green-screens for exteriors, or to shoot Albany for Manhattan. There are, indeed, plenty of opportunities for visually spectacular location shoots in the United States. But shooting in other countries isn’t (always) just a matter of (only) saving money. After all, the last couple of Mission: Impossible and James Bond movies shot all over the world, and were mind-bogglingly expensive. These movies follow the rich tradition of giving audiences a look at landscapes and cities that they may not be able to visit themselves – at least not all of them, and certainly not in the span of two or three hours. Part of the reason that movies like No Time to Die or Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning feel more “real” than the average streaming action picture (which also, after all, tend to feature spies, action, big stars and so forth) is that they take place in a physical world that’s both recognizable and, to people around the world, exotic in its reach and diversity.The cynical read is that these types of movies take place in multiple countries, and often include characters of various nationalities, to assure interest from multiple revenue streams in a global release pattern, and that’s probably true to an extent. But gathering locations from around the world has been a feature of big-budget film-making for decades. It can be great for verisimilitude even in the realm of fantasy; think of the Lord of the Rings films, which of course utilized plenty of special effects, but also used New Zealand locations to give audiences the illusion of a tactile Middle Earth that never existed. It’s an extreme but powerful example of a worldwide phenomenon: tourists goggling at famous real-world locations they recognize from the movies. For so many people, movies will be their first exposure to any number of other places and people, which at their best can play a role in what Roger Ebert described as an empathy-generating machine.That’s why Trump’s vaguely but forcefully worded announcement trades on a bit of fashionable xenophobia, too, implying that movies shot in other places – US-produced or not – carry dangerous levels of propaganda. Propaganda about what? Why, the idea that a world outside American serfs toiling at the behest of corner-cutting billionaires exists at all. For Trump, other countries are not objects of cultural fascination or curiosity. They’re enemy combatants who need to be vanquished and looted by American exceptionalism. It’s a simple-mindedness that many people grow out of – sometimes with the help of exposure to the arts. No wonder the president treats all forms of them with such contempt.Explore more on these topicsFilm industryTariffsDonald TrumpLos AngelescommentShareReuse this content"

Both Tories – and Labour – need to rethink hard and fastMon 5 May 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 5 May 2025 13.52 EDTShareIt takes real effort to kill a political party that has been around for nearly 200 years and is the most successful in Britain’s history. But at the very least, this version of the Conservative party is dead. To quote the famousMonty Python dead parrot sketch, it has ceased to be. It is an ex-party. Inlast week’s local elections, of the 16 councils it was defending, the Conservative party lost control of every one of them. It won just one of the six mayoralty contests. The BBC’s projected national vote share for the Conservative partywas just 15%. It’s another record low for a party that has spent the last several years achieving record-low vote shares in national elections. This is a pathetic performance for a party often described as the natural party of government.The party has no winning majority in any age group of voters other than those over 70. This is no basis for a successful electoral strategyAnd it was all so predictable. I’ve lost count of the articles I’ve written for the Guardian warning that the party’s “Reform-lite” strategy of trying to out-Reform Reform would lead to failure and electoral disaster.Back in July 2024I described it as an existential moment that required change. “Do or die,” as I put it. The party chose not to change – with fatal electoral consequences.Unlike in the past, it’s not as simple as waiting for the pendulum to swing back towards the Conservative party. There is no pendulum. Arguably, there is no such thing as a core voter any more. Those days of predictable votes in predictable places are gone. In today’s Britain, voters act the way they do as consumers. If they vote for a party that fails to deliver on its promises, then they simply choose a different one the next time an election comes around. And why not? Why should political failure be rewarded? Yet this losing version of the Conservative party, with its blinkered, ideological, culture-war preoccupations and entitlement syndrome, has failed to grasp this crucial change.What voters see is a Conservative party with no authentic sense of purpose or mission, and a Labour government that seems not have thought realistically about what its tax and spend agenda would be until after its landslide general election win last July. It’s no wonder voters have cast around for alternative political parties. Voters supported a Labour party selling “change”. Now, in the absence of seeing a sufficiently ambitious plan to deliver change on the ground, many are attracted to a party titled Reform.There are those who would castigate these Reform voters’ political choices, but they would be wrong. Instead, we should understand just how fed up millions of people are with the status quo in this country. These voters feel they’ve heard it all before from the two main parties. Grand promises, rhetoric – but then nothing changes.View image in fullscreenConservative party leader Kemi Badenoch and shadow environment secretary Victoria Atkins, campaigning on 28 April 2025.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PAIs this the end of two-party politics? The Conservative party had better hope so. Otherwise it has an even bigger problem, because for a party with no distinct, authentic purpose any more, our two party politics – driven by a first past the post system – means theConservativesare squeezed out of contention almost everywhere: in the south and south-west England by a LabourLiberal Democrat or Lib Dem-Reform run-off; in the north by a Labour-Reform run-off; in the wider UK by the presence of independent parties.In a sense it’s a healthy challenge for the Conservative party now, as it is for Labour. Both parties need to up their game. But the Labour party at least has the platform of government to show it can deliver. For the Conservatives, the challenge is existential in nature. This version of the Conservative party is finished as a political force in our country. For the first time, even a change of course may now not be enough to improve its fortunes. The party’s joyride down its political cul-de-sac has not just been a flash in the pan. It has been a long one – over the best part of a decade. The local election results prove beyond doubt that it has now reached a political dead end.Farage claims Reform UK local election gains ‘beginning of the end’ for ToriesRead moreIn a very literal sense. Political nature has taken its course. The party has attempted to be a “mini-me” version ofReform UK, and unsurprisingly Reform voters prefer the real thing. And this strategy’s consequential alienation of Conservative-leaning centre-ground voters has seen them head off to either the Lib Dems or Labour, or to the Green party. The party has no winning majority in any age group of voters other than those over 70. This is no basis for a successful electoral strategy for the longer term.Perhaps the Faragian Reform-party bubble, akin to the Johnsonian Conservative-party bubble, will also spectacularly burst when its powerful but simplistic political rhetoric is confronted with the more complex problems of the real world. Perhaps the populist revolution that both parties have fuelled will eat both its political children, not just the one. Yet the driver behind it – inequality of opportunity and the unacceptability of Britain’s endemically weak social mobility – will remain. Future policy solutions will still be required.But for now, all that the present generation of Conservative leadership can do is to own up to their abject failure. They should have the humility to admit that their strategy has been catastrophically wrong. It’s quite a political epitaph: to have essentially killed the Conservative party. But in creating this version of it, they may well have done just that.Justine Greening was the Conservative MP for Putney from 2005 to 2019Explore more on these topicsConservativesOpinionReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

But, as we report today, the data we need doesn’t seem to existLayla Moran is chair of the health and social care select committee and MP for Oxford West and AbingdonMon 5 May 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 5 May 2025 13.06 EDTShare“The NHS undoubtedly saved my life, butsocial carehelps me live it.” That is what a participant at a roundtable event on social care told me recently.Last October, the health and social care select committee I chair resolved to investigate the cost of successive governments’ inaction on reforming adult social care. Of course, the human cost to individuals in terms of unfulfilled lives is a weighty moral argument – reason enough in itself to reform the sector, as the government has promised to do, starting with anindependent commissionled byLouise Casey.But we set out to calculate something different. There are economic costs resulting from the desperate situation in social care: unmet care needs hinder individuals from being able to work, study, acquire skills and participate in the economy, with all the resulting costs to the Treasury through the loss of potential tax receipts and the costs to theNHSif physical or mental health issues result. So rather than producing yet another hand-wringing report on the state of the sector, or suggesting reforms and wading into an estimation of their costs, we decided instead to flip the lens and ask a simple question: what is the current economic cost of not doing any reform at all?Unfortunately our report,published today, does not conclude with an accurate figure – the bill to the country for not fixing the social care system. That’s because, despite our best efforts, we were frustrated in our aim by a serious lack of official data.Let’s unpack why this is important. We probably all know someone affected by the broken social care system, but when the Treasury says: “No, we can’t – that’s too expensive”, there is a cost to that too – to individuals, their carers, the sector, the NHS and the wider economy.And it’s the Treasury that most needs convincing. We spoke to Sir Andrew Dilnot, who knows more than most on this subject. After all, he also led a government-backed social care commission. That was 14 years ago. The recommended reforms then received royal assent – twice. But they were never enacted. Reflecting on the reasons for this, Dilnot told us that one of the critical tasks for the Casey commission will be getting through the Treasury “nexus”.For the Treasury to grasp the economics of this, it needs to know the pounds and pence of what the failing system is costing – very often in other areas of government.We were made aware of the impact of inaction on the people who need care, and heard how financial pressures are forcing local authorities to “care ration”, resulting in some people receiving only the most basic level of care, far from enough to enable them to live fulfilling lives. How much does it cost to find hospital beds for people who could have avoided engaging with the NHS at all if they’d received timely and effective social care at home? How many millions are missing from the exchequer because carers have quit their jobs to look after loved ones at home When we looked for answers, we found large gaps in the data.The biggest cost of inaction is clearly with unpaid carers. More than 4 million unpaid carers provide care for their loved ones, sometimes to the detriment of their own health and wellbeing, their employment and education opportunities. This costs the Treasury through loss of tax receipts as people have to give up work and withdraw from participating in the economy. There are increased demands on the NHS, as carers’ health may suffer, and on the necessary benefit payments to support low-income households. Young carers, missing more than a month’s worth of school every year, are distinctly affected. But the picture there is partial: there is only emerging data on the total lifetime costs to a young carer and the resulting knock-on costs to the Treasury.The Guardian view on social care: while politicians dither, those in need suffer | EditorialRead moreConversely, high-quality care can give people fulfilling lives and can also have economically beneficial outcomes. There are many examples of projects successfully delivering effective and life-enhancing adult social care, and we were lucky to be able to visit some of them. On a visit toCare in the Garden, a not-for-profit organisation supporting people with additional needs on the Isle of Wight, I was moved by the written testimony of a young man: “I am not a burden on society. I have so much to give,” he said. But once again, the government itself does not have figures on the beneficial outcomes of high-quality care, and this is a problem, because without such figures, how can it assess which interventions would result in the highest returns? How can it make a convincing case to the Treasury for these interventions?The lack of adequate data was a problem we found across all the areas we looked at. There is no official data on the number of hours of care needs going unmet. There is no official estimate of how much delayed discharges are costing the NHS, let alone the eventual costs of people’s care if they deteriorate while waiting for discharge.We heard about high levels of poverty among workers in the care sector and are keen to quantify that. Between 2017 and 2020, 19.6% of the residential care workforce drew onuniversal credit and legacy benefits, according to findings by the Health Foundation, twice the rate for workers in other sectors. But when we asked the Department for Work and pensions for the current figure, they could not give us an answer. In too many areas, there just isn’t the information.The good news is that there is wide acceptance of the need for reforms. Now what’s needed is strong and sustained public and political support to guarantee their longevity and the buy-in from the Treasury. For this, the government needs better, more comprehensive and joined-up data. Without this, the committee fears that the Casey commission will bedoomed to fail, leaving everyone continuing to suffer under the current unsustainable system.Because while we may not be able to quantify it in financial terms, we do know that the cost of inaction is high indeed.Layla Moran is chair of the health and social care select committee and MP for Oxford West and AbingdonExplore more on these topicsSocial careOpinionNHSHealthLiberal DemocratsLouise CaseyLayla MorancommentShareReuse this content"

After a week of algorithmic nudging to watch her, I too felt compelled to try, despite a sense of foreboding. (Surely I have good reasons for letting things fester?)I started a timer and tried to reply to a long-overdue email from my accountant. I assumed this would be simple, but soon realised it would require me to confront some of the things I loathe the most: password-protected portals, Excel and, worst of all, my bank statements. I hacked away for 38 miserable minutes, just long enough to pass the buck, temporarily, to my husband.Next, getting a doctor’s appointment to have the weird-looking mole I found in December checked. One perfectly pleasant phone call later, it was booked: nine minutes, 47 seconds. I rewarded myself by tackling a plate of miscellaneous bathroom flotsam I had been looking at, thinking, “I should do something about that” every time I brushed my teeth for the past four years.However, in a devastating turn of events, during the eight minutes and 50 seconds it took to clear the plate of shame (Thai coins from 2015, tags from long-dead trousers, a bewildering number of screws), my husband had retaliated, lobbing a horrible heap of documents back into my inbox. Some hours later, I also realised I had booked my doctor’s appointment for a day when I would be out of the country and remembered why I started procrastinating in the first place: because chores beget more chores.

Time for a reality checkMon 5 May 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 5 May 2025 05.28 EDTShareWas the timing deliberate? It did seem so as Prince Harry backed into the limelight once again last Friday evening with hisextended lament to the BBCabout the fact that he and his wife and children had beendenied taxpayer-funded security protectionby a wicked establishment if ever they choose to visit Britain again.In the great scale of world events, or even of the royal family, Harry’s private security needs are probably not near the top of anybody’s priorities, but they were enough to knock the local election results and even the picture of a grinning Nigel Farage off Saturday’s front pages.But if he thought his latest intervention was going to change minds at Buckingham Palace or effect the reconciliation he claims to want with his father, though not apparently with others like the queen or his brother, he has surely got another think coming.View image in fullscreenSunday People front page, 4 May 2025.The interview – the latest in a string of complaints emerging at regular intervals from Harry and Meghan’s home in Montecito – is likely to be filed alongside previous interviews, documentaries andhis book Spare. We have heard such complaints before, several times over. His trouble is that the family firm, the UK media and most of the public – insofar as they think of his plight at all – have given up on Harry. If he wants reconciliation, he needs better PR and less megaphone diplomacy.The spark for his latest grievance comes as the rest of the royal family and the nation prepare to celebrate that moment in UK history which gave the country something to be proud about: its role 80 years ago in the defeat of Nazi Germany. It will be a commemoration of service, duty and unity, with parades, fly-pasts and civic celebrations, which Harry will miss despite his own military service.At the interview in a private house (not his own) in California, the prince, who gave up royal duties five years ago and moved to America’s West Coast, complained, as if it were the most important thing, that he was a victim. That he was being discriminated against by the UK establishment for being, well, a prince: “My status hasn’t changed. It can’t change. I am who I am.” And he implied that the shadowy forces that had had it in for his mother were out to get him too. The old discredited conspiracy theory lives on in his brain.Harry said he wants to reconcile with his father, who might be dying of cancer for all he knew, but could not get hold of him “because of the security stuff”. He would not bring his family to Britain because of their vulnerability to attack in a country which is somewhat safer than the West Coast, or indeed Ukraine, which he has recently visited. He said: “If anything were to happen to me, my wife or my father’s grandchildren…look where the responsibility lies,” and last night, possibly coincidentally,Meghan published a photographof her husband holding their son Archie’s hand and carrying daughter Lilibet on his shoulders.The prince thought King Charles might have intervened, or at least stepped aside, to allow a proper review of his safety needs from a body other than Ravec – theRoyal and VIP Executive Committee– which reviews the security of vulnerable public figures and contains a staff member from Buckingham Palace. As the judges in Harry’s latest court case about the decision toremove protectionpointed out on Friday, his complaint has been examined several times and found groundless.Prince Harry says king ‘won’t speak to him’ and he would ‘love’ to be reconciledRead moreMore to the point, despite whatever constitutional training he ever received, the fifth in line to the throne does not seem to realise that his dad cannot intervene even in what are technically his own courts to get a favourable outcome for his younger son. That’s the sort of thing Donald Trump might try.Pragmatically, instead of revelling in victimhood, Harry and Meghan might reflect that if they turn up for official events they will get protection. If they turn up privately to stay with friends, the British public will remain blissfully unaware of their presence or even location.For now, all the palace can do is keep calm and carry on, albeit with exasperation. If Harry really wants reconciliation, he could always write a private letter. He knows where his father lives.Stephen Bates is a former Guardian royal correspondentDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Donald Trump’s early April trade decree has taken a month to hit theeconomy– that’s how long Chinese containers need to reach Los Angeles. And on cue, US pacific ports registered a45% dropin container bookings this week from China. When warehouses fallquietandtrucksidle in California, the silence will creepeastward.Unemploymentwill surely tick upwards.Even if Washington reverses course by the end of May, andBeijingplays nice, the best-case scenario is delayed damage. Some goods are beingreroutedto avoid charges, but you can’t reboot global logistics overnight. This isn’t strategic decoupling – it’s economic self-harm. By the time the Trump administration notices, it will be too late. The consequences of the US president’srash tacticswill reverberate through Main Street. Mr Trump offers a flippant excuse:blame 11-year-oldswith too many dolls – not his own tariffs – for rising hardship.US gross domestic product just shrank for the first time in three years – despite Mr Trump’s promise of a “golden era”. His tariffs are steering the world toward adownturn. Even the International Monetary Fund (IMF) knows it. According to its latestmodelling, the fund now sees the probability of global growth falling below 2%, a threshold widely seen as equivalent to a globalrecession, as approaching one in four. That’s double the risk it estimated six months ago. EscalatingUS tariffs, says the IMF, are the main reason behind the darkening skies.What does this mean for the world? Below 2% global growth, much of the per capita gains vanish. Most of what’s left is soaked up by expanding giants inAsiaandAfrica– places with the people and industrialcatch-upcapacity to grow even in a weakened global economy. The UK does not have this. Britain is an ageing, post-industrial economy in a productivity slump without the momentum of demographics or the slack of underdevelopment. That’s why Labour can’t afford to sit back. Rising living standards and real economic security require government to invest, build and redistribute – because the market alone won’t.Commentatorsstill blindly cling to David Ricardo’s 1817 theory of comparative advantage – as if today’s global capitalism mirrors Georgian England’s trade inwine and cloth. It doesn’t. Ricardo assumed nations specialise based on domestic costs. But in a world of mobile capital, it’s companies that specialise, not countries. That’s what the economist Dani Rodrik warned in thelate 1990s: free capital flows underminecomparative advantage. Development now depends not on obeying trade patterns, but on shaping them – throughindustrial policy.But Maga protectionism isn’t rebuilding US industry – it’s shock therapy. Mr Trump engineers atrade crisisto hike prices, kill off “uncompetitive” firms and clear the way for a leaner, capital-heavy economy. Meanwhile,tax cutshand America’s oligarchic tendency even more power to reshape markets in its image. Mr Trump’s narrative promises a revival for US workers – particularly the unionised holdouts in places such asDetroit– but what they will get is higher costs, stagnant wages and patriotic slogans.

Campaigners are right to stress this, as theypush for new entitlementsto be added to the employment rights bill.Time off helps dads and co-parents bond with newborns and builds habits that last. Mothers are more supported and less alone as they recover from childbirth and adapt to life with a baby, which for most includes the challenge ofbreastfeeding. Older siblings have another parent to spend time with and look after them. Last but not least, new babies gain the advantage of a second carer – which, as well as immediate practical effects at the time, can help to prime the adult for responsibility later on.Having two engaged parents is strongly associated with better outcomes for children. Getting fathers more active in parenting anddomestic labourhas long been a goal of feminist reformers for another reason as well: the unequal division of care underpins gender inequality – including the pay and wealth gaps.Given all this, it is disappointing that, more than two decades after Labour introduced statutory two‑week paternity leave, two in five dads don’t take it and one in five don’t take any leave at all. The reasons are mostly a lack of eligibility or affordability at what is, anyway, an expensive time. Even some who take leave return to work before the two weeks are up. Statutory paternity pay is £187.18 a week, which is the same as maternity pay after six weeks (for the first six weeks, mothers receive 90% of their pay) – though some employers are more generous.When it was introduced in 2015, shared parental leave was also aimed at supporting fathers and co-parents to be moreactively involved, by enabling mothers to transfer a portion of their maternity leave. But take-up is so low that the policy iswidely viewed as a failure. Hence campaigners had high hopes of Labour’s employment rights bill as a chance for improvement.They are justifiably disappointedthat while it will extend paternity leave to about 30,000 more fathers, the pay and two-week period on offer are unchanged. Instead, ministers have promised a review.In the House of Lords this week, peers including Labour’s Ruth Lister will try to flesh out this offer. Her amendment proposes that a month of paid leave reserved for fathers and co-parents should be among the options consulted on, along with an allowance for self-employed fathers similar to that which mothers receive. While ministers are inevitably reluctant to increase costs, campaigners are right to push them. The current scheme isungenerous by international standardsand places paternity leave out of reach for too many families. Campaigners make a convincing case that this is a template for low expectations later on.Transparency is only a first step. Campaigning organisations such asMumsnetand theFatherhood Instituteare right to demand that larger employers publish parental leave policies, just as they report gender pay gap data. A lack of information about workplace practice is a barrier to reform – but it’s far from the only one. Without earnings-linked paternity entitlements and extended leave, many fathers will continue to be locked out. As it stands, Britain’s paternity provision is a template not just for low expectations, but for inequality. Ministers must go further.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Plus letters fromRichard RepperandTim GosslingMon 5 May 2025 12.18 EDTLast modified on Mon 5 May 2025 12.30 EDTShareMany people (including me) votedLabourat the last general election because we wanted change – change from policies that put corporations and old ideas above the people. With this Labour government, we’ve got more of the same so far.In my anecdotal experience, most Reform UK voters just want something different and don’t really care what. Yes, some think we have too many refugees, but I believe the majority of them aren’t bigots, just misled (Farage claims Reform UK local election gains ‘beginning of the end’ for Tories, 2 May).By contrast, those I know who vote Labour tend to do so because we believe in fairness. We want progressive policies that make a difference to people’s lives. We want the rich to pay their fair share of tax (something in common with Reform voters too). We want clean industries and waterways. We want energy and water prices to reduce and, hopefully, for those industries to be renationalised (another thing in common with Reform voters).Copying Reform’s socially rightwing policies puts us off voting Labour, yet doesn’t convince Reform voters to switch either. Adopting economically leftwing policies looks like a winner for both sides. But is it too late?In the mayoral election I voted Lib Dem as I thought they had a better chance of beating Reform. Like many people I know, we don’t have tribal allegiances. Our priority is stopping the right wing. The first-past-the-post system prevents us from voting the way we want. Maybe if the mayoral election was a transferable vote, we’d be congratulating Labour instead.Reform can be beaten by a hopeful vision that makes life better for people and improves living standards. By standing up to corporations, by reducing bills, by cleaning up our environment – that’s how we can be convinced to continue voting Labour and ward off Reform.James MarstersBeverley, East Riding of YorkshireRe your article (Labour targets international students claiming asylum after election losses to Reform, 3 May), the insistence of this Labour government on responding to the perceived threat of Reform by aping it on the issues where it is strong is utterly mind-boggling.I don’t think any electable party will be more anti-immigration than Reform. The portion of the electorate for whom immigration is the one issue they care about won’t be persuaded to vote Labour by it pledging to reduce asylum applications from international students. It’s a ludicrous idea and, at best, only serves to reduce the distinction between the two parties.In reality, Reform is weak on almost every conceivable area: the economy, the NHS, Donald Trump, Brexit … the list of vulnerabilities is almost without limit. Yet the government chooses to engage on the only ground on which Reform is sure-footed. It’s utterly bizarre.How is a party with five MPs, fewer than 800 local councillors and no actual policies allowed to dictate the agenda in this way?Richard RepperFrome, SomersetMarina Hyde (Is Farage’s win a new dawn? We could ask Labour, but they’re still fast asleep, 2 May) just confirms my long-held opinion. Voters do not vote for parties, they vote against them. At the general election, they voted against the Tories, being fed up with grinding the faces of the poor and downtrodden. At the local elections, they voted against Labour, which shows few signs of being any better. In due course, they will vote against Reform, after finding out that clamping down on immigration and enjoying the plight of poor countries is not the promised panacea.

She says that “the planning and infrastructure bill is a win-win, for people and for nature recovery”.A vast chorus of alarmed NGOs, learned societies, professional bodies, ecologists, economists, scientists and legal professionals say the opposite. These include:33 nature organisations, spearheaded by Wildlife and Countryside Link (an organisation representing 89 environmental groups); theChartered Institute of Ecology and Environmental Management (CIEEM), which represents more than 8,000 ecologists and environmental managers;the current and every past living president of CIEEM,40 renowned environmental economistsand nature professionals, including Prof Sir Partha Dasgupta (author of The Economics of Biodiversity) and Prof Sir John Lawton (chair of the making space for nature review); a past deputy chair of Natural England and University of Oxford academics; andDavid Elvin KC.Since Ms Creagh’s letter, theOffice for Environmental Protection has confirmed its own opinionthat the bill is a regression on existing environmental protection. She shifts responsibility for the bill’s future effects to Natural England, stating that it must “ensure there is a net benefit to nature”, without mentioning that it would be required to follow guidance imposed by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.That the government does not appear to think it necessary to offer meaningful reassurance to these champions of the natural world is astonishing, but gaslighting the public by pretending that legitimate concerns are “misleading” is shameful.Ben KiteConsultantecologist;Chair,CIEEM strategic policy panelHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

This is like a dream,’ says ZhaoAaron Bowerat the CrucibleMon 5 May 2025 15.47 EDTLast modified on Mon 5 May 2025 19.07 EDTShareThe Crucible has been home to some of the most significant moments in snooker history. Minds will spring immediately to Dennis Taylor’s dramatic triumph in 1985, or one of Stephen Hendry or Ronnie O’Sullivan’s many victories on the grandest stage this sport has to offer.But on a mild Monday evening in Sheffield and 20 years on from the door for Chinese snooker being pushed ajar, Zhao Xintong may well have just changed the way the sport is viewed, played and followed for hundreds of millions of people in Asia and across the world.Ronnie O’Sullivan plans new life in Middle East after sorry semi-final exitRead moreIt was 2005 when Ding Junhui’s victory in the UK Championship against Steve Davis gave snooker hope it could be about to usher in a wave of success from China. There are over 300,000 snooker halls in the country, where it is treated as a national sport. Over 150 million were watching this match in China. This is seriously big business.But there was always one thing missing: a Chinese world champion. That wait is over thanks to one of the most exceptional talents the sport has ever seen. It was just 227 days ago when Zhao made his return in an empty snooker hall in Sofia on the amateur tour with a 3-0 victory over Lithuania’s Vilius Schulte-Ebbert.Zhao was returning from a 20-month suspension for his partin the match-fixing scandalwhich embroiled the sport and threatened to grind Chinese snooker to a halt. It is important to point out that while 10 players were suspended for varying lengths of time, Zhao did not directly throw a match.He did accept charges of being a party to another player fixing two games and betting on matches himself but showed remorse in admitting guilt in China and the UK, where he now resides. The reception from the Crucible crowd suggests that while doubters will remain, many are willing to give him a second chance.“It’s very good for Chinese snooker,” Zhao said. “I’m very happy I’ve done this for them. It’s unbelievable. This is like a dream. When I shook hands with Mark [Williams] I nearly cried. My first target was just to get through the qualifiers. In the future, many Chinese players can win this.”Williams, the beaten man, was gracious enough to admit this moment could supersede what any victory may have meant for him. “Everyone’s got to get behind him and watch him – he could dominate,” he said. “It’s bound to open some doors. It can only be good for our sport.”View image in fullscreenZhao Xintong pots a red in the corner during his 18-12 victory against Mark Williams.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAOrganisers were adamant Zhao, whowon the UK Championship in 2021before his suspension, had to start at the bottom. He was consigned to the Q Tour for amateurs but in truth, he made a mockery of that level, making two maximum breaks and proving near unbeatable.Zhao has won an incredible 42 of his first 44 games since returning, including five to qualify for this world championship. He was quietly fancied by some given his undeniable ability and his sensational temperament, but few could have imagined the manner in how he would handle the biggest occasion.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Zhao emphatically won both afternoon sessions to move to within one frame of the title at the start of the final session but Williams was never going to go away quietly.At 50, he is the oldest finalist in Crucible history and after winning four consecutive frames on Monday evening, a 17-8 deficit was reduced to 17-12 in a matter of minutes. But once Zhao was given one half-chance, he would not pass up on the opportunity, such has been his unflappable nature throughout the tournament.That proved to be the case in the 30th and final frame of the match. A break of 87 executed with the fluency that has taken him through the nine matches in qualifying and the main draw proved to be more than enough, with Zhao raising a Chinese flag aloft amid the celebrations to perhaps symbolically usher in a new era for the sport.The new champion did not have far to go with his trophy and £500,000 winner’s cheque: he lives just a 10-minute walk from the Crucible. But it is thousands of miles away where this triumph will truly be felt, and there was perhaps nobody better placed than Williams who best summed up the moment.“He’s bashed me up,bashed Ronnie [O’Sullivan] upand bashed everyone up. There’s a new superstar of the game. I’m glad I’ll be too old when he’s dominating.” Perhaps that dominance has already begun.Explore more on these topicsWorld Snooker ChampionshipSnookernewsShareReuse this content"

There was a warm embrace between the Liverpool star and Michael Edwards, chief executive of football at Fenway Sports Group, and another with Richard Hughes, the man who initiated contract talks with Alexander-Arnold’s brother and agent prior to starting as the club’s new sporting director last summer and has faced a losing battle on that score ever since.They all knew it was endingbut there were evidently no hard feelings. Liverpool feel they did everything they could to persuade Alexander-Arnold to stay. They offered a new deal that reflected his status as the finest full-back in the Premier League and one of the best in the world. They not only offered success, Arne Slot’s team delivered it. But they could not offer a new experience to a player whose stated aim is to win the Ballon d’Or and wants “that legacy of being the greatest right-back to have played football. I have got to reach for the stars”.Trent Alexander-Arnold confirms Liverpool exit and is set to join Real MadridRead moreStrictly business, although losing Alexander-Arnold to the entitled egomaniacs of Real Madrid will hurt, and not only in football terms. Liverpool’s sense of being a destination and not a stepping stone has taken a hit despiteMohamed SalahandVirgil van Dijk confirmingthere is no place their world-class talents would rather be.The Premier League champions are losing a unique, homegrown asset for nothing. That will sting FSG almost as much as the supporters, who understandably cannot reconcile one of their own wanting to jump ship at any moment, let alone after the high of the club’s record-equalling league title. If the Anfield celebrations on the day the championship was secured against Tottenham could not change the defender’s mind – and he had informed Slot of his decision to leave in late March – nothing would.Alexander-Arnold has been a first-team fixture atLiverpoolfor nine seasons. Awareness of him dates back longer. Steven Gerrard marked him out as having “a terrific chance of making it as a top professional” in his 2015 autobiography. He was Trent Arnold back then and had caught Gerrard’s eye playing as a holding midfielder in the under-16s team he was coaching. “He’s quite leggy but he’s got a lovely frame and seems to have all the attributes you need,” wrote the Liverpool legend. “He’s still not strong enough at the moment, but that will come.”View image in fullscreenTrent Alexander-Arnold informed Arne Slot of his decision to leave Liverpool in late March.Photograph: Liverpool FC/Getty ImagesThe full-back grew up near Liverpool’s former Melwood training ground in West Derby wanting to emulate Gerrard’s achievements in a red shirt. He has surpassed them in terms of silverware but, unlike his boyhood hero, has been able to cut ties with the city and the club in the prime of his career. Gerrard was more of a home Liverbird. It is not difficult to imagine Alexander-Arnold wanting to embrace a new challenge, a new culture, a new language and fitting in with the celebrity lifestyle at Real Madrid alongside his good friend Jude Bellingham. Alexander-Arnold’s world-class vision and assists will grace the Bernabéu but for a generation of Madrid fans accustomed to the superior defensive application of Dani Carvajal, the difference may be striking.Amid the furious accusations of betrayal it is worth considering that Alexander-Arnold has been at Liverpool for 20 years, joining the club’s academy as a promising six-year-old. He has already given a lifetime of service in terms of a football career, along with the memories and medals. A highly intelligent man with interests varying from chess to fashion to Formula One – he isan investor in the Alpine racing team– the defender will have a natural curiosity to see what else football has to offer. There is more to his departure than the lucrative contract he will receive as a free agent. However, Alexander-Arnold will know how his exit will be received by fellow Liverpool fans. It will – is – viewed as a defection, not a departure, by someone the Kop lauds as the “scouser in our team”.View image in fullscreenAlexander-Arnold celebrates winning the Champions League in 2019 having tasted defeat in the previous final.Photograph: Andrew Powell/Liverpool FC/Getty ImagesHis emergence was at the heart of Liverpool’s re-emergence under Jürgen Klopp. He was handed his full Premier League debut against Manchester United at Old Trafford, the first of many examples of Klopp placing his trust in and creating a pathway for the club’s academy prospects. His first senior goal was a superb free-kick that set Liverpool on course forvictory over Hoffenheimin a Champions League playoff in August 2017. He was also caught out in that first leg by a long diagonal ball that led to Hoffenheim’s consolation goal. The occasional lapse in concentration is something Slot has been working on with the player all season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A year later he became the youngest player to start two consecutive Champions League finals when Liverpool returned towin the trophyin Alexander-Arnold’s future home of Madrid.There were 12 Premier League assists in 2018-19, a new Premier League record for a defender of 13 assists as Liverpoolswept to the title the following season, and another dozen league assists in 2021-22. That season would produce a career-best 19 assists in total as Liverpool played an epic 63-game campaign and Alexander-Arnold continued to redefine what it meant to be a full-back. At 23 years of age, the defender had won every competition he had competed in with Liverpool – the Champions League, the Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup, Club World Cup, Uefa Super Cup and Community Shield. Another Premier League and League Cup have since been added to the collection. That doesn’t happen to a defender who cannot defend. The glittering CV also explains his desire to try something new.Salah has been the grateful recipient of countless moments of instinctive genius from Alexander-Arnold. Their connection and movement have been integral features of the Liverpool team under Klopp and Slot, and sets a ridiculously high benchmark for Conor Bradley, or whoever succeeds the right-back, to follow. Among many other standout Alexander-Arnold memories is theperformance in the evisceration of Leicesterthat came days after Liverpool’s triumphant return from the Club World Cup in Qatar. There were some reservations inside the camp as to how the travel and temperatures would affect the team on its swift return to domestic action on Boxing Day. Hitting new heights in a 4-0 win, with Alexander-Arnold involved in all four goals, was a decisive moment in Liverpool’s quest to end their 30-year wait for title No 19.Alexander-Arnold has captained his boyhood club, fulfilling a lifelong ambition, and flourished in a hybrid full-back/midfield role under Klopp, the man who appointed him Liverpool’s vice-captain in July 2023. He has given his all and done it all. There is still a Premier League trophy lift and parade to come. It will be interesting to hear how Alexander-Arnold’s part in the celebrations after Crystal Palace visit Anfield on 25 May is received, or how Anfield reacts to confirmation of his exit against Arsenal on Sunday. An awkward few weeks await but Liverpool will move on, as they always do.Explore more on these topicsTrent Alexander-ArnoldLiverpoolcommentShareReuse this content"

Eze almost won it for Palace at the death but his shot cannoned off the crossbar to give the travelling supporters hope that their dreams could still come true.Crystal Palace v Nottingham Forest: Premier League – liveRead moreResults over the weekend had only multiplied Forest’s ­desperation to rediscover their form after four defeats in their past five, ­including theFA Cup semi-finalagainst ­Manchester City. With a local derby against Leicester and a trip to West Ham to come before they face ­Chelsea on the final day, this result means they still have a fighting chance of ­finishing in the top five. “We are pushing the players – not only physically, but mentally – for this big fight we are in,” said Nuno. “Character, confidence and controlling anxiety – all these aspects will be very important.”It was never going to be easy against a Palace team refreshed from being given four days off following theirexploits at Wembleyand still intent on recording their highest ever Premier League finish.Oliver Glasner had signalled his intentions by naming the same side that demolished Aston Villa as the New York Jets owner, Woody ­Johnson – who is reportedly interested in investing in Palace – watched from the stands with the chairman, Steve Parish. But despite another strong performance that could easily have yielded all three points, the sight of Adam Wharton trudging down the tunnel followed by a physiotherapist after receiving treatment just after Eze’s goal was concerning for Palace with their return to Wembley only 12 days away.“I hope it’s not that serious,” said Glasner. “I spoke to him and he’s a little bit sore because he twisted his ankle but hopefully it will be OK.”A reason for Forest’s dip in recent weeks has been a lack of squad depth in comparison to their European rivals. The midfielder Ibrahim ­Sangaré was handed his first Premier League start since August as one of two changes from theirdamaging defeat to Brentfordlast week, with Callum Hudson-Odoi – who went to school just down the road – spotted with fans in the away section after being ruled out with a hamstring injury.View image in fullscreenMatz Sels concedes the penalty against Crystal Palace’s Tyrick Mitchell.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/ReutersUnsurprisingly given the stirring atmosphere at kick-off it was Palace who took the early initiative as Chris Richards almost scrambled home from a corner. But Nuno’s side has been built on strong foundations and they were able to soak up the pressure and wait for an opportunity. Their patience was almost rewarded when Tyrick ­Mitchell made a mess of his header back to Dean Henderson. Luckily for Mitchell, the England goalkeeper was alert enough to stick out his left foot just in time to prevent a comical own goal.Wrapped up in a hat and gloves on a chilly evening in south London, Nuno was ready to celebrate when Morgan Gibbs-White launched a swift break downfield that, to his disappointment, ended with Anthony Elanga firing straight at Henderson. The hat had been dispensed with for the start of the second half but it was Palace who came storming out of the blocks as Wembley hero Ismaïla Sarr twice went close. Chris Wood had an even better chance moments later at the other end but his shot clipped Maxence Lacroix’s leg and went agonisingly wide.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His decision was swiftly overturned by VAR, allowing Eze – back on penalty duties after Jean-Philippe Mateta’s miss at Wembley – to slot home emphatically in front of the England head coach, Thomas Tuchel.Henderson was at full stretch to save Elanga’s free-kick from a tight angle and it was from the resulting corner that Forest drew level thanks to Murillo’s piece of quick thinking to divert a shot in from Neco Williams that was going wide.The Brazilian being forced off injured in the 81st minute was a worry for Nuno but he could breathe a huge sigh of relief when the substitute Eddie Nketiah saw his goal in injury time ruled out for offside moments after Eze had struck the woodwork.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueCrystal PalaceNottingham Forestmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

In it they demanded a reversal of the ban on transgender women from women’s football and described the FA’s decision as a “pitiful and weak response” to the supreme court’s ruling. Bullingham said the FA understands “how difficult this decision will be for people who want to play football in the gender by which they identify, and we are aware of the significant impact this will have on them”, added it “also understands that it will have repercussions for Goal Diggers FC – your players, coaches, volunteers and fans – who all play an important role in championing diversity in football.”SFA to ban transgender women from playing in women’s footballRead moreBullingham said that the FA would “like to reassure you that we are committed to working with every registered transgender player in our network to support them in staying involved in football and we will continue to have those conversations”. However, Goal Diggers player Becky Taylor-Gill said the FA needs to stand more firmly with transgender women. “Their motto is football for all. Put your money where your mouth is,” said Taylor-Gill. “Put your lawyers in the situation where they can fight for football to be for all.“We’ve created a safe space for trans women in our women’s team that we really cherish and they should feel welcomed. This decision will just push more trans women out of football at a time when that’s what they really need.”Outside the Haggerston Park football pitches where Goal Diggers train, members of the not-for-profit club, which was founded to make football more available and accessible to all women and non-binary people, signed flags and set off flares alongside supporters before setting off on their walk. It had initially been set up as a sponsored walk by Goal Diggers members to fundraise for the club and was to conclude with a letter opposing the FA’s existing grassroots transgender women’s policy, which will be overtaken by the ban when it comes into effect on 1 June.However, after the supreme court ruling and subsequent FA ban, the club decided to open the walk up to others, with members of other clubs and supporters of the campaign joining the walk to endorse the message in the letter that: “Our governing body should not be adding more barriers to transgender people to be welcomed into the beautiful game.”Taylor-Gill said the decision of the FA “goes completely against what Goal Diggers stand for and what the grassroots women’s football community stands for” adding: “We’ve had to fight so much just to be able to play. We, as a club, took us years to find a regular space for us to play football. We were playing football on sandy astro and in kids playgrounds at schools because men’s teams had block bookings for all of the pitches.“The FA have a history of banning women from football. In 1921 they banned women from playing on FA-affiliated pitches and they’re doing the same now, but they’re just taking aim at our transgender teammates who are already an incredibly vulnerable part of society as things stand in the UK. All they want to do is play football and at a time when it’s really important that they have that community because of wider transphobia in society, it’s being taken away from them. That’s really, really sad.”Sammy Rees, a trans women player for Goal Diggers, described feeling “hurt, annoyed and scared” following the ban. “A lot of things that I never worried about in the past are now at the forefront of my mind,” she said. “I’m stressed, not just about the FA decision but the whole supreme court ruling has changed how I view my life. It’s changed how I interact with people, it’s made me more conscious of how I present to other people and how people view me, which is something I never really struggled with before.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It has restated what it always knew: that women need their own teams and leagues. Playing mixed-sex football should be a choice, not something forced on women and girls because trans-identifying male players want to join women’s teams.”Rees added: “As a trans woman that’s played men’s football, as much as the people that I played with were lovely and were accepting, I was incredibly uncomfortable and I know other trans people who have felt similarly. It’s a completely different environment. When I come into women’s football I’m met with nothing but love, guidance, acceptance and most importantly, respect.”Explore more on these topicsFootballThe FAnewsShareReuse this content"

For me, what’s missing is the complete feedback of where my level is. That’s going to come slowly with time playing. After the first-round match I’m going to have a good ­picture of myself, where I am at.“Talking about the other stuff, with players, I just arrived 45 ­minutes ago. I haven’t seen so many. I was down talking with some players. It’s all fine at the moment [but] I haven’t seen most of them. So it’s a very strange feeling again, to be around with so many people and attention. But it’s nice to be back. Me and my team are very happy.”Sinner set for hero’s welcome in Rome but how will the locker room react?Read moreSinner has not competed sincehe won the Australian Open, his third grand slam title, in January.His three-month banwas negotiated through a case resolution agreement with the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) after he was initially cleared of wrongdoing by an independent tribunal after testing positive for the banned substance clostebol last April.According to Wada’s rules, banned players are not allowed to train in any officially sanctioned ­tournament venue or alongside any other ­professional athlete until one month before they return from their ban. After taking some time off at the beginning of his ban, for Sinner this meant that he was limited in what he was capable of doing. “For me, last year was very difficult,” said Sinner. “I had a lot of personal pressure, ­holding everything [in] and couldn’t talk with many people about what happened. I was in a tough situation, and in the beginning of the ­Australian Open, I struggled a lot. So it was nice also to take a small break. Three months is a little bit [too much], it is what it is.“But a small break was good, but I could feel that I’m not playing for quite a long time.View image in fullscreenJannik Sinner’s three-month ban was negotiated through a case resolution agreement with Wada.Photograph: Tiziana Fabi/AFP/Getty Images“The body still has to adjust at times. The blisters and hands, they come again because you know you’re not used to it any more. I’m just very happy and very curious to see where I am at. And now we’ll see.”In addition to being banned from his own sport, the anti-doping rules also bar suspended athletes from entering sanctioned sporting ­arenas. According to Sinner, who is an ambassador for Formula One and an avid sports fan, the hardest aspect of the ban was ­actually not being able to attend any other ­professional sporting events.“To be honest, for me, the toughest part was that, in the beginning, I couldn’t watch any other sport, really, in real life,” he said. “I don’t know how many [people] know this, but, for example, watching a simple football match in a stadium, I couldn’t go there to watch it. I wanted to support my friends in cycling or motor sport, I couldn’t go there. That, for me, was the toughest part. But all things considered, I tried to make the best out of it, being ready mentally from the point when I started again to play ­tennis and that’s it. No, it’s all fine. And I was very glad to also spend some time with my family.”Sinner has become one of the most prominent and successful Italian ­athletes of his era, meaning his return to competition in his home country has naturally generated significant news and attention. His press ­conference was completely filled with journalists and a number of attendees applauded when the tennis player entered the room. Sinner’s romantic relationships have also been the subject of discussion in recent weeks, which prompted him to humorously address those rumours in his opening statement.“There’s a whole a lot of attention, also kind of off the court. And I was also very surprised to see some pictures, which are nothing serious. So yeah, I’m not in a relationship. So whoever is asking, it’s all good,” he said, smiling.A few hours later, Sinner entered Campo Centrale to thunderous applause for his first practice session at an official tournament in three months. His practice points with Jiri Lehecka, the 23-year-old Czech, was soundtracked by a constant stream of cheers from his home crowd. Sinner remains the ATP No 1 and as with all seeded players at the Italian Open, he has received a first-round bye. He will mark his return to professional tennis in round two against either Mariano Navone or Federico Cina.Explore more on these topicsJannik SinnerTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

Doris sustained the injury duringLeinster’s Champions Cup semi-final defeat by Northamptonon Saturday and was replaced during the second half. Leinster do not expect Doris to play again this season and said in a statement the ­precise length of any layoff would not be known until after the operation. Nienaber’s “gut” instinct painted a bleak outlook for the No 8, however.“He saw a specialist and I think there’s some further investigation that needs to be done,” Nienaber said. “Fingers crossed that things aren’t as bad as we think it is, but in the last couple of months that I’ve worked with Caelan, he’s not a guy that necessarily comes off the pitch with injury.“So when I subjectively saw him coming off the pitch on Saturday, I thought in my mind: ‘That must be quite serious’. We’ll probably know more in the back end of the week, but my gut, and it’s only gut, says that I think it might be serious. But fingers crossed it might not be.View image in fullscreenCaelan Doris scored Leinster’s third try during their Champions Cup semi-final defeat by Northampton, but later went off injured.Photograph: David Fitzgerald/Sportsfile/Getty Images“It’ll definitely be a race. Shoulder injuries, depending on the amount of structural damage there is, can be anything from a two-month thing to a four-to-six month thing. We know there is damage, we’re just not 100% sure how much damage.”Farrell is due to announce his captain and unveil his squad in front of a live audience at the O2 on Thursday and it is expected that Doris will have undergone the operation before then.The potential to lose Doris so soon before his squad announcement is a major concern for Farrell. Even if he was already leaning towards Itoje – whoexcelled as England’s leader in the Six Nations– Doris is his Ireland skipper and was almost certainly nailed on to start the Test series against the Wallabies at No 8.Farrell will now anxiously await the result of Doris’s operation, all the while exploring contingency options. Last month the head coach insisted there were at least a handful of options for the captaincy – Sione Tuipulotu, Jamie George and even Owen Farrell could fit the bill – but Itoje has excelled since assuming the role for club and country this season. And while the back-row positions in the squad will be hotly contested, there are fewer standout candidates at No8.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Scotland’s Matt Fagerson and Jack Dempsey are other options, having both appeared at No 8 during the Six Nations, as well as England’s Ben Earl and Tom Willis. Jack Conan deputises for Doris for Leinster and Ireland.The Lions play their first match – a warmup fixture against Argentina – in Dublin on 20 June before beginning their tour of Australia against Western Force in Perth eight days later. The first Test against the Wallabies is on 19 July, raising the possibility that Doris could end up joining the squad after the tour has started. Four years ago, Alun Wyn Jones suffered a dislocated shoulder in the warmup match against Japan and was initially ruled out of the tour,only to join the squad in South Africa 18 days later.In 2017, Warren Gatland named Sam Warburton as captain for the second consecutive tour shortly afterthe Wales flanker had sustained a knee injury.

Lionesses, who train in Kent and play their home game at men’s League Two side Bromley’s Hayes Lane ground, will be hoping to break the trend of promoted teams struggling and going straight back down to the Championship after Bristol City endured that fate in the 2023-24 campaign, collecting only six points in the WSL, nine points behind the second-bottom side, while this season Crystal Palace’s relegation has already been confirmed with them having accumulated only 10 points with one game remaining, seven points adrift.Women’s Super League and Championship: talking points from the weekend’s actionRead more“We have in mind what happened in the last two seasons, for sure, with the promoted team,” said Prêcheur, a former Paris Saint-Germain coach who took over at Lionesses last summer. “We don’t want to have the same story, which means we need to be sure we are strong enough, and it will be tough.“I’m not naive – I know the gap is huge between the Championship and the WSL. After [celebrating] I’ll go back to work and start to ensure staff and players look at what are the priorities and what we need to be sure we can compete.”Nonetheless,the Lionesses’ owner, Michele Kang, who also owns the French club Lyon and the American side Washington Spirit, insists they immediately intend to be a mid-table WSL team, revealing after Sunday’s game that her recruitment team are to have a meeting “first thing on Monday morning” to start work on the summer transfer window.Quick GuideBrighton's Kirby sends Arsenal towards another heavy defeatShowBrighton left Arsenal shellshocked once again as they ran out 4-2 winners in their final Women's Super League home game of the season.Gunners head coach Renee Slegers had been expecting a response from a 5-2 defeat by Aston Villa on Wednesday – which had followed on from their Champions League heroics against Lyon to reach the final – and made six changes to her side.Brighton, however, gave their fans a memorable send-off at Broadfield Stadium, with Fran Kirby (pictured) firing in the opening goal after 16 minutes.Although Caitlin Foord equalised just before the half-hour mark, Jelena Cankovic struck either side of the break – her second after Arsenal were caught playing out from the back – to put the hosts firmly in control after 52 minutes.Kiko Seike added a fourth just two minutes later following a swift counterattack to keep fifth-placed Brighton on course for a highest ever finish in the WSL.Arsenal scored a late consolation through Mariona Caldentey in stoppage time, with Jenna Nighswonger's effort then pushed on to the crossbar, leaving Slegers's squad to regroup as they aim to make sure of runners-up spot in their last league match against closest rivals Manchester United.PA MediaPhotograph: John Walton/PAWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“It’s actually going to be much easier to recruit,” she said. “A lot of top players didn’t want to join a Championship team but now we’re in WSL I think it’s going to be easier to recruit. We’re very, very excited.“We’ve been building the team to be mid-tier WSL, at a minimum, on day one. It remains to be seen, but we’ve seen so many clubs that go up and then come down, so we’ve been actually on purpose to be at least on day one someone in mid-tier, and who knows.”Explore more on these topicsLondon City LionessesWomen's Super LeagueWomen’s ChampionshipWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

Flick did not reveal his plans to replace the injured duo, but he hinted at deploying the centre-backs Ronald Araújo and Eric García or relying on the youngsters Héctor Fort or Gerard Martín in their natural positions.Koundé and Balde’s absence will pose a big challenge for Flick, withBarcelonastruggling to stop Inter’s counterattacks in the first leg, mainly through Denzel Dumfries, who was a constant menace from the right, scoring two goals and claiming an assist.View image in fullscreenDenzel Dumfries, who was brilliant down Inter’s right against Barcelona in the first leg, scores his team’s second goalPhotograph: Mattia Ozbot/Inter/Getty Images“As a coaching staff, we analyse everything. We see how a player performed in each situation and maybe we will have to make some changes because we need to defend much better,” Flick said. “Football is really complex, so it has to do with everything. It has to do with the player but we have to find the right idea of how we want to play, the match plan. Of course, the changes have to be good, but also the players have to show on the pitch who they are and what they are made of.”Barcelona, who are chasing a treble, are unbeaten domestically since late December and are leading La Liga by four points, ahead of Real. After Tuesday’s tie against Inter, they host Real in a crucial La Liga encounter that could effectively decide the title on Sunday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But now Bourne-Taylor is having to ruffle political feathers over what appears the simplest of nature-friendly measures – a small legal clause requiring all new dwellings to include a £35 hollow brick, providing homes for endangered cavity-nesting birds including swifts, house martins, sparrows and starlings.After walking naked except for a thong through London – twice – to raise awareness of the plight of swifts, winning a parliamentary debate and cross-party support for the brick, Bourne-Taylor is facing her greatest foe yet: a Labour government terrified of voters defecting to Reform.After strongly supporting Bourne-Taylor’s swift brick amendment in opposition, the Guardian understands that senior Labour ministers have privately told backbenchers that the government will whip against a newswift brick amendmenttabled for the controversial infrastructure and planning bill. A government source says the amendment is still being considered.View image in fullscreenA common swift.Photograph: Robin Chittenden/Alamy“The hypocrisy is just staggering,” said Bourne-Taylor. “I’ve heard that No 10 and Angela Rayner are worried of doing anything that’s deemed woke, and nature is in that bracket. They’re terrified about Reform and Trump. And so they don’t want to do swift bricks because it sounds a bit lefty. But nature has absolutely no business being woke or anti-woke. That’s a big problem.”It’s difficult to grasp why it’s been so difficult to tweak legislation to ensure new houses include one £35 brick but Bourne-Taylor’s illuminating new book,Nature Needs You, reveals the dirty politics blighting her against-all-odds, one-woman campaign.According to Bourne-Taylor,multibillion profit-makinghousebuilders have signalled in high-level government meetings they have no objections to the bricks, which arewidely made by conventional brick manufacturers. There is alreadya British Standard for them, which means there’s no government investment required for development, guidance or standardisation.The bricks enable new houses to boost nature, especially the drastically declining swift, whose UK populationsslumped by 66% between 1995 and 2022. Swifts once nested in caves and hollow trees but moved into house roofs centuries ago – until modern insulation and renovations have left them homeless. There are barely 40,000 breeding pairs left in Britain.As Bourne-Taylor argues, swifts and other cavity-nesting species are urban birds that bring joy to millions of city-dwellers. “We like seeing birds out of our window,” she said. “It isn’t about people or birds, it’s about life. Why on earth would any government build millions of homes that will be sterile to one of our closest ways of accessing nature? Why take away something that someone who’s old, young or immobile can see out of their window? That’s more than illogical – it’s irresponsible.”View image in fullscreenWithout the bricks ‘these birds don’t have a future in the UK’, says Bourne-Taylor.Photograph: Sam Frost/The GuardianBourne-Taylor’s new book – published this week as swifts return to Britain from sub-Saharan Africa – includes a memorable encounter with an unnamed environment secretary in which the minister tells Bourne-Taylor she ought to be grateful for the hearing she had been given; Bourne-Taylor finally snaps and accuses the minister of speaking “bullshit”.She was inspired to take action when she saved the lives of swift families whose nest holes in a roof were unwittingly blocked by a resident in her Oxfordshire village, vowing there would be a new law to help their offspring find safe nest spaces by the time they were mature three years later.“They’ll now be prospecting this year and I’ve failed them at the moment,” she said. “I made it my business and now it’s become almost solely my business. It’s a 50m-year-old existence weighing on my shoulders.”Bourne-Taylor, an author who has ghostwritten bestselling books including Anne Glenconner’s Lady in Waiting, may have joined the ranks of reforming female environmentalists from Emily Williamson and Eliza Phillips, who stopped the bird-killing plumage trade with a new law in 1921, to contemporary campaigners such as Mary Colwell, who championed thenew natural history GCSEandGeorgina Downs, who has challenged toxic pesticides.But she admits she has found it agonising campaigning for this small legal step. “I wake up every day and wonder whether I can just run away. This is very stressful. It’s emotionally, physically and financially crippled me. And the reason I’m doing it is because I have a voice. The swifts don’t have a voice.”During her campaign, she’s been trolled by everyone from ministers to abusive internet trolls. “The worst ones are not the horrible violent ones, it’s the relentless, patronising criticism from nature lovers – ‘This is just one species, this is not going to solve the nature crisis.’ Firstly, [the brick] is not just for one species. And secondly, you’d like little old me to stop pesticide use? Let me just get on that right now. We shouldn’t just get Chris Packham to do everything. The nature crisis is on us.”In private, says Bourne-Taylor, politicians “always say things like: ‘Oh, legislation is very hard.’ That’s your job. Do your job. A senior Labour minister told me that [housing minister] Matthew Pennycook was getting irritated by the mention of swift bricks, implying that I should pipe down. How about you just do it and then I’ll go away?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

If they can’t breed, they can’t exist. A simple brick can save them.“As a human in power, whether the CEO of a big housebuilder or Angela Rayner or the prime minister, why wouldn’t you take that opportunity to do something that was clearly beneficial, not just for birds but for people?”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentEndangered speciesPlanning policyConstruction industryBirdsWildlifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

His role in the negotiations raised questions for some, who began to worry that, having been a respected elder statesman on the subject – one who as prime minister crafted the UK’s first real climate measures, and made it thepriority for the UK presidency of the G8 group of countries in 2005– he might now be becoming, in the words of one Whitehall insider, “a serious threat to sensible climate policy”.Senior figures in climate science and politics began to talk to the Guardian of their worries about Blair’s activities and attempts at influence two years ago. At first the concerns were raised quietly and off the record, with no one wishing to speak out publicly. But in the past week those worries have emerged into the open after the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change (TBI), his thinktank, published a paper on Monday eveningsetting out proposals for a “reset” of global climate policy, and Blair wrote a foreword thatcontained some explosive suggestions.“In developed countries, voters feel they’re being asked to make financial sacrifices and changes in lifestyle when they know that their impact on global emissions is minimal,” he wrote. “Political leaders by and large know that the debate has become irrational. But they’re terrified of saying so, for fear of being accused of being ‘climate deniers’.”Theresponse was immediate. Nicholas Stern, the economist whose landmark review of climate change, published by Blair’s government in 2006, set the gold standard for climate economics, said: “This new report is muddled and misleading. There is far more progress being made around the world to decarbonise the global economy than it suggests … And the report downplays the science in its absence of a sense of urgency and the lack of appreciation of the need for the world to achieve net zero as soon as possible, in order to manage the growth in climate change impacts that are already hurting households and businesses across the world and in the UK. Delay is dangerous.”I worked with Tony Blair when he put climate at the heart of UK policy. He must not now undermine that | David KingRead moreBob Ward, the policy director for the Grantham Research Institute at the London School of Economics, was scathing: “This report provides weak analysis and the wrong solutions. It fails to recognise that the longer it takes to reach net zero emissions in the UK and around the world, the more that households and businesses will suffer from growing impacts of climate change.”View image in fullscreenClimate activists protest outside the Summit on the Future of Energy Security at Lancaster House in London last month.Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/Rex/ShutterstockShaun Spiers, the executive director of the Green Alliance thinktank, warned: “His report suggests that campaigners have played their part and now need to move aside: combatting climate change is a job for the elites, not ordinary people. Nothing could be more calculated to play into the hands of the populists and undermine popular support for the changes we need to see.”The TBIissued clarifications on Wednesday, complaining that its conclusions and Blair’s words had been misinterpreted, and reaffirming that the report’s authors had found in favour of net zero targets and policies. But the damage had been done. The perception that Blair was now a net zero sceptic was taken up gleefully by the Conservative party, whose leader, Kemi Badenoch, hasditched her party’s longstanding commitment to net zero.The questions raised about Blair’s position on this critical subject stem in part from the position he seems to be adopting on the climate crisis, which is increasingly out of step with the progressive voices who are battling a growing tide of net zero scepticism. So what has Blair’s role been in recent climate summits? Has he found his position moving more into alignment with the partner countries with whom he has worked steadily for the last couple of decades, in particular the Middle East and Gulf states, as some suggest?Immediately after resigning as prime minister, Blair tookup an international role as Middle East peace envoy, a position he would keep until 2015. He also moved quickly toforge lucrative partnershipsfor his thinktank and his former commercial consultancy, Tony Blair Associates, landing a multimillion-pound deal advising the Saudi Arabian government on modernising the country, evencontinuing after the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Hefacilitated deals with the Chinese for PetroSaudiand TBI was paid millions forconsultancy to the United Arab Emirates governmentin the mid-2010s.As the years have passed some climate change insiders have wondered whether keeping such company has affected Blair’s outlook. “He’s swanning around in a particular circle of people who he knew from his time in power. And of course those still in power are authoritarian and often fossil fuel nations – the democratic ones have been voted out. So that is going to distort your view,” said one former Cop adviser.View image in fullscreenBlair and the then Prince Abdullah (right) in Riyadh in 2005.Photograph: Zainal Abd Halim/ReutersAt Sharm el-Sheikh in 2022, Blair insisted on discretion. His presence sent a ripple of excitement through an otherwise turgid summit, and the Egyptian government welcomed him keenly, but his movements were kept to a small circle.Speaking to the Guardianat the time about his reasons for attending, he mentioned projects TBI was working on in Africa, particularly with Mozambique’s government.However, although he said less about this, Blair was also extremely interested in the UAE, where the government had offered in November 2021 tohold the Cop28 climate conference, scheduled for 2023, in Dubai. For some years Blair had been paid to advise the government, and during those years he had metSultan Al Jaber, the boss of the UAE’s national oil company, Adnoc, and the two had become friends. Al Jaber is one of the most powerful business figures in UAE outside the state’s royal families, and also led the team that established Masdar, UAE’s renewable energy company. For a petrostate to host a climate summit was not without precedent, but the choice ofAl Jaberas president raised protests from environmental campaigners.TBI has told the Guardian that Blair was not paid to advise Al Jaber before Cop28, though a spokesperson confirmed the UAE government (and the Saudi government) continued to be clients. Several people who worked on Cop28 have said the two talked at many stages of the summit’s preparations, though the details of what they discussed are unknown. As one person who worked in the Cop28 coordinating team said, in the early stages of preparation in early 2023: “Nothing goes out from Dr Sultan [as Al Jaber is known to his staff] without being passed by Blair.” Another person who worked in the presidency team said of that period: “There were calls, there was a lot of communication, it was a constant presence.”The Dubai Cop ended with theagreement to “transition away from fossil fuels”, the first time in three decades of climate talks that fossil fuels had been addressed head-on. Yet some have said that though Al Jaber led the effort to incorporate that language, it was simultaneously contrary to his own instincts and country’s interests. Within weeks Al Jaber had announced expansion plans for Adnoc, and Saudi Arabia – which had agreed with the consensus, so as not to embarrass its “brother” nation, UAE, by holding out – began attempting to unpick the resolution. Senior Saudi ministers argued that the commitment to transition away from fossil fuels was merely one option among many.View image in fullscreenSultan Al Jaber (centre) celebrates the end of the Cop28 climate summit in Dubai in December 2023.Photograph: Peter Dejong/APAt the nextCop in Azerbaijan(also a petrostate and also advised by Blair; TBI, which was paid for its services, sent 12 advisers to the summit, all listed as members of the host country delegation), mention of the “transition away from fossil fuels” was sidelined in the talks, and the final outcome failed to reaffirm it. Many countries and climate experts said Azerbaijan’s presidency was to blame for the failure. “The way they chose to organise the agenda ensured it could not be passed,” said one high-ranking diplomat.The eclipse of the hard-fought commitment to phase out fossil fuels appears to mirror Blair’s own thinking. In last week’s report, he wrote: “Any strategy based on either phasing out fossil fuels in the short term or limiting consumption is a strategy doomed to fail.”TBI has offered its unpaid services to Brazil,the host of this year’s Cop30 summit in November. Brazil, which hopes to reaffirm the fossil fuel phase-out commitment, as well as encouraging all countries to come forward with fresh plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions, has declined the offer.TBI rejects the idea that Blair’s links in the Middle East have any influence on his thinking. “Why don’t those who disagree with the argument TBI has set out in the paper confront the argument rather than try to impugn the motives of those who wrote it? TBI works with oil-producing countries though not in respect of the oil sector, and non-oil-producing countries including some acutely at risk from climate change,” a spokesperson said. “The issue is how we deal with climate change. And a policy based on the short-term ending of fossil fuels is simply not credible. As the facts show. Fossil fuel demand is rising not falling. And many developing countries need both the energy and the income that comes from fossil fuels.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Some of which will come from nature like afforestation and some from technologies like direct carbon capture, new nuclear, smart grids and AI tools to enhance the deployment of renewables. The Cop in Brazil exactly illustrates the point. Brazil is a leader in the fight against climate change – with a lot of clean energy and the protection of the Amazon forest. But it is also a major oil producer that over the next years will increase production. Making sense of this is the practical policy challenge and if we don’t deal with it practically, we just boost the case of those who say we should give up on the issue.”Nobody the Guardian spoke to suggested that Blair was seeking financial gain, or influenced by business interests, in taking his stance. Rather, a repeated impression was that Blair was “out of touch”. Taking in the view of the climate crisis from five-star hotels and air-conditioned towers in the Gulf petrostates, rather than from the poor and vulnerable countries on the frontlines of the crisis, may be a factor, several said.View image in fullscreenBlair talking with the then UK PM, Rishi Sunak, on the sidelines of the Cop28 climate summit in Dubai in December 2023.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PAHis influence and reach remains powerful. Tom Burke, a co-founder of the E3G green thinktank, believes his international supporters, petrostates among them, could have been the real intended audience for his blistering remarks last week. “Blair is a famous global whisperer. He is signalling to people who matter to him what a good place he is to go to for advice.”The emphasis of his work tends to be on new technologies, such as nuclear fusion and carbon capture and storage, and of technological solutions such as artificial intelligence and “disruptive invention laboratories” rather than renewables, something highly criticised by campaigners. “It might serve the interest of the Saudi groups that have given millions to the institute, but not the rest of us,” said Ami McCarthy, the head of politics at Greenpeace UK.This “tech bro” view that innovations hovering on the horizon will save us, rather than unglamorous equipment we already have but fail to use in sufficient quantity, is a dangerous one, according to David King, the chief scientific adviser in Blair’s government.He wrote in the Guardian: “Framing the climate challenge as a choice between reducing emissions and developing new technologies is misleading. We need to do both – simultaneously and urgently.”The phrase that keeps coming up, in the reactions of climate experts, is that Blair appears stuck in the past, failing to acknowledge that renewable energy and electric vehicles are much cheaper today, and their take-up is booming. “The report’s views on climate solutions are so out of date that if you found them in your fridge, you’d want to dispose of them safely,” said McCarthy. “And that’s exactly what the UK government should do with them.”Nick Mabey, the chief executive of E3G, said: “It reads like something from 15 or 20 years ago. It does not reflect the reality of today.”Like Al Jaber, Blair presents himself as a pragmatist, arguing in the recent foreword: “Present policy solutions are inadequate and, worse, are distorting the debate into a quest for a climate platform that is unrealistic and therefore unworkable.”But this approach itself raises alarm bells. Todd Stern, a former US climate envoy, hasspoken of his concernsat an increasing tendency among some senior businesspeople to advocate not against climate action, but for a slowdown in the name of “pragmatism”. He said: “We are slowed down by those who think of themselves as grownups and believe decarbonisation at the speed the climate community calls for is unrealistic. They say that we need to slow down. It’s really hard [to push for more urgency] because those ‘grownups’ have a lot of influence.” Stern has said he was not taking aim at Blair but making a more general point.So what will the impact of his argument be? TBI, amid its clarifications of the “climate reset” report, has said it was not focused on the UK, but intended to be global. However, the thinktank has taken a keen interest in UK policy, holding a series of meetings or seminar-type events with groups of new Labour MPs, covering a wide range of issues. Blair has also held meetings with the prime minister, Keir Starmer, and the arch Blairite Peter Mandelson is ambassador to the US.Several Whitehall insiders have indicated that they see the influence of Blair, and of Mandelson, in unfriendly briefings against Ed Miliband, the energy secretary.View image in fullscreen(From left) Ed Miliband, Ursula von der Leyen and Keir Starmer at an energy security summit in London last month.Photograph: WPA/Getty ImagesIf that is the case, they may have backfired. Blair’s influence on leaders in the Middle East, and rightwing populists, may be waxing, but within the UK government it seems firmly on the wane. Last Thursday,Starmer hosted an international conference on energy securityin London. In front of political leaders and senior officials from 60 countries, including the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, the prime minister said that tackling the climate crisis was “in the DNA of my government. [We are] acting now, with a muscular industrial policy, to seize the opportunities [in low-carbon technology] to boost investment, build new industries, drive UK competitiveness, and unlock export opportunities. That is the change we need. We won’t wait – we will accelerate.”It was a weighty intervention, hard to row back from, and an unmistakable vote of confidence in his energy secretary. Starmer left the stage to applause and a beaming Miliband.But just a few days later, Reform UK, whose leader, Nigel Farage, never fails to mention “net zero madness”,took a formerly safe seat from Labour. It will be a strange irony if Tony Blair, once seen as the saviour of progressive politics, is increasingly allied with some of its bitterest enemies.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisTony BlairGreen politicsFossil fuelsSaudi ArabiaUnited Arab EmiratesMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now they are turning to the ECHR.In their submission to the ECHR, they will argue that the UK is out of compliance with human rights requirements in how it currently plans for and implements climate adaptation under the Climate Change Act.View image in fullscreenDoug Paulley (centre) has multiple disabilities exacerbated by rising temperatures.Photograph: Yui Mok/PAIn a move that may bolster their case, last week the UK’s statutory climate watchdog, the Climate Change Committee, issued ascathing assessment of the UK’s climate change preparedness.It judged current plans to protect people, land and infrastructure against extreme weather to be inadequate in the face of the increasingly severe flooding, droughts and heatwaves now affecting the country.Paulley said: “I’m very hopeful that the ECHR will now take up this important case. Disabled people, who are disproportionately threatened by the impacts of climate change, have been badly let down by this weak and ineffective adaptation programme.”Jordan said: “Millions of homes across the country are already under threat from the impacts of climate change, and without an adaptation plan that’s fit for purpose many, many more will be put at risk.“I know what it’s like to lose your home to climate change and will continue to campaign for a vastly improved set of adaptation policies that offers proper protection to our lives and communities.”The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it could not comment on ongoing legal proceedings.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisEuropean court of human rightsFriends of the EarthHuman rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

Outside the rink, a bonfire crackles, keeping spectators warm as they watch the game.Broomball has been played for more than a century in northern Ontario. The game is similar to hockey, but players use a ball instead of a puck and wear specialized shoes rather than skates. Now 31, Oombash started playing the game at age 11. Her dad is a coach and taught her to play. “It’s a big sport. Everybody plays broomball or hockey,” she said.Oombash organized today’s broomball tournament in Cat Lake First Nation, a remote Ojibway community of 650 people nestled about 500km north of Lake Superior as a way to encourage teenagers to socialize. She pointed at two boys on the same team. “These boys here, you would never see them talk. But in broomball, they can play together. They get along very well,” she said.View image in fullscreenJanelle Oombash stands on the smooth ice of an outdoor rink, keeping score of a broomball game in Cat Lake, Ontario, Canada, on 1 March.Photograph: Ed OuBut these broomball games are becoming a rare occurrence. Cat Lake has no indoor arena, affording them only a few weeks of ice each winter. “We used to have tournaments every few weeks, but we haven’t been able to do that because the ice goes bad really early,” Oombash said. “It’s been disappointing.”The outdoor rink opened in early February but then closed for a week due towarm temperatures, cancelling broomball and hockey practice for adults as they prepared to travel outside the community for competitive regional tournaments. “That was supposed to be the week we had practice, but we cut it because of how warm it was,” she explained. “We don’t know how long we’re going to have this ice.”Theclimate crisisis pilingincreasing pressure onIndigenous communities’ constitutionally protected rights and traditions. Global heating is changing the migration patterns of animals that are crucial sources of food, and endangering sacred plants such as sage, burned in ceremonies, and black ash, used to weave baskets and make medicine.View image in fullscreenIn northern Ontario, warming temperatures threaten wintertime events such as broomball.Photograph: The GuardianIn northern Ontario, warming temperatures are threatening wintertime events such as broomball, hockey, ice fishing and goose hunting. Shorter winter seasons and disappearing ice are forcing subarctic communities to adapt.“I’m hoping they build an arena so we could play all year round,” Oombash said. “Because we all know the climate is going to change. We all know it’s going to get warmer and warmer.”‘The ice is not freezing as it should’: supply roads to Canada’s Indigenous communities under threat from climate crisisRead moreThe landscape of northern Ontario consists of evergreen forests and spongy muskeg cut through by intertwined lakes and rivers. Dozens of remote First Nations are scattered across the north, accessible only by plane and thousands of kilometres of ice roads. In winter, the lakes freeze solid and snow cloaks the landscape, allowing people to travel overland to hunting camps.Winter is prime hunting season in Eabametoong First Nation, a remote community of about 1,600 people. It’s the time of year that the lake surrounding the community freezes solid, enabling people to drive across and join family members in nearby communities for hunting trips.In March, Eabametoong resident Martha Papah was looking forward to spending the weekend at her adult son’s hunting camp in the neighbouring community of Neskantaga. They planned to hunt beaver for meat and pelts, which can be made into blankets, hats or gloves. Beaver is a delicacy in winter because the animals haven’t yet had the chance to eat plants that make their meat bitter. “This time of year is good if you want to have beaver,” she said.To reach Neskantaga, Papah must drive over anice roadthat crosses a 5.5km-wide frozen lake, with ice that has become thinner and more treacherous in recent years. “I’m excited, and at the same time, you have to be on guard on the ice road. We drive really slow when we cross the lake. It’s dangerous for us,” she said.View image in fullscreenA truck traverses a frozen lake leading to Eabametoong First Nation in Ontario, Canada, on 4 March.Photograph: Ed Ou/The GuardianThere is no all-season road connecting the two communities and no direct flights. To visit her son without a winter road, Papah would need to fly 360kmsouth to Thunder Bay, and then 420km north to Neskantaga, at a cost of C$1,500 (US$1,085) round trip. “It’s much cheaper to go on the winter road,” she said.Warmer temperatures are especially affecting the spring goose hunt. In fall, Canadian geese flock south in iconic V-shape formations, returning in spring to their northern breeding grounds. It’s the one time of year that geese gorge themselves to prepare for migration and breeding, which means more meat on the birds for hunters. This meat provides not only a traditional source of food, but an alternative to expensive groceries at the Northern Store.Global warming has disrupted every activity we do, like hunting for sustenance. So it’s becoming really difficultSolomon Atlookan, Eabametoong chiefIn April, hunters and their families travel to camps, where they shoot geese and cook the meat over campfires. They typically travel by snowmobile across the frozen land. But in recent years, open water has appeared along the lakes and rivers, cutting off travel. “Global warming has disrupted every activity we do, like hunting for sustenance. So it’s becoming really difficult,” said Solomon Atlookan, Eabametoong’s chief.“We used to go to our traditional territory way ’til late April on a snowmobile, and we had a lot of snow,” he said. “In the last five years, none of us have gone there, to go spend a week and hunt geese during their migration, because there’s no snow.”Eabametoong resident John Meeseetawaygeesic spends months each year out on the land, hunting, fishing and trapping – activities he shares on social media to followers all over the world. But travelling overland is riskier these days. “I have to be cautious, I have to take my time and have to be careful,” he said. “It’s not the way it used to be. Used to go anywhere before, but not now. You have to observe everywhere you go now. It’s dangerous now.”View image in fullscreenJohn Meeseetawaygeesic flies to Thunder Bay from Eabametoong First Nation, Ontario, Canada, on 7 March.Photograph: Ed OuHe said the April goose hunt was more complicated now. “Because of the ice melting, we can’t really go anywhere. Years ago, when the ice was good and the snow was there, we would be everywhere. But now we can’t really do that because the ice has been melting too fast.”‘Sea, ice, snow ... it’s all changing’: Inuit struggle with warming worldRead moreHe added that migration patterns of animals were changing. “We’re not catching anything, and now we don’t know where the animals are going.”On 7 March, Meeseetawaygeesic boarded a small, 40-seat plane. He gripped the arms of his seat as the plane lifted off the short runway. These bumpy, low-flying planes make him nervous.When he’s not hunting, Meeseetawaygeesic coaches the local men’s hockey team, Pick Your Poison. He and his teammates boarded the plane heading south to Thunder Bay, toward their final destination of Dryden, Ontario. Held in March every year, the Northern men’s hockey tournament in Dryden is the biggest event of the year for hockey teams in the north. “We’ve been hitting all the tournaments this winter, so I think we’re ready for the big one.,” Meeseetawaygeesic said.The previous week, Pick Your Poison won a smaller tournament and used the prize money to pay for their flights. Normally, hockey players from northern communities drive south along ice roads to reach the big tournament, but these routes are becoming unreliable. A few nights earlier, Meeseetawaygeesic’s truck got stranded on a winter road. Warm temperatures made the road’s snowy surface softer than usual, and his truck became trapped in the snow. So they had to fly.View image in fullscreenBecause of warm temperatures, Pick Your Poison had to fly to the annual men’s hockey tournament in Dryden, Ontario.Photograph: The GuardianThe winter roads that freeze each year make it cheaper for teams to travel to tournaments. But spring is arriving earlier each year, cutting short the winter road season. “With climate change, some of the reserves up north will have a hard time going home after the tournament next week because of the melting of the snow and ice,” he said.To motivate his team, Meeseetawaygeesic tells them: “Play hard, play smart, have fun. Winning is not everything. Even losing is not everything. It’s a matter of being out there and enjoying yourself and meeting other people.” After arriving in Dryden, Pick Your Poison went on to win the championship in the B-side division.This story was supported by the Pulitzer CenterExplore more on these topicsCanada (World news)Climate crisisIndigenous peoplesCanada (Weather)WinterAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Unlike the Tories and Labour, we are proud of our country and history.”However, the party was also attacked for a policy that would apparently spell the end of councils flying Ukrainian flags in solidarity with the country after Russia launched its full-scale invasion. The Ukrainian flag was flying above Grimsby town hall last week where the party celebrated one of its key victories, the taking of the newly created Greater Lincolnshire mayoralty.Mike Tapp, the Labour MP for Dover and Deal, said on Monday: “As VE Day reminds us, Britain has a proud history of working with allies to defeat dictators and tyrants.“It tells you all you need to know about Nigel Farage’s Reform that their very first act after winning elections is to ban the Ukrainian flag from our town halls, in this of all weeks.“Farage and Reform councillors should stop sucking up to Moscow and drop their ban on flying the Ukrainian flag immediately.”The position of Farage and others associated with Reform towards Russia has long been one of the party’s achilles heels.One of Labour’s regular attack lines against Farage, who wascriticised for suggesting the west “provoked” Russia’s invasion ofUkraineby expanding the EU and Nato eastwards, has been to accuse him of “fawning” over Vladimir Putin.Reform UK took control of 10 councils in Englandat last week’s local elections, including Durham, Lancashire, Staffordshire and Kent. It is also the largest party in a number of local authorities including Leicestershire county council.The Conservative MP for Hinckley and Bosworth, Dr Luke Evans, asked whether it meant “Leicestershire county council would not be able to fly the Leicestershire county flag”.Explore more on these topicsReform UKUkraineEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

This trivialisation of serious global financial threats undermines our fight against money laundering and kleptocracy – and it ultimately makes Britain less safe.“It is deeply disappointing that the BVI and other overseas territories continue to delay the implementation of vital transparency measures. The UK must now look seriously at how to ensure these longstanding commitments are delivered.”Granting access to ownership data to those with a “legitimate interest” is seen as a stepping stone to full publicly accessible registers of beneficial ownership , a measure that ministers and campaign groups believe should become the global norm in an international crackdown on financial crime.Phil Brickell, who is a member of the same APPG that Powell chairs, said: “While I welcome efforts to promote doing business the right way anywhere, surely time and money would be better spent lifting the veil of corporate secrecy in the British Virgin Islands which has been used by the world’s crooks and kleptocrats to clean and stash their dirty cash.”A spokesperson for the BVI said Riley Right was a “simple and effective way to engage the wider community and enhance understanding”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

All three men in that investigation remain in custody.But the main focus of government, counter-terrorism police and Britain’s security services is on what they believe was a thwarted attack plot, with arrests made amid fears that the unleashing of violence could have been staged soon.Those arrested, all male, were a 29-year-old detained in the Swindon area, a 46-year-old man who was arrested in west London, a 29-year-old man held in Cheadle Hume, in the Stockport area, and a 40-year-old was detained at gunpoint in Rochdale.All four were arrested under terrorism laws for allegedly planning terrorist acts and warrants to detain them until this Saturday have been granted by magistrates.Police said a 24-year-old man arrested in the Manchester area had been released on bail, but with conditions restricting his freedoms.The arrests followed a joint operation by counter-terrorism police and the security service MI5.Investigators do not believe the target was a synagogue as some news outlets have suggested, but will not comment whether the “specific premises” that faced the potential threat was linked to Britain’s Jewish community.The plot was more sophisticated than recent lone actor terrorism attacks seen in the UK, police believe.The result of searches of electronic devices is being examined by detectives.Murphy said: “Our officers and staff are progressing what is a significant and highly complex investigation, and we still have searches and activity under way at multiple addresses across the country.“We are working incredibly hard, with public safety at the forefront of our ongoing efforts.“We believe that a specific premises was the target of this suspected plot and counter-terrorism policing officers remain in close contact with the affected premises.“At this time, we will not be providing further information about the suspected target for reasons of operational security and public safety.“As always, I would ask the public to remain vigilant and if they see or hear anything that concerns them, then to contact us.”Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, has said the arrests in the “two major operations” over the weekend reflected some of the biggest threats “we have seen in recent years”.Ken McCallum, the head of MI5, said in October 2024 that Tehran was behind “plot after plot” in the UK and that MI5 had uncovered five new planned attacks last year, usually against dissidents, taking the total since January 2022 to 20.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

At the event’s heart, however, were the VVIP second world war veterans, those remaining few who bore actual witness then and who today serve to remind.Back in 1945, Britain allowed itself a brief period of rejoicing on VE Day, with overwhelming relief and optimism at Germany’s surrender after long wartime years of deprivation and huge loss of life on all sides.On Monday, the first of four days of commemorations, tribute was paid with a 1,300-strong military procession, a flypast, marching bands, massed pipes and drums, and youth cadets.The procession set off from beneath the bronze gaze of Churchill’s statue in Parliament Square and ended outside the palace. Elsewhere, street parties were held across the UK.Thousands crowded on to the Mall, many waving red, white and blue flags. Watching from a dais on the Queen Victoria Memorial were the king, queen, senior royals and the prime minister, Keir Starmer, sitting alongside those who had served in the war and who were wrapped up both in their memories and against the spring chill.View image in fullscreenKing Charles, Keir Starmer and war veteran Joy Trew take in the military procession.Photograph: Chris Jackson/Getty ImagesAs Big Ben fell silent, the actor Timothy Spall boomed aloud words from Churchill’s victory speech beginning: “My dear friends, this is your hour.”Alan Kennett, a 100-year-old Normandy veteran, then started the parade as he was handed the Commonwealth War Graves torch for peace. In 1945, Kennett, from Lichfield, was in Celle, near Belsen, in a cinema with other men in his unit, when they were told the war had ended. “The whole place erupted and of course it became one great party,” he recalled.UK armed forces personnel were joined by representatives from Commonwealth and Nato allies. A detachment of Ukrainian military, selected from the UK armed forces’ training programme for Ukrainian recruits, offered a reminder that while VE Day marked peace, war continued today in many corners of the world.View image in fullscreenVeterans Olga Hopkins and John Mortimer (known as Jack Mortimer) take their places on the West Terrace in the gardens of Buckingham Palace, to view the flypast of aircraft.Photograph: Jordan Pettitt/AFP/Getty ImagesA Buckingham Palace tea party for 30 second world war veterans aged from 98 to 104, and about 20 evacuees and others who lived through the war, was hosted by the king and queen.Those invited included a 98-year-old former prisoner of war, a 99-year-old who served in the Desert Rats and took part in the D-day landings, and a 100-year-old woman who worked in the Special Operations Executive (SOE), known as Churchill’s secret army.Prince George attended with his parents. His father, the Prince of Wales, spoke to Alfred Littlefield, a 101-year-old Royal Engineers D-day veteran, of the importance of preserving veterans’ stories. William smiled as he shook hands with veterans and said it was very important for George and the next generation to hear stories from those who fought in the war.Starmer hosted a tea party in Downing Street, with guests served a menu including Victoria sponge cake, scotch eggs and pork pies.A flypast of 23 historical and current aircraft, including a Lancaster Bomber and the famous Red Arrows streaming red, white and blue, flew over the crowd in the Mall and the royals watching from the palace balcony to conclude Monday’s official commemorations.View image in fullscreenThe Prince and Princess of Wales and their children George, Louis and Charlotte watch the flypast from the Buckingham Palace balcony.Photograph: Aaron Chown/APAnother of those invited to the palace tea party was Joyce Wilding, 100, who enlisted at 18 into the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry and worked in the SOE. Recalling VE Day, she said: “We went to Piccadilly where there was a stream of people singing and dancing. We joined a crocodile and did the palais glide down Piccadilly. There were soldiers up lamp-posts, it was extraordinary.”Bernard Morgan, a 101-year-old RAF D-day veteran who worked as a codebreaker, received a secret telegraph message two days before VE Day that read: “German war now over, surrender effective sometime tomorrow.” When it was officially confirmed on 8 May, he and his comrades lit a huge bonfire and celebrated until late into the night.He said: “It’s so important that we make the most of these opportunities to remember what happened, not just to celebrate the achievement but also to ensure that such horrors never happen again.”A picture caption on this article was amended on 5 May 2025.

Because look, these are shared challenges.”Daniel Moylan, the Conservative transport spokesperson, said on Monday that the prime minister had cast his reset of relations with the EU as a “magic bullet” to deliver on Labour’s manifesto pledge to “smash the gangs” when it came to illegal Channel crossings.“It’s not working. He needs to start taking action in the UK and stop creeping to Brussels,” Lord Moylan added.A UK government spokesperson said: “We are not providing a running commentary on our discussions with the EU. These are ongoing and cover a wide range of issues.“Together we want to build a safer, more secure and more prosperous UK and we have been clear that we will always act in the national interest to secure the best outcomes for the UK.”The European Commission has been approached for comment.In the absence of a deal on giving access to Eurodac and Schengen data, one area of potential progress revolves around work and travel freedoms. The EU is prepared to make major concessions in negotiations to allow British and European 18- to 30-year-olds to travel and work freely,the Guardian reported last month.However, there have been suggestions that figures in the British government have made access to EU databases a “red line” in negotiations over such a youth mobility scheme.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The others are on foreign policy and security cooperation and growth and trade cooperation.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumEuropean UnionEuropeMigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Despite his cheeky side Layton had an absolute heart of gold and would do anything for anyone.”The family added: “He was loved by all that met him, and it showed. He was a family boy that loved his mam and sisters more than anything in the world. Layton, we love you more than any words can ever explain. You will be missed more than you’ll ever know. Our bright and beautiful boy.”A fundraiser to support his family has raised more than £15,000. Set up by a friend of the family, more than 1,200 people have donated money to pay for a headstone and funeral expenses, and to provide financial support to Layton’s mother.“Can’t imagine what the family are going through, but know that people all over your community want to help you,” one donor wrote.In a message to the boy’s mother, another donor said she was “thinking and praying for you and Layton so much, he had such a beautiful smile”.The fire broke out near Fairfield industrial park, in the Bill Quay area of Gateshead, at about 8pm on Friday evening. Layton died at the scene.Thirteen boys and three girls, all aged between 11 and 14, were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter. They have been released on bail pending further inquiries.“As a family we would like to say a massive thank you to all that helped in finding Layton,” his family said. “A massive thank you to the police and all services involved. We’re incredibly grateful for the work that you do every day to bring closure to families like ours.”Anyone with information in relation to the incident has been asked to contact Northumbria police directly.“Our thoughts remain with Layton’s family at this devastating time,” said DCI Louise Jenkins of Northumbria police. “Our specialist officers will continue to support them in any way we can. We ask that their privacy be respected at this time.“I would remind everyone not to speculate on details of the incident online or in the community – what might seem like a simple post on social media could disrupt an ongoing investigation.”She added: “Circulation of malicious communications is classed as a criminal offence and those who choose to be involved could face prosecution. It’s also important to note that anyone suspected of a crime must not be named publicly for legal reasons and those who are under 18 have anonymity.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The UK is among the countries offering film-makers generous tax incentives.1:04Donald Trump announces tariff on movies from 'other nations'  – videoThe US president said he had already ordered the commerce department and the US trade representative to begin instituting such a tariff. He said on his Truth Social platform the issue was a “national security threat” because of the “concerted effort by other nations” to attract productions.“Hollywood is being destroyed,” he later told reporters. “Other nations have stolen our movie industry.”His outburst caused immediate concern in the UK, a regular location for some of Hollywood’s biggest movie productions, including Barbie, parts of the Mission: Impossible franchise and Disney’s Star Wars productions. More big movies are scheduled to be shot in the UK soon, including Star Wars: Starfighter.Philippa Childs, the head of the creative industries union Bectu, said: “These tariffs, coming after Covid and the recent slowdown, could deal a knockout blow to an industry that is only just recovering, and will be really worrying news for tens of thousands of skilled freelancers who make films in the UK.“The government must move swiftly to defend this vital sector and support the freelancers who power it, as a matter of essential national economic interest.”One senior figure in the British creative sector said: “If it becomes real, it will be huge. It could possibly wipe out the British film industry and its crews.”Trump’s movie tariffs are designed to destroy the international film industryRead moreThe international feature film production spend in the UK was £1.9bn last year, with high-end TV production bringing in £2.8bn. Investment from the US on filmsincreased 83%from the previous year.Adrian Wootton, the chief executive of the British Film Commission, said the announcement was “clearly concerning” but said it was crucial to know more about the details of the plans.“We will be meeting with government and our industry policy group in the coming days to discuss further,” he said. “The UK and US have long enjoyed a strong, shared history of film-making.”Senior politicians are calling for Keir Starmer’s government to prioritise the UK film industry in US trade talks, though sources have already told the Guardian that a deal is asecond-order priorityfor Trump.Caroline Dinenage, the chair of the culture, media and sport committee, said: “Last month the committee warned against complacency on our status as the Hollywood of Europe. President Trump’s announcement has made that warning all too real.“Making it more difficult to make films in the UK is not in the interest of American businesses. Their investment in facilities and talent in the UK, based on US-owned IP, is showing fantastic returns on both sides of the Atlantic. Ministers must urgently prioritise this as part of the trade negotiations currently under way.”James Frith, a Labour member of the committee, said any tariffs on UK film production would be self-defeating.“Any US tariffs on foreign-made films would harm not just British jobs and creativity but also the US studios and audiences who rely on our skilled workforce and production expertise,” he said. “It is in everyone’s interest to protect this deep, highly successful partnership.”Industry insiders said it was unclear how the tariffs would work in practice, warning they would end up penalising US studios and cutting production and jobs.Trump is facing resistance in the US from the likes of Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, whose office said the president had no authority to impose such tariffs.Trump’s declaration was not a complete surprise to industry and government insiders, given his previous declaration that he wanted to help “troubled” Hollywood.Before his inauguration, he appointed Sylvester Stallone, Mel Gibson and Jon Voight as “special ambassadors” charged with bringing back production lost to “foreign countries”.Film and television production in Los Angeles has fallen by nearly 40% over the past decade, according to FilmLA, a non-profit that tracks the region’s production.Trump’s move could also be a reaction to a decision by the China Film Administrationin Aprilto “moderately reduce the number of American films imported”, in response to US tariffs on China.Trump’s attack on the film industry is a sign of xenophobic contempt | Jesse HassengerRead moreStephen Galloway, a former editor of the Hollywood Reporter, said: “There is a gigantic problem, which Trump’s social media post addresses, which is that Hollywood has been decimated – there has been a complete flight of production from Los Angeles.“It’s a locomotive that’s going faster and faster and – based on the expense of living and shooting in Los Angeles, and tax breaks and subsidies from different states and other countries, and the strength of the dollar – that all makes foreign production a bargain. There’s an arms race among states and countries to up the tax breaks and subsidies they offer.”Galloway suggested Trump may be acting out of a romantic fantasy, much like imagining that under steel tariffs Pittsburgh could once again become a place of US steel production, when in reality there are now about 5,000 steel mill jobs in the area.“Hollywood is the source of all modern romantic fantasy, but can you restore it to its golden age? No, you can’t,” he said. “Everyone would love to do it, but the invention of the computer chip destroyed Hollywood as we knew it as a film manufacturing hub.“There’s a contradiction between ‘let’s preserve Hollywood as the centre of manufacturing’ and ‘let’s protect ourselves from foreign propaganda’. But if foreign propaganda is a Disney movie that happened to be shot in Pinewood, what kind of propaganda is that?”A UK government spokesperson said: “Talks on an economic deal between the US and the UK are ongoing – but we are not going to provide a running commentary on the details of live discussions or set any timelines because it is not in the national interest.“We will continue to take a calm and steady approach to talks and aim to find a resolution to help ease the pressure on UK businesses and consumers.”Amid confusion over how any tariff could work in the complicated process of movie-making, a White House spokesperson said no final decision had been made on new levies. They said all options were being explored to deliver on Trump’s concern over Hollywood.Explore more on these topicsFilm industryTrump tariffsTariffsTelevision industrynewsShareReuse this content"

That’s why this pro-business government is determined to improve the total business environment including for small businesses.”The spokesperson said the DBT wanted to work with banks​ “to create opportunities for businesses to access the finance they need to scale, export and break into new markets”.Representatives of the banking industry are expected to say that banks are ready to lend more funds to SMEs, but the high level of risk means the government needs to widen a scheme that underwrites loans.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Lobby group UK Finance has argued that the scheme’s funding needs to be backed with more cash before banks will increase the number of loans.Gareth Thomas, the minister for small businesses who will chair the meeting with the finance industry, is known to be frustrated that many SMEs have lost touch with local bank branches and are forced to obtain loans via online forms.Thomas, who was chair of the Co-operative party for eight years until 2019, has argued that mutual lenders, which are big providers of business loans in Germany, should be supported in the UK to provide access to credit.Last year an all-party committee of MPs said unfair banking practices and “damaging” financial regulations were harming small businesses and putting innovation and growth at risk.MPs on the Treasury committee said an extensive inquiry found that a lack of supportive policies were compounding problems for companies that had survived a “torrid” five years, which included the recent energy crisis and high level of inflation.The committee’s report also highlighteda growing concern about “debanking”– when customers’ accounts are closed by their bank – noting that lenders had shut 140,000 SME accounts in 2023 alone, often without adequate explanation.Explore more on these topicsBankingFinancial sectorRachel ReevesnewsShareReuse this content"

The people who run Macmillan just don’t understand that. They have betrayed everything Douglas Macmillan [who founded the charity 114 years ago] stood for – that those with cancer should not be forced into poverty, but here we are, all those years later, where that is now a reality.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is well known inside Macmillan just how much of a godsend the welfare advisers are to people with cancer.“I just don’t understand why they are getting rid of a service that so many thousands of people rely on, while at the same time, hiring senior people on large salaries.“I get why cuts may have to be made, the climate we are in, but I don’t understand why the welfare advisers are the ones to be cut, why the frontline has to be cut, when there are so many senior people sat in offices discussing strategy and in meetings all day.”A Citizens Advice spokesperson said: “We are in ongoing discussions with Macmillan to understand the implications of funding changes and how sustainable benefits advice for cancer care patients could be delivered in the future.”Macmillan has insisted it cannot “keep doing everything we previously did” because in recent years itsincome – £233m in 2023– has failed to keep pace with expenditure (£262m in 2023). But critics fear frontline services for the poorest patients appear to be bearing the brunt of the cuts.Macmillan-funded Citizens Advice staff are in a number of areas integrated into NHS cancer services and operate directly from hospitals so that patients can ask about money worries in the same place where they are treated.

These are the combined results of three commercial food sensitivity tests that are sold online and have surged in popularity in recent years.There’s just one problem: I experience no discernible symptoms with any of these foods in my daily life, and among all of these items there is no single food that all three tests agreed on.The popularity of commercial food sensitivity tests has exploded in recent years. Dieticians and allergists attribute this to a general increased interest and excitement around gut health, and the difficulty of getting a diagnosis for troublesome gut symptoms via the NHS.Many people buy them in the hope of diagnosing intolerances like lactose and histamine sensitivity, which are often caused by people not producing enough of certain enzymes that break down those substances.But the promise of a diagnosis from a quick and easy test collides with the reality of how intolerances are actually identified.“The reality is that the only way to really find out if you’ve got a food intolerance is exclusion and reintroduction of specific items from your diet, which is hard work,” said Prof Adam Fox, who specialises in paediatric allergy at King’s College London and is a spokesperson for theBritish Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology. “It is such an attractive idea that you can just book a test, and it will tell you. But the dangers are over and underdiagnosis, and both of those have potential risks.”Various intolerance or sensitivity tests are available, but the most common are immunoglobulin G (IgG) blood tests, which analyse a small sample of self-collected blood for antibodies (immunoglobulins) to specific foods; and bioresonance testing, which claims to detect “energy fields” from samples of hair and compares these to food-related energy fields.Although these tests are performed by accredited labs – meaning their equipment and methodologies produceconsistent results – medical experts say the tests themselves are unscientific and unproven and that taking their recommendations at face value could have serious consequences for people’s health.View image in fullscreenLinda Geddes tried out three food allergy/sensitivity tests that can be ordered online.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianDr Sammie Gill, a specialist gastroenterology dietitian, and spokesperson for theBritish Dietetic Association, said: “Not only are people spending their money on expensive tests that are completely invalid, but they often exacerbate stress, anxiety and development of disordered eating.”Some home tests also detect immunoglobulin E (IgE) in blood – a validated scientific test for allergies, but one that experts say should only be interpreted in the context of someone’s clinical history.Fox said: “Using an allergy test on its own is a waste of time and could be dangerous because they can diagnose people with allergies they don’t have or tell them they’re not allergic to something when they are.”Sensitivities are also common. A reaction to gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye and barley may be flagged by a test – but isn’t the same thing as celiac disease, an autoimmune disease; or wheat allergy, where the immune system overreacts to proteins in wheat.Curious about what such tests might say about me, I ordered IgG and IgG/E blood tests from Supply Life and Cerascreen (costing £207 and £109.90 respectively), plus a bioresonance hair test from Check My BodyHealth(costing £28).Together, these tests identified a list of 80 foods that I am “highly reactive” to, and a further 31 that I am slightly or moderately reactive to. However, there was no single food item that all three tests agreed on. And in many cases, items given a red flag by one test were given a green flag by another.For instance, a blood sample test from Cerascreen based on tests for IgG4 antibodies suggested that I showed a strong reaction to almonds, rye, sesame, spelt, kiwi and turkey, while a test based on a strand of my hair from Check My Body Health found no reactivity to any of these.The only foods that both Cerascreen and Supply Life agreed that I might be sensitive to using their IgG tests, were almonds, potatoes and hazelnuts – all of which I eat regularly without any issues.Gill said: “All three tests report an alarmingly high number of foods that should be avoided or cautioned.A long-term restrictive diet deprives your body of essential nutrients and not only increases the risk of nutritional deficiencies, but chronic health conditions such as osteoporosis or impaired immune function leading to an increased risk of illness and infection.“The complete lack of consistency between the three different tests, alongside the fact you report having no issues consuming foods labelled ‘red’ or ‘orange’ simply reinforces the fact that these tests are nonsensical.”Cerascreen’s tests also identified nine items to which I showed IgE sensitisation, a crucial step in the development of allergic reactions. This included strong sensitisation to peanuts and hazelnuts, even though I regularly eat these without any symptoms.After studying these results, Fox correctly guessed that I suffer from hay fever. “This means that many foods, such as peanut and hazelnut will come up high, because they contain proteins very similar to pollen,” he said.“This can give confusing false positives: you are clearly OK with peanut as you eat it regularly with no ill effect, but this nicely illustrates how using the test without the correct clinical context can result in very inappropriate overdiagnosis. Importantly in younger children, avoiding allergenic foods can increase the risk of allergy developing, so these tests could actually promote kids getting allergies.”Although Cerascreen’s report clarified that “if you do not experience any symptoms when eating the food, you should not remove it from your diet”, and Supply Life offered me the opportunity to discuss my results with a dietician, stressing that “any change in diet needs to be carefully managed”, Check My Body Health advised removing all high and moderate reactivity items from my daily diet for six to eight weeks, then reintroducing them one by one while closely monitoring for symptoms.View image in fullscreenInterpretations of test results by a professional are needed to stop overdiagnosis, academics told Linda Geddes.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianHowever, it stated that bioresonance therapy is categorised as a complementary and alternative medicine, and that “tests and related information provided do not make a medical diagnosis nor is it intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment”.Dr Marc Dangers, the head of product and lab at Cerascreen said it was crucial to understand that differing methodologies and the specific antibodies or markers each test measures can indeed lead to varied results, and acknowledged “ongoing scientific discussion surrounding the clinical significance of IgG4 antibodies in diagnosing food intolerances”.“It is important to emphasise that our tests offer an initial indication and are not intended as a definitive diagnosis,” Dangers said. “We strongly encourage individuals to interpret our findings in conjunction with their personal experiences and any symptoms they may be experiencing. Dietary modifications should only be contemplated under the guidance of a qualified healthcare professional, particularly when no symptoms are apparent after consuming the identified foods.”He added that Cerascreen consistently advises individuals with positive IgE results to consult with an allergist for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.Supply Life clarified that it measured all four types of IgG to show whether the immune system was mounting any response to food, while IgG4 tests only measured an antibody that arrived later on in the inflammatory process. Check My Body Health didn’t respond when approached for comment.Despite these criticisms, customer testimonials on the companies’ websites suggest that at least some people have been helped by these tests. Supply Life pointed to a recent survey of 1,586 customers, which found that 86% reported benefits to their symptoms as a result of doing the tests, rising to 94% who followed their dietary reccommendations for six weeks or more.Gill said that this is possible. “If you’re over-restricting and cutting out multiple foods, the chances are you might be unknowingly removing the one or two foods that are actually causing you symptoms. If you are eating less, there is also a lower chance of triggering gut symptoms, and you might feel better in the short-term,” she said.A placebo effect may also contribute to a temporary improvement in people’s symptoms. “Imagine trying to cut out milk, egg etc. It would be very hard work, and you would likely briefly feel better, simply because you feel you are taking control and likely generally looking after yourself better,” said Fox. “However, this soon passes and there would be no health gain for a lot of effort and a risk to the nutritional quality of your diet.”Given that I experience no food-related symptoms, I won’t be taking up this advice and I will continue to spoon peanut butter on my breakfast with abandon. Gill stresses that food should be a source of enjoyment: “Being told that you must cut out multiple different foods removes the pleasure from eating.” I agree.What is the difference between a food allergy, a sensitivity and an intolerance?Although these terms are sometimes used interchangeably there are key differences between food allergies and intolerances (also known as sensitivities), including how they are managed.Food allergies involve the immune system overreacting to a harmless substance, and may affect the whole body or just a small area. There are two main types: IgE-mediated food allergies are the most common, and typically occur within seconds or minutes of eating. Symptoms range from mild to life-threatening, and could include a rash and/or itching of the skin; swelling of the lips, tongue or throat; wheezing and vomiting. Symptoms of non-IgE-mediated food allergies may take hours or days to develop, and could include abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea.Food intolerances don’t involve the immune system, and are caused by difficulties digesting certain foods. Symptoms are usually localised to the gut, and although unpleasant, are not life-threatening. These typically include abdominal pain, bloating, excess wind and diarrhoea or constipation. Also, whereas food allergy symptoms can be triggered with very small amounts of the substance, people with a food intolerance may be able to eat small quantities without any gut-related issues.Are there any clinically validated tests for detecting these conditions?IgE-mediated food allergies can be detected using skin prick tests, where a small amount of allergen is introduced into the skin and observed for a reaction, or blood tests that look for IgE antibodies specific to certain foods.Prof Adam Fox said: “For most food allergies, the higher the number that comes back, the more likely it is that you’re allergic – but that doesn’t mean that if the test is negative, you’re not allergic, or if the number is very high, that you are allergic,” which means they should be interpreted alongside a patient’s clinical history. “The most reliable test is what happens when you eat the substance – so what is the clinical context?” he said.There are no reliable clinical tests for non-IgE-mediated allergies or food intolerances, apart from lactose intolerance, a condition where the body struggles to digest a sugar found in milk and dairy products. Other intolerances and non-IgE allergies are typically diagnosed by taking a detailed medical history, and then carefully eliminating and reintroducing the suspected food,under the guidance of a healthcare professional.What about IgG blood tests and hair resonance tests?IgG antibodies are produced by the immune system in response to foreign substances like food antigens. However, many medical societies advise against using IgG tests to diagnose food intolerance. “IgG antibodies are produced in response to foods you eat on a regular basis – they simply indicate repeated food exposure,” said Dr Sammie Gill. “In summary, if you eat food, you’ll likely produce IgG. It’s completely normal.”Raised IgG to certain foods may even be an indicator that people can tolerate eating them. Fox said: “They are typically raised to foods you eat regularly without a problem”.Bioresonance testing involves analysing the electromagnetic frequencies emitted by an individual’s hair sample and comparing them to frequencies emitted by various substances such as foods, minerals, metals and gut bacteria. Companies running these tests claim they are rooted in the principles of quantum physics, but many physicists disagree.“Quantum science is complex and subtle. It tells us that the world often works in counter-intuitive ways – and we can use those properties to develop powerful technology. But we need to be really careful about companies using the word ‘quantum’ in inappropriate ways to make their product sound mysterious and exciting,” said Louis Barson, director of science, innovation and skills at the UK’s Institute of Physics. “That’s part of why work on quantum standards and measurement is so important – we need to be able to differentiate between things that ‘are’ and ‘are not’ quantum.”“It’s pure quackery,” said Fox.What if you suspect a potential food allergy or intolerance?Gill said: “If you think you might be allergic to a particular food, skip the commercial kits and book an appointment with your GP, who can refer you to a qualified allergist or immunologist. They can arrange any relevant testing and take a full clinical history to support with an accurate diagnosis. It’s worth keeping a food and symptom diary for seven to 14 days in the run-up to your appointment.”Fox said: “For food intolerances, some might find that their GP is less experienced or less able to help them, but a registered dietitian is super helpful here. They can support you by doing careful exclusion diets and reintroduction. They can also give you a reality check as to whether the symptoms you’re describing are likely to be related to foods that you’re eating.”Explore more on these topicsAllergiesHealthFoodnewsShareReuse this content"

And continued airstrikes, elimination of terrorists, and dismantling of infrastructure.”Announcement of Israel’s Gaza occupation plan is carefully timedRead moreThe plan, which was unanimously approved at a security cabinet meeting late on Sunday, goes beyond any aims so far outlined by Israel for its offensive in the devastated Palestinian territory and is likely to prompt deep international concern and fierce opposition.“This will inevitably lead to countless more civilians killed and the further destruction of Gaza,” said a spokesperson for António Guterres, the United Nations secretary general. “Gaza is, and must remain, an integral part of a future Palestinian state.”A spokesperson for the British Foreign Office said: “The UK does not support an expansion of Israel’s military operations in Gaza. Continued fighting is in nobody’s interests.”After a fragile ceasefire collapsed in mid-March, Israel renewed its bombardment, with troops reinforcing kilometre-deep “buffer zones” along the perimeter of the territory andexpanding their holdover much of the north and south of the strip.In all, more than 70% of Gaza is under Israeli control or covered by orders issued by Israel telling Palestinian civilians to evacuate specific neighbourhoods.On Sunday, the army chief, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, said the military was calling up tens of thousands of reservists to allow for conscripted regular troops to be deployed to Gaza for the new offensive.Zamir has resisted calls by some Israeli ministers for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to take on the job of distributing aid in Gaza, which has been under a tight blockade by Israel for more than two months. Much of the 2.3 million population can no longer find enough to eat and the humanitarian system is close to collapse,aid officialsin the territory have said.View image in fullscreenShuruq Ayyad consoles her 12-year-old daughter Rahaf, who is suffering from malnutrition, at a shelter in central Gaza City on Sunday.Photograph: Omar Al-Qattaa/AFP/Getty ImagesIsraeli officials told local media that ministers believed there was “currently enough food” in the territory, but that they approved “the possibility of a humanitarian distribution, if necessary, to prevent Hamas from taking control of the supplies and to destroy its governance capabilities”.Israel says the blockade and intensified bombardments since mid-March are to put pressure on Hamas to release hostages held in Gaza. Militants in the territory still hold 58 hostages seized in Hamas’s October 2023 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,200 people, mostly civilians.Israel’s retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 52,535 people in Gaza, the majority of them civilians, according to the health ministry there.The officials also said Netanyahu “continues to promote” a proposal made in January by Donald Trump to displace the millions of Palestinians living in Gaza to neighbouring countries such as Jordan or Egypt, to allow its reconstruction.A “voluntary transfer programme for Gaza residents … will be part of the operation’s goals”, the senior security official said.Israel’s military on Monday carried outa fresh round of airstrikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen’s Red Sea city of Hodeida, a day after the Iranian-backed rebels launched a missile that hit Israel’s main airport.The rebels’ media office said at least six strikes hit the crucial Hodeida port Monday afternoon. Other strikes hit a cement factory in the Bajil district in Hodeida province, the rebels said. Israeli media reported that dozens of Israeli air force took part in the operation.Trump’s scheduled visit later this month to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and UAE may provide an additional incentive to the Israeli government to conclude a new ceasefire deal and allow aid into Gaza. Trump, who recently said he wanted Netanyahu to be “good to Gaza”, is likely to come under pressure from his hosts to push Israel to make concessions to end the conflict.Israeli military officials say seizing territory provides Israel with additional leverage in its negotiations with Hamas, and some observers suggest that the public announcement of the new offensive and plans for a longer-term presence in Gaza are merely aimed at putting pressure on the militant Islamist group.Humanitarian organisations have unanimouslyrejected Israel’s planto establish a limited number of aid distribution hubs run by private contractors and guarded by the IDF in southern Gaza.The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) on Sunday accused Israel of trying to shut down the existing aid distribution system run by the UN and its humanitarian partners in order to impose its own supply system.“[This] contravenes fundamental humanitarian principles … It is dangerous, driving civilians into militarised zones to collect rations, threatening lives … while further entrenching forced displacement,” OCHA said.Hamas on Monday described the new Israeli framework for aid delivery in Gaza as “political blackmail” and blamed Israel for the war-ravaged territory’s “humanitarian catastrophe”.1:17Israeli attacks on southern Gaza kill at least 40 people – videoIn Israel, hundreds of protesters took to the streets in Jerusalem while a coalition representing the majority of families of hostages held by Hamas, about half of whom are thought to be dead, condemned the planned new offensive as a threat the lives of hostages and Israeli soldiers.Netanyahu’s governing coalition – and so his hold on power – depends heavily on the support of hardline rightwing parties that have long demanded the reoccupation and resettlement of Gaza, which Israel formally left in 2005. A new parliamentary session opened on Monday.Israeli strikes across Gaza continued overnight and during Monday, killing at least 32 people in the territory, according to hospital staff. Strikes hit Gaza City, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya and among the dead were eight women and children, according to staff at al-Shifa hospital, where the bodies were brought.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Robert F Kennedy Jr, the health and human services secretary, told Fox News in February that Trump has asked for a study on the safety of abortion pills and has not made a decision on whether to tighten restrictions on them.Last year, the US supreme courtrejected a bidby anti-abortion groups and doctors to restrict access to the drug, finding that they lacked legal standing to challenge the FDA regulations.Those plaintiffs dropped their case after the high court ruling, but US district judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee, allowed the states to intervene and continue to pursue the lawsuit.The US justice department moved to dismiss their claims days before Trump took office in January.In Monday’s filing, government lawyers repeated their arguments thatTexasis not the proper venue for the lawsuit and that the states lack standing to sue because they are not being harmed by the challenged regulations.“Regardless of the merits of the States’ claims, the States cannot proceed in this Court,” they wrote.Volunteers rush to send abortion pills to US women in need as ‘war between the states’ loomsRead moreThe three states are challenging FDA actions that loosened restrictions on the drug in 2016 and 2021, including allowing for medication abortions at up to 10 weeks of pregnancy instead of seven, and for mail delivery of the drug without first seeing a clinician in person. The original plaintiffs initially had sought to reverse FDA approval of mifepristone, but that aspect was rebuffed by a lower court.The Republican-led states have argued they have standing to sue because their Medicaid health insurance programs will likely have to pay to treat patients who have suffered complications from using mifepristone.They have also said they should be allowed to remain in Texas even without the original plaintiffs because it would be inefficient to send the case to another court after two years of litigation.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationLaw (US)AbortionHealthDonald TrumpUS healthcareTexasnewsShareReuse this content"

On the programme isthe Beatles’ In My Life, seen as a nod to his earlier political life when he was mayor of the northern port city of Hamburg between 2011 and 2018, where the Liverpool musicians cut their teeth in its clubs and bars in the 1960s.Some commentators have suggested the song, the lyrics of which include the line “of all these friends and lovers, there is no one compares with you”, is also a tribute to his wife, the fellow politician Britta Ernst, to whom he has often expressed his affection and gratitude.Merkel’s punk pick for leaving ceremony raises eyebrowsRead moreAn excerpt from Bach’s second Brandenburg Concertos, his only classical choice, is a likely reference to the state of Brandenburg, where he lives and which he will continue to serve as a backbencher. He was the only Social Democrat to win a direct mandate in the former communist east, where the far-right Alternative für Deutschland more or less swept the board.The song choice that has caused the most mirth is the feminist anthem Respect, made famous by Franklin, which alludes to a keyword of the election campaign that brought him to power in 2021, and which he has repeated often. Critics say he has not always lived up to the motto himself, having sometimes been gruff or appearing dismissive to journalists in particular.Commentators have said Scholz’s musical choices offer a rare glimpse into the emotional side of the chancellor, who was often referred to as a “Scholzomat” due to hisrobotic-like responses, and whose old black leather briefcase became something of a TikTok star while he stayed in the background.Referring to him as a “file carrier” in a farewell column, Franz Josef Wagner, a veteran columnist for the tabloid Bild, said Scholz’s inability to communicate had probably contributed to the brevity of his tenure as chancellor, which lasted just over three years. “Dear departing chancellor, if you had told us everything that went on in your heart, you would maybe still be chancellor today. But your mouth was sealed. You had a silent heart,” he wrote.Scholz’s immediate predecessor Angela Merkel chose Nina Hagen’s 1974 hit You Forgot the Colour Film, a mix of nostalgia for holidays on the Baltic coast and a critique of grey life in communist Germany; the chanson Red Roses Should Rain for Me, a 1968 hit by the German actor Hildegard Knef; and Great God, We Praise You, a 17th-century ecumenical hymn.Among the choices of her predecessor, the Social Democrat Gerhard Schröder, was Frank Sinatra’s My Way.Explore more on these topicsGermanyOlaf ScholzFriedrich MerzEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Meanwhile, males with strong social bonds tended to get ill more frequently but were less likely to be injured in fights.The study, by theDian Fossey Gorilla Fundand the universities of Zurich and Exeter, may help give an insight into how the relationships of other social animals, including humans, work.“Having a lot of strong social relationships is often really good but sometimes it isn’t,” said Robin Morrison, the lead author on the paper and a senior researcher at the University of Zurich.Morrison said the example of strong and stable social bonds appearing to lead to less illness in female gorillas but more in males could not be explained simply by social contact leading to more disease risk.She said: “It’s possible that males expend more energy by having close social ties, as they have to defend females and offspring, and the stress of this may reduce their immune function. If you are a very popular male in your group, that comes with a lot of responsibilities.”The study is based on observations of gorillas in Rwanda’sVolcanoes national park, where the apes usually live in groups of about 12 with a single dominant male.Morrison said one of the big surprises was how there seemed to be room for very different characters. “You have gorillas that are actually quite peaceful and will intervene very rarely, but seem to have this very authoritative kind of role. Whereas others will be very kind of ‘it’s my way or nothing’. And they can be successful in different ways.”Among the gorillas studied was Titus, a silverback adult male gorilla who lost his father and many other group members to poachers and whose mother died when he was only four.View image in fullscreenTitus being groomed by his six-year-old daughter Ikaze.Photograph: University of ExeterHe became the dominant male of his group at the early age of 15 and had an unusual leadership style, being exceptionally gentle and calm. His nature made him attractive to females and contributed to his 20-year tenure as dominant male.Maggie was the highest-ranking female gorilla in a group. She was one of the most frequently aggressive group members but also quick to provide friendly support such as grooming.She often acted as a protector, a role usually taken by males, and when the dominant male died unexpectedly she took charge, guiding the group until they merged with a neighbouring group.Morrison said the study could shed light on the evolutionary history of humans. “Why are some people very social and others aren’t? I think this paper helps us see that actually it’s not as straightforward as saying ‘always be as social as possible’. Actually, some individuals can do very well by having sort of a smaller number of close friends.”The paper, published in the journalProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is titled “Group traits moderate the relationship between individual social traits and fitness in gorillas”.Explore more on these topicsPrimatologyAnimal behaviournewsShareReuse this content"

That represents a 28% premium to the stock’s Friday close, according to Reuters calculations.Skechers shares jumped 25% to $61.86 on the news, regaining some ground after dropping nearly 30% this year as the company withdrew its annual results forecast in April and warned of the fallout from President Donald Trump’s 145% import tariff on Chinese goods.China accounts for a bulk of imports for the brand’s US business.Needham analyst Tom Nikic said the deal talks may have been accelerated by the volatile macro environment – driven by tariffs, weakening consumer sentiment and troubled China-US relations – and the company may have wished to navigate these challenges without being under Wall Street’s scrutiny.Skechers, Nike and Adidas America are among the companies that have urged Trump to exempt shoes from reciprocal tariffs, as US businesses face higher costs and shoppers tighten spending to brace for a potential rise in prices.Founded in 1992, California-based Skechers started out as a brand focused on men’s street style with the launch of its popular shoe Chrome Dome, but has come to be known for its comfort-first sneakers.The company has held up against stiff competition from legacy brands such as Nike and newer entrants such as Hoka, thanks in part to its aggressive global expansion and focus on value. Its shoes are priced anywhere between $75 (£56) and $150 (£113) on its website, and the company has roughly 5,000 retail stores in over 120 countries.Its marketing tie-ups with celebrities including Britney Spears and Kim Kardashian have also helped the brand boost its appeal and stay relevant.Nikic said the deal was “very surprising” as Skechers has always been viewed as a family business, with the founding Greenberg family highly involved in the operations.Sources told Reuters Skechers was not running an auction and the deal was bilateral as 3G Capital has had a long relationship with the Greenbergs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Police said the hostages were tortured and that video footage – allegedly recorded by the captors themselves – showed the miners were shot dead at point-blank range.Illegal gold mining has surged in Peru, Latin America’s biggest producer of the precious metal, just as the international price peaked once more at around $3,500 per ounce. Meanwhile acrime wave has swept the countrywith unprecedented rises in racketeering and killing-for-hire. 2024 saw a record increase murder rates – a 35.9%increase in homicidescompared with 2023.Teacher murdered in front of schoolchildren as Lima gripped by crime waveRead more“Illegal mining is the most lucrative criminal activity in the country,” said César Ipenza, an environmental lawyer. Illegal gold mining accounted for $9bn , or 60% of Peru’s total laundered assets betweenJanuary 2014 and October 2024, according to the country’s Financial Intelligence Unit, dwarfing the next biggest sources of laundered assets.Once confined to certain zones illegal gold mining has spread throughout the country since the Covid-19 pandemic. The gold-rich area where the mine is located in La Libertad region has been under a state of emergency for more than two years due to ongoing violence and unrest.This massacre brings to 39 the number of artisanal miners and workers killed by criminal gangs in Pataz, the company La PoderosaMiningconfirmed in a statement.“The spiral of uncontrolled violence in Pataz is occurring despite the declaration of a state of emergency and the presence of a large police contingent which, unfortunately, has not been able to halt the deterioration of security conditions in the area,” the statement added.In December, thousands of gold miners camped out in the downtown Lima and blocked the main highway to insist that the government maintain a registry of informal and illegal miners known as REINFO which protects them from prosecution.Explore more on these topicsPeruAmericasMiningnewsShareReuse this content"

Now, in keeping with one of the late pontiff’s last wishes, the popemobile is being given a second life – as a mobile health clinic for children in the Gaza Strip.In a region ravaged by more than18 months of war,the initiative is both symbolic and practical, said Peter Brune, the secretary general of the Catholic charity Caritas Sweden.“We call it a vehicle of hope because it conveys a message to the children ofGazathat peace is possible, there will be peace, you will have a future and the world has not forgotten about you. And then there’s the very practical dimension in that it will actually deliver medical aid to affected children.”Brune and his counterpart at Caritas Jerusalem, Anton Asfar, came up with the idea late last year. They soon arranged to have the question put to Pope Francis. “We got a letter from the pope saying, ‘Yes I’m glad to say that I fully endorse this idea’,” said Brune.Work swiftly began on fitting out the vehicle, which had been left sitting in Bethlehem since the 2014 visit, with supplies such as rapid tests for infections, suture kits and oxygen as well as a refrigerator for medication.It will be used to diagnose and treat children who have no access to healthcare, bolstering the aid provided by Caritas Jerusalem, which has about 100 staff on the ground in Gaza. “This is a concrete, life-saving intervention at a time when the health system in Gaza has almost completely collapsed,” said Brune.View image in fullscreenPope Francis in the popemobile in the West Bank city of Bethlehem in May 2014.Photograph: ReutersThe announcement, made days beforethe start of the conclaveto elect a new pope, echoes Francis’s deep commitment to those caught in the crossfire of the conflict.He had long called for an end to the hostilities and voiced his disapproval at how the war was being carried out. “Yesterday children were bombed. This is cruelty, this is not war,”he said in Decemberafter an Israeli airstrike killed seven children from one family. He added: “I want to say it because it touches my heart.”For much of the past year and a half, Francis had madenightly callsto Gaza’s only Catholic church, offering his unwavering support to the congregation as they grappled with the pain and devastation of war. “It was close to his heart,” said Brune. “Since the war broke out, 3% of the Christians in Gaza have been killed.”The transformed popemobile is expected to be ready in a week or so, said Brune, and talks have been launched in the hope of obtaining permission from Israeli officials to bring it into Gaza.Brune described the situation on the ground as urgent. “Since 2 March, no aid has been let into Gaza at all. It’s horrible. A few months ago, when it was cold, children were freezing to death. Now they’re starving to death.”While aid groups have warned that Israel’s blockade offood and medicineinto Gaza has left civilians in the territoryfacing starvation, Israel has said that the blockade, along with its renewed military campaign, is aimed at pressuring Hamas to release the remaining hostages.Unicefsaid last monththat the conflict had killed more than 15,000 children, injured tens of thousands of others and left nearly 1 million children repeatedly displaced in the Gaza Strip, adding to warnings that the humanitarian situation had reachedits worst pointsince the hostilities broke out in 2023.The war in Gaza was triggered by a surprise attack launched by Hamas into Israel on 7 October, in which militants killed more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 250 hostages. Israeli officials say 59 hostages remain in Gaza, more than half of whom are believed to be dead.Brune called for aid to be let in. “It’s forbidden to use civilians and, even worse, children as some kind of instrument in an ongoing war between adults,” he said. “It’s against all humanitarian principles and laws.”He hoped the popemobile’s transformation would set a precedent of sorts, paving the way for other papal vehicles to be repurposed. “Maybe Gaza now, but then Ukraine in the future or Congo or other places,” he said. “Everywhere where humanitarian access is denied, we want to apply the principle of saying that the popemobile will stand for the importance of letting humanitarian aid come through.”Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisGazaPalestinian territoriesThe papacyIsrael-Gaza warAidHumanitarian responsenewsShareReuse this content"

He wore a sweater over a white collared shirt and grey slacks, which the judge had allowed rather than jail clothing. Combs, 55, has been held in a grim federal lockup in Brooklyn since his arrest last September. His hair and goatee were almost fully gray because dye isn’t allowed in jail.Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs faces new criminal counts alleging ‘forced labor’Read moreUnlike other recent high-profile celebrity trials, Combs’s court case won’t be broadcast live because federal courtrooms don’t allow electronic recordings inside – meaning courtroom sketch artists serve as the public’s eyes in the courtroom.The trial is expected to take at least eight weeks. If convicted, he faces the possibility of decades in prison.Several prospective jurors indicated they had seen news reports featuring a key piece of evidence in the case: a video of the hip-hop mogul hitting and kicking one of his accusers in a Los Angeles hotel hallway in 2016. One prospective juror described a still image she saw from the video as “damning evidence”. That woman was rejected from consideration.After another juror was dismissed, Combs asked for a bathroom break, telling the judge: “I’m sorry your honor, I’m a little nervous today.”The 17-page indictment against Combs – which reads like a charging document filed against a mafia leader or the head of a drug gang – alleges that Combs engaged in a two-decade pattern of abusive behavior against women and others, with the help of people in his entourage and employees from his network of businesses.Combs and his lawyers say he’s innocent and any group sex was consensual. They say there was no effort to coerce people into things they didn’t want to do, and nothing that happened amounted to a criminal racket.Prosecutors say women were manipulated into drug-fueled sexual performances with male sex workers that Combs called “freak offs”. To keep women in line, prosecutors say Combs used a mix of influence and violence: he offered to boost their entertainment careers if they did what he asked – or cut them off if they didn’t.And when he wasn’t getting what he wanted, the indictment says Combs and his associates resorted to violent acts including beatings, kidnapping and arson. Once, the indictment alleges, he even dangled someone from a balcony.Combshas acknowledgedone episode of violence that is likely to be featured in the trial. In 2016, asecurity camera recorded himbeating up his former girlfriend, the R&B singer Cassie, in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel. Cassiefiled a lawsuitin late 2023 saying Combs had subjected her to years of abuse, including beatings and rape.The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, as Cassie, whose legal name is Casandra Ventura, did.Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs pleads not guilty to new indictmentRead moreThe trial is the most serious in a long string of legal problems for Combs.In 1999, he was charged with bursting into the offices of an Interscope Records executive with his bodyguards and beating him with a champagne bottle and a chair. The executive, Steve Stoute, later asked prosecutors to go easy on Combs, who pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and took an anger management class.Later that same year, Combs was stopped by police after he and his then girlfriend, Jennifer Lopez, fled a nightclub where three people were wounded by gunfire. Combs was acquitted of all charges related to the episode at a 2001 trial, but a rapper in his entourage, Jamal “Shyne” Barrow, was convicted in the shooting and served nearly nine years in prison.Then in 2015, Combs was charged with assaulting someone with a weight-room kettlebell at the University of California, Los Angeles, where one of his sons played football. Combs said he was defending himself and prosecutors dropped the case.Explore more on these topicsSean ‘Diddy‘ CombsHip-hopRape and sexual assaultNew YorkUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

But when they awoke later in the morning, the two children were gone.The Royal Canadian Mounted Police believe the pair, members of the Mi’kmaq First Nation community of Sipekne’katik, wandered off from their home and probably entered a heavily forested area.Among the resources devoted to the effort have been dog teams with the heavy urban search and rescue team from Halifax, the region’s largest city, as well as thermal imaging cameras attached to drones. Police say their work has been “strategic and thorough” as they weigh any clues that might suggest a likely whereabouts for the children.The search is also the first major undertaking by the Nova Scotia Guard, a newly formed a volunteer emergency organization meant to address shortfalls in the province’s response to crisis. In 2023,a flash flood killed four people, including three children – a tragedy that some residents believe could have been avoided by timely warnings sent by authorities.Nova Scotia’s premier,Tim Houston, a resident of Pictou county, has visited the search headquarters alongside other local officials, to offer support for residents and searchers.“People in Pictou County and across Nova Scotia are praying for a positive outcome for two missing children,” he said in a statement. “During this time of worry, please know that our first responders and volunteers are working tirelessly during this 24/7 operation.”Foiled at times by inclement weather, more than a dozen search teams are in the field.“Everybody in the community is concerned and worried, but we’re all hoping for the best here,” said Donald Parker, a municipal councillor with the municipality of Pictou county told CBC News. “It’s hard on the whole community … It’s incredibly tough.”On social media, the Sipekne’katik chief, Michelle Glasgow, questioned the decision not to issue an Amber alert, used when a child is presumed abducted, and said the disappearance underscored the need for a national alerting system.“Please help bring Jack and Lily home,” she wrote.Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

He was able to leave and escape to the US after friends abroad applied pressure for his release.Abu Tohawroteabout the struggle of his family members to find food in Gaza, juxtaposed with memories of everyday meals before the war.“I yearn to return to Gaza, sit at the kitchen table with my mother and father, and make tea for my sisters. I do not need to eat. I only want to look at them again,” he wrote.Herecalledseeing pictures of the destruction of the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, where he regularly visited his grandparents and attended school. “I looked at the photos again and again, and an image of a graveyard that grows and grows formed in my mind,” he wrote.He also wrote about the suspicion and indignities that he and other Palestinians face outside their homeland. Herecalledtelling a TSA agent who swabbed his palms for explosives during a layover in Boston: “I was kidnapped by the Israeli army in November, before being stripped of my clothes … Today, you come and separate me from my wife and kids, just like the army did a few months ago.”The New Yorker also won a Pulitzer for its investigative podcast about the killing of Iraqi civilians by the US military and for feature photography for Moises Saman’s images documenting the end of Bashar al-Assad’s dictatorship in Syria.This year’s Pulitzer winners in the arts also include Percival Everett for his novel James, a re-imagining of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn from the perspective of the enslaved title character, and Branden Jacobs-Jenkins for his play Purpose, a drama about a prominent Black family destroying itself from within.Explore more on these topicsPulitzer prizePalestinian territoriesGazaIsrael-Gaza warAwards and prizesMiddle East and north AfricaThe New YorkernewsShareReuse this content"

And yet, the final season is as bleak as ever. Where’s the hope we all need?Rebecca NicholsonMon 5 May 2025 06.41 EDTLast modified on Mon 5 May 2025 16.04 EDTShareGreat timing! For those who are finding the second season ofThe Last of Ustoo upbeat, too optimistic, just too damn cheerful, here comesThe Handmaid’s Tale, returning for a final run of utter despair and soul-destroying misery. The Emmy-winning take on Margaret Atwood’s novel is back for a sixth and last season, having remarkably stretched out the first novel from a semi-faithful adaptation into a sprawling dystopian hellhole that never lets anyone win.I find it one of the most frustrating series on television. It is well made, well acted and sits on the foundations of important conversations, particularly as the western world continues its steady turn towards authoritarianism. Thefirst season’s most unforgettable sceneis the one in which, prior to being forced into a life of reproductive servitude, June (Elisabeth Moss) and Moira (Samira Wiley) attend a protest, marching against the removal of women’s rights to their own finances. To an eerie remix of Blondie’s Heart of Glass, the soldiers begin to beat those at the front, before turning their guns on the civilians. Just as the novel is rooted only in acts of violence, corruption and autocracy that had already taken place, the show was a compelling horror because it offered a vision of a near-future that seemed, or seems, ever closer.Yet as it continues to make the story go far beyond the novel, it has fallen into a maddening spiral. Every season, June liberates herself from the barbarism of Gilead and the Sons of Jacob, then chooses to return to that world to avenge some new or lingering personal injustice. Similarly, Serena Joy (an excellent Yvonne Strahovski) is allowed to develop complexities – has she been brainwashed by her own trad-wife propaganda, or is she still a political operator so shrewd that she has everyone dancing to her own tune? – but then is simply returned to where she began.View image in fullscreenRefugees … June (Elisabeth Moss) and Serena Joy (Yvonne Strahovski) in season six of The Handmaid’s Tale.Photograph: Steve Wilkie/DisneyIn the first episode of season six, the series seems to have recognised its own circularity. It has a growing tendency to throw its cast in the air and scatter them freely, and while some subplots feel as if they have earned their place (the colonies, the trauma of refugees), others are struggling to find a purpose. But this opener suggests it knows it is time for a reset, and does so not by making the story bigger, but by making it more focused, to a near-theatrical degree. Most of the episode is set on the train transporting refugees out of an increasingly hostile Canada, to one of the last remaining outposts of the United States. Canada has decided to capitulate to the strength of Gilead, in part due to some profitable trade agreements, and wishes to improve relations with its autocratic neighbour.These attempts at normalising the abhorrent are the show’s most astute thread. Simultaneously, Gilead is attempting to smooth the edges of its own religious extremism by remaking its image with a more feminine touch: New Bethlehem is a place where Gilead’s refugees can return and live under a softer version of the same regime.‘I can say things other people are afraid to’: Margaret Atwood on censorship, literary feuds and TrumpRead moreThe show is not big on subtleties: when characters, particularly women, dare to dream of hope, they do so under sunlight, in nature, surrounded by birdsong. When the bad men of Gilead perform their political manoeuvres, it’s over cigarettes, by the dim light of an open fire, in a room lined with dark wallpaper. The angel and the devil are on the shoulders of the World of Interiors magazine.On the train, Serena Joy and June, the former commander’s wife and her former handmaid, assess their new situations. They both have small children; Serena, in particular, thinks they share a twisted bond, and perhaps they do. Mothers have always been a big theme here, and they become even more prominent as it begins to bow out. To watch these two women examining each other, animal-like, as each tries to figure out the other’s motives, suggests that, at last, the show has ripped up its bleakly repetitive template.Then along comes the second episode, and unsurprisingly, it snaps back to more familiar ground. As I say, it’s well made and well acted, and something about its horrors clearly keeps viewers coming back for more. But don’t expect any radical departure from what it has always done, which is bludgeon hope to death. Happy viewing!The Handmaid’s Tale is on Prime Video and Channel 4 in the UK, on SBS and SBS on Demand in Australia and Hulu in the US.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe Handmaid's TalefeaturesShareReuse this content"

A doubledecker bus suspended above a calm sea bay. A dishevelled middle-aged couple frolicking down a high street, caught in their own private musical. There’s an irrepressible fountain of dream imagery erupting out of Nick Cheung’s fourth feature, which imaginesHong Kongafter the 2008 financial crash as a nightmarish inland empire awash in outrage, anguish and guilt. “Other people’s money!” crows one investor – but the real business here is other people’s dreams.Loose-cannon psychiatrist Dr Man (Terrance Lau) is under censure from his bosses for investigating his patients’ private lives. Maybe it’s his own uneasy dreams that motivate him to trespass, though a new bizarre case gives him added cause to go the extra mile. A narcoleptic taxi driver admitted to hospital after nodding off and veering into the opposite lane, Choi (Nick Cheung) is trapped in a twilight between reality and reverie. Prying into the circumstances once again, Dr Man discovers something even more disturbing at the man’s home: his wife Fiona (Fala Chen), an obsessive shut-in who monitors financial feeds.A Hong Kong industry veteran and Johnnie To bit-player, Cheung has inherited some of that master director’s way with fine-milled visuals; his lambent and baffling headscapes also feel very reminiscent of another maestro, the dear departed David Lynch. Initially presenting these visions in fragmentary fashion, threading between Man, Choi, Fiona and a former psychiatrist (an Andy Lau cameo) who claims to enter people’s dreams, the irrational is the city’s governing force – surfacing both in the nocturnal unconscious and stock-market eddies.The transition to a more conventional narrative shadowing Dr Man’s shrink-cum-gumshoe is a little abrupt, dissipating the film’s oneiric kick. And a stylist though he undoubtedly is, Cheung doesn’t invest heavily enough in a single character to bring the story home. That’s especially clear in the case of Choi and Fiona’s supposedly fateful love affair, wafted along, in a Wong Kar-Wai-esque touch, onthe old-timey strains of Broadway standard Peg O’ My Heart. Instead, somewhat disingenuously Cheung pushes Man’s credo of emotional honesty to the fore. This powerfully textured psychological warren he has lovingly created says otherwise.Peg O’ My Heart is released in cinemas on 9 May.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersDrama filmsHong KongAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

Clear!Michael HoganMon 5 May 2025 06.05 EDTLast modified on Mon 5 May 2025 10.24 EDTShareIt’s been hailed as the greatest TV show of 2025 so far and the best medical drama in a generation. The Pitt has become the US’s most talked-about TV show. It has also become talked-about in the UK, mainly thanks to outrage that it hasn’t crossed the Atlantic yet.As speculation builds about The Pitt finding a British broadcaster – and ITV medi-thrillerMalpracticereturns – we’ve counted down the top 20 greatest TV medical dramas ever.From the Sherlock Holmes of hospitals to Dr Doug Ross, these are the finest fictional physicians to consult. Prepare to describe your symptoms. The TV doctors will see you now …20. The Good Doctor (2017-2024)Actor Daniel Dae Kim (AKA Jin from Lost) saw the success of the South Korean original and snapped up the rights for a US remake. It followed Dr Shaun Murphy (Freddie Highmore), a gifted young surgical resident with savant syndrome at San Jose’s St Bonaventure hospital. The West Wing’s Richard Schiff added heft as his mentor. Although its portrayal of autism came in for criticism, it ran for seven hit seasons. Not bad, doctor.19. Dr Death (2021-23)View image in fullscreenUnsettling … Joshua Jackson as Christopher Duntsch AKA Dr Death.Photograph: Peacock/Karen KuehnBased on the Wondery podcast of the same name, this true-crime anthology told unsettling tales of medical malpractice. The debut run starred Joshua Jackson as Dallas neurosurgeon Christopher Duntsch, who permanently mutilated 31 patients, killing two. The sequel starred Édgar Ramírez as Swiss surgeon Paolo Macchiarini, whose unethical experimentation resulted in seven fatalities. I think I’ll seek a second opinion, actually.18. Dr Kildare (1961-66)This 60s phenomenon created a heartthrob inRichard Chamberlain, who made his name as a dashing young intern at Blair general hospital. It spawned novels, comic books, radio plays, board games, candy bars, a prequel spin-off and even pop hits for Chamberlain. The pioneering NBC series ended the TV dominance of westerns, establishing medical drama as a mainstream staple.17. No Angels (2004-06)View image in fullscreenRacy … Sunetra Sarker as Anji, Louise Delamere as Lia, Jo Joyner as Beth and Kaye Wragg as Kate in No Angels.Photograph: Channel 4This Life did it for lawyers. Teachers did it for, well, teachers. No Angels did it for nursing. With a title nodding to 70s medical soap Angels, theracy Channel 4 dramedyfollowed four healthcare pros at a Leeds hospital – played by Jo Joyner, Sunetra Sarker, Kaye Wragg and Louise Delamere – with messy work and private lives.16. Temple (2019-21)Sky’s underrated medical crime drama saw a gifted surgeon (Mark Strong) set up an illegal clinic in the tunnels beneath Temple tube station to secretly research a cure for his terminally ill wife. He funded it with a sideline in treating criminals and other desperate patients. Gory and gripping, with Daniel Mays as a cracking sidekick.15. St Elsewhere (1982-88)View image in fullscreenA young Denzel Washington … with Cynthia Sikes in St Elsewhere.Photograph: Album/AlamyIt became infamous for its bonkers “it all happened inside a snowglobe” finale, but this NBC classic – originally pitched as “Hill Street Blues in a hospital” – was a standout drama of the 80s. Set at the rundown St Eligius in Boston, it numbered a young Denzel Washington among its cast. There was even a Cheers crossover episode, which saw three doctors visiting the legendary bar. Sometimes you wanna go …14. Call the Midwife(2012-present)It’s often written off as a cosy exercise in nostalgia but Heidi Thomas’s reliable ratings-grabber, following nurses and nuns in post-second world war east London, is quietly one of the most radical dramas on air. Where else would you find issues such as abortion, incest, slum landlords, domestic violence, racism and female genital mutilation in Sunday night primetime? Not on Countryfile, that’s for sure.13. Chicago Hope(1994-2000)It was unlucky to be overshadowed by 90s rival ER – which premiered the very next night – but this CBS series was high-class fare. An early hit for super-producer David E Kelley (of Ally McBeal and Big Little Lies), it was set at the titular midwestern hospital, where hotshot surgeons included Mandy Patinkin and Adam Arkin, son of Alan.12. Nip/Tuck(2003-10)View image in fullscreenCamply eccentric … Nip/Tuck.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy“Tell me what you don’t like about yourself.” Before turning his attention to serial killers and horror stories, showrunner Ryan Murphy scored a hit with this blackly comic cosmetic surgery drama. Best friends Dr Sean McNamara (Dylan Walsh) and Dr Christian Troy (Julian McMahon) set up a cutting-edge Miami clinic together. Cue camply eccentric patients and lurid private lives. Murphy insisted that the medical cases were “100% based on fact”.11. Casualty(1986-present)View image in fullscreenIt has launched so many stars … Kate Winslet in Casualty.Its spin-off Holby City might have gone to the great sickbay in the sky, but the world’s longest-running primetime medical drama remains a fixture of BBC One’s schedules. Conceived in response to the decline of the NHS under the Conservative government, it continues to blend soapy storylines with hard-hitting themes. Stats show that Casualty has launched the careers of more future stars then any other British show, with the likes of Kate Winslet, Jodie Comer and Tom Hiddleston passing through those ward doors.10. The Knick (2014-15)A rare foray into TV for director Steven Soderbergh, this handsomely shot period piece was set at New York’s Knickerbocker hospital circa 1900. Clive Owen was charismatically troubled as surgeon Dr John W Thackery, juggling his cocaine and morphine addictions with saving lives and modernising medicine. It was cancelled after two intense seasons but a Harlem-set, Barry Jenkins-run spin-off is in development.9. A Very Peculiar Practice (1986-92)View image in fullscreenSatirical … Peter Davison (left) with Graham Crowden and John Bird in A Very Peculiar Practice.Photograph: Network DVDHe’s now the go-to writer for bonnets-and-breeches literary romps, but Andrew Davies scored an early hit with this satirical drama, based on his experiences as a lecturer at Warwick University. Viewing Thatcher’s Britain through the prism of a campus health centre, it starred a post-Tardis Peter Davison as an idealistic GP, surrounded by a grotesque gallery of sexed-up, boozy, grasping capitalist colleagues.8. Cardiac Arrest(1994-96)View image in fullscreenUnflinching … Helen Baxendale as Claire with Andrew Lancel as Andrew in Cardiac Arrest.Photograph: BBCLine of Duty creatorJed Mercurio was still working as a physician when he wrote his debut drama. It was so scathingly cynical about the realities of the NHS that he scripted it under a pseudonym. Following junior doctors at a Glasgow hospital, it was unflinchingly gritty and darkly comic, making a star of Helen Baxendale as a battle-scarred house officer. Politicians hated it. Real-life medics loved it.7. Nurse Jackie(2009-15)View image in fullscreenTour de force … Edie Falco as Jackie Peyton in Nurse Jackie.Photograph: Cinematic/AlamyPill-popping nurse Jackie Peyton made for a compellingly flawed protagonist in this provocative Showtime drama. Across seven seasons, she battled her demons in a chaotic New York emergency department. The Sopranos’ Edie Falco won an Emmy for her tour de force performance as the self-destructive antiheroine.6. This Is Going to Hurt (2022)View image in fullscreenPulls no punches … Ambika Mod and Ben Whishaw in This Is Going to Hurt.Photograph: PADoctor turned comic Adam Kay adapted his searingmedical memoirinto an equally searing BBC drama. Grimly hilarious and righteously angry, it pulled no punches in its portrayal of life on an NHS obstetrics and gynaecology ward. Ben Whishaw was electrifying as the frazzled protagonist, while Ambika Mod delivered a heart-rending breakthrough turn as trainee doctor Shruti. Jarvis Cocker’s soundtrack was just a bonus.5. Grey’s Anatomy (2005-present)View image in fullscreenSoapy and addictive … Ellen Pompeo and Sandra Oh in Grey’s Anatomy.Photograph: Michael Desmond/fiveShonda Rhimes’ medical melodrama has aired an astonishing 446 episodes and counting, making it ABC’s longest-running scripted show. The Seattle hospital saga is routinely underestimated but remains a ratings juggernaut. Its heyday was the early years when intern Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) got her stethoscope in a tangle over neurosurgeon “Dr McDreamy” (Patrick Dempsey), but it has survived wholesale cast changes across 21 seasons. Soapy, addictive and shamelessly romantic.4. Bodies (2004-06)View image in fullscreenCareer-peak performance … Max Beesley in Bodies.Photograph: PRJed Mercurio outdid his earlier creation Cardiac Arrest with this pulverising drama, again based on his experiences as a hospital doctor. Max Beesley delivered a career-peak performance as a beleaguered registrar in an “obs and gynae” ward, horrified that his bungling boss (Patrick Baladi) was killing patients, but protected by the principle of “Doctors look after doctors”. With the pair’s feud punctuated by gruesome surgical scenes, it built into a terrifying picture of incompetence, arrogance and underfunding.3. The Pitt (2025)Connected by the reassuring presence of actor Noah Wyle, The Pitt is the spiritual successor to ER. High-pressure action in a chaotic Pittsburgh emergency ward unfolds in real time over 15 hours, with each propulsive episode playing out across a single hospital shift. As overworked staff run on adrenaline, it’s a blistering portrayal of a post-pandemic healthcare system under attack from its own government. The acclaimed debut run saw mass shootings, stolen ambulances, nursing shortages and rats in the corridors. A second season is due next year, all unfolding over a Fourth of July weekend. Hurry up, UK broadcasters.2. House(2004-12)View image in fullscreenA diagnostic genius … Hugh Laurie as Dr Gregory House in House.Photograph: NBC/Getty Images“Everybody lies”. Not just the title of the pilot episode but the entire ethos of Fox’s New Jersey hospital whodunnit. A Vicodin-addicted misanthrope who happened to be a diagnostic genius, Dr Gregory House uncovered patients’ secrets and deduced what was ailing them. Clue: it was never lupus. Except when it was. Hugh Laurie dazzled as the Sherlock Holmes of medicine, forever clashing with colleagues over his wild theories and habitual rule-breaking.1. ER (1994-2009)View image in fullscreenThe making of a megastar … George Clooney as Dr Doug Ross in ER.Photograph: NBCUPHOTOBANK/Rex FeaturesWhat else could it be? Michael Crichton’s medical masterpiece took the ensemble formula of forerunner St Elsewhere and cranked it up several levels. Set in a Chicago emergency room, it skilfully mixed multiple patients, life-or-death stakes and ethical debates into a breathlessly thrilling package. Cinematically shot, jargon-packed and kinetically paced, ER became the US’s top-rated show with 35 million viewers and an all-round pop cultural blockbuster. The Pitt’s Noah Wyle made his name as a baby-faced student doctor, Julianna Margulies made for a magnificent nurse manager and it turned jobbing actor George Clooney into a megastar.

At the centre of this Boiler Room live stream is a 48-year-old woman who by her own description looks more like a social worker than a DJ, commanding the room as she drops walloping dance tracks, living up to the nickname that has been bestowed upon her: the Queen of Bassline.“That moment proved that a normal-looking girl fromYorkshire, who’s just a bit mental on the tunes, can do it,” says Angela Weston, AKA Big Ang, of her debut appearance this year. “I’ve had belief in the genre from the start and just always carried on doing what I’ve done. Bassline is in my blood.”Often topped with male MCs or female singers, bassline is characterised by four-four rhythms with deep, wobbly bass that sounds wet yet dense. It has its roots in speed garage but evolved to become its own genre and a defining sound of the north and Midlands. It’s booming again, so much so that it’s getting its own celebratory event this week as part of 2025’sBradfordCity of Culture: Bassline Symphony, in which pioneers of the genre Jamie Duggan, DJ Q and TS7 are collaborating with Katie Chatburn and the Orchestra of Opera North, held in one of the UK’s oldest concert halls. “It feels full circle,” says Bradford producer and DJ Thomas Sampson, AKA TS7. “When I was 16 I would sneak into clubs like Boilerhouse, the hub of bassline in Bradford, so to see it get this big support from the city is amazing. It’s got a lot of history and legacy here.”But it has needed the tenacity of people such as Big Ang to keep it alive: the idea of bassline becoming a government-funded, family-friendly event would have once been laughable. “For a while it felt like it was you against the world,” recalls Duggan. “I wasn’t allowed to DJ in most cities. I got blacklisted. It was a terrible time.”View image in fullscreen‘It felt like it was you against the world’ … Jamie Duggan DJing in 2009.Photograph: PYMCA/Avalon/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesThis came after the high-profile closure of two clubs associated with the genre in Sheffield. First, in 2005, Niche was shut down after a Swat-style raid involving hundreds of police officers, weapons, helicopters, horses and road closures. While the massive operation only turned up small quantities of drugs, the club couldn’t get a licence to reopen. A second iteration of Niche was closed in 2010 after multiple stabbings and, by this point, a long history of violent incidents. Bassline was seen as a magnet for out-of-towners wanting to cause trouble and so its star DJs, including Duggan and Shaun Banger Scott, found themselves out of work. It was a slow and steady road back. “I was constantly at police and council meetings,” recalls Duggan. “That was my life for a few years – which is crazy for a DJ to have to do.”The original Niche, opened in 1992, was a no-frills concrete sweatbox surrounded by old cutlery works that ran from midnight to noon. While unglamorous, in the 2000s it became so identified with a buzzy new sound – one fusing overlooked and pitch-shifted B-sides, track reworks, and original productions from the likes of Big Ang, Jon Buccieri and DJ Booda – that a genre was even named after the club before “bassline” properly took hold. “You got any Niche tunes?” was a common question put to record shop workers. Big Ang describes her production style around this period as being equally inspired by the speed garage of Tonka and the old school rave of Slipmatt, resulting in something hefty but also uplifting.A precocious talent from a young age – who would mirror piano riffs from dance tracks on a keyboard at home – Weston was driven to make music from the age of 13. She was a determined artist who worked three jobs while coming up as a DJ and producer on the circuit, and bulldozed any obstacles that got in the way. When she heard someone disparaging her work, she came back at them in the only way she knew how. “Instead of retaliation, I went: ‘What do you call this rubbish then?’ And made a tune that got to 29 in the UK top 40,” she says of her 2005 track It’s Over Now. “People don’t mess with Big Ang. She comes up with some big basslines and shells them.”Punters would drive the length of the motorway to hear this music. “People wanted to hear a certain tune so badly, because they couldn’t hear it anywhere else, that they wouldn’t leave until they heard it,” recalls Duggan. The Sunday morning sets, a graveyard shift by most people’s standards, became a destination. “You’d have people rocking up at eight in the morning,” says Duggan. “They would get up, have breakfast, clean their car and drive down for the final three hours.”The atmosphere was electric. In the early days, it was a booze-free place fuelled by pills, dancing and ice pops to help quell the intense heat. Resident DJ Nev Wright recalls one audience member, keen to show his love for the tunes, pulling out an aerosol can and lighter to create scorching fireballs as a mark of appreciation. While Bradford, Birmingham, Leeds, Derby and Dewsbury were all kicking off too, the allure of Niche was so huge that some used to travel just to gawp at it. “When we were underage kids in Leeds we used to pay taxi drivers to cruise us around,” says Tafadzwa Tawonezvi, AKA producer T2. “One night we paid him for a few hours to drive us to Niche just to sit outside and watch people going in.”Given that DJs and producers have spent years trying to undo an unfair reputation placed on the music they love so much, you can understand a bit of retroactive PR work on Niche – with everyone I speak to saying it was safe, welcoming and inclusive – but it was unquestionably littered with instances of violence, and even the murder of the club owner’s brother, Mick Baxendale, back in 1998. While such headline-grabbing events remained in the minority, its edgy reputation was part of the attraction for some. “It was the place where the naughty guys went,” says Tawonezvi. “As an impressionable kid that was exciting.”Trouble aside, the club and music were in perfect sync, and cassette tapes of live sets by Niche DJs were rinsed and treated like treasure. “Oh man, Jamie Duggan January 2004,” says Sampson, recalling his favourite.“They were everywhere,” says Wright. “Every afterparty; in everyone’s cars. The numbers they were doing were ridiculous. They flew out.”As a predominantly working-class sub-genre of dance music, it took a while for bassline to break through from being treated like a parochial curiosity or anomaly. “We were ignored by the press,” says Wright. “It took a while for recognition to come.” However, being overlooked meant that a singular sound and identity could develop. “Growing up, grime felt London-based,” says Sampson. “It didn’t really get recognition up north but bassline just had a really northern feel to it. It’s hard to describe but there’s something really raw and organic about it. And because it’s a northern sound, it gives you hope that it can happen to you because in Bradford there’s not many opportunities.”The crossover moment came in 2007 with T2’s Heartbroken, co-written with singer Jodie Aysha, which spent three weeks at No 2 and would later be sampled by DJ Khaled and Drake. For a teenage Tawonezvi, the track came at a pivotal moment in his life. “I was getting in trouble a lot and I didn’t want the streets to get the better of me,” he says. “I was just thinking about surviving. Where I grew up, you would see crackheads everywhere. My fear was to be a failed man.”T2: Heartbroken – videoHe finished the song and the very next day he was due in court and looking at a prison sentence (he won’t divulge the charge). The case ended up getting thrown out, the track went platinum and his career took off. “My life could have been completely different,” he says. Ministry of Sound bassline compilations followed, mixed by Niche residents. “It just spread like wildfire,” says Duggan. “Trying to shut it down had the complete opposite effect.”There’s now a slew of new artists such Warpfit, Silva Bumpa, Notion, TeeDee and Soul Mass Transit System, as well as the party collective-cum-record label Off Me Nut. Jorja Smith’s new bassline-referencing single The Way I Love You, released last week, nods to Niche in its video. BOTA (Baddest of Them All), a 2022 UK No 1 by Eliza Rose & Interplanetary Criminal, got a bassline twist via a Big Ang remix, while Interplanetary Criminal himself has been seen proudly sporting a “Big Ang Forever” T-shirt while dropping her 2002 bassline tracks to ecstatic young fans at Manchester’s Warehouse Project.“That is one of the most amazing things that’s happened to me,” says Weston. “It makes me feel so proud. Everything I believed in back in the day has come to fruition. There’s a real community, loads of talent, and people are flying, while I’m still shelling basslines and showing the young ones how to get down.” Similarly, Duggan can’t help but feel some vindication. “I’ve been hooked since I was 15, so when everybody talks about it as this legendary thing, it does make you smile knowing that you’ve been there through it all,” he says. “The good and the bad.”Bassline Symphony is atSt George’s Hall, Bradford on 9 MayExplore more on these topicsDance musicClub cultureElectronic musicSheffieldYorkshireBradfordfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What has she learned?Kate MossmanMon 5 May 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 5 May 2025 06.40 EDTShareYoung musicians have so little to say. Give me a rocker in his later years any day. Ask him about his childhood, his relationship with his mum, his painful lifelong love affair with his lead guitarist. Many belong to a specific anthropological group: born after the war, they got their first guitars on hire purchase and went on to date the aristocracy. They became my specialist subject as a journalist: it was impossible to resist the combination of vulnerability, extreme oddness and sharp business nous I found in so many, while others were living in strangely compromised circumstances despite years of deathless hits. I was particularly drawn to those who had continued a career under the radar, or who had slipped under it but hadn’t quite noticed.It was a strange subject to pursue, but always a labour of love – because on some level, I felt a strange identification with these “cosmic dads” of rock’n’roll. The obsession has culminated in a book, Men of a Certain Age. Here are 10 things I learned in the course of writing it.They’re victims of dental crimeAccording to guitaristJeff Beck, the rock star’s distinctive “egg-timer” face (sunken cheeks, faintly simian) was the result of bad 1960s dentistry and a teenage lust for sweets. A man on a flying horse would be hard-pressed to pull Beck out of a lineup with Ronnie Wood, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. He was the inspiration for Nigel Tufnel from Spinal Tap and his stage gear was designed by Hilary Wili, who did the costumes for Downton Abbey. (“She still finds time to stitch me something.”) With their little legs, narrow hips and mysterious “proceeding” hairlines, rockers often look like pickled versions of the boys they were when they first picked up a guitar.Their mindsoperate on a militaristic scaleGreg Lake, talking about Emerson, Lake & Palmer’s biggest gigs, once told me: “I’ve never seen so many people together in one place, apart from in a war.” Paul O’Neill, of the US prog outfit Trans-Siberian Orchestra, claimed to have walked in disguise among his audience before a show in Germany like Henry V before Agincourt. There he met two Sunni Muslims from Iraq and, 90ft away, two Shia Muslims from Iran: “God forbid, two years from now, they end up in two different militias and recognise each other,” he told me. “They would unchamber their weapons and say, ‘Hey, weren’t we at a TSO concert together?’” Many US rockers see themselves as quasi-political figures, ambassadors of western might.View image in fullscreenPlaying for peace … Greg Lake of Emerson, Lake & Palmer.Photograph: Ilpo Musto/REX/ShutterstockThey’re self-made menThis is why Sting is beloved in America. He grew up in the shadow of a 10,000-tonne ship in the docks of Wallsend. One was built and launched every year, a constant cycle of constraint and departure. TheQueenMother attended one of the launches and waved at him from her car. He told himself: “One day, I’ll be on the inside of a car like that.” His father was a milkman, and Sting and his brother would be at the dairy at 4am. The class divide between him and his bandmate Stewart Copeland, son of a CIA diplomat, fuelled much press in the early days. “I developed no accent,” he told me. “Now I only speak Geordie when I’m angry – and I can speak it well.”Their wivesmake sure they behaveRock wives correct mistakes, monitor manners and oversee the business side of things. Gene Simmons claims to have slept with 4,600 women. By the time I met him in Moscow, he was married to Shannon Tweed, a former erotic-thriller actor known for her work in Meatballs III. She was there at the table, flicking through Time magazine. Gene talked about the postwar British diet, citing faggots (lowgrade meatballs) in gravy. Tweed read a definition of faggots from her phone in a slow, Beverly Hills voice: “A bundle of pieces of iron or steel to be welded, rolled or hammered together at high temperature.” “It’s a question of semantics,” said Gene. “Though I’m not anti-semantic.” She told him to finish his porridge. “You’re burping while talking,” she added. “I was?” he said. “At least I didn’t fart.”View image in fullscreenBehind every great man … Gene Simmons and Shannon Tweed.Photograph: DMI/The LIFE Picture Collection/ShutterstockThey like to mock themselves“You find the truth by ridiculing yourself,” Johnny Rotten told me. Punk is the most exhausted story in pop music but Rotten speaks in strange, fresh phrases, as though he’s found a way to keep himself interested. “Vivienne’s clothes were always awful,” he volunteered of Westwood. “All those zips – she had no concept of men’s dangly bits.” Shaun Ryder was similar, spectacularly engaged for someone so blasted by drugs, and strangely amused by the interview and portrait process. His hair had recently fallen out after testosterone injections for an underactive thyroid – head, eyebrows, chest and nethers. He could have been self-conscious, but he made it part of the act as he peered at the photographs and said: “I look like Uncle Fester.”They pine for the sheepskin rug daysRock stars are from another age, when journalists and musicians hooked up on sheepskin rugs and wrote features together in blissful, claret-fuelled symbiosis. After four days with the Soft Machine exile Kevin Ayers in Carcassonne, he made a little bed up for me in his large, empty house. Later, as his manager explained that no romance was to take place, I heard a brief crashing of pots and pans. It’s a shame this all sounds a bit #MeToo in hindsight. It really wasn’t.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

From the late 1960s on, it was a male domain, and male journalists were often at pains to compete with them and disguise their admiration, making statements such as: “Let me tell you why your second album tanked.” Time and again, I have seen relief on the face of a rocker as I enter the room, a loosening of the shoulders. He would then tell me things he wouldn’t tell a man, probably thinking: “Ah, it’s just a girl!”They long to play their new stuffBruce Hornsbyhad a big hit in 1986, The Way It Is, and found a way to live well off it by allowing lucrative cover versions by various rappers, most notably Tupac Shakur. These helped finance his life of bluegrass, jazz and atonal pointillism in the concert halls of middle America. “Look, if you really hate it, don’t come back,” he said of this new material. “You shouldnotcome back, because I am not going to be a vehicle for your stroll down memory lane.” I love these figures who found a way to play only the music they wanted. Jeff Beck was asked to join the Stones once, but told me: “I wouldn’t have been my own master – and that would be my wholebeingtruncated.”View image in fullscreenWill not truncate his being … Jeff Beck.Photograph: Robert Knight Archive/RedfernsTheylove a rivalryThe artist formerly known as Terence Trent D’Arby, nowSananda Maitreya, made plenty of records but struggled to listen to them. His exit from the industry, after his second album flopped, was too painful to recall. Yet like all the best rock stars, he knew the value of his story and exaggerated his musical rivalries. Claiming that Lenny Kravitz was a “cheaper model” of himself, he announced: “Record companies say, ‘Hey, if you likethisasshole, you’re going to likethisasshole, plus we’re making a higher margin onthisasshole!’” I even found a poem on his website to his old nemesis. It was called Lenny K and read: “Fear not / Your girls are safe! / I’ve got an Italian girlfriend now / And my leash is pretty short.”Men of a Certain Age by Kate Mossman review – close encounters with charismatic male rockersRead moreTheir feelings are easily hurtQueen were always suspicious of journalists, ever since the NME ran a piece about Freddie Mercury with the headline: “Is this man a prat?” I chose a clumsy moment to ask Brian May why the press hated Queen: he was trying to swallow a piece of goat’s cheese. “I don’t know,” he winced. “Why don’t you ask them what their problem was?” Sitting in his dressing room, Paul Stanley ofKissput it like this: “The press’s dislike of Kiss was so out of whack, so out of proportion, you almost have to look at someone and go, ‘Who beat you as a child?’”Kate Mossman is senior writer for the New Statesman.

We were taken aback by the popularity of our pieces onhow to get your garden ready for summerand thebest secateursto help you with the spring tidy.It’s also time to dust the cobwebs off your summer wardrobe, and perhaps breathe new life into it with a few fresh items, whether that’s a“sexy spring sweater”, someviral barrel-leg trousersoran £8 mascara.

After retesting 25 of her favourites and five of the latest launches, she pulled togetherher ultimate editfor the Filter. “Even those who consider themselves low-maintenance usually own a mascara,” she says. “It seems no one is immune to how effortlessly eye-framing a few coats can be.” That’s certainly true of Filter readers: Sabine’s bargain pick has been one of the fastest-selling products we’ve ever recommended, after she “fell for this mascara at first swipe”.The best budget secateursView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Clemmie Power CollinsSpear & Jackson Razorsharp Advantage bypass secateurs£9.95 at Amazon“Secateurs are the single most valued tool in the gardener’s trug, an implement as personally prized as the bricklayer’s trowel,” says Matt Collins, head gardener at London’s Garden Museum, in our roundup ofthe best secateurs. They’re particularly important in spring, “the time for cutting back perennials and grasses in advance of new growth”. These Spear & Jackson secateurs are “the most simply designed and hard-working budget secateurs I’ve had the pleasure of trying”, says Matt – and they’ve also been the most popular with our bargain-loving readers.The lunch-break weeding toolView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jonathan BuckleyNiwakihorihori knife£32.95 at Sarah RavenAsk any professional gardener about their favourite tool and you’ll hear repeatedly about the hori hori knife. Once again, gardening experts chose the hori hori asone of their favourite tools for getting your garden summer-ready: “It’s perfect for digging, cutting, weeding and planting, so you can get loads done even on a quick stroll or lunch break,” said garden designerLulu Roper-Caldbeck.The spring sweaterView image in fullscreenBoden Enid embroidered jumper£112 at John Lewis“I have so much love for a sexy jumper,” says Jess Cartner-Morley in herApril style essentials. “Not easy to find, which is why ‘sexy jumper’ sounds a bit like an oxymoron,” she adds, but perfect for cooler evenings where you want a special top that doesn’t give you goose bumps. “I’d wear this out for dinner with a black cami underneath.”The five-star-rated coconut milkView image in fullscreenBiona organic coconut milk£11.95 for 6 x 400ml at Amazon“Buying a good-quality [coconut milk] – as opposed to one bolstered with sweeteners, emulsifiers and stabilisers – often makes the difference between a great dish and a bad one,” said restaurateur Ravinder Bhogal in hercoconut milk taste test.

This litre bottle from dermatologist-founded Altruist may seem expensive, but it “represents, millilitre for millilitre, some of the best value high-quality, broad-spectrum sunscreen on the market”.The‘glass hair’ glossView image in fullscreenGlaze Clear conditioning gloss£15.99 at AmazonHayley Spencer asked the experts which beauty treatments are safe (and easy) to DIY at home– and “glass hair” was deemed achievable (as long as there’s no colour in it). “There’s nothing like that salon-fresh feeling of bouncy, shiny locks that have just been dyed,” she says. “After about a month, though, you’ll likely find that your hair looks a tad lacklustre. It’s probably because the gloss treatment, which coats the hair cuticles and adds nourishment and shine, has worn off.” Glaze’s Clear conditioning gloss can be used on dry hair and takes just 10 minutes to develop, giving your hair that “glass” shine at home.The best budget walking padView image in fullscreenRattantree shock-absorbing treadmill£142.49 at DebenhamsObviously no substitute for a walk outside in nature, but under-desk treadmills have become increasingly popular as a way to boost your daily steps while stuck at your desk. This Rattantree model is particularly accessible, at £142.49: “It’s a mega-value, fairly generic option that hails from China,” says fitness fanatic Leon Poultney in our roundup ofthe best walking pads. “It’s no surprise that it doesn’t offer all the bells and whistles of its pricier rivals. The build quality isn’t fantastic, but it is lightweight, an absolute doddle to use and covers the basics required by most working walkers.”The Pollock-esque bud vaseView image in fullscreenRainbow bud vaseFrom £12.50 at EtsyA reader favourite from our roundup ofcolourful pick-me-ups to elevate your everyday, this bright and cheerful vase is designed to hold a single stem, or at most a small clutch of them.

It’s time to find out what you really wantIt’s easy to go through life mirroring what others want and how they see you. But don’t you deserve more?Moya SarnerMon 5 May 2025 06.00 EDTShareMany of us tend to diminish ourselves and others with some snappy, reductive phrase rather than dig more deeply in search of understanding. Enter the idea of the “people pleaser”. The term has a ring to it; it rolls off the tongue and its meaning seems self-evident. It feels comfortable and anodyne. We know where we are with a people pleaser.But do we really? I hadn’t taken the time to think about it until recently. And the more I did, the more I found the phrase, and the possible unconscious dynamics reduced by it, discomfiting and disturbing. It took several years of psychoanalysis for me to be able to see more clearly what my tendency for people pleasing was hiding, and what I saw did not please me at all. What I saw was not anodyne. I saw that at the core of me, where something real and solid should be, sat a mirror, reflecting whatever I thought others wanted to see.It was a shock to realise that I did not know who I was at all. That the self I had constructed was not really built out of my own character and qualities and desires, but out of my interpretation of what others desired from me. It was a terrible, terrifying realisation – but perhaps the most important from my time in therapy so far. Because before you can start building a better life, you have to ask yourself, do you even know who is deciding what better means?To build a better life, you have to ask yourself who is deciding what ‘better’ meansWhen people talk about people pleasing, they often seem to refer to women. I’m sure, as has often been written, that there is something in the way girls and women are socialised that feeds and rewards this mirror construction, which I see every time I see a girl pouting for a selfie.But I also think this way of relating to ourselves and to others can affect anyone. Perhaps, as the psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott theorised, it is rooted in infancy, linked to the development of what he called the false self. He thought the false self can emerge when a baby intuitively senses that their carer does not have the capacity to manage their true feelings, whether that’s hunger, need, rage, pain or anything else. The false self can then take over and fill up the space where any true sense of self might grow, as the infant tries to be the baby, then child, then adolescent, then adult that is wanted, rather than the one they truly are. Complying, rather than being.I used to think of people pleasing as being an active, conscious choice. I might knowingly pretend to a friend that I didn’t mind travelling to meet them, while privately acknowledging I’d hidden my true feelings about being too tired to shlep. But Winnicott wasn’t talking about this more ordinary kind of pretending; his description takes us into an entirely different domain, an unconscious reshaping of our wants and needs that is totally dependent on the expectations or wishes of others, leaving a sense of emptiness inside where something real could be. For a while, I assumed that there was nothing at the core of me; that this mirror construction was all I was. It was a very unsettling, disturbing period in my therapy.But I now realise that this was not the case. There was plenty there; I just didn’t want to know about it. Very unpleasing feelings lurked underneath the reflective surface: envy, hatred, anger, fear, vulnerability, a sort of puffed-up arrogance as a shield for need and shame and fragility. And, of course, there is plenty more that I’m not inclined to share publicly. No wonder I was so anxious back then; these were some of my monsters hiding under the bed. I used to think of these parts of myself as flaws that needed to be expunged. I’m a bit kinder now. I’ve come to realise that I’m just as human as the next person.I’m a hopeless people pleaser. I tried saying ‘no’ for a weekRead moreSince this realisation, I have also begun to see other characteristics and qualities. They include a kind of big-heartedness, and a courage I was very much unaware of. A resilience and solidity that sits alongside my fragility; that in fact grows out of it. All this was hidden from me, too. Since getting to know these different parts of myself, my life has certainly got better. I feel less empty and more solid now, most of the time. Something has grown inside: something real, a sense of self, a capacity to be in contact with my emotional life and listen to myself in a real way – and to recognise when I cannot – that brings with it a sense of agency. The monsters under the bed, and behind the mirror, are much less anxiety-provoking now I’ve finally introduced myself.Moya Sarner is an NHS psychotherapist and the author ofWhen I Grow Up – Conversations With Adults in Search of AdulthoodDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The only person as excited as a new mum-to-be is her mother. Not only is she becoming a grandmother, she gets to experience one of the happiest and most life-changing events of her daughter’s life, offering her wisdom along the way.My mum would’ve been no exception. She found immense happiness in raising her own children, and she had always wanted me to experience the same joy.But when I told her I was going to be a mum, she was past the point of understanding. She’d been diagnosed with young-onset dementia three-and-a-half years before, at only 58.‘It felt shameful’: the profound loneliness of modern motherhoodRead moreEach time I saw Mum I would tell her my happy news again. Sometimes, she seemed to understand, sometimes she didn’t.For the first half of my pregnancy I was horrifically unwell. And whenever I’m sick, my mum is the only person I want. I adore my partner, but no one can care for you like your mum does. Only your mum radiates worry until you’re better.Through the sickness, and through the excitement, I felt Mum’s loss acutely. There was no one texting me every day asking about my symptoms, sending me links to herbal remedies she swore by when she was pregnant, asking whether I’d felt the baby move yet, or when my next scan was.There was no one excitedly buying baby clothes every time they set foot in a baby shop, as I knew my mother would have done if she still could have. And there was no one I felt I could bother on a daily basis about whether this or that thought or feeling during pregnancy was normal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sometimes, she seemed to understand, sometimes she didn’tWhen my waters broke a month early I felt deeply afraid for my baby. I wanted so much to phone Mum to seek her reassurance; to have her come to the hospital with premmie nappies and tiny onesies. When the baby came five days later I phoned her from the hospital and told her she had a grandson. She said “mmm”, and asked if I knew where her dog was.When my mother-in-law gave us a huge wicker basket filled with beautiful baby things, I burst into tears because I knew my mum would have done the same, but couldn’t. She would have bought so much loot for the baby and I would’ve been protesting that we had no room in the house and asking if she had the receipts because we probably didn’t need 18 newborn-sized cardigans.I think of Mum often in my day-to-day life as a mother now too. Of how she would sing The Little Engine That Could when my brother and were too tired to walk any more: “I think I can! I think I can!” Or how she would get us doing the hokey pokey to wash ourselves in motel showers when no bath was available. Her methods of making scary or impossible-seeming things fun were ingenious.Sometimes, when I need advice, I try to imagine what hers might have been. But it saddens me that I never seem to be able to think of what she would have said. I am slowly forgetting her, even though she is still here. Would she have been a confident grandmother, always offering her advice? Or would she have been self-conscious about not knowing how things are done these days?Signs of dementia or normal forgetfulness? How to tell the differenceRead moreWhen I noticed I was forgetting her, I started writing down little things as I remembered them. Things like how she would eat the syrup off McDonald’s sundaes and leave most of the soft serve. Or how a mealtime rarely went by without her asking if we wanted poo on toast.I love remembering these things, but they also make me sad that my child will never know them, will never know his nana. Even though she doesn’t really know who he is, and always calls him a “she”, my mum’s face still lights up when I take him to visit. She speaks gibberish to him. When he smiles, Mum says how beautiful “she” is.I try to fill the void left by Mum by seeking connection and advice from friends and family members, but she has left a space that can never really be filled. All I can do is try to remember her and, one day, tell my son about her.Explore more on these topicsParents and parentingAustralian lifestyleFamilyDementiaAgeingcommentShareReuse this content"

I tried to be healthy: I would make overnight oats; get only the small mixed sushi from Wasabi; and drink prosecco because someone said it was keto-friendly. I even did Veganuary back when it was such a gruelling feat of strength to be vegan for a month that people would sponsor you in horror and amazement.I felt I had more in common with a pair of old socks than with gym-goers. Terms like “reps”, “leg days” and “core strength” made me cringe, mainly because they were the secret language of an exclusive club to which I wasn’t invited.Yet I still believed I could magic up the motivation to work out profusely and daily. I signed up toFitnessFirst because it was opposite my flat, so I knew I would definitely go. (I went twice in a year.)Then I realised the problem: I had set the bar sky high. Just like any fad diet, the plan was always doomed to fail. One day, I wondered if I could stick to doing a 40-second plank, every day for a week. Just to see. Forty seconds was all I could manage at the time, and a week seemed doable.View image in fullscreenForty seconds of doing this could change your life.Photograph: Peter Flude/The GuardianFive years later, I can now do a two-and-a-half-minute plank and various other strength exercises. I still do it all religiously every day and the domino effect it has had has changed my life.About a year in, I began to encounter a tantalisingly unfamiliar feeling: physical strength. I noticed I was standing differently, taller perhaps, my core naturally taut. There were even the beginnings of – dare I say it – abs. Am I someone that has abs, I wondered?About a year in, I began to encounter a tantalisingly unfamiliar feeling: physical strengthThe feeling was exhilarating. I had spent years body-shaming myself: as a teenager, I existed on a diet of pasta and worshipped Kate Moss, so I always believed I was overweight because I wasn’t a waif. Now, suddenly, I was accepting my body, even liking it. But my body hadn’t changed size – I just felt stronger physically and, consequently, mentally.This newfound confidence led me back to my childhood sport: competitive swimming. I am better at swimming now because my core is stronger and my core gets stronger the more I swim. A coach recently referred to me as “an athlete” and I laughed (before spending the rest of the day smirking and in my head trying out the word “athlete” next to my name).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You could describe zhoug as a green chilli sauce, but that wouldn’t quite do justice to this amazing Yemeni condiment, which is packed with flavour from preserved lemons, cardamom and garlic. Use some to stir through the hot, just-cooked jersey royals, then serve the rest as a sauce for the chicken. The only accompaniment you then need is a light green salad: a handful of whatever leaves are to hand, some finely sliced fennel and a few pumpkin seeds, all dressed with lemon juice, olive oil and sea salt.Crispy chicken with zhoug and jersey royalsPrep20 minCook16 minServes2350g jersey royals, cleaned and halved2chicken breasts4 heapedtbsp plain flour2tsp za’atar(optional)1½tsp flaky sea salt1egg75g panko breadcrumbsOlive oil, for fryingGreen salad, to serveFor the zhoug50g coriander(if you dislike coriander, use an extra 50g parsley)15gflat-leaf parsley1 preserved lemon, skin and flesh roughly sliced1 smallgarlic clove, peeled6 green cardamom pods, seeds only2 green chillies, pith and seeds removed if you prefer less heat½tsp caster sugar½tsp ground cumin50ml olive oilCook the potatoes in a large pan of boiling water for 10 minutes, until cooked through. Meanwhile, put the chicken breasts on a large board, spacing them well apart, and cover loosely with a double layer of clingfilm. Use a rolling pin evenly to bash out the chicken to 3mm thick (by the time you get round to coating it in breadcrumbs, it will have bounced back to about 5mm); if the chicken breasts have mini fillets attached, separate them and flatten them, too.Get three shallow bowls or trays, each one large enough to hold one piece of the flattened chicken. Mix the flour, za’atar, if using, and half a teaspoon of salt in one dish, beat the egg in another and tip the breadcrumbs into the third. Dip each chicken piece first in the flour, then in the egg, and then in the breadcrumbs (use a different hand for the dry ingredients and for the egg, or you’ll end up with crumbed fingers), then put on a large plate or tray. Repeat with the remaining chicken.Try this recipe and many more on the new Feast app: scan or clickherefor your free trial.Heat a tablespoon of oil in your largest saucepan – if it’s not large enough to do both pieces at once, do them in turn. Fry the chicken on a medium-high heat for three to four minutes on each side, until cooked through, adding a little more oil as needed. Transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper to drain while you fry the rest of the chicken.Meanwhile, tip all the ingredients for the zhoug, plus a teaspoon of salt, into a small food processor or high-speed blender, and blitz to a smooth, green sauce.

The annual event has become a pop cultural phenomenon by reinventing party dressing as a world of internet-breaking daredevil stunts.

This intellectually minded celebration of diversity lands at a moment when the Trump administration is pushing back robustly against both diversity and intellectualism.With popcorn-worthy dramatic timing, a show that honours America’s immigrants and celebrates understated elegance and inclusive definitions of masculinity has an all-singing, all-dancing moment in New York, under the gaze of a government that stands in baseball-hatted opposition to all of the above. Donald Trump’s second term has seen a dramaticpushback on diversity and inclusion programmes.And while other culture wars of the Maga era are happening on elite campuses, the high-profile opening night red carpet will put Kardashians, supermodels and sports stars at the centre of the conversation.View image in fullscreenA$AP Rocky and Rihanna arrive at the 2023 Met Gala.Photograph: Angela Weiss/AFP/GettyThe party also puts in the spotlight the editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour, who has led Vogue in vocal support for Democrats at a moment when loyalty to Trump has become all-important in American public life. Wintour will host the party flanked by co-chairs A$AP Rocky, Colman Domingo, Lewis Hamilton,Pharrell Williamsand LeBron James.‘Money does not whisper – it shouts’: how Trump 2.0 ushered in a brutish new era of power dressingRead moreThe fashion on theMet Galared carpet – and at the afterparties, for which second looks are standard – reach many more people than will visit the exhibition. This year’s dress code is “tailored for you”. Bespoke suiting, pocket squares and cravats, bow ties and shiny shoes are expected to make a strong showing on the red carpet.A high representation of black designers is anticipated, to reflect the spirit of the show. The British Vogue editor, Chioma Nadi, will be wearing a suit by Martine Rose. Privately, some celebrity stylists are reporting anxiety among white celebrity clients around how best to respectfully dress for an event that celebrates black culture. Williams has tipped Rihanna and her partner, A$AP Rocky, as the couple to watch on the red carpet. “Those two, they come through with a blowtorch,” he said.Hamilton appears in the current issue of Vogue in a tuxedo with a bow tie and a large Tiffany diamond earring worn as a brooch. In an accompanying letter, Hamilton wrote that he hopes the night “sparks conversation and reconfirms the connection between fashion and self-expression, and how deep it runs in black culture”. He added that “particularly in the States, in terms of people pulling back on diversity … I think this Met Gala sends a really strong message that we must continue to celebrate and elevate black history.”Domingo told Vogue that at a preview of the exhibition he “got really emotional” on seeing “these dark, beautiful mannequins with wide noses and shiny dark skin, lean and beautiful [that were] specially made for the show”. A flamboyant dresser, who attended last year’s Met in an ivory tuxedo with a floor-length cape accessorised with a spray of calla lilies, Domingo said style “has been key to our survival as people of colour to imagine ourselves in a different situation. It’s not just about clothes. It’s about how we – men, women, people of colour – sort through the world to find images that allow us to exist in spaces that aren’t always available to us.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has hinted that he will wear more than one outfit, representing “great moments in tailoring for men of colour”.Congresswoman Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, who wore a gown emblazoned with the words “Tax the rich” at the 2021 gala, is thought to be on the guest list. But as a fundraiser for the Metropolitan Museum, the gala has always courted America’s wealthiest people. (Tickets cost about $75,000.) Elon Musk has attended twice, in 2018 and 2022. Ivanka Trump has made 12 appearances, most recently in 2016.Observers are watching the guest list closely to see whether Wintour extends any olive branches to Trump’s inner circle. Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez made their Met debuts last year, although sources have reported they are skipping this year’s party in favour of preparations for their wedding in Venice this summer.The exhibition is a collaboration between the Costume Institute head, Andrew Bolton, and the guest curator Monica L Miller, and is inspired by Miller’s 2009 book, Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity. Miller’s book chronicles how dandyism developed as both an aesthetic and a strategy, pushing at the boundaries of political and social possibility.“Dandyism can seem frivolous, but it often poses a challenge to or a transcendence of social and cultural hierarchies,” Miller told the Met.Explore more on these topicsMet Gala 2025VogueAnna WintourMet GalaMagazinesDonald TrumpDEI policiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I am not, surprisingly enough, in outer space. I’m at theCrawick Multiverse, a cosmos-themed land art installation in the south of Scotland that was built on the site of an old open-cast coal mine and is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year.The galaxies here are huge, spiralling mounds of earth, their perimeters reaching out towards one another but never quite touching.“These galaxies are slowly moving towards each other, and eventually they’ll collide,” says Gillian Khosla, chair of the Crawick Multiverse Trust. “When that happens, it will be the end of our universe.” Thankfully, we’ve got a few billion years until then.We stroll around the grounds and watch as visitors climb the mounds, looping around the spirals to reach the sandstone boulders on top. Parents are chased by kids, who are less interested in the cosmological ideas of the art than the fact it happens to double up rather well as an obstacle course.View image in fullscreenThe north to south avenue is lined with hundreds of stones salvaged from the old open-face coal face.Photograph: Stuart Kenny“We’re open to everybody’s way of looking at it,” laughs Caroline McMillan, a local farmer and Crawick Multiverse trustee, who joins us for the walk. “It can be an artsy thing, or it can be a nice place to come for a coffee – or to roll down some hills with your kids.”The coal mine that once operated here was shut and abandoned in the 1980s,when the “black gold” ran out. The land is owned by the Duke of Buccleuch – one of Scotland’s largest landowners. In 2005, he invited the late land artistCharles Jencksto transform it.“It was a depleted site,” says Khosla. “Everything was removed that was worth money and nothing was left. What open-cast coal mining tended to do was take, take, take; and what we’re trying to do here is add – add interest, diversity, nature and add value to the community.”What open-cast coal mining did was take, take, take; and what we’re trying to do here is add – add interest, diversity, nature and add value to the communityGillian KhoslaMcMillan lived in a house overlooking the site for much of the development. “It was grey and uninteresting,” she says. “Now it’s green and there’s a lot more biodiversity – ponds and dragonflies. It’s created jobs and it’s somewhere people bring people now; family and friends.”View image in fullscreenA view of the Northern Lights from Crawick Multiverse.Photograph: Mike BolamThe installation was built with existing materials – sandstone boulders were transformed into planets and black holes.

This remains a little-visited part of Scotland, despite its beauty, which is particularly apparent in early spring, with the sun shining and daffodils disrupting the greenery. Some old coal bings (piles of waste rocks) are still visible beyond the boundary walls, though digging ended decades ago.I continue my artistic voyage atA’ the Airts, a community art centre and cafe in the historic town of Sanquhar, just minutes from the Crawick Multiverse. Andy Williamson, chair of the centre, is originally from the neighbouring parish of Kirkconnel. Decades ago, like many in the local area, he worked at the Fauldhead colliery in Kirkconnel, which at the time was the largest pit in Dumfriesshire. In Sanquhar and Kirkconnel, thousands once relied on the pits to earn their living. The closure of the mines had a profound impact here, still felt today.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s down to maybe 2,000 now. The village never recovered.”A’ the Airts has a busy programme of music, film and poetry – some of it inspired by that mining legacy – as well as workshops on quilting, pottery and the distinctiveSanquhar knitting pattern. “I think one of the redeeming features of a mining village anywhere is the community spirit,” Williamson says. “That’s still relevant here. Everybody pulls together.” Green shoots sprout from mined land.Sanquhar is a picturesque town with a long history. On the edge is the ruin of a 13th-century castle where Scotland’s national hero William Wallace is said to have battled the English and Robert the Bruce is also believed to have visited. The poet Rabbie Burns frequented the town in the 1780s, often staying the night. Sanquhar is also home to the oldest working post office in the world, established in 1712.The story of such Scottish legends is told at theSanquhar Tolbooth Museum, which is to be found in an 18th-century baroque building on the high street that also houses old Davy lamps and mining pickaxes.View image in fullscreenThe historic town of Sanquhar, which boasts the world’s oldest working post office.Photograph: Duncan IrelandToday, there are new paths leading to Sanquhar Castle, new play parks and increasing tourism. “It’s all about making the place a bit better for the next generation,” says Lisa Black of the Sanquhar Enterprise. “That means something.”I spend a comfy night at theNithsdale hotelbefore continuing my journey on theSouthern Upland Way– a hiking route running 214 miles, coast-to-coast across the south of Scotland.The trail turned 40 last year and marked that anniversary with sculpted way markers, which were installed at the start and end of thethree sections(western, middle and eastern) that make up the trail.Sanquhar marks the end of the western Spirit of Galloway segment and the beginning of The Big Hills section through the centre of Scotland. I’m walking the eight miles to Wanlockhead, the highest village in Scotland and home to theMuseum of Lead Mining, which offers the only underground mine tour in Scotland.It is early, and I follow a farm road steeply out of Sanquhar as a dawn chorus of song thrushes, blackbirds, robins and wrens sing to welcome in the day.

Greece may be among Europe’smost populardestinations but workers are in short supply.Shortages are such that just weeks away from tourists flying in, an estimated 80,000 work slots have yet to be filled in the food and hotel sector – the backbone of an industry that, at 25% of GDP, is the engine of the Greek economy.Stathokostopoulos is not the only entrepreneur struggling to find staff to meet the demands of the popular taverna at what is likely to be the busiest time of the year.Nationwide, hoteliers are in race to find front desk managers, cleaners, lifeguards, door staff, waiters and cooks. On big-draw islands such as Crete and Rhodes, reports of hoteliers poaching employees from competitors with promises of better pay and work conditions have soared.“It’s partly a legacy of the [Covid-19] pandemic, which all ofEuropehas felt but in Greece the problem is particularly acute,” said Giorgos Hotzoglou, president of the Panhellenic Federation of Workers in Food Service and Tourism (POEET). “What we’re seeing is an unprecedented lack of qualified and experienced workers, especially in the hotel and food industry, following the exodus of employees during the lockdown. Many never returned. As a result an estimated 80,000 jobs are now needed.”For Hotzoglou the sector’s seasonality is to blame. “Once the season is over workers are entitled to only three months of unemployment benefit. When there’s a cost of living crisis, how are they expected the rest of the year to possibly survive?”Tourism is not the only sector hit by the labour shortages. Construction and agriculture have also been affected by the scarcity in a country not only confronting a dramatic demographic decline but still reeling from the exodus of more than 500,000 mostly high-skilled students and workers at the height of its near decade-long economic crisis.In a bid to address the problem, partly because of pressure from local MPs, the centre-right government hassought to legalisethe status of about 30,000 unregistered migrants. It has also signed an array of bilateral agreements “for labour mobility” with third countries including Egypt, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Georgia, India and Moldova.“I’ve just received a recruitment offer from a company in Dubai that I’m considering,” said Stathokostopoulos. “A Bangladeshi is working in our kitchen and he’s excellent. It’s people from Asia and other parts of the world who are now applying for this type of work.”Asylum seekers, until recently languishing in refugee facilities, will take up jobs in northernGreecelater this month after being trained by the Hellenic Hotel Association – a groundbreaking step in a nation where the coastguard and other officials have been accused by human rights groups of illegal pushbacks to keep migrants at bay.Sinceassuming the helm of the migration ministryin March, Makis Voridis, a former far-right student activist, has vowed to expel “illegal migrants”, tightening a government policy that takes a “tough but fair” approach to immigration.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

By 2028, Athens’ tourism ministry has forecast 40 million visitors – nearly four times the country’s population – a result of increased arrivals mostly from the emerging markets of India and China. The tourist season is also lengthening as travel habits change with climate change.Greece has begun actively recruiting abroad, holding career day job fairs in Germany, Holland and the UK. In addition to foreigners, the hope is that Greeks who left during the financial crisis will also return, said Protopsaltis.“We tell people: ‘come back,’” he said. “The Greek economy is not what you remember. It’s doing very well.”Explore more on these topicsGreeceEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Far from help, in the “harsh and unforgiving end of the earth”, the murders and rapes started.“More than 100 people died in the grounding but the carnage didn’t end there,” is how theAustralian National Maritime Museum describes it.“What befell the survivors was sheer horror – anarchy, tyranny, madness, murder and rape, in a reign of terror where people were picked off one-by-one.“Only about a third of the 340 passengers and crew would live.”It’s one of Australia’s most horrifying incidents. Researchers are still studying the mass graves found on the islands.While no one doubts the terror that unfolded, a Dutch academic has posed a different theory: that rather than a dastardly plot, ordinary men were driven to terrible acts by starvation.View image in fullscreenArchaeological excavations at Beacon Island have uncovered mass graves.Photograph: Courtesy of Shipwrecks of the Roaring 40s ARC ProjectIt has been said the Batavia storyparallels the TV show Yellowjackets, and it has also been credited with inspiring hit UK reality show The Traitors – which was originally going to be calledThe Mutineers.But what if we’ve got it all wrong?The cultural psychologist Jaco Koehler says there’s an alternative scenario that provides “a better explanation for what happened”. His theory –The Batavia Disaster: A new scenario to explain the massacre after the shipwreck– has been published in the May edition of the International Journal of Maritime History.Koehler writes that bias in the reports from the time and the use of torture akin to waterboarding cast doubt on the theory that one man plotted a mutiny and oversaw a massacre.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads“It is remarkable that an unlikely story about a mad heretic plotting a massacre has been repeated uncritically for almost 400 years,” Koehler says.The Batavia, with experienced commander Francisco Pelsaert in charge, more than 300 people on board and cargo containing silver coins, left Holland for the East Indies (Indonesia) in 1629.Wreck of Shackleton’s ship Quest found, last link to ‘heroic age of Antarctic exploration’Read morePelsaert was at odds with the ship’s captain Adrian Jacobsz from the start, for issues including drunkenness. Jacobsz was friendly with under-merchant Jeronimus Cornelisz, the third most important person on the ship.On 4 June 1629, the Batavia was wrecked on the Houtman Abrolhos Islands off the west coast of Australia. Pelseart rose from his sickbed to shout at Jacobsz: “Skipper, what have you done, that through your reckless carelessness, you have run this noose round our necks?”Some of those who didn’t drown stayed on the ship until it broke up completely. Others made their way to the surrounding islands. Most gathered on a small, waterless island that came to be known as Batavia’s Graveyard.Pelseart and other senior officers left the survivors behind to search for water, and ended up sailing to Jakarta (then Batavia) to find help.More than three months passed before the commander returned.Map showing Houtman Abrolhos Islands off Western Australia’s coastIn his absence, Cornelisz took charge. He started ordering the murder of the remaining survivors in the hopes of taking the coins and treasures in Batavia’s cargo hold.He tricked some into believing water could be found on another island, sent some on useless errands where his allies would push them overboard, and sent resistance soldiers off without weapons, not expecting them to survive. Those soldiers found food and water, and sent smoke signals to alert the others – but they were ignored.The soldiers didn’t die, and eventually overpowered Cornelisz when he went after them.When Pelsaert finally returned, he took the mutineers prisoner and heard confessions about the murders carried out under the orders of Cornelisz. He heard that Jacobsz and Cornelisz had always planned to kill any opposition and that they intended to “throw the dead overboard and then go pirating with the ship”.Pelsaert sent Cornelisz and the condemned mutineers to the gallows.Koehler read Pelsaert’s journals, which had records of the interrogations.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

Pelsaert’s story was “partly based on confessions obtained through waterboarding”, he writes, and the accuracy of information extracted under torture should be questioned.View image in fullscreenAn illustration from the 1647 Dutch book Ongeluckige voyagie, van’t schip Batavia (Unlucky voyage of the ship Batavia).Illustration: WikiMediaCommonsKoehler’s alternative scenario describes “extreme violence driven by famine”. There were too many people and not enough food. With Pelsaert gone, there was a “power vacuum”. Some formed a gang, thieving food, intimidating survivors and raping women.Eventually people were willing to kill to survive, he writes.And since then, confirmation bias – “the tendency to favour evidence that supports existing beliefs, while paying little attention to evidence that is inconsistent with those beliefs” – may have played a role in the enduring belief in Pelsaert’s story, Koehler continues.The wreck was found in 1963.Today, researchers are still studying the artefacts and gravesites. They have welcomed this new theory on the Batavia massacre, although they did not necessarily agree with the alternative explanation.Prof Alistair Paterson, from the University of Western Australia’s School of Social Sciences and the Oceans Institute, and Dr Wendy van Duivenvoorde, professor of maritime archaeology at Flinders University, are among those working on site alongside the WA Museum. The project is funded by the Australian Research Council.View image in fullscreenSilver coins recovered from the wreck site of the Batavia off the coast of Western Australia.Photograph: Guy de la Bedoyere/WikipediaPaterson says the team is still studying up to 22 individuals buried in mass graves, and they still only partially understand what happened.“We ended up finding a series of mass burials … which doubled down on the idea that what we now know as Beacon Island was really Batavia’s Graveyard … it’s akin to a church burial ground,” he says.“We need to understand what social processes were occurring so that people were murdered, controlled and contained to that island.“We have the archaeological and the historical narrative and we will always need to hone our theories regarding how this event occurred.”Van Duivenvoorde says Koehler’s theory was a “fascinating” approach that she would share with her students. She said “of course” there was bias in the records – but she does not agree with his conclusions.‘Holy grail of shipwrecks’: recovery of 18th-century Spanish ship could begin in AprilRead more“I’ve worked on those islands, as have a lot of other archaeologists and forensic specialists … there are some resources available that are accessible, especially on the bigger islands, the flora that’s edible, fresh water sources, and so on,” she says.“It was obviously a desperate situation … [but] if survival was the primary goal of the killings, why didn’t they move to West and East Wallabi island?“It’s interesting, it has a lot of interesting new things in it, but I’m not convinced.”Corioli Souter, the head of maritime heritage at WA Museum, says the survivors would have suffered some deprivations, but the question is why the survivors did not follow the smoke signals to find those resources if famine was the rationale for the mutiny.“Surely, moving the survivors to an area with resources would be the next step,” she says.Koehler suggests that people accept the narrative that Cornelisz was behind the massacres because “we prefer the notion of an individual corrupted by evil”.“It saves us from a much more disturbing thought: that mass murder does not arise from [the] monstrosity of a single individual, but from moral decay set in motion by the collapse of authority and the disintegration of social structures,” he says.Explore more on these topicsWestern AustraliaIndonesiaNetherlandsAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Philippine cardinal and ‘karaoke priest’ in the running for popeTagle is considered progressive and humble, but has faced some criticism for his response to the drug war and sexual abuse in the churchRebecca RatcliffeSouth-east Asia correspondentSun 4 May 2025 23.51 EDTLast modified on Mon 5 May 2025 10.39 EDTShareFilipino Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle laughed when asked in 2015 if he had ever considered that he might one day be pope. “I make a public confession here. I cannot even manage my life. How can I imagine a worldwide community?”Despite his self-deprecating response, the Filipino cardinal is among those tipped as a potential successor to Pope Francis. If appointed, he would be the first Asian pope in modern times.Tagle, who goes by the nickname “Chito,” has been described as the Asian Francis, due to his progressive outlook and humble lifestyle. He has previously criticised the “harsh” stance toward single mothers, and people who are gay or divorced. As bishop of Imus, a city near Manila, he rode jeepneys, cheap public minivans and invited the destitute to eat with him.Known as approachable and unpretentious, Tagle is also a fan of singing and dancing. Videos of him on Tiktok have been shared widely, winning him the approval of many in thePhilippines, where karaoke is practically a national sport, and beyond.“When he speaks and gives lectures he’s not the usual, formal priest. He sings. He’s a Filipino. He is a karaoke priest,” said Michael Xiao Chua, a historian at De La Salle University. Tagle has an “off the cuff” style, and is like “a rock star” after mass, he added, saying he had seen volunteers circle around Tagle to manage queues of people wanting to greet him.Tagle, 67, was born in Imus, near the capital region Metro Manila, to Catholic parents who worked in a bank. “He’s [from] a very simple family – not poor but not rich,” said Mary John Mananzan, a missionary benedictine sister who has known Tagle for decades. Tagle reportedly wanted to become a doctor, but entered the church after a priest tricked him into applying to a seminary in Quezon City. He obtained a doctorate at the Catholic University of America and became Bishop of Imus and, later, archbishop of Manila. He was made a cardinal by Pope Benedict XVI in 2012.In a bastion of Catholicism, Filipinos mourn Pope Francis and wonder who comes nextRead moreBut his rise to the top echelons of the Catholic church has not been without controversy. Tagle served as president of Caritas Internationalis from 2015 until 2022 when the leadership team was removed due to concerns over mismanagement. At the time Tagle – who was not involved in day-to-day operations – said the decision did not relate to allegations of sexual abuse or mismanagement of money.This March a survivors group, the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, called for an investigation into Tagle, and five other cardinals, in relation to the handling of alleged child abuses cases by Caritas Internationalis in New Zealand and the Central African Republic. Tagle has not commented on these calls.Campaigners have said Tagle has not worked hard enough to tackle sexual abuse in the church. Anne Barrett Doyle, co-director of BishopAccountability.org, said last week the church in the Philippines was in the “dark ages” on the issue, and that guidelines on dealing with allegations have not been published on the website of the Manila archdiocese or the Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines. Questioning his suitability, she said: “If Cardinal Tagle cannot even get his brother bishops from his home country to publish guidelines. What on earth can we expect for him to achieve as pope of a global church?”View image in fullscreenCardinal Luis Antonio Gokim Tagle attends a mass at St Peter’s basilica in The Vatican, on 30 April, 2025.Photograph: Tiziana Fabi/AFP/Getty ImagesHowever the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines defended Tagle, stating that during his tenure as bishop of Imus and archbishop of Manila he had “actively participated in the development and implementation” of guidelines on handling sexual abuse cases but that he “no longer holds direct authority over any diocese in the Philippines”. Tagle, it said, “has consistently advocated for a humble and responsive Church that listens to the cries of the wounded and acts decisively to protect the vulnerable.”In the Philippines, Tagle has also been accused of being slow to condemn former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte’sso-called war on drugs. As many as 30,000 people were killed in the crackdowns, which began after Duterte took office in June 2016. Many victims were young men, who were shot dead in the streets.In 2017, Tagle wrote a pastoral letter criticising the killings, saying: “We cannot govern the nation by killing. We cannot foster a humane and decent Filipino culture by killing.” However, some say he should have spoken out more clearly earlier.Duterte’s war on drugs marked a difficult chapter for the Catholic church in the Philippines. Some priests risked retaliation by criticising the killings, and despite international outrage over the killings, Duterte remained highly popular among the Catholic-majority population.Mananzan said Tagle was not “the condemning type”. “He had very strong statements about the extrajudicial killings… But he never [talked] about Duterte as a person.”Tagle opposed thepassing of the Reproductive Health Billin the Philippines, which offered free contraceptives and information on family planning. He also opposes abortion rights.Were Tagle to be appointed pope, it would be met by huge celebrations in the Philippines, where 80% of the population is Catholic.Despite a 500-year history with the Catholic church, the Philippines has always felt that it exists on the outskirts, said historian Xiao Chua.Pope Francis was the first non-European pope in centuries, he said, of a trend that should continue.“We need [another] pope from the peripheries.”Explore more on these topicsCatholicismPhilippinesAsia PacificReligionChristianityprofilesShareReuse this content"

Here are some of the highlights:Winston MarshallSincequitting Mumford & Sons, the double Grammy winning folk rock band he co-founded, four years ago following his controversial endorsement of a conservative journalist’s book, guitarist and banjoist Marshall has found his place in the rightwing ecosystem.The 37-year-old British son of GB News co-owner and hedge fund tycoonSir Paul Marshallnow hosts his own podcast, The Winston Marshall Show, in which he discusses politics with like-minded guests for his 14,000 subscribers.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Ethan Miller/Getty ImagesHeshowed up in the West Wingon Tuesday in a sharp black suit to first congratulate “Madame Leavitt” for inviting him, then try to gauge her position on the “quarter of a million” Britons he insisted had been penalized in the UK for social media posts or perceived speech infractions.“Would the Trump administration consider political asylum for British citizens in such a situation?” he asked.Leavitt, amid guffaws in the room, said the question was “a very good one” and she would “see if it’s something the administration would entertain”.Tim PoolThe host of several conservative podcasts waslinked last yearto a US content creation company the justice department said was paid almost $10m by Russian state media operatives to publish videos promoting Moscow’s interests and agenda.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alex Brandon/APHe appeared in the new media seat at a briefing last week, dressed in a black woolly hat and hoodie, to castigate “legacy media” for promoting what he said were a succession of anti-Trump “hoaxes”, including the story ofKilmar Ábrego García, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador.His question, such as it was, was another attack on the mainstream media: “I’m wondering if you can comment on their unprofessional behavior as well as elaborate if there’s any plans to expand access to new companies?”“We want to welcome all viewpoints into this room,” Leavitt replied, declining Pool’s invitation.Link LaurenBleached blond, and with astriking resemblanceto the Harry Potter character Draco Malfoy, Lauren is a previously unknown musician and content creator who served as a social media adviser to Robert F Kennedy Jr during the new health secretary’s failed presidential campaign last year.His recent wild claims include informing his 875,000 TikTok followers that the Biden administration was a “cesspool of topless trans peopleon the White House lawn”, and was responsible for countless suicides.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: The Washington Post/Getty ImagesOne of the leading sycophants at Leavitt’s alternative briefing, he asked the press secretary:“You’re a very high-profile young mother who seems to juggle and balance it all beautifully. What advice do you have to young parents out there who are starting their careers having kids, building familiesand trying to find that balance so desperately?”Leavitt had no advice to offer, but was keen to point out that “there are so many new moms and dads on our senior staff, but also across the entire administration”.Dominick McGeeUnder the pseudonym Dom Lucre, election denier McGee wasbooted briefly from X(then Twitter) in 2023 for posting a video depicting child sexual abuse, but allowed back on at the insistence of the platform’s owner, Elon Musk.Since then, the self-styled Black Maga influencer has disseminated numerous conspiracy theories on social media, including amplifying Trump’s false claims that the 2020 election he lost was fraudulent, and promoting the QAnon fiction that the so-called deep state was conspiring to usurp the president.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Dom Lucre TwitterHis question during his brief appearance at the new media briefing was thus:“Is there any possibility for names such as Barack Hussein Obama, Hillary Rodham Clinton, to ever possibly get investigated for … any of the wrongdoings they might have done?”Leavitt said it was “refreshing” to hear McGee’s question. “The legacy media would never ask [it],” she said.Arynne WexlerBilling herselfas “just a crazy nonlib girl in a crazylib world”, Maga newcomer Wexler claims to have grown up “as one of few conservatives on the outskirts of the very blue New York City”.“The left doesn’t know what to do with me,” she opines in a self-aggrandizing biography that expresses her fixation on “smashing the status quo and redefining what conservative commentary can be”.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jason Davis/Getty Images for DailyWire+Her first attempt at “stirring things up in the realm of political commentary”, having been granted the honor of the opening question at Leavitt’s alternative briefing, was a racially dubious statement praising the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.“I can attest to the deportations in Florida, my Uber drivers finally speak English again, so thank you for that,” she enthused.Her subsequent question demanded to know what action would be taken against “trans men … masquerading as women in girls’ sport”. Leavitt replied: “Obey the law or you will be prosecuted.”Rogan O’HandleyBetter known by his alter egoDC Draino, O’Handley is a former entertainment attorney with a long history as a commentator on the political right. He was among 15 rightwing influencersgiven early access in Februaryto what the White House said was key new evidence in the case of the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, but which many observers said “fell way short” of the explosive revelations they promised.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jason Davis/Getty ImagesWith more than 7 million followers across several social media platforms, O’Handley was warmly welcomed by Leavitt to the new media seat during a briefing that included Trump’s border enforcer, Tom Homan.He used his opportunity to deliver a lengthy monologue endorsing Trump’s policy of deporting scores of migrants without due process, and excoriated judges who had issued orders trying to stop it.“In Trump’s first 99 days, we’ve seen a coordinated assault on the rule of law by radical judges,” he said. “These judges are providing more due process to violent MS-13 and Tren de Aragua illegal aliens than they did for American citizens who peacefully protested on January 6.”Would Trump consider suspending the writ of habeas corpus for such migrants? O’Handley wondered.“The administration is open to all legal and constitutional remedies,” Leavitt said, adding that she “agreed with the premise” of his question.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationRepublicansNewspapers & magazinesUS politicsprofilesShareReuse this content"

For years, she watched as men with less experience were promoted before her.“Even if I got to interview,” says Adhikari, 42, “the interviewer would be judging me, asking if I might get married, or have children and then suggesting family commitments would take over.”Adhikari’s career finally advanced when she was appointed manager of Amba Yaalu, the first and only hotel with an all-female staff in Sri Lanka, which opened in January. She is part of an 84-strong team busting gender stereotypes in a country whereless than 10% of the tourism workforce is female.Sri Lanka is an outlier in terms of gender equality in the tourism industry. Worldwide,54% of the workforce is female. However, only 14% of women progress to any level of seniority, according to Natalia Bayona, executive director of UN Tourism.Despite this, Bayona thinks the tourism industry is changing quickly, especially since the pandemic. “The good thing about Covid was that it opened a window for developing opportunities that were not there before for women, especially in rural areas,” she says.View image in fullscreenThe Amba Yaalu retreat gives women a chance to work in the tourism industry, where opportunities for women are rare in Sri Lanka.Women are leading businesses and seeing opportunities to rebuild through tourism, she adds, particularly in countries in the global south which have been ravaged by inequality and conflict in the past.“Gender equality is moving fast in tourism and this won’t be a trend, it will [yield] results that tourists want,” she adds. “Women lead in a very special way that takes into account multitasking, responsibility and humanity.”Located on a mango plantation along the banks of Kandalama Reservoir, Amba Yaalu is the newest addition to the Thema collection of hotels, founded by Chandra Wickramasinghe. His inspiration for a female-operated hotel came from his mother, who raised eight children alone while working as a nurse. His aim is to boost female participation in the tourism workforce as well as provide an alternative source of employment for the hundreds of thousands of womenwho leave to become domestic workers in Gulf states.Traditionally, Indian women did the cooking at home. Now, they are leading restaurantsKhushnooma Kapadia, Marriott InternationalWickramasinghe was aware that women made up about 10% of the tourism workforce in Sri Lanka. “This is crazy,” he says. “We have got women leaving to Middle Eastern countries.

Many talented women are gaining recognition for their culinary expertise and for enriching gastronomy.”In Tanzania,Dunia Camp, Africa’s first and only entirely female-run safari camp located in the south-central Serengeti, often leads the way in guest feedback among the 17 camps within theAsilia group. “Dunia has always been top, top, top,” says camp manager Petronila Mosha. “The guests will rave about the service.”Dunia Camp opened in June 2016, and has meant more women have been able to build careers in the tourism industry, traditionally the preserve of men inTanzania. When it was floated as a concept, there were only two or three women working in camps across the company, says Mosha. Now up to 30% of the workforce across the company is female. “We have paved the way for many women … Now if you are a female guide, every company will be like: ‘You are a hotcake, come to us.’ We have inspired a lot of women.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHer StageFree monthly newsletterHear directly from incredible women from around the world on the issues that matter most to them – from the climate crisis to the arts to sportEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Getting women to come and work in the bush was a challenge at first. “Everybody was excited about all women working together only to get here and hear the roar of lions or see their footprints next to their tent,” remembers Mosha. Some only lasted a few days before returning to the town. Then, they had to get used to the physical demands of the job. “We grew up knowing these jobs are to be done by men. When it was you [who had to unload heavy boxes] and there were no men there, it was quite challenging. But we found a way to manage,” she adds.Back in Sri Lanka, the team at Amba Yaalu has also had to get used to working with no men. The kitchen is led by Kaushalya Batagoda, one of the few female executive chefs in the country, who was the only woman in her class at hotel school. She grew up in the area and is passionate about encouraging women from rural communities, many of whom have never set foot in a hotel, into the hospitality business. Some people she manages can’t read and this has been a challenge when handling strong chemicals used for cleaning, for example. Lifting heavy gas canisters also takes a bit more time.Women at the wheel: the female taxi services bringing safety and independence to Bolivian travelRead more“They are very capable and very brave women,” says Wickramasinghe. “That helps to build a lot of confidence, especially at night.”View image in fullscreenFemale chefs at Amba Yaalu, where the kitchen is led by one of the few female executive chefs in Sri Lanka.In both Sri Lanka and Tanzania, the teams have had to battle people voicing doubt over whether women could run a hotel. They have also fought against stereotypes dictating that a woman’s place is at home and that those who are exposed to western cultures will perhaps start questioning the status quo, or develop habits such as smoking and drinking.In the future, all involved want to see more entirely female-run hospitality and tourism ventures and more women working in the sector.

Exiled news outlets were invited back to Ethiopia, journalists were released from prison and a host of new publications sprang up.But any hopes of a lasting press freedom were dashed in 2020 with theoutbreak of warbetween Abiy’s military forces and local rulers in Tigray, Ethiopia’s northernmost region. Amid mounting allegations of atrocities, the government restricted journalists’ access to Tigray and imposed a communication blackout, cutting off the region’s phone and internet.People would roll down their window and say they would come and kill meAnonymous journalistEthiopia clamped down on independent media, claiming it was protecting national security and describing the rebels in Tigray as terrorists. Initially, the government refused to term the conflict a war and instead referred to it as a “law-enforcement operation”, anticipating a swift victory.By the time the conflict ended two years later,about 600,000 people had been killedand nearly 10% of women aged 15 to 49 in Tigray had been raped.According toReporters Without Borders’ annual press freedom index, Ethiopia went from being 110th out of 180 countries in 2019 to 145th this year, as mass arrests and the detention of media workers across the country took their toll.Quick GuidePress Freedom: why does it matter?ShowPress freedom is inworrying declinein many parts of the world, with widespread attacks on journalists - last year was thedeadliest on record- and the shutting down of news outlets due to economic hardship.We are running aseries of piecesexploring the threats and challenges faced by media around World Press Freedom Day on 3 May, created to remind governments of their duty to uphold freedom of expression.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.View image in fullscreenAbiy Ahmed at the World Press Freedom prize ceremony in Addis Ababa in 2019. A year later the government was clamping down on Ethiopia’s independent media.Photograph: AFP/Getty“My trouble started on the first day of the war,” says one Ethiopian journalist. “I wrote an article about Ethiopia descending into a civil war and pro-government activists started labelling me a mercenary, a CIA agent.“These people had hundreds of thousands of followers [on social media] and were sharing my picture.”Soon, online threats morphed into physical ones. “While I was driving, people would roll down their window and say they would come and kill me,” says the journalist.“In the comments of the social media posts, people were pointing out my address, saying they knew my house and would attack me. I was confronted in a restaurant, a parking lot … I was an easy target.”Eventually, they fled, joining at least53 other Ethiopian journalists and media workers exiledsince the war began in 2020, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). Since 2019,at least 200 journalists have been arrested, according to Ethiopia Press Freedom Defenders.View image in fullscreenFive of the many Ethiopian journalists to have been targeted in recent years (clockwise from top left): Tesfa-Alem Tekle; Woldegiorgis G Teklay; Belete Kassa; Yayesew Shimelis; and Guyo Wariyo.Photograph: Yabele Media, Ethio News, Ethio Forum, Oromia Media NetworkAlthough the Tigray war is over, the restrictions on media have continued as conflict flares in other parts of the country, human rights groups say. The CPJ counts 12 journalists behind bars in Ethiopia, putting it among the worst countries inAfricafor jailing journalists.Two journalists have been killed, includingDawit Kebede Araya, a reporter for the regional broadcaster Tigrai TV, who was gunned down by an unidentified attacker near his home in Tigray in January 2021. In 2022, the Dimitsi Woyane TV station in Tigrai was hit by adrone strike. The CPJ did not attribute either to the government, but called for an investigation.Several independent media outlets have been shut down. Two foreign correspondents for the Economist and the New York Times have been deported.

At the time, war was creeping close to Addis Ababa and a state of emergency was in place that curtailed civil liberties.Amir wasdetained for four months but never charged. State media outlets accused him of colluding with the rebels, who are classed as terrorists.We’re operating as if we’re under this total state of emergency, this constant cloud of fearTsedale Lemma“As an independent journalist, I wanted to talk to people and document the situation on the ground,” he says. “They were portraying me as having committed a cardinal sin, something very terrible, just for doing my job.”Last month, policedetained seven journalistsat the privately owned Ethiopian Broadcast Service. On 23 March the outlet had aired claims by a woman who said she had been raped by soldiers in 2020.The woman later recanted her allegations and the outlet’s founder apologised, saying it has discovered the allegations were fabricated after the programme had aired. Police accused the journalists of terrorism and working with “extremist” groups to overthrow the government.“If you are not promoting what the government wants, you are seen as against the system,” says an editor. “Every week, we get letters from government offices complaining about our coverage.“It’s not because we publish wrong facts, but because we are reporting on things like conflict and inflation, things that are seen as critical.”Most journalists now practise self-censorship, says the editor: “Many independent media just repeat government statements. I ask the journalists, ‘Why do you do that?’ They say, ‘I have children, I need to survive.’”View image in fullscreenBirtukan Temesgen cries on EBS TV. After saying soldiers had gang-raped her, she later said the allegations were false. Seven EBS journalists were then detained.Photograph: EBS/YouTubeTsedale Lemma, founder of Addis Standard, one of Ethiopia’s leading independent media outlets, says the police and security services routinely flout legal protections for media workers.“We’re nowhere close to protecting the media from this coordinated assault the government is waging against it, whether it’s mass arrests, disappearances of journalists, the mass defamation of journalists or the delegitimisation of their work,” she says.Addis Standard has had repeated run-ins with the government. In 2020, asenior member of its newsroom was detained without chargefor two months. In 2021, thegovernment briefly suspended the outlet, halting work in its newsroom for a week. Late last year, its video team were detained for a day as they were reporting on people migrating to Addis Ababa.More than half the world cannot speak freely, report findsRead moreJusttwo weeks ago police raided the Standard’s officeand the home of an employee, confiscating computers and phones, and detaining three managers, one of whom was assaulted, Tsedale says.“We’re operating as if we’re under this total state of emergency, [and] this constant cloud of fear doesn’t give journalists the confidence to stay the course with you,” says Tsedale. “No matter how many resources you spend training and mentoring them, they are always on the lookout for a safer, secure job.”Another editor shares similar stories about colleagues being detained while covering news and held for days at police stations. With Ethiopia gearing up for its general election in 2026, he fears further clampdowns. “In two years, we won’t have any independent media left if things continue like this.”A government spokesperson did not reply to messages seeking comment on the state of press freedom in Ethiopia.It has previously said several independent media outlets are highly partisan and do not adhere to proper journalistic ethnics regarding impartiality and verifying facts, instead advocating for certain ethnic groups within Ethiopia’s multi-ethnic federation of more than 80 different peoples."

Photograph: DHL GroupExclusive account reveals previously unreported details and insights into how Kremlin’s sabotage campaign played out on the ground – and the multinational effort to track down the network behind itByPjotr SauerandShaun WalkerMon 5 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 5 May 2025 12.51 EDTShareOn a frosty November morning last year, a broad-shouldered man with short grey hair staggered, exhausted, into a small guesthouse on the outskirts of Bosanska Krupa – a quaint Bosnian border town where ancient stone bridges span the emerald-green waters of the Una River.Alexander Bezrukavyi had been on the run for more than three months, pursued by European security services who accused him of working for Russia’s military intelligence agency, the GRU.Bezrukavyi, 44, had set out from Croatia on foot two days earlier, navigating dense Balkan forests and rugged hills to cross into Bosnia illicitly.As evening arrived, Bezrukavyi messaged his wife, promising her that they would soon be reunited in Russia, and contacted his friend to finalise his plans for getting back home, using new forged papers and a flight from neighbouring Serbia.View image in fullscreenAleksandr Bezrukavyi, right, at the hearing in the courtroom of the Court of BiHPhotograph: BiHBut a few hours later, at about 2am, a group of Bosnian intelligence officers and police burst into his room.Bezrukavyi’s arrest was part of a Polish-led operation targeting a suspected Russian-backed criminal network. The cell is accused of sending parcels containing camouflaged explosives on cargo planes across Europe, triggering fires at three locations.Polish prosecutors believe Bezrukavyi was part of a plot to send shipments with explosives to the US and Canada, a brazen plan that would have marked a major escalation of a sabotage campaign that western security officials believeMoscow has unleashed over the past three years across Europe.Western security officials believe the exploding parcels could have led to a plane crash and mass casualties.When intelligence about the alleged plot reached Washington, it caused so much alarm that top officials in Joe Biden’s administration had called their Russian counterparts to demand that Vladimir Putin call it off.View image in fullscreenBezrukavyi during extradition to Poland.Photograph: MSWiAOn 13 February, three months after his arrest in Bosnia, Bezrukavyi was extradited to Poland amid much fanfare. An image published in Polish media showed a man in handcuffs, chained at the ankles, being escorted off a plane by two masked law enforcement officers.“A Russian hiding in Bosnia-Herzegovina, suspected of coordinating acts of sabotage against Poland, the US, and other allies, was extradited to Poland and arrested by court order,” the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, wrote on X.The country’s interior minister described his extradition as “a serious blow to the Russian sabotage network in Europe”.This exclusive account – based on the first known interviews with two direct participants in the parcel operations, as well as others close to Bezrukavyi’s group and current and former western intelligence sources – reveals previously unreported details into how the Russian sabotage campaign played out, and the multinational effort to track down the wider network behind it.View image in fullscreenDHL fire in Birmingham.Photograph: no creditIt also raises questions about the chain of command in today’s Russian intelligence operations, in which staff officers tend to remain in Moscow, leaving the dirty work on the ground to proxies and recruits.The Polish prosecutor, in a statement, said Bezrukavyi would be charged “with coordinating acts of sabotage in Poland and other countries, consisting of setting fire to buildings and sending courier packages with incendiary materials”.In communications with those close to him, Bezrukavyi has claimed he was duped – unknowingly used to deliver packages coordinated via the Telegram messaging app, without understanding their true purpose. Others in the group claimed the same.“We were being used like blind mules,” one of them told the Guardian. “We were set up.”On the run across EuropeBezrukavyi grew up in Rostov-on-Don, a Russian city near the Ukrainian border, where court records suggest he has a long history of violent offences. Over the years, he faced multiple criminal charges, including illegal possession of weapons, burglary, robbery and drug-related crimes.View image in fullscreenAlexander Bezrukavyi’s Spanish residency permit.Photograph: HandoutAccording to those who know him from his time in Russia, he made much of his money in various smuggling schemes in Ukraine’s Donetsk region, including moving cigarettes across the separatist-controlled border into Russia.In 2019, Russian court documents show he was briefly detained and later charged with participation in an organised criminal ring.Before he could be re-arrested, he fled to Ukraine and settled in Kharkiv – a city nearly captured by Russian forces in the early days of the invasion. As the war raged, Bezrukavyi supposedly lay low in Ukraine, eventually managing to leave for Moldova on 17 February 2024, according to leaked border data.By May, he had entered the Schengen zone via Croatia, and later obtained Spanish residency through a fictitious marriage to a Ukrainian woman.“He couldn’t return to Russia because he was still wanted there, so he stayed in Europe waiting for Moscow to drop the charges,” claimed his real wife, Natalia, in a phone interview. The Guardian has a photograph of Bezrukavyi’s Spanish residency permit.From Spain, Bezrukavyi moved to Warsaw, where he hung out with a group of Ukrainian friends and acquaintances. He shared a flat on the city’s outskirts with Vyacheslav Chabanenko, a clean-shaven Ukrainian, nicknamed “Ponchik” or “Doughnut” for his stocky physique, whom Bezrukavyi had met back in Kharkiv.Chabanenko also had a criminal past, allegedly spending five years in a Russian jail for beating his wife and mother-in-law. He also became friends with Serhiy Yevseyev from the Ukrainian city of Lutsk, who was later detained and is believed to have aided the operation.In the summer of 2024, the group reportedly began searching for jobs among Russian-language Telegram channels commonly used by Ukrainian refugees. Amid the legitimate job listings and housing tips, they apparently came across an anonymous account that went by the name VWarrior, which Polish authorities believe was operated by a GRU handler.View image in fullscreenVyacheslav ChabanenkoThe account began offering courier jobs paying hundreds of dollars per assignment.A close associate of Bezrukavyi who supplied cars for the operation disclosed new details of the parcel shipments to the Guardian.“The packages looked very random – sex toys from China, vibrators, lubricants, cosmetics … we thought it was pretty worthless shit,” said Kirill, whose name has been changed to allow him to speak freely, and who is hiding from law enforcement in a third country, outside Europe and Russia.Kirill said an account they knew only as VWarrior would send the group lists of items to buy via Telegram, which they would then collect and pack into boxes. Kirill said the account would post from several different accounts, all with names that included the word “warrior”.VWarrior usually tasked the group with delivering the boxes from one location to another across Poland and Lithuania, though on at least two occasions, he instructed them to send them via DHL, according to Kirill. All payments to the couriers were done in cryptocurrency.“It could be true that the purpose of the parcels was sinister,” Kirill admitted. “We just wanted easy money, work that wouldn’t involve drugs or weapons … but it turned out to be some packages to test some fucked up shit,” he said.Polish officials would later discover that at least one of the parcels sent by Bezrukavyi’s group concealed a homemade incendiary device, hidden among the sex toys and reportedly crafted from a cocktail of chemicals, including highly reactive magnesium.Multinational race to find culpritsOver the course of three days in July, European security agencies were shaken by three separate package explosions – each sent from Lithuania – that detonated in Birmingham, UK; Leipzig, Germany; and near Warsaw, Poland.View image in fullscreenA DHL logistics centre in Poland.Photograph: DHL GroupWestern security agencies were quick to suspect Russian intelligence was behind the incidents, which came amid a series of other hostile acts – including arson, cyber-attacks, data theft and the targeting of undersea cables.It was a fourth package – sent by another member of Bezrukavyi’s network – that helped Polish authorities piece together what was happening. Dispatched from Vilnius on 18 July, the parcel was prepared by a Ukrainian national, Vladyslav Derkavets, and disguised as a shipment of cosmetics and sex toys.Unlike the others, the package failed to detonate at a depot in Warsaw, allowing investigators to recover it intact and analyse its contents.Reuters earlier reported that the devices were rigged to ignite using pre-set timers repurposed from inexpensive Chinese electronics typically used for tracking lost items. Their impact was intensified by tubes disguised as cosmetics, which were actually filled with a flammable gel containing compounds such as nitromethane.Shipments of sex toys and massage pillows were used to conceal an incendiary device, in what western investigators suspect is part of a Russian sabotage operation.The Guardian obtained what a second source involved in the scheme described as a photograph of the alleged order before it was dispatched. The image – the first of its kind to be published – shows four massage pillows, along with several cosmetic tubes and sex toys, laid on a mattress.The source said the shipment was coordinated by the VWarrior account who paid for it via cryptocurrency, specifically the Tether crypto token, through a middleman.According to information seen by the Guardian, a cryptocurrency wallet said by a source to be linked to VWarrior transferred the equivalent of $960 (£720) to another wallet in July as payment for the delivery.A screenshot of the VWarrior telegram account, no longer active, shows a person in tactical gear and helmet, face hidden. The Guardian was unable to reach VWarrior for comment.View image in fullscreenA screenshot of the VWarrior telegram account.It remains unclear what role exactly Bezrukavyi and his associates played in the three parcel deliveries that caught fire. However, all the couriers appear to have operated within the same network and transported similar content of sex toys and massage pillow devices.As European officials set off on a multinational race to find the culprits behind the mysterious fires, Bezrukavyi’s group continued their courier work, apparently under the instructions of VWarrior.On 1 August, Bezrukavyi, together with Chabanenko, strolled through a market on the outskirts of Warsaw. They picked out two pairs of Nike sneakers and six sets of sportswear, stuffing them into a plastic bag. VWarrior then instructed them to ship the goods to fictitious addresses in Washington and Ottawa via DHL.These shipments appear to have raised suspicion among Polish security services, who had already been on high alert after the string of explosions. Sending American-branded clothes back to North America – at steep transatlantic shipping costs – made little sense.Polish investigators soon concluded the packages with clothes did not contain explosives in contrast to the other shipments. Instead, the shipments, they believed, were a test – a dry run to probe international delivery routes and timing for future Russian operations to target North American-bound cargo.After receiving intelligence about the alleged plot, top officials in the Biden administration were shocked, and wondered whether the Kremlin was aware of the possible implications.“It’s unclear whether the Russian services were aware of the fact that a fairly large number of cargo traffic goes on passenger planes,” said a former US security official, pointing out that the consequences of a mid-flight explosion could be catastrophic.Several top officials called their Russian counterparts and asked them to tell Putin to put a stop to the operation. “I think the calls were successful,” the former security official added.Arrests across EuropeFour days after the trip to the Warsaw market, Polish police forces arrived at the flat shared by Bezrukavyi and Chabanenko in Warsaw, arresting the latter.View image in fullscreenVyacheslav Chabanenko“From that moment on, they started picking up our friends one by one,” said Kirill.Yevseyev, who together with Kirill had provided the car, fled to Spain where he was later apprehended and was handed over to Polish authorities. Derkavets, the Ukrainian who had sent the package that did not catch fire, was arrested in Poland.Kirill spoke to the Guardian from a third country, where he is hiding. A law enforcement source confirmed there was an Interpol red notice issued by Poland for Kirill for “sabotage and espionage of a terrorism nature”.Bezrukavyi was out grocery shopping when the police came for him. His friends warned him about the raid, according to his wife, Natalia, and instead of returning home, he went on the run.He fled to Slovakia, where he spent the next few weeks hiding out in small villages. He decided to attempt to return to Russia, telling Natalia he would rather risk arrest at home than keep hiding in Europe. But on the way, while in Bosnia, Polish authorities caught his scent.Natalia painted the whole case as a huge misunderstanding. “He is completely innocent. This is all a very bad dream,” she said.Warsaw, however, considered Bezrukavyi important enough for the head of its domestic intelligence services to fly to Bosnia to discuss his extradition with his counterpart in the Balkan nation, according to a source with direct knowledge of the meeting.There are also indications that Russia valued Bezrukavyi. Shortly after his arrest in Bosnia, Russian officials initiated a parallel extradition request – citing a 2019 criminal case as the basis.Moscow frequently relies on old charges – or launches new ones – against its own citizens, including intelligence operatives and Kremlin-linked businessmen, to establish legal grounds for demanding them back.Alexander Bezrukavyi shortly after his arrest.Bezrukavyi’s background, in the criminal circles of Rostov region, does not contain any of the red flags previously present in staff GRU officers who travelled to direct operations in Europe. Western intelligence officials say that, hit by travel bans and western sanctions, Moscow now prefers to use freelancers on the ground.“What we see recently is that staff officers of the Russian intelligence services rarely leave Russian territory, instead recruiting agents to do the work remotely, often via Telegram,” said one European security official.These freelancers might know nothing about what they are doing, or they might be trusted coordinators, taking orders from contacts in the security services and recruiting others to run operations.Another western security official, who was briefed on the case, said they believed Bezrukavyi was knowingly working for the GRU, who directed the operation to send the clothing parcels.He recruited friends – many of them financially struggling and with criminal records – who may not have fully understood the true purpose behind the tasks they were given.View image in fullscreenFlight preparations at HUB Leipzig by DHL aircraft mechanicsPhotograph: DHL GroupKirill told the Guardian he had never suspected the parcels could be linked to intelligence work. He admitted he could not be fully certain that his old friend Bezrukavyi was also in the dark about the true purpose of the packages.Perhaps he knew more than he let on. But even then, he said, he did not think his friend would have been acting from any sense of higher calling.“I’m sure he didn’t do it ‘for the Motherland’ – he just wanted easy money. He’s been a criminal his whole life,” said Kirill.One thing is certain, he added. If the Russian services continue their sabotage offensive, there are sure to be more arrests: “There will be others who’ll want to make some money, and someone will be there to take advantage of that.”Russia’s spies: Uncovering Russia’s secret espionage programmes.

She discusses her road trip back into her complicated pastByEmine SanerMon 5 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 5 May 2025 03.41 EDTShareWhen EA Hanks was 14, her mother announced she had bought a Winnebago and they were going to drive across the US in it. It was 1996, and Hanks (her initials stand for Elizabeth Ann), had recently left her mother, Susan, to go to live with her father, the actorTom Hanks, in Los Angeles. “Things between my mother and I were at an absolute low point,” she says. The drive, she remembers, from California – long hours on the road, her mother chain-smoking and listening to Christian rock music, stopping only to eat and sleep – was “three awkward, silent, painful months that would end up with us in Florida”. It is not clear what the point of the road trip was – though Hanks met members of her mother’s family for the first time in Florida – but then not many things were clear with Susan.In 2019, nearly 20 years after Susan died, Hanks took to the same road, Interstate 10, in an attempt to make sense of her mother’s life. This forms the basis of her memoir, The 10. “I had no idea where my mom grew up, or how she grew up, or who was around. All I knew is that she never spoke of it,” says Hanks. “It always had this tinge of southern gothic drama and violence.”Hanks’s childhood had been abusive and neglectful; her mother had at times left her without food or clean clothes, and when she was 13, punched her in the face for no apparent reason. Susan, who had also been an actor and used the stage name Samantha Lewes, was a cocaine addict and mentally ill (not diagnosed, but Hanks writes that her symptoms led her to believe she had bipolar disorder). She also knew almost nothing of her mother’s family. When Susan became ill with cancer, none of them visited her, and none went to her funeral.View image in fullscreenHanks with her father, Tom, in 2007.Photograph: Patrick McMullan/Getty ImagesYears later, going through Susan’s belongings, she found a journal. In it, Susan makes an accusation against her own father that Hanks describes as “an absolutely hellacious crime of sexual assault, murder and cannibalisation of a young girl”. It was so overblown that it seemed unbelievable – this was also the woman who heard the voice of God, and thought her ex-husband had installed men in the walls of her house to spy on her.“I was increasingly aware that my mother’s mental health was precarious and, as her life went on, was devolving into a state of utter paranoia and delusion,” says Hanks. “But my mom’s stories always had a grain of truth and I think when I read the journal, something about this felt resonant. If this is the type of trauma that my mom experienced in her youth, her life makes a little bit more sense to me.” From her father, she borrowed a van – a Ford Transit, affectionately known as the “Shit Box” – packed a typewriter (an appreciation she shares with her dad), researched how to survive on the road, and went in search of answers.Hanks, who will be 43 this month, had become a journalist after university, living in New York City and working for the Huffington Post, “where I was living on a four-hour news cycle, and was essentially working in an HTML sweatshop. I stumbled out the other end in my late 20s, with the beginnings of an ulcer and absolutely no creative process whatsoever.” She moved back to LA in 2012, and did various jobs, including working as a personal assistant and in bookshops. Out with friends of friends, she made them laugh – when we speak over Zoom, Hanks has the articulacy and wry humour of her father – and they offered her a job writing jokes for a TV show. She started creating scripts for shows and films, “that were, thank God, never going to get made”, but it rekindled her love of writing.View image in fullscreenHanks’s parents, Susan and Tom, at the premiere of the 1984 film Splash, in which her father starred.Photograph: Bei/ShutterstockInspired by that 1996 road trip, she pitched her idea of recreating it as an investigation into American politics that would take her from the Democrat-stronghold of California, through Texas and the deep south, to Trump’s Florida. “No editor was interested in that story from me.” She laughs. “Just not the right writer, not the right voice. Basically, [The 10] starts off as a magnificent failure of a magazine piece.” Then it became personal.As Hanks was hoping to uncover the facts behind the mystery of her mother’s life, and her grandfather’s potential crime, she was also trying to get to grips with the truth behind the US’s mythology at a time of growing danger. (She never mentions him by name, but the other man who lurks in the book’s shadows is the current US president. The first time Trump was inaugurated, Hanks writes, she spent a rainy day at Disneyland, a place of consolation as much as celebration for her, Hollywood child that she is.)The places the Interstate 10 passes through, she says: “the south-west, Texas and the deep south, are really doing the heavy lifting in the myth of American exceptionalism – manifest destiny, cowboys and Indians, the ‘gallant south’ – these are at the root of our most pernicious, glamorous and dangerous building blocks of American exceptionalism.”The US she journeys through is extremely beautiful (the deserts, forests and swamplands) and brutal. She sees the best of the country – to Hanks, that’s New Orleans, with its culture defined by its people – and the worst. The vast emptiness of the landscapes isn’t a fact of geography, she points out, but “because we killed 90% of the Indigenous population in a single generation. It’s not empty, it’s a crime scene.”In Mississippi, she visited the Confederate flag-lined estate of Jefferson Davis, who was the first and only president of the Confederate States between 1861 and 1865. The estate is now a museum and Hanks listened to a guide with disgust. “We’re still debating what the civil war was about,” she says. “Is this a war about states’ rights, or is this a war about being able to own human beings?” It made her think about the similarities between personal and political trauma, even if the stakes are wildly different – that one way to deal with it, maybe the only way, is to face it. “You can’t move on from something like the civil war if we can’t even agree on what the facts are,” she says. “That’s why we’re still stuck in it.”View image in fullscreenWith her father in Paris in 1994.Photograph: Arnal/Gamma-Rapho/Getty ImagesWhen Hanks was about five, her parents split up and Susan took Hanks and her elder brother, Colin, to live in Sacramento. She writes about a house full of cigarette smoke, the fridge empty and a back garden too full of dog’s mess to play in. Sometimes, when Susan disappeared for a night or two, Colin would have to look after his sister. Friends’ parents banned their children from having sleepovers at her house, not least because: “The one time a kid did, we found a loaded gun in the box where we kept the television remotes.”When did she realise her home life wasn’t like other people’s? “I think when I was really young I had a language for my mom as an addict which is, I guess, the plus side of what happens when your mom hosts multiple 12-step meetings in your living room.” There were often people with addictions at the house, which was frightening to a child. “I did not have an understanding of why my mom heard the voice of God and why she felt empowered to be in conversation with him in public, no matter how people around her responded.”When Hanks was older, schoolfriends started to notice that she was often without a packed lunch, or that she would ask the teacher for food, or her hair wasn’t brushed and her clothes were dirty. “And let’s not talk about how often I went to the dentist.” Sometimes her mother could be wonderful – she introduced Hanks to classical music, important films and books. She let the teenage Hanks dye her hair, and she drove her around the state to the horse shows in which she competed. The switch between good times and bad was unsettling. It would have been easier, thinks Hanks, if her mother had just picked a side.There was also the wild swing between life with her mother and life with her father, with whom she would spend some weekends and most school holidays, in LA or on film sets (she had a small part in Forrest Gump, the 1994 hit that won Tom his second Oscar). “It was like visiting a bizarre planet occasionally,” she says. Tom Hanks was at the very centre of a booming Hollywood in the 90s. In the family, she says with a laugh, there was “what Colin and I call BG and AG – before Gump and after Gump”.In Sacramento, it was quiet, usually just Hanks and her mother, who would often be chain-smoking in bed and reading the Bible. At her father’s house, it was full of “assistants, and the phone was always ringing, the doorbell always ringing”. And there was family – her two younger half-brothers, and her stepmother, Rita Wilson, and usually many members of Wilson’s extended family. “It’s family dinner and three meals, and suddenly I have to do my homework, which was not something [my mom] cared about,” says Hanks. She remembers going to the Oscars – she thinks it was the night her father won for Forrest Gump – and then going back to Sacramento, where her mother, unable to face cooking, would feed her fast food most nights, and thinking: “My life is not what it was last weekend.”View image in fullscreenHanks … ‘I’m still letting my mom go, and also choosing what parts to keep.’Photograph: Mathew AndersonTo Susan, her ex-husband’s immense success and fame was “catastrophic”, writes Hanks. In Susan’s view, she says: “It obliterated whatever chance she had at an artistic path, a career as a great stage actress.” But for her father, too, fame has been a kind of catastrophe, “in that it obliterates his humanity. He doesn’t get to be a fully rounded person with his own version of good days and bad days. He can only be Tom Hanks, and people lose sight not only of his personhood, but also, I think, his artistry. It just becomes a brand.” In Sacramento, however frightening: “The one thing that I had is that I was growing up in anonymity, with privacy, mostly before the internet, and certainly before the heyday of the tabloid industry that was documenting the lives of the ‘daughters of …’ I got to skip all of that.”As a child, she remembers feeling deeply embarrassed on behalf of the people who became so starstruck and emotional around her father – these days, he’s not just the Hollywood Everyman, but America’s Dad. “As I got older, I changed how I feel. I think I have a much deeper respect for what is happening for those people in that moment, which is that they are recognising a true friend. It’s a one-sided friendship, but I don’t think I can question the genuine nature of what is playing out on their face, the joy they have in recognising someone.” For those in their 20s and 30s who grew up with Toy Story – the main character, cowboy Woody, being voiced by Tom Hanks – it’s especially true. “I would argue, and I know that my dad would agree, that Woody is his great artistic legacy. If you can be cynical about a grown person who instantly transforms back into that child when they hear [his voice], you’re a sharper person than I am.” She adds with a smile: “I also think you get a little older and you’re, like: ‘Oh, that is why I don’t have college debt, so let’s respect it.’”When she was a child, her father knew what her home life with her mother was like, but despite trying, says Hanks, he did not have custody of his children. “While my mom was a scary and physically threatening presence who pushed, and pulled hair, and locked me in closets and used food deprivation as a tool, she was not someone who, up until that point, was hitting me.”View image in fullscreenEA Hanks (right) with her father, her stepmother, Rita, and her half-brother, Truman Theodore Hanks at the Oscars in 2020.Photograph: UPI/AlamyThen, one night when Hanks was 13, seemingly out of nowhere, her mother dragged her across the room, and punched her in the face. “It wasn’t until that happened, and we had evidence of assault that I was able to leave.” But Hanks had always felt the threat of violence. “It’s a lifetime spent on very thin ice, and you’re aware of every step you take, and the threat of pushing someone from it being a good day, into it being a bad day. You get very agile with good jokes, changing the subject.” As an adult, it led to “emotional distance, discomfort with intimacy”.By the time she took to the road, with her mother’s death nearly 20 years in the rear-view mirror and years of therapy, Hanks had reached a degree of peace. It is probably not a spoiler to say her book does not have a neat Hollywood ending, this being real life, but Susan emerges as someone who was failed by the culture she grew up in. As in 1996, her mother was her travel companion – she brought along Susan’s journal and a white binder full of her poetry, some of which she includes in her book. Some of her writings are rambling and alarming, her illness on the page, but some of her poetry is lovely. “I think anybody who’s buried a loved one knows that feeling when the two-way conversation suddenly becomes one-sided,” says Hanks. “To engage with her on that level, in good faith as her editor [Susan wrote multiple drafts of her poems], was like entering back into conversation with her.”Six months on the open road gave Hanks the time and space to think about her mother – not just the sadness of her life, and the damage she did, but other things too. “When someone’s been dead for 20 years, you forget. Were my mom’s eyes hazel? What did her voice sound like? What was that recipe that I really enjoyed that she made on the rare occasions she cooked? It was remembering that 20 years on, I’m still letting her go, and I’m also choosing what parts to keep. That is something that the book gave me – to remind me that I’m still my mother’s daughter.”In the UK, theNSPCCoffers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000.

Khuntale lives in Mumbai now, but visits the gardens as a ritual every time he goes home to Karad. On the day he took this photo, in 2017, he was there to meet friends for an evening stroll. The gardens lie against the banks where the Krishna and Koyna rivers meet, and the group walked by the water, talking, admiring their surroundings and stopping for street food.One of the group was Khuntale’s childhood friend Tejali, who had been stopping to pick flowers along the way. Khuntale suggested taking a photo with his mobile phone. He positioned himself behind Tejali’s head to take the shot, then later rotated the image 180 degrees.“The beauty of this angle is the distortion, where the important parts of the image – her beautiful hair and the yellow flowers – look even more prominent and vibrant,” Khuntale explains. “The flowers are called bhringraj, a common weed in India that is thought to lower blood pressure and cholesterol, and promote hair growth. It was a total coincidence that I placed the flowers in her hair; I didn’t realise the connection until the next day.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

They are not permitted to put up tents and the police in the seaside city carry out evictions of the camps three times a week.According to demonstrators at a protest against these policies in January, the evictions are carried out at a fast pace, with tents and sleeping bags seized by the authorities, who are desperate to prevent another permanent camp being set up.View image in fullscreenThe beach at Calais, where the authorities are attempting to transform the image of the cityView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenA camp in the woods (left) and people washing their clothesThe city’s hostile environment includes barbed wire, boulders to prevent tents from being erected, and surveillance devices. This is a result ofan agreementunder which the UK has paid the French government hundreds of millions of pounds to deter displaced people from coming to Calais and attempting to cross the Channel.Despite this inhospitable urban landscape, the municipality of Calais has been attempting to attract more tourists.This was symbolised by the appearance in 2019 of the “Calais dragon”, a fire-breathing colossus built of steel and carved wood.

By a narrower majority the judges voted 9 to 7 to strike the case entirely from the ICJ list.There have been repeated allegations during the two-year civil war inSudanthat the UAE has been flying arms to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in an attempt to oust the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) led by Abdel Fattah al-Burhan.However, when the UAE signed up to article IX of the genocide convention in 2005, it inserted a reservation stating it would not allow disputes about the interpretation, application and fulfilment of the convention to be resolved at the ICJ.The ICJ ,president, Yuji Iwasawa, acknowledged that Sudanese government lawyers in presenting their case claimed that the RSF had engaged in “extrajudicial killing, ethnic cleansing, rape, enforced disappearances and burning of villages as well as killing on an ethnic basis”.The court was “deeply concerned about [how] the unfolding conflict led to untold loss of life and suffering in west Darfur”. But, the president said, the UAE reservation had been formulated in clear terms, and was not incompatible with the purpose of the genocide convention.‘Smoking gun’ evidence points to UAE involvement in Sudan civil warRead moreThe judges’ ruling was largely expected but marks a second diplomatic victory in the UAE efforts to ward off allegations that it has been prolonging the bloody two-year civil war by arming the RSF. A UN panel of experts report on 29 April published no evidence that the UAE was arming the RSF.Speaking after the ICJ ruling in The Hague, , deputy assistant minister for political affairs at the UAE ministry of foreign affairs said: “Quite simply, today’s decision represents a resounding rejection of the Sudanese Armed Forces’ attempt to instrumentalise the court for its campaign of misinformation and to distract from its own responsibility.“The facts speak for themselves: the UAE bears no responsibility for the conflict in Sudan. On the contrary, the atrocities committed by the warring parties are well documented.“The international community must focus urgently on ending this devastating war and supporting the Sudanese people, and it must demand humanitarian aid reaches all those in need. The Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces must stop fighting, must stop weaponising aid, and must endorse civilian leadership independent from military control as the only foundation for sustainable peace.”The ICJ ruling that it had no jurisdiction is controversial for some. A group of prestigious international jurists last week backed a legal opinion from the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights that argued: “While some narrowly tailored reservations to article IX of the genocide convention might be permissible, blanket reservations to the entirety of article IX should be rejected as invalid.”They argued “the utility of the genocide convention is not for states to adopt these principles in the abstract, which exist with or without the convention, but to bind states to comply with its terms.“To allow states to exempt themselves from the genocide convention’s only judicial mechanism not only undermines the integrity of the convention, but also the efficacy, foreseeability, and reliability of the international system as a whole.”Currently 153 states are party to the genocide convention, with 16 states inserting blanket reservations including the UAE. The UK has been one of a group of influential states that have argued such broad reservations may be incompatible with the convention.In its opinion, the Wallenberg Centre concluded: “The current expectation that the court bend to the will of outlier reserving states seeking to evade participation in cases as significant as genocide should be reversed. In 2025, these states should not have the final word before the judicial process even begins. They should be compelled to account for their actions in a court of law.”Explore more on these topicsInternational court of justiceSudanAfricaMiddle East and north AfricaUnited Arab EmiratesInternational criminal justicenewsShareReuse this content"

It has been drawn up to support global efforts to hold perpetrators accountable and the lawyers have requested that the Met unit – part of the force’s counter-terrorism command known as SO15 – reviews the dossier before passing it to the international criminal court (ICC) to assistinvestigations into RSF atrocities in Darfur, in the west of Sudan.Now into its third year, thecatastrophic warbetween the RSF and the Sudanese military has prompted the world’s biggest humanitarian crisis, killed at least 150,00 people and forced 12 million from their homes.The lawyers said the documents, given to the Met on Monday, offer evidence that the RSF’s leadership are responsible for repeated war crimes, focusing on the legal principle of “command responsibility” – that commanders knew or ought to have known about the atrocities committed by their troops.Former international judgeSir Howard Morrisondescribed the dossier’s weight of evidence as “compelling”.View image in fullscreenPeople flee after the Rapid Support Forces attacked Zamzam displacement camp in April.Photograph: Courtesy of North Darfur Observatory For Human Rights“The novel approach through the highly regarded offices of SO15 adds great impetus to the potential accountability of those responsible for the atrocities that have been visited upon numerousvictims in Darfur,” Morrison said.The lead lawyer, Lucia Brieskova, added: “We believe this submission will contribute to the fight against impunity suffered by many inDarfurin Sudan.”The case was instructed by a Sudanese pro-democracy supporter, whom the Guardian is not naming for security reasons.It comes as the international court of justice is expected to deliver a verdict on whether the United Arab Emirates can plausibly be found “complicit in the commission of genocide” by arming the RSF in Sudan’s civil war.The case was brought by Sudan who said the UAE has been arming the RSF with the aim ofwiping out the non-Arab Masalit populationof west Darfur. The UAE has said the case is a cynical publicity stunt.‘They were chanting as they killed people in their homes’: survivors describe attack on Sudan’s Zamzam campRead moreRecently the Trump administration characterised atrocities committed by the RSF in Darfur as genocide,reaffirming a designationmade by the Biden administration in January.The submission sent to Scotland Yard says evidence assembled by the UN, human rights groups and the media, proved war crimes in Darfur were perpetrated by RSF troops.“Steps should have been taken by the RSF leadership to address the situation.“Taken together, this direct and circumstantial evidence makes it clear that the RSF leadership either knew, or at least should have known, that the war crimes were being committed by the RSF in Darfur. Therefore, they have a case to answer under international criminal and humanitarian law,” it states.Although the ICC investigation is focusing on war crimes in Darfur, reports of atrocities being committed throughout the country continue to emerge.Last week, footage circulated online showed at least 31 people, including children, were killed by the RSF in Khartoum’s twin city of Omdurman.The Sudanese army also faces accusations of committing atrocities against civilians, with its leaders sanctioned by the US.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentConflict and armsDarfurSudanAfricaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Police said the hostages were tortured and that video footage – allegedly recorded by the captors themselves – showed the miners were shot dead at point-blank range.Illegal gold mining has surged in Peru, Latin America’s biggest producer of the precious metal, just as the international price peaked once more at around $3,500 per ounce. Meanwhile acrime wave has swept the countrywith unprecedented rises in racketeering and killing-for-hire. 2024 saw a record increase murder rates – a 35.9%increase in homicidescompared with 2023.Teacher murdered in front of schoolchildren as Lima gripped by crime waveRead more“Illegal mining is the most lucrative criminal activity in the country,” said César Ipenza, an environmental lawyer. Illegal gold mining accounted for $9bn , or 60% of Peru’s total laundered assets betweenJanuary 2014 and October 2024, according to the country’s Financial Intelligence Unit, dwarfing the next biggest sources of laundered assets.Once confined to certain zones illegal gold mining has spread throughout the country since the Covid-19 pandemic. The gold-rich area where the mine is located in La Libertad region has been under a state of emergency for more than two years due to ongoing violence and unrest.This massacre brings to 39 the number of artisanal miners and workers killed by criminal gangs in Pataz, the company La PoderosaMiningconfirmed in a statement.“The spiral of uncontrolled violence in Pataz is occurring despite the declaration of a state of emergency and the presence of a large police contingent which, unfortunately, has not been able to halt the deterioration of security conditions in the area,” the statement added.In December, thousands of gold miners camped out in the downtown Lima and blocked the main highway to insist that the government maintain a registry of informal and illegal miners known as REINFO which protects them from prosecution.Explore more on these topicsPeruAmericasMiningnewsShareReuse this content"

But when they awoke later in the morning, the two children were gone.The Royal Canadian Mounted Police believe the pair, members of the Mi’kmaq First Nation community of Sipekne’katik, wandered off from their home and probably entered a heavily forested area.Among the resources devoted to the effort have been dog teams with the heavy urban search and rescue team from Halifax, the region’s largest city, as well as thermal imaging cameras attached to drones. Police say their work has been “strategic and thorough” as they weigh any clues that might suggest a likely whereabouts for the children.The search is also the first major undertaking by the Nova Scotia Guard, a newly formed a volunteer emergency organization meant to address shortfalls in the province’s response to crisis. In 2023,a flash flood killed four people, including three children – a tragedy that some residents believe could have been avoided by timely warnings sent by authorities.Nova Scotia’s premier,Tim Houston, a resident of Pictou county, has visited the search headquarters alongside other local officials, to offer support for residents and searchers.“People in Pictou County and across Nova Scotia are praying for a positive outcome for two missing children,” he said in a statement. “During this time of worry, please know that our first responders and volunteers are working tirelessly during this 24/7 operation.”Foiled at times by inclement weather, more than a dozen search teams are in the field.“Everybody in the community is concerned and worried, but we’re all hoping for the best here,” said Donald Parker, a municipal councillor with the municipality of Pictou county told CBC News. “It’s hard on the whole community … It’s incredibly tough.”On social media, the Sipekne’katik chief, Michelle Glasgow, questioned the decision not to issue an Amber alert, used when a child is presumed abducted, and said the disappearance underscored the need for a national alerting system.“Please help bring Jack and Lily home,” she wrote.Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

It attracted an estimated 2.1 million fans to Copacabana beach and had crowds screaming and dancing along.‘Like a religious thing’: free Lady Gaga concert draws 2.1m to RioRead more“They were clearly saying that they were planning an attack at Lady Gaga’s concert motivated by sexual orientation,” Felipe Cury, secretary of the Rio police, told a press conference on Sunday.The Rio police chief, Luiz Lima, said the group disseminated hate speech and violent content online “aimed at gaining notoriety in order to attract more viewers, more participants – most of them teenagers, many of them children”.Even as Brazilian authorities said they arrested suspects in the hours before Lady Gaga’s show, the event went ahead without disruption – leading some to question the seriousness of the threat. Serious security concerns typically lead organisers to cancel such massive events – as happened with Taylor Swift’s concerts in Vienna last year.Police said nothing about the alleged plot at the time in an effort to “avoid panic” and “the distortion of information”.A spokesperson for Lady Gaga said the pop star and her team “learned about this alleged threat via media reports this morning. Prior to and during the show, there were no known safety concerns, nor any communication from the police or authorities to Lady Gaga regarding any potential risks.”The statement added: “Her team worked closely with law enforcement throughout the planning and execution of the concert and all parties were confident in the safety measures in place.”Security was tight at Saturday’s concert, with 5,200 military and police officers deployed to the beach where fans were revelling in the pop singer’s classic hits including Born This Way, which became an LGBTQ anthem after its 2011 release.Authorities arrested two people in connection with the alleged plot – a man described as the group’s leader in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul on illegal weapons possession charges, and a teenager in Rio on child sexual abuse charges. Police did not elaborate on their exact roles in the plot or on how the group came to target Lady Gaga’s free concert.“Those involved were recruiting participants, including teenagers, to carry out integrated attacks using improvised explosives and molotov cocktails,” police said.The Justice Ministry said it determined the group posed a “risk to public order”. It said the group falsely presented themselves online as Little Monsters – Lady Gaga’s nickname for her fans – in order to lure teeangers into “networks with violent and self-destructive content”.During a series of raids on the homes of 15 suspects across several Brazilian states, authorities confiscated phones and other electronic devices. Although police said they believed homemade bombs were intended for use in the planned attack, there was no mention of the raids turning up any weapons or explosive material.Cury said one of the suspects whose home was raided in the city of Macaé, near Rio, “had a religious motivation” and “claimed [Lady Gaga] was a Satanist”.In an Instagram post, Lady Gaga has expressed gratitude for the enormous crowd.“Nothing could prepare me for the feeling I had during last night’s show – the absolute pride and joy I felt singing for the people of Brazil,” she wrote. “The sight of the crowd during my opening songs took my breath away. Your heart shines so bright, your culture is so vibrant and special, I hope you know how grateful I am to have shared this historical moment with you.”Lady Gaga at Coachella review – a thrilling all-timer of a performanceRead moreHer free beach concert stood out at a time of surging ticket prices for live music around the world as concertgoers pay budget-busting costs to see their favourite artists.Last month Lady Gagaperformed at Coachella Valley music festivalin California, where tickets fetched upwards of $600 for one weekend.The high prices of tickets for her upcoming shows in Australia have also attracted criticismlocally.Last May, superstar Madonna also performed on Copacabana beach, playing the final show of her latest world tower for some 1.6 million fans on the sprawling sands.Explore more on these topicsLady GagaRio de JaneiroBrazilAmericasPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

The police said the men were suspected of helping Kwok to change the details of a life insurance policy and withdraw its remaining value. Kwok’s father was charged and detained while her brother was released on bail pending further investigations.Yalkun Uluyol, China researcher at Human Rights Watch, said: “The Chinese government has increased its appalling use of collective punishment against family members of peaceful activists fromHong Kong. The Hong Kong authorities should immediately and unconditionally release Anna Kwok’s father and cease harassing families of Hong Kong activists.”ChinaAid, a US-based human rights group, said: “This represents a deeply unsettling and significant escalation of the ongoing retaliatory actions against the families of exiled activists … this is a blatant attempt to silence overseas dissidents by targeting their family members at home, a tactic that brazenly disregards fundamental human rights and the rule of law.”Police in Hong Kong have repeatedlyquestioned the relativesof exiled activists. In recent months relatives of Tony Chung, Frances Hui and Carmen Lau, overseas pro-democracy activists who are alsowanted by the Hong Kong police, have been questioned. Chung and Lau, who are in the UK, have both had threatening letters sent to their neighbours offering rewards for information leading to their capture.The arrests in Kwok’s case mark the first time that relatives have been criminally charged. Kwok’s father faces a sentence of up to seven years in prison if convicted. He has been denied bail with the case adjourned to 13 June, according to Reuters.The Hong Kong police and the Hong Kong Democracy Council did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Kwok could not be reached for comment.Explore more on these topicsHong KongAsia PacificChinanewsShareReuse this content"

It called for greater community outreach and to rebuild trust before the 2025 poll.Those efforts,including increased engagment on Chinese social media, appear to have failed. Labor recorded swings towards it in the Melbourne seats of Menzies, Aston and Chisholm, and the Sydney seats of Bennelong and Reid. In all these marginal seats, between 13% and 30% of constituents have Chinese ancestry.Election count continues: Labor poised to grow Senate numbers allowing it to pass legislation with only Greens supportRead morePolling booths in Chatswood and Eastwood – two suburbs in Bennelong where more than 40% of people have Chinese ancestry – recorded swings to Labor of between 15% and 26%. Labor’s Jerome Laxale boosted his wafer-thin margin of 0.1% in Bennelong to almost 10%, with 77% of the vote counted so far.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailA senior New South Wales Labor source said the party’s strategy in Bennelong, Reid and Parramatta was focused on undermining the Liberal party’s efforts to restore trust with the Chinese Australian community. One strategist, who requested anonymity to speak freely, said Dutton’s previous comments had made this relatively easy, including hisclaims that Labor was “weak” on China.“[The Liberal party] had good candidates in Reid and Bennelong,” the Labor strategist said. “Two young people of Asian heritage [Grange Chung and Scott Yung] who on paper would have been quite compelling. So we made our strategy to link their candidates to Peter Dutton as often as possible.“If you were at those polling stations on election day, all the material you would have seen from us was ‘Vote Yung, get Dutton’ with oversized images of their faces on corflutes. We were successful in that.”Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailWhen asked on Sunday what mattered most to his constituents in Bennelong, Laxale said “Peter Dutton”.In Menzies, every polling both with a double-digit swing to Labor had a significant amount of voters with Chinese ancestry. The same trend was replicated across neighbouring Chisholm. In Box Hill, where 46% of people have Chinese ancestry, Labor had so far won 71% of votes.A senior Victorian Labor source said “virtually no resources” went into Menzies and that there was no field organiser on the ground. They said the campaign capitalised on statements from Dutton that appeared hawkish on China.“When inthe final debatePeter Dutton said China was the biggest threat to national security we couldn’t believe it. It all got packaged up for RedBook and WeChat right away,” the Labor source said. “It was yet another huge own goal in a campaign full of them.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He also counted votes for a Chisholm outpost centre in the 2022 election. He said the voting intentions of Chinese Australians are not as simplistic as they are often portrayed in the media.“I suspect many Chinese Australians felt the Coalition was not inclusive enough,” Wang said. “This is very different from the mainstream discourse around ‘pro- or anti-China’: this binary is misleading and misinterprets the community’s sentiment.“When the Liberal party played up the ‘Chinese spy’ rhetoric and also their very hard rhetoric around ‘immigration’, it made many Chinese voters feel excluded from the so-called mainstream society in Australia and that their contributions to our society have not been properly recognised, let alone celebrated.”Eric Fu, a senior research fellow at the University of Melbourne who focuses on citizenship, said “many in the Chinese community felt isolated and targeted by the Liberals on several occasions during the campaign”.“Their loyalty to Australian democracy was questioned and smeared publicly on TV.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025Liberal partyAustralian politicsLabor partynewsShareReuse this content"

That’s outer suburban and regional electorates only.”Prof Nicholas Biddle, head of the School of Politics and International Relations at the Australian National University, said the “signs were already there”.“My read of it is that the scale of those shifts were greater than we thought, but the directions were all starting to emerge even late last year and early this year.”Biddle said his research found age, cultural background and gender were all key factors, but also added that education and housing tenure had an impact.“Where there has been shifts, it would appear that it’s in areas with relatively high levels of education, and that’s been emerging over a little while, and really it appears the scale has accelerated.”As Coalition support dropped, Biddle said that not all of that, as some had predicted, went out to the minor parties and independents.Labor was able to increase its primary vote across the country, Biddle said.Earlier this year, the shift of support for the Coalition didn’t equate to an increase in votes for Labor – but that changed when Australians cast their votes.“What appears to have occurred is those shifts have gone not just in second and third preferences but even first preferences to Labor,” Biddle said.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email“It’s not just a Coalition loss – it’s easy to look at Dutton losing his seat, and the emergence or salience of Donald Trump – but it appears that it is an improvement in support for the Labor party.”Results in Tasmania showed more regional areas left the Coalition for Labor.In Queenstown, in the seat of Braddon, Labor recorded a primary vote of 44% and a swing of more than 20%. Almost a fifth of workers in the area are trades workers and technicians, the kind of voters the Coalition was trying to hold on to.swing chartSamaras said voters who spoke a language other than English at home also backed the Labor party over the Coalition.“That’s such a big one, so the two-party-preferred for Labor amongst Australians who speak another language at home is 60% across all our research,” he said.“And of course that is a drastic problem for a party that was trying to win seats in two swing states of NSW and Victoria.”Samaras said it was particularly the Indian and Chinese diaspora who supported Labor.“This is why they lost Deakin and Menzies [in Victoria].”Explore more on these topicsAustralian politicsAustralian election 2025Peter DuttonAnthony AlbaneseanalysisShareReuse this content"

On 28 May 2022,Liverpoolsupporters said they feared for their lives as they were forced to enter Stade de France via a narrow subway and boxed-in lanes that could not accommodate the thousands of people that had arrived.This led to severe overcrowding which a French senate report later said posed “a risk of crushing”. Security and ticket checks were abandoned. This led to people without tickets, including some local young men who attacked Liverpool fans, to gain entry into the stadium.Shortly before kick-off, the turnstiles were closed, leaving many fans with tickets unable to get inside the stadium. As more people arrived, police used pepper spray and teargas on the crowd.After the match, Liverpool supporters complained of being robbed by local gangs and said police had offered no protection. The French government, police and Uefa placedthe blame on Liverpool supporters, claiming that the chaos was caused by thousands seeking entry with fake tickets.Darmanin apologised to Liverpool fans for the first time on Monday.Speakingto the LEGEND YouTube channel, he said: “It was a failure because I had not foreseen. That was a mistake on my part. I was led astray by my preconceptions.“The scapegoat was easy to find, and I apologise now to Liverpool supporters. They were quite right to be hurt. It was a mistake and a failure.”After the match, Darmanin made a statement saying the chaos had been caused by “30,000-40,000 Liverpool fans” with forged or no tickets and alleged there had been an “industrial scale” ticket fraud.Ian Byrne, the MP for Liverpool West Derby, told the Guardian: “Darmanin’s conduct afterPariswas unforgivable and I questioned his fitness in being a minister responsible for justice at the time.“He repeated all the lies about hooliganism, fake tickets to frame the blame on the Liverpool supporters who were once again victims of a state cover-up. It was only because of the collective fightback of Liverpool supporters and fine journalism that prevented the narrative Darmanin was spinning gaining traction.“The partial apology will be noted by Liverpool supporters but Darmanin’s actions will not be forgiven or forgotten.”A month after the game, Darmanin, apologised to “everyone who suffered from bad management” but stopped short of saying sorry to the Liverpool fans.“Should the Stade deFrancehave been better managed? The answer is yes,” he told the French radio station RTL at the time. “Am I partly responsible? The answer is yes. Of course, I readily apologise towards everyone who suffered from this bad management of the event.”AGuardian investigation in the aftermath of the gamedetailed the near disaster Liverpool fans faced, including reporting that children were among those pepper sprayed unprovoked by police.In March, a judge ruled that Liverpool fans affected by the game had the right to have their personal injury claims heard in the UK after an attempt by European football’s governing body to block it.Explore more on these topicsChampions League final 2022Football politicsLiverpoolUefaReal MadridParisFrancenewsShareReuse this content"

The two will face each other in a runoff that raises the prospect of another disruptive nationalist joining the EU leaders’ club.The coalition candidate, Crin Antonescu, finished third in a bitter blow to the government, formed after December elections by the leftist PSD, the centrist Liberals and ethnic Hungarian UDMR to keep the EU andNatomember on a pro-western track.Simion’s Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR) and two other sovereignist parties won more than a third of parliamentary seats, and forming a new majority without the far-right bloc will be hard – even more so if Simion is elected president.A Simion victory – and a likely change of government – could lead to Romania, which shares a border withUkraine, veering away from the mainstream and becoming another disruptive force within the EU alongside Hungary and Slovakia.It would also be welcomed by conservative nationalists in Europe and beyond – including senior Trump administration figures such as the US vice-president, JD Vance – who accused Bucharest of denying democracy after the original ballot was cancelled.“The problem now isn’t that Romania is in a hard place, but that the EU is, should George Simion win,” said the political scientist Cristian Pîrvulescu. “The anti-European group within the EU will become more substantial.”View image in fullscreenGeorge Simion, 38, pushes a sovereignist, socially conservative agenda and has called for the ‘Melonisation’ of Europe.Photograph: Action Press/Rex/ShutterstockThe French far-right leader Marine Le Pen said Romania’s voters had sent “a very nice boomerang” to the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, echoing claims Brussels was behind the cancellation of the original vote last year.Simion said after the result that his win was “not just an electoral victory, it is a victory of Romanian dignity. It is the victory of those who have not lost hope, of those who still believe in Romania, a free, respected, sovereign country.”The far-right candidate added: “I am here to serve Romanians, not the other way around. He said he believed in an EU “that thrives as a nest for its diverse and sovereign nations – not as a rigid system enforcing one-size-fits-all policies”.Simion, whose AUR has grown from an anti-vax movement into the country’s second-largest party, finished first in 36 of 47 electoral districts and secured 61% of the large overseas vote.Dan, a 55-year-old mathematician who founded the Save Romania Union party (USR) and campaigned as a pro-EU, anti-corruption independent, called the runoff a battle “to convince Romanians that Romania needs its pro-western direction”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Because look, these are shared challenges.”Daniel Moylan, the Conservative transport spokesperson, said on Monday that the prime minister had cast his reset of relations with the EU as a “magic bullet” to deliver on Labour’s manifesto pledge to “smash the gangs” when it came to illegal Channel crossings.“It’s not working. He needs to start taking action in the UK and stop creeping to Brussels,” Lord Moylan added.A UK government spokesperson said: “We are not providing a running commentary on our discussions with the EU. These are ongoing and cover a wide range of issues.“Together we want to build a safer, more secure and more prosperous UK and we have been clear that we will always act in the national interest to secure the best outcomes for the UK.”The European Commission has been approached for comment.In the absence of a deal on giving access to Eurodac and Schengen data, one area of potential progress revolves around work and travel freedoms. The EU is prepared to make major concessions in negotiations to allow British and European 18- to 30-year-olds to travel and work freely,the Guardian reported last month.However, there have been suggestions that figures in the British government have made access to EU databases a “red line” in negotiations over such a youth mobility scheme.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He urged anyone with information to contact the police.In a radio interview on Monday morning, Puente said the network appeared to have been deliberately targeted. “This is a low-value theft,” he told Cadena Ser. “Whoever did it knew what they were doing because there were no cameras and the financial gain is absolutely negligible compared with the enormous damage.”The minister said he viewed the incident as “damage” rather than theft, adding that it involved 150 metres of cable.Why did Spain and Portugal go dark? – podcastRead moreÁlvaro Fernández Heredia, the president of Renfe, said he also felt the theft was suspicious.“It’s strange and I’m sure the transport ministry and the police will be looking into this because it isn’t something we’ve seen up until now,” he toldRadio Nacional de España.Asked if he shared Puente’s contention that it was a case of sabotage: “I do … The theft of signalling cable on which the safety infrastructure depends is sabotage, even if it’s just simple theft because it’s an attack on the infrastructure itself.”The interior ministry said the Guardia Civil had opened an investigation, adding that both that force and the Policía Nacional had long been in contact with Adif as part of a special plan for prevent the theft of copper from the rail network. According to interior ministry statistics, there were 4,433 thefts involving copper and conductive materials last year.By 9.30am on Monday, Renfe and Adif said the Madrid to Seville line was running again and hoped services would return to normal over the course of the day.By early Monday morning, Alberto Valero and his family, visiting Spain from Mexico, had spent hours at Madrid’s Atocha station, waiting for a train to Seville.“We’re here with tourists from everywhere; France, Portugal,” Valero told the Associated Press. “Everyone is at a loss for what to do because of the total disarray.”The severe delays came a week afterSpain and neighbouring Portugal suffered an unprecedented and as yet unexplained power blackout, prompting the opposition conservative People’s party (PP) to accuse the socialist-led government of incompetence.“We’ve had two events in the past week that are more commonly seen in countries we wouldn’t want to resemble; countries where the government has forgotten about its citizens,” said PP sources.The PP’s leader, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, said thousands of people had been stranded on trains overnight without water.“This is the second Monday when we’ve had scenes that do not befit the fourth-largest eurozone economy,” he said. “People don’t deserve to be paying more taxes for worse services. Spain needs to function again and that’s my aim.”Inan interview with El País on Sunday, Spain’s environment minister, Sara Aagesen, warned it could take days to discover the reasons for last week’s power outage. She alsoechoed her view that it was far too soon for opposition parties and others to be pointing the finger at the country’s renewable energy sourcesas a possible cause.“Blaming renewable as a [reason for the blackout] seems irresponsible and simplistic to me,” said Aagesen. “Irresponsible because we’re talking about a resource that has been part of our energetic mix for a long time. And, besides, we’ve had very similar power generation on many previous days, with lots of renewables and even with lower demand – and the system has worked perfectly.”Explore more on these topicsSpainEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

On the programme isthe Beatles’ In My Life, seen as a nod to his earlier political life when he was mayor of the northern port city of Hamburg between 2011 and 2018, where the Liverpool musicians cut their teeth in its clubs and bars in the 1960s.Some commentators have suggested the song, the lyrics of which include the line “of all these friends and lovers, there is no one compares with you”, is also a tribute to his wife, the fellow politician Britta Ernst, to whom he has often expressed his affection and gratitude.Merkel’s punk pick for leaving ceremony raises eyebrowsRead moreAn excerpt from Bach’s second Brandenburg Concertos, his only classical choice, is a likely reference to the state of Brandenburg, where he lives and which he will continue to serve as a backbencher. He was the only Social Democrat to win a direct mandate in the former communist east, where the far-right Alternative für Deutschland more or less swept the board.The song choice that has caused the most mirth is the feminist anthem Respect, made famous by Franklin, which alludes to a keyword of the election campaign that brought him to power in 2021, and which he has repeated often. Critics say he has not always lived up to the motto himself, having sometimes been gruff or appearing dismissive to journalists in particular.Commentators have said Scholz’s musical choices offer a rare glimpse into the emotional side of the chancellor, who was often referred to as a “Scholzomat” due to hisrobotic-like responses, and whose old black leather briefcase became something of a TikTok star while he stayed in the background.Referring to him as a “file carrier” in a farewell column, Franz Josef Wagner, a veteran columnist for the tabloid Bild, said Scholz’s inability to communicate had probably contributed to the brevity of his tenure as chancellor, which lasted just over three years. “Dear departing chancellor, if you had told us everything that went on in your heart, you would maybe still be chancellor today. But your mouth was sealed. You had a silent heart,” he wrote.Scholz’s immediate predecessor Angela Merkel chose Nina Hagen’s 1974 hit You Forgot the Colour Film, a mix of nostalgia for holidays on the Baltic coast and a critique of grey life in communist Germany; the chanson Red Roses Should Rain for Me, a 1968 hit by the German actor Hildegard Knef; and Great God, We Praise You, a 17th-century ecumenical hymn.Among the choices of her predecessor, the Social Democrat Gerhard Schröder, was Frank Sinatra’s My Way.Explore more on these topicsGermanyOlaf ScholzFriedrich MerzEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

In no other area in our lives are we told that we have to wear something that resembles a skirt.”After years of complaints about rule 6(b) of the sport’s code, which says players must wear a “skirt/skort/divided skirt”, Dublin and Kilkenny players turned up at their provincial Leinster semi-final in shorts. After the referee threatened to abandon the game, they changed into skorts. But the protest has ignited wider calls for theCamogie Association of Irelandto drop the rule.Simon Harris, Ireland’s tánaiste, said on X: “Rules forcing camogie players to wear skorts while playing are archaic. Players have made their views clearly known.”Alan Kelly, the chair of the Irish parliament’s sports committee, said he would like to invite the Camogie Association to address the issue before the committee. He said: “It’s bananas that in today’s day and age there are rules forcing our camogie players to wear skorts rather than their preferred choice of clothing when playing matches.“We can’t continue to ignore this. No sportsperson should have to tog out in gear that’s unsuitable and uncomfortable.”The hybrid garment comprises an overlapping fabric panel over tight, compressor-type shorts, giving the impression of a skirt. In a recentGaelic Players Association(GPA) survey, 70% of respondents cited “discomfort” while wearing skorts and 83% wished to have a choice between shorts and skorts.Aisling Maher, a co-chair of the GPA, said she loved the game but skorts were unfit for purpose. “In no other facet of my life does someone dictate that I have to wear something resembling a skirt because I am a girl. Why is it happening in my sport?” she said.Camogie players at London’s Gaelic Games Association club Thomas McCurtains launched a Shorts Not Skorts campaign in 2023. But a majority of delegates at the Camogie Association of Ireland’s annual congress last year rejected two motions to amend the rule.In a statement on Sunday, the association said a democratic vote had retained the rule and a working group was examining playing wear. It said: “A wide range of national and international manufactured skorts have been sourced. Testing of these skorts for comfort, fit and design will begin in mid-May and will include adult and juvenile players from club and county teams, as well as referees.”Explore more on these topicsIrelandEuropeWomennewsShareReuse this content"

Other strikes hit a cement factory in the Bajil district in Hodeida province, the rebels said. Israeli media reported that dozens of Israeli aircraft took part in the operation.On Sunday, the Houthislaunched a missile from Yemen that struck an access road near Israel’s main airport, briefly halting flights and commuter traffic. Four people were lightly injured. It was the first time a missile had struck the grounds of Israel’s airport since the start of the war.TheHouthisclaimed that the strikes were a joint Israeli-American operation. However, a US defence official said Washington did not participate in the strikes, which were not part of Operation Rough Rider, the US military operation against the Houthis in Yemen to prevent them from targeting ships in the Red Sea. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity.However, the US military separately launched multiple strikes on the Yemeni capital, Sana’a, on Monday, according to another US official.Nasruddin Amer, head of the Houthi media office, said the Israeli strikes would not deter the rebels, vowing that they will respond to the attack.“The aggressive Zionist-American raids on civilian facilities will not affect our military operations against the Zionist enemy entity,” he said in a social media post.He said the Houthis will escalate their attacks and won’t stop targeting shipping routes and Israel until it stopsthe war in Gaza.The Houthis have targeted Israel throughout the war in solidarity with Palestinians, raising their profile at home and internationally as the last member of Iran’s self-described “Axis of Resistance” capable of launching regular attacks on Israel. The US military under President Donald Trump has launched an intensified campaign of daily airstrikes targeting the Houthis since 15 March.Houthi rebels have fired at Israel since the war with Gaza began on 7 October 2023. The missiles have mostly been intercepted, although some have penetrated Israel’s missile defence systems, causing damage. Israel has struck back against the rebels in Yemen.Netanyahu says new offensive in Gaza focused on consolidating seizure of territoryRead moreThe Israeli military said it targeted the Hodeida port on Monday because Houthi rebels were using it to receive weapons and military equipment from Iran.The attack on Ben-Gurion international airport on Sunday came hours before Israeli cabinet ministers voted to expand the war in Gaza, including toseize the Gaza Strip and to stay in the Palestinian territory for an unspecified amount of time. While air traffic resumed after an hour, the attack could lead to cancellations of many airlines, which had recently resumed flights to Israel.Explore more on these topicsYemenIsraelHouthisMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

And continued airstrikes, elimination of terrorists, and dismantling of infrastructure.”Announcement of Israel’s Gaza occupation plan is carefully timedRead moreThe plan, which was unanimously approved at a security cabinet meeting late on Sunday, goes beyond any aims so far outlined by Israel for its offensive in the devastated Palestinian territory and is likely to prompt deep international concern and fierce opposition.“This will inevitably lead to countless more civilians killed and the further destruction of Gaza,” said a spokesperson for António Guterres, the United Nations secretary general. “Gaza is, and must remain, an integral part of a future Palestinian state.”A spokesperson for the British Foreign Office said: “The UK does not support an expansion of Israel’s military operations in Gaza. Continued fighting is in nobody’s interests.”After a fragile ceasefire collapsed in mid-March, Israel renewed its bombardment, with troops reinforcing kilometre-deep “buffer zones” along the perimeter of the territory andexpanding their holdover much of the north and south of the strip.In all, more than 70% of Gaza is under Israeli control or covered by orders issued by Israel telling Palestinian civilians to evacuate specific neighbourhoods.On Sunday, the army chief, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, said the military was calling up tens of thousands of reservists to allow for conscripted regular troops to be deployed to Gaza for the new offensive.Zamir has resisted calls by some Israeli ministers for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to take on the job of distributing aid in Gaza, which has been under a tight blockade by Israel for more than two months. Much of the 2.3 million population can no longer find enough to eat and the humanitarian system is close to collapse,aid officialsin the territory have said.View image in fullscreenShuruq Ayyad consoles her 12-year-old daughter Rahaf, who is suffering from malnutrition, at a shelter in central Gaza City on Sunday.Photograph: Omar Al-Qattaa/AFP/Getty ImagesIsraeli officials told local media that ministers believed there was “currently enough food” in the territory, but that they approved “the possibility of a humanitarian distribution, if necessary, to prevent Hamas from taking control of the supplies and to destroy its governance capabilities”.Israel says the blockade and intensified bombardments since mid-March are to put pressure on Hamas to release hostages held in Gaza. Militants in the territory still hold 58 hostages seized in Hamas’s October 2023 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,200 people, mostly civilians.Israel’s retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 52,535 people in Gaza, the majority of them civilians, according to the health ministry there.The officials also said Netanyahu “continues to promote” a proposal made in January by Donald Trump to displace the millions of Palestinians living in Gaza to neighbouring countries such as Jordan or Egypt, to allow its reconstruction.A “voluntary transfer programme for Gaza residents … will be part of the operation’s goals”, the senior security official said.Israel’s military on Monday carried outa fresh round of airstrikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen’s Red Sea city of Hodeida, a day after the Iranian-backed rebels launched a missile that hit Israel’s main airport.The rebels’ media office said at least six strikes hit the crucial Hodeida port Monday afternoon. Other strikes hit a cement factory in the Bajil district in Hodeida province, the rebels said. Israeli media reported that dozens of Israeli air force took part in the operation.Trump’s scheduled visit later this month to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and UAE may provide an additional incentive to the Israeli government to conclude a new ceasefire deal and allow aid into Gaza. Trump, who recently said he wanted Netanyahu to be “good to Gaza”, is likely to come under pressure from his hosts to push Israel to make concessions to end the conflict.Israeli military officials say seizing territory provides Israel with additional leverage in its negotiations with Hamas, and some observers suggest that the public announcement of the new offensive and plans for a longer-term presence in Gaza are merely aimed at putting pressure on the militant Islamist group.Humanitarian organisations have unanimouslyrejected Israel’s planto establish a limited number of aid distribution hubs run by private contractors and guarded by the IDF in southern Gaza.The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) on Sunday accused Israel of trying to shut down the existing aid distribution system run by the UN and its humanitarian partners in order to impose its own supply system.“[This] contravenes fundamental humanitarian principles … It is dangerous, driving civilians into militarised zones to collect rations, threatening lives … while further entrenching forced displacement,” OCHA said.Hamas on Monday described the new Israeli framework for aid delivery in Gaza as “political blackmail” and blamed Israel for the war-ravaged territory’s “humanitarian catastrophe”.1:17Israeli attacks on southern Gaza kill at least 40 people – videoIn Israel, hundreds of protesters took to the streets in Jerusalem while a coalition representing the majority of families of hostages held by Hamas, about half of whom are thought to be dead, condemned the planned new offensive as a threat the lives of hostages and Israeli soldiers.Netanyahu’s governing coalition – and so his hold on power – depends heavily on the support of hardline rightwing parties that have long demanded the reoccupation and resettlement of Gaza, which Israel formally left in 2005. A new parliamentary session opened on Monday.Israeli strikes across Gaza continued overnight and during Monday, killing at least 32 people in the territory, according to hospital staff. Strikes hit Gaza City, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya and among the dead were eight women and children, according to staff at al-Shifa hospital, where the bodies were brought.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Once “Operation Gideon’s Chariots” is under way, Israel will send its troops across much – if not all – ofGaza, and will seek to establish a “sustained presence” there, Israel officials said.Israeli officials are also talking openly about the displacement of Palestinians to southern Gaza, and their potential “voluntary” displacement from the territory altogether to allow the implementation of the reconstruction plan announced by the US president, Donald Trump, in January. The far-right Israeli finance minister,Bezalel Smotrich, told Israelis on Mondayto embrace the word “occupation”.All this will confirm many people’s long-held fears of Israel’s intentions in Gaza and prompt international outrage.The idea of a major new offensive in Gaza has been discussed and debated within the government and the upper ranks of the military for some months. So why has Israel’s government announced this plan so loudly? And why now?A key factor is the indirect talks being held with Hamas about a new ceasefire. The government of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, hopes that the Israel Defense Forces’ call-up of tens of thousands of reservists, the threat of the new offensive and the prospect of Israel seizing swaths of territory will force Hamas’s leaders to make concessions.If it fails to do so, then physical possession of terrain will offer useful leverage in future negotiations and allow Hamas to be squeezed further in the meantime. Israel’s twin war aims – to crush Hamas and free the 59 hostages it still holds – remain unchanged, though Netanyahu has signaled the former is the priority.Trump is due to visit the Middle East in 10 days, and Israeli officials said the offensive would start after the leader of their country’s most important ally had enjoyed the hospitality of Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar. Images of destruction and death from Gaza would make the president’s stay that much more diplomatically delicate. In reality, the complex logistics necessary to move and mobilise additional troops in Israel is likely to mean an even longer delay.Israel has also now gone public with its plan to allow some aid into Gaza, which has been brought to “the brink of catastrophe”, aid officials say, by two months of Israel’s tight blockade of food, fuel, medicine and everything else.The scheme involves creating big distribution sites run by private contractors in the south of Gaza, to which vetted representatives of each Palestinian family would travel to pick up food parcels. Israeli troops would guard the bases, likely to be situated in a vast zone up to 5km wide now being cleared along the border with Egypt.The scheme has been dismissed as unworkable, dangerous and potentially illegal under international law by leading humanitarian organisations. There has been no mention either of who might provide healthcare, sanitation, water, fuel and everything else necessary for life in the territory.Policy papers outlining and advocating the imposition of a military administration on Gaza have been circulating among senior officials in Israel for more than a year. Netanyahu continues to dismiss out of hand the possibility of the Palestinian Authority, which exercises partial authority in the occupied West Bank, governing the territory. Nor has he outlined any other kind of future political settlement in Gaza. The likely result, should the new offensive go ahead, would be that Israeli troops end up the de facto rulers of much of Gaza and its 2.3 million inhabitants.The Israeli prime minister also offers little to the majority of Israelis who call for a ceasefire deal to secure the release of the hostages. His coalition still depends heavily on the support of far-right parties who are very happy with the prospect of the new offensive and the prospect of a “sustained” Israeli presence in Gaza. Netanyahu now appears likely to remain in power for the 15 months or so until the next elections.More than 1,200 people died, mostly civilians, in the Hamas surprise raid into Israel in 2023 that triggered the war, and about 250 were taken prisoner, of whom 58 remain in Gaza. More than 52,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have died in the Israeli offensive there which followed.On Monday – among all the outrage and enthusiasm generated by Operation Gideon’s Chariots – the announcement that Israel’s security cabinet had decided not to establish “at this time”a state commission of inquiryinto the failures that allowed that attack to take place went almost unnoticed.Any inquiry should wait until the war has ended, Netanyahu told Israelis.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

Now, in keeping with one of the late pontiff’s last wishes, the popemobile is being given a second life – as a mobile health clinic for children in the Gaza Strip.In a region ravaged by more than18 months of war,the initiative is both symbolic and practical, said Peter Brune, the secretary general of the Catholic charity Caritas Sweden.“We call it a vehicle of hope because it conveys a message to the children ofGazathat peace is possible, there will be peace, you will have a future and the world has not forgotten about you. And then there’s the very practical dimension in that it will actually deliver medical aid to affected children.”Brune and his counterpart at Caritas Jerusalem, Anton Asfar, came up with the idea late last year. They soon arranged to have the question put to Pope Francis. “We got a letter from the pope saying, ‘Yes I’m glad to say that I fully endorse this idea’,” said Brune.Work swiftly began on fitting out the vehicle, which had been left sitting in Bethlehem since the 2014 visit, with supplies such as rapid tests for infections, suture kits and oxygen as well as a refrigerator for medication.It will be used to diagnose and treat children who have no access to healthcare, bolstering the aid provided by Caritas Jerusalem, which has about 100 staff on the ground in Gaza. “This is a concrete, life-saving intervention at a time when the health system in Gaza has almost completely collapsed,” said Brune.View image in fullscreenPope Francis in the popemobile in the West Bank city of Bethlehem in May 2014.Photograph: ReutersThe announcement, made days beforethe start of the conclaveto elect a new pope, echoes Francis’s deep commitment to those caught in the crossfire of the conflict.He had long called for an end to the hostilities and voiced his disapproval at how the war was being carried out. “Yesterday children were bombed. This is cruelty, this is not war,”he said in Decemberafter an Israeli airstrike killed seven children from one family. He added: “I want to say it because it touches my heart.”For much of the past year and a half, Francis had madenightly callsto Gaza’s only Catholic church, offering his unwavering support to the congregation as they grappled with the pain and devastation of war. “It was close to his heart,” said Brune. “Since the war broke out, 3% of the Christians in Gaza have been killed.”The transformed popemobile is expected to be ready in a week or so, said Brune, and talks have been launched in the hope of obtaining permission from Israeli officials to bring it into Gaza.Brune described the situation on the ground as urgent. “Since 2 March, no aid has been let into Gaza at all. It’s horrible. A few months ago, when it was cold, children were freezing to death. Now they’re starving to death.”While aid groups have warned that Israel’s blockade offood and medicineinto Gaza has left civilians in the territoryfacing starvation, Israel has said that the blockade, along with its renewed military campaign, is aimed at pressuring Hamas to release the remaining hostages.Unicefsaid last monththat the conflict had killed more than 15,000 children, injured tens of thousands of others and left nearly 1 million children repeatedly displaced in the Gaza Strip, adding to warnings that the humanitarian situation had reachedits worst pointsince the hostilities broke out in 2023.The war in Gaza was triggered by a surprise attack launched by Hamas into Israel on 7 October, in which militants killed more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 250 hostages. Israeli officials say 59 hostages remain in Gaza, more than half of whom are believed to be dead.Brune called for aid to be let in. “It’s forbidden to use civilians and, even worse, children as some kind of instrument in an ongoing war between adults,” he said. “It’s against all humanitarian principles and laws.”He hoped the popemobile’s transformation would set a precedent of sorts, paving the way for other papal vehicles to be repurposed. “Maybe Gaza now, but then Ukraine in the future or Congo or other places,” he said. “Everywhere where humanitarian access is denied, we want to apply the principle of saying that the popemobile will stand for the importance of letting humanitarian aid come through.”Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisGazaPalestinian territoriesThe papacyIsrael-Gaza warAidHumanitarian responsenewsShareReuse this content"

Sotheby’s, by holding the auction, was “participating in continued colonial exploitation”, it added.The ministry insisted on the immediate cessation of the auction, saying the gem relics “constitute inalienable religious and cultural heritage of India and the global Buddhist community”.It also called on Sotheby’s and Chris Peppé to issue a public apology to the Indian government and Buddhists worldwide, and for the full disclosure of all provenance documents and any other relics in the possession of William Peppé’s heirs or transferred by them to any other entity or individual.Failure to comply would result in legal proceedings in Indian andHong Kongcourts and through international bodies “for violations of cultural heritage laws”, the letter warned.The ministry added that it would launch a public campaign highlighting Sotheby’s role “in perpetuating colonial injustice and becoming a party to [the] unethical sale of religious relics”.View image in fullscreenThe Piprahwa gems.Photograph: Sotheby’sThe gems include amethysts, coral, garnets, pearls, rock crystals, shells and gold, either worked into pendants, beads and other ornaments, or in their natural form.They were originally buried in a dome-shaped funerary monument, called a stupa, in Piprahwa, in present-day Uttar Pradesh, India, on about 240-200BC, when they were mixed with some of the cremated remains of the Buddha, who died about 480BC.The British crown claimed Peppé’s find under the 1878 Indian Treasure Trove Act, and the bones and ash were given to the Buddhist monarch King Chulalongkorn of Siam.Most of the 1,800 gems went to what is now the Indian Museum in Kolkata. Peppé was permitted to retain approximately a fifth of them, which were described as “duplicates” of some of the others.On the matter of the gems’ provenance and ownership, the ministry’s letter noted that under the Buddhist religion, materials in sacred funerary mounds are “sacred grave goods … inseparable from the sacred relics and cannot be commodified.“We beg to note that the relics of the Buddha cannot be treated as ‘specimens’ but as the sacred body and originally interred offerings to the sacred body of the Buddha.”The ministry added that the sellers, who describe themselves as custodians of the gems “had no right to alienate or misappropriate the asset … an extraordinary heritage of humanity where custodianship would include not just safe upkeep but also an unflinching sentiment of veneration towards these relics”.Its letter said the proposed auction “offends the sentiments of over 500 million Buddhists worldwide”, violated ethics and disrupted sacred tradition.Peppé, who wrote a piece for Sotheby’sabout his family’s custodianship of the gems, has been contacted for comment.He previously told the Guardian that the “Piprahwa gems were relic offerings made at the time of the reinterment of the Buddha’s ashes over 200 years after his passing. I have not found any Buddhists who claim the gems are corporeal remains.”With regards to his and his two relatives’ right to sell the gems, he added: “Legally, the ownership is unchallenged.”Sotheby’s has been contacted for comment. It previously told the Guardian that it has conducted “requisite due diligence”, including in relation to provenance and legality.The Indian ministry of culture’s Instagram post stated that “Sotheby’s has responded to the legal notice with the assurance that full attention is being given to this matter.”Explore more on these topicsBuddhismIndiaHong KongSouth and central AsiaColonialismReligionnewsShareReuse this content"

The figure was 305,619 in 2019, according to data obtained by the Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM) under freedom of information laws.A report by the RCEM also found the risk of a 12-hour wait in an emergency department in England increased with the age of the patient. People aged 60 to 69 had a 15% chance of waiting 12 hours or more. For those aged 90 and over, the likelihood rose to 33%.“The healthcare system is failing our most vulnerable patients – more than a million last year,” said Dr Adrian Boyle, the president of the RCEM. “These people are our parents, grandparents, great-grandparents.Tens of thousands waited more than 24 hours for hospital beds in A&E last yearRead more“They aren’t receiving the level of care they need, as they endure the longest stays in our emergency departments, often suffering degrading and dehumanising corridor care. It’s an alarming threat to patient safety. We know long stays are dangerous, especially for those who are elderly, and puts people’s lives at risk.”As well as long waits, the RCEM report found many older people were missing out on vital checks in A&E. Of patients aged over 75, only 16% were screened for delirium – a reversible condition linked to an increased risk of death. Fewer than half (48%) of patients were screened for their risk of falls.Dr Nick Murch, the president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said: “This situation, where over a million older patients are known to have endured prolonged periods of over 12 hours in emergency departments, frequently in unsuitable and undignified settings such as corridors, is a matter of grave concern.“It is clear that, despite the considerable dedication and hard work of multidisciplinary teams including emergency medicine, acute medicine and acute frailty services, these extended waiting times signify a profound failure within our healthcare system.“We must ensure that 12-hour waits in emergency departments again become an infrequent exception rather than the norm.”The RCEM recommends changes, including “front door frailty screening” in every A&E, which is already being introduced in Scotland.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Confidence in current household finances fell by six points to +21.The number of households missing essential payments, such as rent or mortgage, utility bills, credit card or loan payments, remained at similar levels to March, at 1.9 million households, in the month to 11 April. Which? estimates that between 5.6% and 7.7% of households missed or defaulted on a housing, bill or credit payment.The proportion of tenants missing rent payments increased to 4.7% in the past month, as many are still struggling to make ends meet due to continuing cost of living pressures.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Its survey found 79% of pharmacists were having to refuse requests for antibiotics from patients at least once a day.A quarter of pharmacists said patients frequently returned partially used antibiotics, while 37% were aware of patients regularly hoarding them for a later date. Half-used courses of antibiotics were being posted on local social media groups, the NPA said.Other issues include patients requesting antibiotics from their pharmacy before going on holiday just in case of illness, and people returning from abroad with huge quantities of antibiotics for conditions not treated by them in the UK.Olivier Picard, the chair of the NPA, said: “These are concerning findings and shows there are widespread misconceptions about the role that antibiotics can play among some patients.“Although antibiotics may be an appropriate course of treatment for some conditions, for other ailments like viral coughs and sore throats, they may not be effective. This could also mean antibiotics may not be effective for treating more serious conditions, posing a risk to patient safety.“Pharmacists are highly trained medical professionals who see nearly 2 million patients a day and provide medication advice. They can supply antimicrobials in some circumstances, but only when they are clinically needed.”Diane Ashiru-Oredope, the lead pharmacist for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) at the UKHSA, said addressing public misconceptions about taking antibiotics was an important part of tackling AMR.“Antibiotic resistance is impacting people every day in this country. Not being able to effectively prevent and treat infections is one of the biggest threats to our health,” she said.Overcoming that threatwas still possible if everyone worked together to help keep antibiotics working, she said. “For example, only taking them when prescribed and as directed by a healthcare professional, not taking antibiotics for colds and flu and not saving antibiotics for future use – unused antibiotics can be returned to pharmacies.“Taking action not only protects our own individual health, it also protects everyone in our communities and future generations.”A Department ofHealthand Social Care spokesperson said AMR represented “one of the most significant threats to public health, with potentially devastating consequences if we don’t act now”.“Our pharmacists, along with other healthcare professionals, play a crucial role and we’re grateful for their vigilance in ensuring these vital medicines are only provided when clinically appropriate,” they said.Explore more on these topicsAntibioticsDrug resistanceHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

That compares with 250 in the same period in 2022, 60 in 2023 and 44 in 2024.People were asked to avoid the Merrivale and Okehampton areas for the time being, and Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service said the fire might behave unpredictably due to the changing weather.Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service posted an update to X on Monday evening saying: “Approximately 12,500 acres of moorland were destroyed by fire.“Crews assisted by Dartmoor rangers and Commoners using firefighting equipment attempted to extinguish the fire to protect the environment.“Crews used five Argo Cat vehicles, fogging units, leaf blowers and a drone.”Dartmoor national park posted a photo of the fire to X on Monday morning, saying: “The dry weather has left Dartmoor highly vulnerable to fire. Please don’t light BBQs or fires.”Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service’s area manager, Simon Young, told the BBC: “Wildfires are always challenging because they are inaccessible for our appliances to go on to our moorland,” he said.“It makes it very difficult, but we have specialist vehicles to make sure we have capability to get on to the moor and make sure we can do the job as safely as possible.“The wind has really played its part and we are currently under amber wildfire conditions nationally for the next three to four days.“We know the conditions are very dry under foot and with the wind it has just exacerbated it.”Meanwhile,SurreyFire and Rescue Service was called to a 1.6 hectare fire in the open at about 12.45pm on Monday on Turfhill, Lightwater in Surrey Heath.Explore more on these topicsWildfiresDevonSurreynewsShareReuse this content"

All three men in that investigation remain in custody.But the main focus of government, counter-terrorism police and Britain’s security services is on what they believe was a thwarted attack plot, with arrests made amid fears that the unleashing of violence could have been staged soon.Those arrested, all male, were a 29-year-old detained in the Swindon area, a 46-year-old man who was arrested in west London, a 29-year-old man held in Cheadle Hume, in the Stockport area, and a 40-year-old was detained at gunpoint in Rochdale.All four were arrested under terrorism laws for allegedly planning terrorist acts and warrants to detain them until this Saturday have been granted by magistrates.Police said a 24-year-old man arrested in the Manchester area had been released on bail, but with conditions restricting his freedoms.The arrests followed a joint operation by counter-terrorism police and the security service MI5.Investigators do not believe the target was a synagogue as some news outlets have suggested, but will not comment whether the “specific premises” that faced the potential threat was linked to Britain’s Jewish community.The plot was more sophisticated than recent lone actor terrorism attacks seen in the UK, police believe.The result of searches of electronic devices is being examined by detectives.Murphy said: “Our officers and staff are progressing what is a significant and highly complex investigation, and we still have searches and activity under way at multiple addresses across the country.“We are working incredibly hard, with public safety at the forefront of our ongoing efforts.“We believe that a specific premises was the target of this suspected plot and counter-terrorism policing officers remain in close contact with the affected premises.“At this time, we will not be providing further information about the suspected target for reasons of operational security and public safety.“As always, I would ask the public to remain vigilant and if they see or hear anything that concerns them, then to contact us.”Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, has said the arrests in the “two major operations” over the weekend reflected some of the biggest threats “we have seen in recent years”.Ken McCallum, the head of MI5, said in October 2024 that Tehran was behind “plot after plot” in the UK and that MI5 had uncovered five new planned attacks last year, usually against dissidents, taking the total since January 2022 to 20.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Poll after poll said that top of the list for change was the cost of living, followed by public services.But just nine months from taking power, many voters seem to be already giving up on the government’s ability to bring about that change. The speed of that rejection has been extraordinary.There is a barely concealed frustration among someLabourstaffers about the intensity of the rejection. This is a government overseeing a huge boost to the minimum wage, protecting employees from tax rises, nationalising the railways and investing billions in the NHS.But the tone was set by the early cut to winter fuel allowance, and exacerbated by upcoming welfare changes that will hit disabled people.“It’s the cuts,” one MP said. “They might be going Green or going Reform but that’s what people are saying. They have had enough of it.”No 10 now faces a challenging situation with its own backbenchers, especially before the welfare vote in June. MPs will use this moment to send a message if they do not believe Downing Street is listening.Apossible U-turn– at least partially – on winter fuel allowance for some of the worst-off might go a significant way towards calming nerves, though there is no escape from looking weak.But nothing is imminent. In the short term, No 10 will tell its MPs not to panic and that last week’s results were far more of a blow for the Conservative party than for Labour. The proportion of Labour voters going to Reform – about 8% – is roughly unchanged since September.But there is a deeper question about what will happen if the party is not seen to channel that angry desire for change. The Labour MP Jake Richard, in the Reform-facing seat of Rother Valley, tweeted on Sunday: “Labour must take on Reform because it’s the party’s moral purpose, not simply for electoral reasons (which makes it a necessity).”He cited “extraordinary data from last week’s elections: 61% of the most deprived wards were previously held by Labour. Now roughly 85% are held by Reform.”Economic insecurity has become somewhat of a political cliche when progressives attempt to explain concern about immigration. But new polling in the aftermath of the election paints a stark picture of those who are taking a gamble on Reform UK.The polling by Merlin Strategy, on behalf of the campaign group Looking for Growth, found Reform UK voters feel their situation is significantly more precarious than voters as a whole and feel more pessimistic about their own future and the country.A third of the party’s voters said they could “only just make my household finances work” or that “I can’t afford my costs”, compared with 19% of Labour voters.Another poll went viral over the weekend, this time from YouGov: of all those voters who have said they will no longer vote Labour, the winter fuel allowance, cost of living and a lack of public service improvement are the top reasons. Immigration was chosen by just 18% of switchers.Some on the Labour party’s right will demand radical action on immigration. The Pendle and Clitheroe MP, Jonathan Hinder, has called for the party to consider leaving the European convention on human rights and instituting a “one-in, one-out” policy for migration. To out-Farage on immigration would leave Reform with “nothing to talk about”, the MP contends.Starmer is prepared to talk tough on migration – and on culture wars – to the understandable discomfort of progressives. There will be an immigration white paper that will propose cracking down hard on asylum policy and on international students, at a likely cost to universities.But to lean in as hard as some of the party’s Blue Labour caucus would like could risk alienating even further the other half of Labour’s fragile coalition. The issue that unites them both is the economy.Explore more on these topicsLabourKeir StarmerLocal electionsBenefitsEconomic policyanalysisShareReuse this content"

Warner Bros Discovery and Paramount dropped 1.1% and 1% respectively.In Australia and New Zealand, which serve as major production hubs for global franchises such as the Lord of the Rings series, its Tolkienesque cousin The Hobbit, and various Marvel films, lawmakers in those countries respondedthat theywould advocate for their respective film industries.Australia’s home affairs minister, Tony Burke,said thathe had spoken with the head of the government body Screen Australia about the proposed tariffs and that “nobody should be under any doubt that we will be standing up unequivocally for the rights of the Australian screen industry.”And New Zealand’s prime minister, Christopher Luxon, said: “We’ll have to see the detail of what actually ultimately emerges. But we’ll be obviously a great advocate, great champion of that sector in that industry.”In the UK, a parliamentarianalso warnedthat such tariffs were “not in the interests of American businesses” and the UK media union Bectuurged the UK governmentto protect the country’s “vital” film sector, warning tens of thousands of freelance jobs could be at risk.The announcement on Sunday follows Trump’s earlier pledges to revitalize the US film industry. But early on Monday afternoon, the White House began walking back Trump’s announcement,according tothe Hollywood Reporter.Just before taking office,Trump appointedactors Jon Voight, Sylvester Stallone and Mel Gibson as “special ambassadors” to Hollywood tasked with bringing the industry back “bigger, better, and stronger than ever before”.TheAssociated Pressreported that it is common for major blockbusters and smaller productions to film scenes in the US as well as internationally. Big-budget projects often span multiple countries.Trump’s movie tariffs are designed to destroy the international film industryRead moreFor years, according to the AP,incentive programshave influenced where films are made, increasingly driving film production away from California to states and countries offering more favorable tax incentives, such as Canada and the UK.According to FilmLA, a non-profit that tracks production in the Los Angeles area, film and television production in LAhas dropped by nearly 40% over the past decade.Trump’s announcement on Sunday comes after hetriggered a trade war with China, and imposed global tariffs, unsettling global markets and sparking fears of a potential US recession.In April, China, which is currently the world’s second-largest film market after the US, responded to Trump’s tariffs on Chinese products byreducing the quotaof American movies allowed into the country.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTariffsUS economyEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Last week, Trump hinted at a possible reprieve for companies, saying they would be given time to move their operations to the US, But “after that it’s going to be a tariff wall put up, and they won’t be happy about it,” he added.Giovanni Barbella, the global head of strategy and supply chain at the Swiss multinational Sandoz, said tariffs would lead to supply disruptions and in the medium term price increases, hitting US patients hardest. Sandoz is one of the world’s biggest makers of generic drugs – cheaper versions of branded medicines whose patents have expired. The majority of prescription drugs sold around the world are generic.“We are producing products on a very tight margin,” Barbella said. “That’s the nature of our industry. So ultimately, higher production cost, including the cost of tariffs, will lead to higher prices.”He added: “There can be even more supply disruption, because some players can leave the [US] market and focus on markets where they can make more business. So ultimately, the risk is that the US patient will suffer the most.”There are already persistent drug shortages in the US, the UK and other countries, and tariffs would potentially exacerbate that by disrupting the long and complex global supply chains.Mark Samuels, the chief executive of Medicines UK, which represents Britain-based generic drugmakers, said: “In an insurance-based system, as the US has, if medicine costs increase and insurance runs out, then that does increase the risk that people either can’t afford to complete their cancer treatments or pay for it altogether.”A 25% US tariff on pharmaceutical imports wouldincrease drug costs in the country by almost $51bn (£38bn) a year, raising prices by up to 12.9% if passed on, according to an analysis by the accountancy firm EY that was commissioned by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the main US industry group.In an attempt to head off looming tariffs, theSwiss drugmakers Rocheand Novartis are investing $50bn and $23bn respectively in the US in coming years. Britain’s AstraZeneca announced a $3.5bn investment in November and said last week it wasshifting the production of some medicines sold in the USfrom Europe to the States. The US firm Eli Lilly, the maker of diabetes and obesity drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound, is spending at least $27bn to build four new manufacturing sites in the US.Johnson & Johnson is putting $55bn into US manufacturing and research over the next four years. The New Jersey-based company is more vulnerable to any US tariffs because of its significant manufacturing across Europe including the UK, Ireland, Switzerland, Italy and Belgium.Sandoz said that while pharmaceutical companies – which command higher prices for their products – could shift production to the US, it was much harder for generic drugmakers to do so. The drugs they make are cheap – a small pack of paracetemol costs from 37p at UK supermarkets – and the companies operate on tighter profit margins.About a quarter of generic medicines prescribed by the NHS are made in the UK, a third come from India and the rest from the EU, according to Medicines UK while China and India are the two main sources of medicine ingredients.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You can’t afford a BMW? Buy a Ford and you can still get to work. If you have a 25% hike on chemotherapy and you can’t afford your treatment any more, what’s the alternative?

That represents a 28% premium to the stock’s Friday close, according to Reuters calculations.Skechers shares jumped 25% to $61.86 on the news, regaining some ground after dropping nearly 30% this year as the company withdrew its annual results forecast in April and warned of the fallout from President Donald Trump’s 145% import tariff on Chinese goods.China accounts for a bulk of imports for the brand’s US business.Needham analyst Tom Nikic said the deal talks may have been accelerated by the volatile macro environment – driven by tariffs, weakening consumer sentiment and troubled China-US relations – and the company may have wished to navigate these challenges without being under Wall Street’s scrutiny.Skechers, Nike and Adidas America are among the companies that have urged Trump to exempt shoes from reciprocal tariffs, as US businesses face higher costs and shoppers tighten spending to brace for a potential rise in prices.Founded in 1992, California-based Skechers started out as a brand focused on men’s street style with the launch of its popular shoe Chrome Dome, but has come to be known for its comfort-first sneakers.The company has held up against stiff competition from legacy brands such as Nike and newer entrants such as Hoka, thanks in part to its aggressive global expansion and focus on value. Its shoes are priced anywhere between $75 (£56) and $150 (£113) on its website, and the company has roughly 5,000 retail stores in over 120 countries.Its marketing tie-ups with celebrities including Britney Spears and Kim Kardashian have also helped the brand boost its appeal and stay relevant.Nikic said the deal was “very surprising” as Skechers has always been viewed as a family business, with the founding Greenberg family highly involved in the operations.Sources told Reuters Skechers was not running an auction and the deal was bilateral as 3G Capital has had a long relationship with the Greenbergs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Police said the hostages were tortured and that video footage – allegedly recorded by the captors themselves – showed the miners were shot dead at point-blank range.Illegal gold mining has surged in Peru, Latin America’s biggest producer of the precious metal, just as the international price peaked once more at around $3,500 per ounce. Meanwhile acrime wave has swept the countrywith unprecedented rises in racketeering and killing-for-hire. 2024 saw a record increase murder rates – a 35.9%increase in homicidescompared with 2023.Teacher murdered in front of schoolchildren as Lima gripped by crime waveRead more“Illegal mining is the most lucrative criminal activity in the country,” said César Ipenza, an environmental lawyer. Illegal gold mining accounted for $9bn , or 60% of Peru’s total laundered assets betweenJanuary 2014 and October 2024, according to the country’s Financial Intelligence Unit, dwarfing the next biggest sources of laundered assets.Once confined to certain zones illegal gold mining has spread throughout the country since the Covid-19 pandemic. The gold-rich area where the mine is located in La Libertad region has been under a state of emergency for more than two years due to ongoing violence and unrest.This massacre brings to 39 the number of artisanal miners and workers killed by criminal gangs in Pataz, the company La PoderosaMiningconfirmed in a statement.“The spiral of uncontrolled violence in Pataz is occurring despite the declaration of a state of emergency and the presence of a large police contingent which, unfortunately, has not been able to halt the deterioration of security conditions in the area,” the statement added.In December, thousands of gold miners camped out in the downtown Lima and blocked the main highway to insist that the government maintain a registry of informal and illegal miners known as REINFO which protects them from prosecution.Explore more on these topicsPeruAmericasMiningnewsShareReuse this content"

Saying she “wasn’t there to make friends” and that she “avoided unnecessary drama,” Lloydwas well known by the end of her careerfor her steely demeanor that ran counter to some of her era’s more outgoing personalities like Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan.Lessons from the USWNT’s Brazil friendlies: Thompson’s a star and a keeper dilemmaRead more“I’m sorry I wasn’t always able to give you all of me,” Lloyd said on Sunday, addressing her former teammates. “I wouldn’t say I have regrets, but if there’s one thing I do wish, I wish I had let more people understand me over the years. I operated like an emotionless machine. I was intense and I truly believe that the only way for me to survive in such a cut-throat environment was to be that way.”Lloyd was well-known for her intense dedication to training and improving as a player, to the point to where she cut herself off not just from teammates but also her family. Lloyd told the crowd in Frisco, Texas that the years since her retirement have given her a new perspective, especially with the birth of her first child, a daughter named Harper.“I always knew I wanted a child, but I had no idea how this little baby could completely change me as a person,” Lloyd said. “Unlike during my playing career, I have been present. I have allowed myself to be vulnerable, emotional, and fully engaged in every moment I get to spend with her.”Lloyd, who appeared to get choked up at a few points during her speech, apologized to her parents and siblings for lost time and the weddings, anniversaries, birthdays and other milestones missed.Many of these absences came while Lloyd was working with James Galanis, a personal trainer she hired in 2003 to improve her game. Lloyd cut ties with Galanis in 2020, and in recent years has spoken about the coach’s wide-ranging influence over her life, including cutting her off from contact with family.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Was it worth putting my husband second? Was it worth being so obsessive, so intense every day of my soccer career? Was it worth putting off starting a family?”In the end, though, the answer seemed to be yes.“As lonely and difficult as the journey was at times, I would do it all over again,” she said. “There was nothing I loved more than winning, but winning comes at a cost, and I paid that price.”Lloyd was inducted into the Hall of Fame on the first ballot for which she was available, garnering 47 out of 48 votes. She was selected alongside former Real Salt Lake and USMNT goalkeeper Nick Rimando in the players’ category. Former USWNT goalkeeper Mary Harvey and USMNT midfielder Chris Armas were inducted on the “veteran” ballot, while former MLS president Mark Abbott was selected on the “builder” ballot.Explore more on these topicsUSA women's football teamNWSLWomen's footballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Tom Tunstall, 47, was transferred to Royal Stoke university hospital with significant back and abdominal injuries. Five other riders were treated at the track for minor injuries, while three more escaped unharmed.A statement from organisers MotorSport Vision Racing read: “At the start of this afternoon’s Quattro Group British Supersport Championship race at Oulton Park, exiting turn one, Old Hall corner on the first lap, there was a chain reaction incident involving 11 riders falling. The race was immediately stopped and trackside medical services deployed.“Due to the extreme severity of the incident and ongoing medical intervention, the remainder of the Bennetts British Superbike Championship event was cancelled. This catastrophic accident has tragically resulted in two riders being fatally injured, and another sustaining significant injuries.“The Motorcycle Circuit Racing Control Board and MotorSport Vision Racing are investigating the full circumstances of the incident in conjunction with the coroner and Cheshire constabulary.”Tunstall was treated at the track and then the circuit’s medical centre, before being transferred to Royal Stoke university hospital. Five riders were moved to the medical centre with minor injuries, Carl Harris, Max Morgan, Cameron Hall, Freddie Barnes and Morgan McLaren-Wood.Lewis Jones, Corey Tinker and George Edwards were also involved in the incident but were not injured.Explore more on these topicsMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Nor will the team’s ideals, Popovich said.“That’s the goal, to make sure we keep it going,” Popovich said, adding that he will do everything he can to help Johnson going forward.“I’m no longer coach,” Popovich said. “I’m ‘El Jefe.’”Johnson looked in Popovich’s direction as he began his remarks, and took a deep breath. “I am honored by this opportunity and even more humbled by the people that I’ll be able to partner with and serve,” he said.When Johnson thanked his wife Jessica and their four children for their love and support, Popovich – listening from a seat in the front row with Ginobili and Duncan on either side – teared up. Ginobili leaned over, whispered something and patted Popovich on the leg. Duncan immediately did the same.Some physical manifestations of the stroke were present. Duncan carried a cane, presumably just in case Popovich – who walked slowly, but without support – needed it. But his trademark wit was still there, on show when Popovich offered an answer about what Johnson had learned as his assistant.“No technical fouls,” Popovich said.Popovich’s public appearance was a bit of a surprise. Surrounded by a slew of Spurs past and present – Victor Wembanyama leading the way – Popovich walked into the practice facility shortly before the team’s managing partner, Peter J Holt, spoke to open the news conference.Holt struggled to get words out at times, the emotion of the day very clear.“I can’t be him or ‘El Jefe,’” Johnson said when asked what he’ll take from Popovich. “But to be able to commit and invest in people and relationships – that can be having to yell and hold someone accountable, and that can be to put your arm around someone’s shoulder and love them – and he did it better than anybody that’s ever walked the sidelines. And I will attempt to do it my way, whatever that looks like going forward.”Popovich – the NBA’s all-time wins leader, who coached the Spurs from 1996 until this year and won fiveNBAtitles in that span – started by cracking a few jokes. He also turned reflective, at times even a bit emotional. He suffered the stroke in November, hours before the Spurs played the Minnesota Timberwolves. Johnson took over as acting coach for the final 77 games of the season and his promotion was formally announced Friday.“I can never express the gratitude that I have for so many people caring about the organization and sending me thoughts and prayers, that sort of thing, since I had this stroke,” Popovich said.Popovich also thanked several of those involved in his rehabilitation, as well as former players and coaches. He also noted that everyone in the Spurs organization – including the in-game time-out performers, those in the ticket office, custodians, window-washers and more – plays a role in the team’s success. He also lauded the fans for their years of support, and vowed that the Spurs won’t let them down.“We all have a part in this,” Popovich said. “It’s not just the players and the coaches.”The Spurs’ core principles – doing things the right way, honoring continuity, always welcoming former players back into the fold – will remain in place, Johnson said.“The theme of the book isn’t changing,” Johnson said.Explore more on these topicsSan Antonio SpursNBABasketballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The 25-year-old came back strongly passing Verstappen, with theMcLarenclearly having an enormous pace advantage over the Red Bull, to claim second place behind his teammate, Oscar Piastri, who took a dominant win from fourth on the grid. Both McLarens ultimately finished more than 30 seconds in front of the third-placed Mercedes of George Russell, with Verstappen in fourth.Lewis Hamilton unapologetic for terse exchange with Ferrari at Miami Grand PrixRead moreMcLaren’s team principal, Andrea Stella, admitted with hindsight that Norris might have backed off and bided his time to ease past Verstappen but it was far from clear in the opening corner of the first lap that the McLaren would end up with such an advantage.“I quite like to see Lando aggressive, going for taking the lead of the race and sometimes it’s just the matter of a fraction of a second,” Stella said. “In this case Lando could have been a little bit more patient. With the benefit of hindsight it could have been better for Lando to just lift and make sure that he could keep the second position because the car was very fast and he would certainly have passed Max.”The incident with Verstappen was adjudged fair, although Norris felt he had been pushed off by the Dutchman and noted pointedly he felt that Verstappen’s elbows-out approach had been expected and ultimately detrimental.“He’s fighting hard, but it’s up to him to do that,” Norris said. “He’s ruining his own race, he’s not racing very smart. He’s fighting, that is always expected, but that’s what it is.”Piastri now has four wins from six races this season to one for Norris and he leads his teammate by 16 points and Verstappen by 32. On the form of the McLaren in Miami, the championship battle is increasingly looking like it will develop into a straight fight between the two McLaren drivers.A crucial element of the race was Piastri’s overtake of Verstappen for the lead but when Norris followed suit, it took him four laps including one pass at turn 11 where he had to give the place back because he had gone off track to complete the manoeuvre. During that period Piastri opened up an eight-second lead that Norris was unable to recover.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A typically wholehearted performance from Nuno Espírito Santo’s side capped by an ­instinctive equaliser from Murillo rescued a point that could eventually prove priceless for their hopes of reaching the promised land of the Champions League.It is to their immense credit that with three matches still to play, a team that ended last season in 17th place is still in contention to dine at Europe’s top table. Having fallen behind to Eberechi Eze’s penalty in front of a joyous ­Crystal Palace crowd still ­basking in the glory of their upcoming ­appearance in the FA Cup final, that Forest were back on terms within four minutes spoke volumes about the spirit Nuno has created at the two-time European champions since replacing Steve Cooper. Eze almost won it for Palace at the death but his shot cannoned off the crossbar to give the travelling supporters hope that their dreams could still come true.Crystal Palace v Nottingham Forest: Premier League – liveRead moreResults over the weekend had only multiplied Forest’s ­desperation to rediscover their form after four defeats in their past five, ­including theFA Cup semi-finalagainst ­Manchester City. With a local derby against Leicester and a trip to West Ham to come before they face ­Chelsea on the final day, this result means they still have a fighting chance of ­finishing in the top five. “We are pushing the players – not only physically, but mentally – for this big fight we are in,” said Nuno. “Character, confidence and controlling anxiety – all these aspects will be very important.”It was never going to be easy against a Palace team refreshed from being given four days off following theirexploits at Wembleyand still intent on recording their highest ever Premier League finish.Oliver Glasner had signalled his intentions by naming the same side that demolished Aston Villa as the New York Jets owner, Woody ­Johnson – who is reportedly interested in investing in Palace – watched from the stands with the chairman, Steve Parish. But despite another strong performance that could easily have yielded all three points, the sight of Adam Wharton trudging down the tunnel followed by a physiotherapist after receiving treatment just after Eze’s goal was concerning for Palace with their return to Wembley only 12 days away.“I hope it’s not that serious,” said Glasner. “I spoke to him and he’s a little bit sore because he twisted his ankle but hopefully it will be OK.”A reason for Forest’s dip in recent weeks has been a lack of squad depth in comparison to their European rivals. The midfielder Ibrahim ­Sangaré was handed his first Premier League start since August as one of two changes from theirdamaging defeat to Brentfordlast week, with Callum Hudson-Odoi – who went to school just down the road – spotted with fans in the away section after being ruled out with a hamstring injury.View image in fullscreenMatz Sels concedes the penalty against Crystal Palace’s Tyrick Mitchell.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/ReutersUnsurprisingly given the stirring atmosphere at kick-off it was Palace who took the early initiative as Chris Richards almost scrambled home from a corner. But Nuno’s side has been built on strong foundations and they were able to soak up the pressure and wait for an opportunity. Their patience was almost rewarded when Tyrick ­Mitchell made a mess of his header back to Dean Henderson. Luckily for Mitchell, the England goalkeeper was alert enough to stick out his left foot just in time to prevent a comical own goal.Wrapped up in a hat and gloves on a chilly evening in south London, Nuno was ready to celebrate when Morgan Gibbs-White launched a swift break downfield that, to his disappointment, ended with Anthony Elanga firing straight at Henderson. The hat had been dispensed with for the start of the second half but it was Palace who came storming out of the blocks as Wembley hero Ismaïla Sarr twice went close. Chris Wood had an even better chance moments later at the other end but his shot clipped Maxence Lacroix’s leg and went agonisingly wide.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His decision was swiftly overturned by VAR, allowing Eze – back on penalty duties after Jean-Philippe Mateta’s miss at Wembley – to slot home emphatically in front of the England head coach, Thomas Tuchel.Henderson was at full stretch to save Elanga’s free-kick from a tight angle and it was from the resulting corner that Forest drew level thanks to Murillo’s piece of quick thinking to divert a shot in from Neco Williams that was going wide.The Brazilian being forced off injured in the 81st minute was a worry for Nuno but he could breathe a huge sigh of relief when the substitute Eddie Nketiah saw his goal in injury time ruled out for offside moments after Eze had struck the woodwork.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueCrystal PalaceNottingham Forestmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

There was a warm embrace between the Liverpool star and Michael Edwards, chief executive of football at Fenway Sports Group, and another with Richard Hughes, the man who initiated contract talks with Alexander-Arnold’s brother and agent prior to starting as the club’s new sporting director last summer and has faced a losing battle on that score ever since.They all knew it was endingbut there were evidently no hard feelings. Liverpool feel they did everything they could to persuade Alexander-Arnold to stay. They offered a new deal that reflected his status as the finest full-back in the Premier League and one of the best in the world. They not only offered success, Arne Slot’s team delivered it. But they could not offer a new experience to a player whose stated aim is to win the Ballon d’Or and wants “that legacy of being the greatest right-back to have played football. I have got to reach for the stars”.Trent Alexander-Arnold confirms Liverpool exit and is set to join Real MadridRead moreStrictly business, although losing Alexander-Arnold to the entitled egomaniacs of Real Madrid will hurt, and not only in football terms.

If the Anfield celebrations on the day the championship was secured against Tottenham could not change the defender’s mind – and he had informed Slot of his decision to leave in late March – nothing would.Alexander-Arnold has been a first-team fixture atLiverpoolfor nine seasons. Awareness of him dates back longer. Steven Gerrard marked him out as having “a terrific chance of making it as a top professional” in his 2015 autobiography. He was Trent Arnold back then and had caught Gerrard’s eye playing as a holding midfielder in the under-16s team he was coaching. “He’s quite leggy but he’s got a lovely frame and seems to have all the attributes you need,” wrote the Liverpool legend. “He’s still not strong enough at the moment, but that will come.”View image in fullscreenTrent Alexander-Arnold informed Arne Slot of his decision to leave Liverpool in late March.Photograph: Liverpool FC/Getty ImagesThe full-back grew up near Liverpool’s former Melwood training ground in West Derby wanting to emulate Gerrard’s achievements in a red shirt. He has surpassed them in terms of silverware but, unlike his boyhood hero, has been able to cut ties with the city and the club in the prime of his career. Gerrard was more of a home Liverbird. It is not difficult to imagine Alexander-Arnold wanting to embrace a new challenge, a new culture, a new language and fitting in with the celebrity lifestyle at Real Madrid alongside his good friend Jude Bellingham. Alexander-Arnold’s world-class vision and assists will grace the Bernabéu but for a generation of Madrid fans accustomed to the superior defensive application of Dani Carvajal, the difference may be striking.Amid the furious accusations of betrayal it is worth considering that Alexander-Arnold has been at Liverpool for 20 years, joining the club’s academy as a promising six-year-old. He has already given a lifetime of service in terms of a football career, along with the memories and medals. A highly intelligent man with interests varying from chess to fashion to Formula One – he isan investor in the Alpine racing team– the defender will have a natural curiosity to see what else football has to offer. There is more to his departure than the lucrative contract he will receive as a free agent. However, Alexander-Arnold will know how his exit will be received by fellow Liverpool fans. It will – is – viewed as a defection, not a departure, by someone the Kop lauds as the “scouser in our team”.View image in fullscreenAlexander-Arnold celebrates winning the Champions League in 2019 having tasted defeat in the previous final.Photograph: Andrew Powell/Liverpool FC/Getty ImagesHis emergence was at the heart of Liverpool’s re-emergence under Jürgen Klopp. He was handed his full Premier League debut against Manchester United at Old Trafford, the first of many examples of Klopp placing his trust in and creating a pathway for the club’s academy prospects. His first senior goal was a superb free-kick that set Liverpool on course forvictory over Hoffenheimin a Champions League playoff in August 2017. He was also caught out in that first leg by a long diagonal ball that led to Hoffenheim’s consolation goal. The occasional lapse in concentration is something Slot has been working on with the player all season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A year later he became the youngest player to start two consecutive Champions League finals when Liverpool returned towin the trophyin Alexander-Arnold’s future home of Madrid.There were 12 Premier League assists in 2018-19, a new Premier League record for a defender of 13 assists as Liverpoolswept to the title the following season, and another dozen league assists in 2021-22. That season would produce a career-best 19 assists in total as Liverpool played an epic 63-game campaign and Alexander-Arnold continued to redefine what it meant to be a full-back. At 23 years of age, the defender had won every competition he had competed in with Liverpool – the Champions League, the Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup, Club World Cup, Uefa Super Cup and Community Shield. Another Premier League and League Cup have since been added to the collection. That doesn’t happen to a defender who cannot defend. The glittering CV also explains his desire to try something new.Salah has been the grateful recipient of countless moments of instinctive genius from Alexander-Arnold. Their connection and movement have been integral features of the Liverpool team under Klopp and Slot, and sets a ridiculously high benchmark for Conor Bradley, or whoever succeeds the right-back, to follow. Among many other standout Alexander-Arnold memories is theperformance in the evisceration of Leicesterthat came days after Liverpool’s triumphant return from the Club World Cup in Qatar. There were some reservations inside the camp as to how the travel and temperatures would affect the team on its swift return to domestic action on Boxing Day. Hitting new heights in a 4-0 win, with Alexander-Arnold involved in all four goals, was a decisive moment in Liverpool’s quest to end their 30-year wait for title No 19.Alexander-Arnold has captained his boyhood club, fulfilling a lifelong ambition, and flourished in a hybrid full-back/midfield role under Klopp, the man who appointed him Liverpool’s vice-captain in July 2023. He has given his all and done it all. There is still a Premier League trophy lift and parade to come. It will be interesting to hear how Alexander-Arnold’s part in the celebrations after Crystal Palace visit Anfield on 25 May is received, or how Anfield reacts to confirmation of his exit against Arsenal on Sunday. An awkward few weeks await but Liverpool will move on, as they always do.Explore more on these topicsTrent Alexander-ArnoldLiverpoolcommentShareReuse this content"

On 28 May 2022,Liverpoolsupporters said they feared for their lives as they were forced to enter Stade de France via a narrow subway and boxed-in lanes that could not accommodate the thousands of people that had arrived.This led to severe overcrowding which a French senate report later said posed “a risk of crushing”. Security and ticket checks were abandoned. This led to people without tickets, including some local young men who attacked Liverpool fans, to gain entry into the stadium.Shortly before kick-off, the turnstiles were closed, leaving many fans with tickets unable to get inside the stadium. As more people arrived, police used pepper spray and teargas on the crowd.After the match, Liverpool supporters complained of being robbed by local gangs and said police had offered no protection. The French government, police and Uefa placedthe blame on Liverpool supporters, claiming that the chaos was caused by thousands seeking entry with fake tickets.Darmanin apologised to Liverpool fans for the first time on Monday.Speakingto the LEGEND YouTube channel, he said: “It was a failure because I had not foreseen. That was a mistake on my part. I was led astray by my preconceptions.“The scapegoat was easy to find, and I apologise now to Liverpool supporters. They were quite right to be hurt. It was a mistake and a failure.”After the match, Darmanin made a statement saying the chaos had been caused by “30,000-40,000 Liverpool fans” with forged or no tickets and alleged there had been an “industrial scale” ticket fraud.Ian Byrne, the MP for Liverpool West Derby, told the Guardian: “Darmanin’s conduct afterPariswas unforgivable and I questioned his fitness in being a minister responsible for justice at the time.“He repeated all the lies about hooliganism, fake tickets to frame the blame on the Liverpool supporters who were once again victims of a state cover-up. It was only because of the collective fightback of Liverpool supporters and fine journalism that prevented the narrative Darmanin was spinning gaining traction.“The partial apology will be noted by Liverpool supporters but Darmanin’s actions will not be forgiven or forgotten.”A month after the game, Darmanin, apologised to “everyone who suffered from bad management” but stopped short of saying sorry to the Liverpool fans.“Should the Stade deFrancehave been better managed? The answer is yes,” he told the French radio station RTL at the time. “Am I partly responsible? The answer is yes. Of course, I readily apologise towards everyone who suffered from this bad management of the event.”AGuardian investigation in the aftermath of the gamedetailed the near disaster Liverpool fans faced, including reporting that children were among those pepper sprayed unprovoked by police.In March, a judge ruled that Liverpool fans affected by the game had the right to have their personal injury claims heard in the UK after an attempt by European football’s governing body to block it.Explore more on these topicsChampions League final 2022Football politicsLiverpoolUefaReal MadridParisFrancenewsShareReuse this content"

Raised inInferninho(Little Hell), a favela outside São Paulo, the way theReal Betiswinger tells it, he grew up without shoes to play in or a bed of his own to sleep in, surrounded by drugs and guns. Some days he wouldn’t eat and one day, when he was six or seven, he had to jump over a dead body to get to school. Life was just the way it was, even on the rough concrete courts where his bleeding feet moved faster than the rest. “I played against traffickers and all sorts,” he said. “If you ask if I was scared, of course I was. But I always had a strong personality and the harder it was, the more I wanted to be there.”So when someone threatened to kidnap him a week ago, Antony just laughed – and so did everyone else. This wasn’t São Paulo, this was Seville. And, like a lot of what is said there, it was just a joke, even if there were true words said in jest, born of fondness and admiration, a kind of desperation too, a disbelief thatheis here withthemand a determination to keep it that way. There was no anonymous letter this time, no ransom note cut from newspaper letters; instead, there was a message on Isco’s Instagram. “Antonio of Triana,” it read, “we’re going to kidnap you: this is your first warning.” A few days later, the second came. “If I have to provide the car to kidnap him, I will,” said former Betis player Joaquín. “However it happens, he has to stay.”Bayern Munich v Leverkusen has been a great rivalry. But is it over? | Andy BrassellRead moreThey have to try something, and they really are trying everything. Antony joined Betis on loan from Manchester United in January. No purchase clause, no option to buy, and in truth no money to buy him, certainly nothing near the €100m United spent two years earlier, but right now the idea of him leaving doesn’t bear thinking about, awful for everybody, Antony included. Which is why Isco threatened to bundle him into the back of a car, whyafter the derbyhe had suggested: “We’ll have to do one of those crowdfunding things.”That was a month ago and as he said so, live on TV, Antony stood silently alongside, gazing at him like a lovestruck teenager. The feeling is mutual, everyone smitten. Antony hadended that nighton the shoulders of goalkeeper Adrián, shirt off, heaving a Betis flag through the sky, the Benito Villamarín, where his shirts now outsell all others, going as wild as if they had won the World Cup. He ended this Sunday night arriving back in the city late to find the training ground engulfed in green smoke, fans celebrating the return of their team, hundreds of them hugging him, holding on, trying to never let go. This is your third warning.Back then, Antony had helped Betis to their first league win over Sevilla in seven years; now, he had scored a superb 91st-minute goal to complete a 2-1 comeback victory over Espanyol, the ball bending into the far top corner from the corner of the area, implausibly and perfectly placed. “Monumental,” his teammate William Carvalho called it, although the outrageous run and finish with which Giovani Lo Celso had equalised five minutes earlier might have been even better. As he celebrated, Antony pointed at the tattoo on his throat that saysiluminado– enlightened, illuminated, the chosen one – and at full time Adrián was there again, laughing at the ludicrousness of what he had done, waggling his hand like he had trapped his fingers in a drawer and pushing him towards the travelling fans, pointing at him. Here he is, your Goat.And, yes, they have started calling him that.It was the second time in three days that Antony had scored the winner. In midweek, he got a superb second when Betis beat Fiorentina in the first leg of the Conference League semi-final, putting them within touching distance of a first European final, and him within reach of two continental winners’ medals in a season. “I’ve trained with him a thousand times and he’s never scored with his right foot,” David de Gea said. This time it came with his left, just as Manuel Pellegrini had requested, which was why he ran to embrace his coach, laughing. It also confirmed that Betis will play European football for a fifth consecutive season, a club record, and kept them within a point of a Champions League place – which would be their first in 20 years.View image in fullscreenAntony scored the winner for Real Betis in a 2-1 comeback win against Espanyol on Sunday.Photograph: Andreu Dalmau/EPABut it wasn’t just that, it is all of it: the 77 touches, the five shots, the energy, the creativity, the constant threat. The commitment too: only one Betis player makes more recoveries. It is the fun, the talent, the sense of superiority: at times he can look just too good. The feeling that says:what’s a player like him doing here?A sense of place, belonging: what felt bizarre before feelsrightnow. “Pellegrini has given me a lot of confidence,” Antony said, and he has given it back. Above all, it is the transformation, his and theirs.“It seemed like everything was a disaster,” Pellegrini said. The point of course that it wasn’t, that people were losing the plot, and when he’s asked what he has changed Betis’s coach always gives the same answer:nothing. But even he knows that’s not entirely true. Calling it a crisis might have been a bit much but when Antony joined, Betis had picked up seven out of 27 points and had been knocked out of the cup, 5-1 by Barcelona. They had lost more games than they had won and if they were still only five points from fifth, there wereseventeams between them and that place. One of those wasSevilla, for goodness sake. Nor did they know then that fifth would provide Champions League qualification; Athletic, in fourth, were 14 points away.For Antony things weren’t much better. In fact they were a whole lot worse. Betis paid a €2m loan fee for a player who hadn’t started a Premier League game. He had made 14 appearances in total, two of his three starts coming in the League Cup, had not provided an assist and had scored just once – against Barnsley. Since then, he has played 20 games for Betis, scored seven, given four assists and won a penalty. In his 13 league games, Betis’s record reads: won nine, lost two, drawn two. If he hasn’t been Spain’s best player, it might only be because his new best friend, Isco, has: since Isco’s return in December, he has made 14 starts, scored eight, provided six and played with asmooth mastery like no one else, except perhaps Pedri.Quick GuideLa Liga resultsShowReal Sociedad 0-0 Athletic Bilbao, Espanyol 1-2 Real Betis, Sevilla 2-2 Leganés, Real Madrid 3-2 Celta Vigo, Valladolid 1-2 Barcelona, Las Palmas 2-3 Valencia, Villarreal 4-2 Osasuna, Alavés 0-0 Atlético, Rayo Vallecano 1-0 Getafe.MondayGirona v Mallorca.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.They couldn’t be happier together, two men for whom Betis was, in Isco’s words, “the light in the darkness”, their resurrection, a home they have made their own. There is a reason he called the Brazilian Antonio of Triana – the most emblematic andbéticoof the city’sbarrios.“Isco is a crack,” Antony says. “Antony’s a brilliant player and an incredible person,” Isco says. “I’m happy to be able to enjoy him; he has surprised us all because of the humility he turned up with, the desire to help and we’ve all felt a change since he came.” There are others of course – Johnny Cardoso stands out for a start, new arrival Cucho Hernández too – but together those two have transformed Betis, European semi-finalists and statistically the second-best team in Spain in 2025 behind Barcelona.‘The real Inter’ prepare for Champions League showdown with Barcelona | Nicky BandiniRead more“Antony is a special case,” Pellegrini says. “You don’t just pay €100m for a player by chance. He came here convinced that he had to mature – the last year at United might have given him some of that – and he has talent to spare. Producing two or three really important things per gameshows the player he is more than doing strange things on the ball. He is focused on finishing moves well, being practical: good deliveries, looking for shots, helping the collective. Our style has suited him. I’m happy for him; it was a difficult time for him but he showed his bravery by coming here and took it as a personal challenge.”Everyone is so enamoured that the challenge now is to find a way to hold on somehow, anyhow. “We have to enjoy this and then we will see,” Joaquín says, but this is too good to just let go. They have to do whatever it takes to keep him. “Even,” Isco says, “if it’s just for one more year,” even if it means kidnapping him. It is what all of them want, Antony especially: now playing with the best people, illuminated again in the city of lights. “When the opportunity arose to come to Betis, my head was already here. In my heart, I was sure I would be happy, and every day I see that this was the best decision I could have made,” he says. “I love the club, the city, everything. The sunshine, the people, the food: it reminds me of Brazil. And the most important thing of all is that here I have found myself.”PosTeamPGDPts1Barcelona3458792Real Madrid3436753Atletico Madrid3429674Athletic Bilbao3424615Villarreal3413586Real Betis3410577Celta Vigo340468Rayo Vallecano34-6449Mallorca33-74410Osasuna34-84411Real Sociedad34-54312Valencia34-114213Getafe3403914Espanyol34-83915Sevilla34-93816Alaves34-113517Girona33-123518Las Palmas34-163219Leganes34-193120Valladolid34-5816Explore more on these topicsReal BetisLa LigaEuropean club footballManchester UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Italian goalkeeper has had the biggest hand – or glove – in taking the club to the brink of theChampions Leaguefinal and his contributions against Liverpool, Aston Villa and Arsenal have not gone unnoticed by his teammates.His saves in the penalty shootout at Anfield helped PSG overcome Liverpool, earning him the man-of-the-match award. He did not receive the trophy for his performance at Villa Park, despite big saves from Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio. “It was Gigi who was the man of the match,” said a bewildered Ousmane Dembélé as he was handed the award after the second leg at Villa Park. “He saved us with his incredible saves. He was decisive in every important moment.”A finger-tip save from Leandro Trossard and a great stop to deny Gabriel Martinelli helped PSG keep a clean sheet at the Emirates last week. On that occasion, Vitinha was handed the award before writing on social media that Donnarumma was “the real MVP”.Donnarumma has re-written the script this year. So often the man who would crumble on big European nights – memorably at the Bernabéu in 2022, when he made a mistake in a defeat to Real Madrid in the last 16 – he has become the man who is pushing them towards the Champions League trophy, still perceived as the “holy grail” by the club’s owners. And his performances have come at an opportune time or his own career.When he arrived at PSG on a free transfer from Milan in the summer of 2021, Donnarumma was thrust into a “difficult situation” in which he was in competition with Keylor Navas for the No 1 jersey. Mauricio Pochettino chopped and changed between the two keepers. Towards the end of Donnarumma’s first season at the club, both goalkeepers recognised the situation was unsustainable. “It has to change,” said Navas. Donnarumma agreed, saying: “We have an excellent relationship but it isn’t easy to live with, for him or for me. Things surely must change.”And they did. “A choice had to be made: it was either him or me,” said the Italian after Navas was demoted and then loaned to Nottingham Forest. In Christophe Galtier’s only season at PSG, Donnarumma was the undisputed No1 and that remained the case in Luis Enrique’s first season. However, the goalkeeper’s shortcomings with the ball at his feet and his questionable aerial presence saw old doubts re-emerge last summer.View image in fullscreenDonnarumma saved two of Liverpool’s three penalties in their shootout in the last 16.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAThose doubts led to the recruitment of Matvey Safonov for the not inconsiderable fee of €20m. The Russian arrived in bullish mood. “Luís Campos [PSG’s sporting director] never said I was No 2. I don’t see myself as a No 2,” said the Russia international. “I don’t want to be a substitute. If they make me a No 2, things won’t be easy for the No 1. I have never lost a competition. I have always been the No 1 goalkeeper. Maybe they don’t have the intention of making me No 1 straight away, but I believe I will become that.”Safonov, who has since stressed that he has a strong relationship with the other goalkeepers at the club, has not displaced Donnarumma this season but he has nonetheless made 16 appearances. PSG were also linked with a move for Lille goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier, seen as the future for the France national team, and therefore in fitting withLes Parisiens’new strategy of signing homegrown talents.Arsenal are talking the talk after PSG loss but can they walk the walk in Paris?Read moreHowever, there is now optimism that Donnarumma will sign a new contract. As stated by the player and his agent, an extended stay at the Parc des Princes is the priority. For a long time, it was uncertain whether that was also the club’s priority but, in this make-or-break season, it seems he has sufficiently convinced the club’s hierarchy.There is still a trade-off with Donnarumma, despite his undoubted shot-stopping abilities. Luis Enrique gave a stern “no comment” when asked a fair question about the goalkeeper’s aerial presence – or lack thereof – before the game at Villa Park.He had just one word to describe Donnarumma’s performance after the match: “Sen-sa-tion-nelle”. It was the PSG manager’s only word in French during the whole press conference. It is one that doesn’t need translating but it is one that applies to all of Donnarumma’s performances on English soil in this Champions League knockout phase. Those performances could yet prove decisive in PSG’s quest to win the prestigious and elusive European crown. Two games remain for Donnarumma’s own individual redemption arc to be complete.Quick GuideLigue 1 resultsShowNantes 0-1 AngersAuxerre 1-2 Le HavreBrest 1-0 MontpellierLyon 1-2 LensLille 1-1 MarseilleStrasbourg 2-1 PSGToulouse 2-1 RennesSaint-Étienne 1-3 MonacoNice 1-0 ReimsWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Talking pointsOusmane Dembélé returned to training on Monday to give PSG a timely boost before their second leg againstArsenal. The France international, who scored the only goal in the first leg, had been a concern after picking up a muscle injury at the Emirates. However, he took part in a squad session and is expected to be available for the match at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday.PSG’s lack of interest in the remainder of the Ligue 1 season was once again evident againstStrasbourg. Luis Enrique made 10 changes to the team that beat Arsenal at the Emirates in midweek, with only João Neves keeping his place in a side that had an average age of just 21. Unlike PSG, Strasbourg do have something to play for, and it showed. Lucas Hernández scored an own goal as PSG conceded their seventh goal from a corner this season before a sublime effort from Félix Lemarechal doubled Strasbourg’s lead on the stroke of half-time. Bradley Barcola netted within 40 seconds of the restart, but despite Désiré Doué coming of the bench – to face his brother Guéla – Luis Enrique’s side could not find an equaliser. The result means that PSG’s 39-game unbeaten run away from home in Ligue 1 comes to an end. Luis Enrique did not seem too worried. Titles, not records, are his priority.The win means that Strasbourg remain in a congested pack behind PSG. Only two points separate Marseille in second from Strasbourg in sixth. Monaco and Nice, third and fourth, both got important wins, while Marseille drew with fifth-placed Lille. The big losers of the weekend were Lyon, who are now three points behind Strasbourg after a 2-1 loss to Lens. Paulo Fonseca’s side were dominant in the game but wasteful, and the defeat could have grave consequences. Lyon had counted on Champions League qualification to ease the dire financial situation at the club, which led the DNCG to provisionally relegate Lyon earlier this season. The Champions League may now be beyond them, and the consequences of that failure could be severe.Their local rivals, Saint-Étienne, look increasingly likely to make a swift return to Ligue 2. Their defeat to Monaco was compounded by a last-gasp win for Le Havre, who are now four points aboveSaintéand in the relegation playoff spot.Les Vertswere without forward Lucas Stassin this weekend and they may miss him until the end of the season. Without him, it is difficult to see where the goals will come from. Reims, defeated by Nice, as well as Angers and Nantes, all remain in danger of the drop.PosTeamPGDPts1PSG3252782Marseille3223593Monaco3224584Nice3221575Lille3217576Strasbourg3214577Lyon3219548Lens32-1489Brest32-34710Auxerre32-14111Rennes3213812Toulouse3203813Reims32-113314Angers32-203315Nantes32-163216Le Havre32-303117St Etienne32-392718Montpellier32-5016This is an article byGet French Football NewsExplore more on these topicsLigue 1Get French Football NewsParis Saint-GermainEuropean club footballArsenalChampions LeagueStrasbourgSt EtiennefeaturesShareReuse this content"

OK, their first-choice boss Simone Inzaghi was technically suspended, but seeing his assistant Massimiliano Farris trot out for the pre-game interview only reinforced a feeling that we were not about to watch the real thing.For months, Inter had tried to compete at full focus on every front, Inzaghi speaking of the ambition to win a quadruple. Then they lost three games in a week, falling behind Napoli at the top of Serie A and sufferingelimination from the Coppa Italiaby neighbours Milan. Suddenly their most ambitious target, the Champions League, looked like it might be their most realistic shot at claiming any silverware.Bayern Munich v Leverkusen has been a great rivalry. But is it over? | Andy BrassellRead moreAll the club’s eggs are not yet in one basket – Napoli may yet slip, and the Club World Cup doesn’t start for another five weeks – but the selection to face Verona was a clear statement of Inter’s priorities. Only one player, Yann Bisseck, who startedthe 3-3 draw away to Barcelonain last Wednesday’s Champions League semi-final first leg kept his starting spot.The replacements performed their duties just fine. Inter won an early penalty after Nicolás Valentini blocked Marko Arnautovic’s flick with his arm. Kristjan Asllani converted in the ninth minute and, just like that, the game was won. Inter’s second string lacked the craft to carve out further chances but they made sure a limited Verona never saw the ball long enough to create a threat.It finished 1-0, a welcome result for Inter after their catastrophic end to April – even if it might feel like too little, too late. Napoli had already won away at Lecce on Saturday, retaining their three-point buffer at the top with three games left.Quick GuideSerie A resultsShowTorino 1-1 Venezia, Cagliari 1-2 Udinese, Parma 0-1 Como, Lecce 0-1 Napoli, Inter 1-0 Verona, Empoli 0-1 Lazio, Monza 0-4 Atalanta, Roma 1-0 Fiorentina, Bologna 1-1 Juventus.Monday:Genoa v Milan (7.45pm)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.At full time, one journalist asked Farris whether some people might consider this a negative season for Inter even if they win theChampions League. He responded that he would probably just give a person like that a polite smile, leaving us to imagine the rejoinder he might have wished to add: “because a person who thinks that is obviously bonkers”.As much as Inter wanted, and believed they could, win every competition they entered this season, the Champions League has always been the trophy they desire most. No Italian team has won it since they last did, under José Mourinho 15 years ago. Inter’s run to the final two years agoonly deepened their hunger.In Inzaghi’s mind they are already back on that stage. “The final won’t be played in Munich,” he said last week, “but at San Siro on Tuesday.”Despite twice letting a lead slip, his team came away from the draw inBarcelonawith renewed belief. They stood toe-to-toe with opponents who have scored 150 goals this season and proved they were capable of trading blows.“Inter c’è,” said Alessandro Bastoni – Inter are here, still alive and kicking. Denzel Dumfries couldn’t stop talking about how this was “la Inter vera”– the real one, not the pale imitation we had seen for the previous week. La Gazzetta dello Sport called them “Stellar”.View image in fullscreenDenzel Dumfries scores a spectacular goal for Inter against Barcelona last week. He said their performance in the 3-3 first-leg draw was ‘la Inter vera’(the real Inter).Photograph: Mattia Ozbot/Inter/Getty ImagesThe only thing dampening their enthusiasm was concern over the hamstring injury that forced the captain, Lautaro Martínez, off at half-time. The Argentinian has had a fascinating season – less prolific than we have come to expect inSerie A, but consistently decisive in Europe, where he has not always been so effective in the past. He has scored a goal for every 87 minutes he has been on the pitch in this Champions League.Before the first leg, Inter’s greatest selection concern surrounded Marcus Thuram, who has struggled to shake off a string of niggling injuries in 2025. He wound up starting, and scoring an audacious heel flick within 30 seconds of kick-off at Montjuïc. “When you get to this point of the season, nobody is 100%,” said the Frenchman. “It’s hard for everyone, Barcelona too. But these are matches you have to play even if you’re not at 100%.”Martínez appears to be of the same mind. He posted to Instagram with a photo of himself performing a pull-up accompanied by battery and hourglass emojis. He is expected to train with teammates on Monday and several Italian outlets have already reported he will start on Tuesday. Not every return from injury, though, goes as well as Thuram’s. The fear is that Martínez’s desperation to play may run ahead of his body’s capability to heal.Atalanta fan stabbed to death in clashes with Inter supporters, police confirmRead moreInter’s chances of beating Barcelona will certainly be less if he is absent or even below his best. Inzaghi noted the difference in depth between his squad and Hansi Flick’s after the first leg. In attack, especially, Inter have struggled when their starters are missing. Mehdi Taremi has scored three goals in 39 appearances in all competitions. Marko Arnautovic has seven in 26.Is it now or never for this group? Inter have fielded the oldest starting XIs in both Serie A and the Champions League this season. There is a core that could be rebuilt around – Bastoni, Martínez, Thuram, Nicolò Barella and Federico Dimarco – but a couple of the team’s most reliable, relied-upon players – Francesco Acerbi and Henrikh Mkhitaryan – are into the second half of their 30s.There is a shared sense of self-belief, earned in part from the fact that so many of these players have been here and done this before. That courage to keep attacking even after conceding weighty goals in places like Barcelona and Munich has made supporters love this team even more.To reach a second Champions League final in three years, even so, remains a tall task. “We went against all odds to play a great game in Barcelona,” said Farris, speaking for Inzaghi, on Saturday night. “Now we need to do it again on Tuesday.”PosTeamPGDPts1Napoli3530772Inter Milan3540743Atalanta3540684Juventus3520635Roma3518636Lazio3513637Bologna3515628Fiorentina3518599AC Milan34155410Como35-34511Torino35-14412Udinese35-114413Genoa34-123914Cagliari35-153315Verona35-333216Parma35-143217Lecce35-332718Venezia35-212619Empoli35-282520Monza35-3815Explore more on these topicsSerie AEuropean club footballInternazionaleBarcelonaChampions LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But is it over?Clubs’ tussle for supremacy in Germany may be at its end as the futures of Alonso and Wirtz remain uncertainAndy BrassellMon 5 May 2025 08.08 EDTLast modified on Mon 5 May 2025 10.10 EDTShareEarly on Sunday evening Bayern Munich’s players arrived a few at a time in a swish restaurant that had been opened just for them, as they prepared to commemoratea 33rd Bundesliga title(34 if you include the pre-Bundesliga crown of 1932) not quite as they had hoped, in their street clothes rather than their football strips. Bild even claimed that as Freiburg took the lead late in the first half against Bayer Leverkusen on the big screen in front of the Bayern squad (a game the 2024 champions needed to win to mathematically prolong the race) there was a loud exclamation of “Scheiße!” from at least one player who had wanted Bayern to officially finish the job themselves at home to Borussia Mönchengladbach next Saturday.Harry Kane, Munich’s beloved import, finally has the trophy he’s long cravedRead moreIt had not quite been the titanic end that anybody had hoped for, with Bayern letting in a 95th-minute Yussuf Poulsen equaliser thatstopped themofficially sealing it on Saturday, Harry Kane suspended so he couldn’t take part at all and Leverkusen getting a leveller in the fourth minute of stoppage time at Freiburg on Sunday which ended up meaning little to anyone apart from the hosts and their rivals for Champions League qualification.It did, however, epitomise the struggle. There will be some who seek to diminish the achievements of Bayern, of Kanedespite winning his first major trophy, of Vincent Kompany in his first season of elite-level head coaching, crying out that the house always wins. Yet the context is everything. Xabi Alonso’s Leverkusen have turned the Bundesliga upside down in the last two and a half years. Even the first year of Kane in the Bundesliga wasn’t enough to deny them. It has taken England’s captain being joined by the magnificent Michael Olise, the continued progression of Jamal Musiala (surely now the Bundesliga’s best player) and the unlikely influence of Kompany, evolving the Bayern environment into something slightly more holistic, to restore a status quo of sorts.Seeing Bayern with a worthy opponent for the first time since Jürgen Klopp brought Borussia Dortmund to the top has been exhilarating. The sense is, though, that Alonso’s touchline celebration of Jonathan Tah’s equaliser in Freiburg – big smile, little leap, clenched fist – might have just said it all. He wasn’t celebrating what it was but what had been, in that incredible last season but in almost every moment since his October 2022 arrival, propellingDie Werkselffrom the bottom to higher than where they thought the top was, shredding every notion of impossible along the way. Tah’s flicked header was a reminder of all those late comebacks, the improbable result-from-the-jaws-of-defeat moments that stacked up last season and even, semi-regularly, this term. Yet removed from any sort of real sporting meaning for the team it felt like a tribute, a nod to what coach and players had achieved together which, it feels like, is coming to an end.And it has felt like that for a while. Alonso is widely expected to replace Carlo Ancelotti at Real Madrid, with club and coach in Nord Rhine-Westphalia sitting in limbo until the terms and the timings of the Italian’s departure for the Spanish capital are agreed. “Hand on heart,” sighed Granit Xhaka after Sunday’s game, “I think it’s easier for every team, for every player, when you know who’s going to be on the sidelines next year. But that shouldn’t be an excuse for the last few weeks.” Xhaka lamented the scratchy form and missed opportunities that have followed Champions League elimination by Bayern. The former Arsenal man, now Leverkusen’s unofficial spokesman, non-mincer of words and Alonso’s authority on the field, couldn’t avoid a sense of finality even as he said that he hoped the coach would stay. “We had him for two years,” said the captain. “Whether we have him for a third year is not my job to say. But no matter what happens, we had a great time.”View image in fullscreenJonas Urbig, Harry Kane, Konrad Laimer and Eric Dier celebrate after Bayern’s title win.Photograph: -So what next? It is not only Alonso’s future that lies at the heart of the equation but that of Florian Wirtz. Since returning from the muscle injury that undercut the money stretch of Leverkusen’s season the No 10 has been short of his imperious best and he was quiet on Sunday afternoon – right up until the moment where he wasn’t, skating past a brace of challenges and steering in a fine shot from the edge of the box to drag his team back into the game and mount the platform for that next late comeback.Quick GuideBundesliga resultsShowMainz 1-1 Eintracht Frankfurt, Freiburg 2-2 Leverkusen, Augsburg 1-3 Holstein Kiel, Dortmund 4-0 Wolfsburg, Borussia Mönchengladbach 4-4 Hoffenheim, RB Leipzig 3- 3 Bayern, St Pauli 0-1 Stuttgart, Union Berlin 2-2 Werder Bremen, Heidenheim 0-0 Bochum.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.If there was one moment that defined this season, the battle between Bayern and Leverkusen and the destiny of the title, it was back in mid-February with Wirtz again at the centre. It was the first minute of stoppage time between the two teams at the BayArena and with the score goalless and Manuel Neuer having just blocked an effort from Amine Adli. It fell to Wirtz, surrounded by traffic in the Bayern area. Traffic that he managed to extricate himself from in the blink of an eye. All that remained was the finishing touch but staggeringly,he put it wide. A hush fell over the stadium; everyone knew that was the moment. It would have shortened an eight-point lead to five but regardless of the numbers, it never really felt as if Leverkusen got that close again, either in Bundesliga or in that Champions League tie in which Bayern crushed their hopes and their spirit in time-honoured fashion.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Bayern could not get near him. It had looked as if the 22-year-old’s reign would continue, with his future not tied to Alonso’s and the contours of an extended contract broadly agreed. Yet as with Alonso, the months have gone by with the sound of silence becoming more deafening. Now Bayern are preparing for their push, set to dip into their reserve cash to pair Wirtz with Musiala despite their expensive contract renewals of spring. That would be a sad end to a satisfying tussle for supremacy in theBundesliga, which has been so in both the direct confrontations and at a distance. It could survive the exit of Alonso, but not of Wirtz as well.Talking pointsA more improbable return to the status quo is that of Dortmund coming to within touching distance of a return to the Champions League. Niko Kovac’s team continued their hot streak and their return from the wilderness with a 4-0 thrashing of Wolfsburg which lifted them to fourth overnight on Saturday, although Freiburg reclaimed that final Champions League spot with their Sunday point.

It was potentially vital for Leipzig, now in sixth but only two points behind Freiburg as a battle royale for the top four is set up. For Freiburg’s Julian Schuster to make it in his debut season would be sensational – but they travel next to Holstein Kiel, the team that refuse to go down and pulled off a brilliant 3-1 win at Augsburg this weekend to keep alive their chance of getting the relegation playoff spot (Kiel also travel to Dortmund, who they beat in January, on the final day).Jonathan Burkhardt’s equaliser for Mainz stopped Eintracht Frankfurt getting the win they needed to clinch top four in Sunday’s late game but they need an absolute maximum of two points to make sure.PosTeamPGDPts1Bayern Munich3261762Bayer Leverkusen3231683Eintracht Frankfurt3220564Freiburg32-3525Borussia Dortmund3215516RB Leipzig326507Mainz329488Werder Bremen32-6479Borussia M'gladbach3214510Stuttgart3264411Augsburg32-114312Wolfsburg3213913Union Berlin32-143714St Pauli32-113115Hoffenheim32-183116Heidenheim32-272617Holstein Kiel32-272518VfL Bochum32-3322Explore more on these topicsBundesligaEuropean club footballBayer LeverkusenBayern MunichfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In it they demanded a reversal of the ban on transgender women from women’s football and described the FA’s decision as a “pitiful and weak response” to the supreme court’s ruling. Bullingham said the FA understands “how difficult this decision will be for people who want to play football in the gender by which they identify, and we are aware of the significant impact this will have on them”, added it “also understands that it will have repercussions for Goal Diggers FC – your players, coaches, volunteers and fans – who all play an important role in championing diversity in football.”SFA to ban transgender women from playing in women’s footballRead moreBullingham said that the FA would “like to reassure you that we are committed to working with every registered transgender player in our network to support them in staying involved in football and we will continue to have those conversations”. However, Goal Diggers player Becky Taylor-Gill said the FA needs to stand more firmly with transgender women. “Their motto is football for all. Put your money where your mouth is,” said Taylor-Gill. “Put your lawyers in the situation where they can fight for football to be for all.“We’ve created a safe space for trans women in our women’s team that we really cherish and they should feel welcomed. This decision will just push more trans women out of football at a time when that’s what they really need.”Outside the Haggerston Park football pitches where Goal Diggers train, members of the not-for-profit club, which was founded to make football more available and accessible to all women and non-binary people, signed flags and set off flares alongside supporters before setting off on their walk. It had initially been set up as a sponsored walk by Goal Diggers members to fundraise for the club and was to conclude with a letter opposing the FA’s existing grassroots transgender women’s policy, which will be overtaken by the ban when it comes into effect on 1 June.However, after the supreme court ruling and subsequent FA ban, the club decided to open the walk up to others, with members of other clubs and supporters of the campaign joining the walk to endorse the message in the letter that: “Our governing body should not be adding more barriers to transgender people to be welcomed into the beautiful game.”Taylor-Gill said the decision of the FA “goes completely against what Goal Diggers stand for and what the grassroots women’s football community stands for” adding: “We’ve had to fight so much just to be able to play. We, as a club, took us years to find a regular space for us to play football. We were playing football on sandy astro and in kids playgrounds at schools because men’s teams had block bookings for all of the pitches.“The FA have a history of banning women from football. In 1921 they banned women from playing on FA-affiliated pitches and they’re doing the same now, but they’re just taking aim at our transgender teammates who are already an incredibly vulnerable part of society as things stand in the UK. All they want to do is play football and at a time when it’s really important that they have that community because of wider transphobia in society, it’s being taken away from them. That’s really, really sad.”Sammy Rees, a trans women player for Goal Diggers, described feeling “hurt, annoyed and scared” following the ban. “A lot of things that I never worried about in the past are now at the forefront of my mind,” she said. “I’m stressed, not just about the FA decision but the whole supreme court ruling has changed how I view my life. It’s changed how I interact with people, it’s made me more conscious of how I present to other people and how people view me, which is something I never really struggled with before.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It has restated what it always knew: that women need their own teams and leagues. Playing mixed-sex football should be a choice, not something forced on women and girls because trans-identifying male players want to join women’s teams.”Rees added: “As a trans woman that’s played men’s football, as much as the people that I played with were lovely and were accepting, I was incredibly uncomfortable and I know other trans people who have felt similarly. It’s a completely different environment. When I come into women’s football I’m met with nothing but love, guidance, acceptance and most importantly, respect.”Explore more on these topicsFootballThe FAnewsShareReuse this content"

Lionesses, who train in Kent and play their home game at men’s League Two side Bromley’s Hayes Lane ground, will be hoping to break the trend of promoted teams struggling and going straight back down to the Championship after Bristol City endured that fate in the 2023-24 campaign, collecting only six points in the WSL, nine points behind the second-bottom side, while this season Crystal Palace’s relegation has already been confirmed with them having accumulated only 10 points with one game remaining, seven points adrift.Women’s Super League and Championship: talking points from the weekend’s actionRead more“We have in mind what happened in the last two seasons, for sure, with the promoted team,” said Prêcheur, a former Paris Saint-Germain coach who took over at Lionesses last summer. “We don’t want to have the same story, which means we need to be sure we are strong enough, and it will be tough.“I’m not naive – I know the gap is huge between the Championship and the WSL. After [celebrating] I’ll go back to work and start to ensure staff and players look at what are the priorities and what we need to be sure we can compete.”Nonetheless,the Lionesses’ owner, Michele Kang, who also owns the French club Lyon and the American side Washington Spirit, insists they immediately intend to be a mid-table WSL team, revealing after Sunday’s game that her recruitment team are to have a meeting “first thing on Monday morning” to start work on the summer transfer window.Quick GuideBrighton's Kirby sends Arsenal towards another heavy defeatShowBrighton left Arsenal shellshocked once again as they ran out 4-2 winners in their final Women's Super League home game of the season.Gunners head coach Renee Slegers had been expecting a response from a 5-2 defeat by Aston Villa on Wednesday – which had followed on from their Champions League heroics against Lyon to reach the final – and made six changes to her side.Brighton, however, gave their fans a memorable send-off at Broadfield Stadium, with Fran Kirby (pictured) firing in the opening goal after 16 minutes.Although Caitlin Foord equalised just before the half-hour mark, Jelena Cankovic struck either side of the break – her second after Arsenal were caught playing out from the back – to put the hosts firmly in control after 52 minutes.Kiko Seike added a fourth just two minutes later following a swift counterattack to keep fifth-placed Brighton on course for a highest ever finish in the WSL.Arsenal scored a late consolation through Mariona Caldentey in stoppage time, with Jenna Nighswonger's effort then pushed on to the crossbar, leaving Slegers's squad to regroup as they aim to make sure of runners-up spot in their last league match against closest rivals Manchester United.PA MediaPhotograph: John Walton/PAWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“It’s actually going to be much easier to recruit,” she said. “A lot of top players didn’t want to join a Championship team but now we’re in WSL I think it’s going to be easier to recruit. We’re very, very excited.“We’ve been building the team to be mid-tier WSL, at a minimum, on day one. It remains to be seen, but we’ve seen so many clubs that go up and then come down, so we’ve been actually on purpose to be at least on day one someone in mid-tier, and who knows.”Explore more on these topicsLondon City LionessesWomen's Super LeagueWomen’s ChampionshipWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

After sustaining the injury duringBarça’s 4-3 victory against Celta Vigo on 19 April, he missed theCopa del Rey final victory against Real Madridand thefirst leg of the semi against Inter.‘The real Inter’ prepare for Champions League showdown with Barcelona | Nicky BandiniRead more“We’ve spoke yesterday and everything is going the right way, and [Lewandowski] is good. Much better than we expected, and he’s ready for the bench. So when we need him, maybe he can come in,” Flick said on Monday.Barcelona’s hopes of reaching their firstChampions Leaguefinal in a decade are buoyed up by Lewandowski’s return, especially after an exhilarating 3-3 draw in the first leg. However, the team will be without the full-backs Jules Koundé and Alejandro Balde, both sidelined with injuries. Flick did not reveal his plans to replace the injured duo, but he hinted at deploying the centre-backs Ronald Araújo and Eric García or relying on the youngsters Héctor Fort or Gerard Martín in their natural positions.Koundé and Balde’s absence will pose a big challenge for Flick, withBarcelonastruggling to stop Inter’s counterattacks in the first leg, mainly through Denzel Dumfries, who was a constant menace from the right, scoring two goals and claiming an assist.View image in fullscreenDenzel Dumfries, who was brilliant down Inter’s right against Barcelona in the first leg, scores his team’s second goalPhotograph: Mattia Ozbot/Inter/Getty Images“As a coaching staff, we analyse everything. We see how a player performed in each situation and maybe we will have to make some changes because we need to defend much better,” Flick said. “Football is really complex, so it has to do with everything. It has to do with the player but we have to find the right idea of how we want to play, the match plan. Of course, the changes have to be good, but also the players have to show on the pitch who they are and what they are made of.”Barcelona, who are chasing a treble, are unbeaten domestically since late December and are leading La Liga by four points, ahead of Real.

Minds will spring immediately to Dennis Taylor’s dramatic triumph in 1985, or one of Stephen Hendry or Ronnie O’Sullivan’s many victories on the grandest stage this sport has to offer.But on a mild Monday evening in Sheffield and 20 years on from the door for Chinese snooker being pushed ajar, Zhao Xintong may well have just changed the way the sport is viewed, played and followed for hundreds of millions of people in Asia and across the world.Ronnie O’Sullivan plans new life in Middle East after sorry semi-final exitRead moreIt was 2005 when Ding Junhui’s victory in the UK Championship against Steve Davis gave snooker hope it could be about to usher in a wave of success from China. There are over 300,000 snooker halls in the country, where it is treated as a national sport. Over 150 million were watching this match in China. This is seriously big business.But there was always one thing missing: a Chinese world champion. That wait is over thanks to one of the most exceptional talents the sport has ever seen. It was just 227 days ago when Zhao made his return in an empty snooker hall in Sofia on the amateur tour with a 3-0 victory over Lithuania’s Vilius Schulte-Ebbert.Zhao was returning from a 20-month suspension for his partin the match-fixing scandalwhich embroiled the sport and threatened to grind Chinese snooker to a halt. It is important to point out that while 10 players were suspended for varying lengths of time, Zhao did not directly throw a match.He did accept charges of being a party to another player fixing two games and betting on matches himself but showed remorse in admitting guilt in China and the UK, where he now resides. The reception from the Crucible crowd suggests that while doubters will remain, many are willing to give him a second chance.“It’s very good for Chinese snooker,” Zhao said. “I’m very happy I’ve done this for them. It’s unbelievable. This is like a dream. When I shook hands with Mark [Williams] I nearly cried. My first target was just to get through the qualifiers. In the future, many Chinese players can win this.”Williams, the beaten man, was gracious enough to admit this moment could supersede what any victory may have meant for him. “Everyone’s got to get behind him and watch him – he could dominate,” he said. “It’s bound to open some doors. It can only be good for our sport.”View image in fullscreenZhao Xintong pots a red in the corner during his 18-12 victory against Mark Williams.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAOrganisers were adamant Zhao, whowon the UK Championship in 2021before his suspension, had to start at the bottom. He was consigned to the Q Tour for amateurs but in truth, he made a mockery of that level, making two maximum breaks and proving near unbeatable.Zhao has won an incredible 42 of his first 44 games since returning, including five to qualify for this world championship. He was quietly fancied by some given his undeniable ability and his sensational temperament, but few could have imagined the manner in how he would handle the biggest occasion.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Zhao emphatically won both afternoon sessions to move to within one frame of the title at the start of the final session but Williams was never going to go away quietly.At 50, he is the oldest finalist in Crucible history and after winning four consecutive frames on Monday evening, a 17-8 deficit was reduced to 17-12 in a matter of minutes. But once Zhao was given one half-chance, he would not pass up on the opportunity, such has been his unflappable nature throughout the tournament.That proved to be the case in the 30th and final frame of the match. A break of 87 executed with the fluency that has taken him through the nine matches in qualifying and the main draw proved to be more than enough, with Zhao raising a Chinese flag aloft amid the celebrations to perhaps symbolically usher in a new era for the sport.The new champion did not have far to go with his trophy and £500,000 winner’s cheque: he lives just a 10-minute walk from the Crucible. But it is thousands of miles away where this triumph will truly be felt, and there was perhaps nobody better placed than Williams who best summed up the moment.“He’s bashed me up,bashed Ronnie [O’Sullivan] upand bashed everyone up. There’s a new superstar of the game. I’m glad I’ll be too old when he’s dominating.” Perhaps that dominance has already begun.Explore more on these topicsWorld Snooker ChampionshipSnookernewsShareReuse this content"

Doris sustained the injury duringLeinster’s Champions Cup semi-final defeat by Northamptonon Saturday and was replaced during the second half. Leinster do not expect Doris to play again this season and said in a statement the ­precise length of any layoff would not be known until after the operation. Nienaber’s “gut” instinct painted a bleak outlook for the No 8, however.“He saw a specialist and I think there’s some further investigation that needs to be done,” Nienaber said. “Fingers crossed that things aren’t as bad as we think it is, but in the last couple of months that I’ve worked with Caelan, he’s not a guy that necessarily comes off the pitch with injury.“So when I subjectively saw him coming off the pitch on Saturday, I thought in my mind: ‘That must be quite serious’. We’ll probably know more in the back end of the week, but my gut, and it’s only gut, says that I think it might be serious. But fingers crossed it might not be.View image in fullscreenCaelan Doris scored Leinster’s third try during their Champions Cup semi-final defeat by Northampton, but later went off injured.Photograph: David Fitzgerald/Sportsfile/Getty Images“It’ll definitely be a race. Shoulder injuries, depending on the amount of structural damage there is, can be anything from a two-month thing to a four-to-six month thing. We know there is damage, we’re just not 100% sure how much damage.”Farrell is due to announce his captain and unveil his squad in front of a live audience at the O2 on Thursday and it is expected that Doris will have undergone the operation before then.The potential to lose Doris so soon before his squad announcement is a major concern for Farrell. Even if he was already leaning towards Itoje – whoexcelled as England’s leader in the Six Nations– Doris is his Ireland skipper and was almost certainly nailed on to start the Test series against the Wallabies at No 8.Farrell will now anxiously await the result of Doris’s operation, all the while exploring contingency options. Last month the head coach insisted there were at least a handful of options for the captaincy – Sione Tuipulotu, Jamie George and even Owen Farrell could fit the bill – but Itoje has excelled since assuming the role for club and country this season. And while the back-row positions in the squad will be hotly contested, there are fewer standout candidates at No8.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Scotland’s Matt Fagerson and Jack Dempsey are other options, having both appeared at No 8 during the Six Nations, as well as England’s Ben Earl and Tom Willis. Jack Conan deputises for Doris for Leinster and Ireland.The Lions play their first match – a warmup fixture against Argentina – in Dublin on 20 June before beginning their tour of Australia against Western Force in Perth eight days later. The first Test against the Wallabies is on 19 July, raising the possibility that Doris could end up joining the squad after the tour has started. Four years ago, Alun Wyn Jones suffered a dislocated shoulder in the warmup match against Japan and was initially ruled out of the tour,only to join the squad in South Africa 18 days later.In 2017, Warren Gatland named Sam Warburton as captain for the second consecutive tour shortly afterthe Wales flanker had sustained a knee injury.

It’s going to sting now but use it as motivation and let’s all come back better. Don’t be satisfied.”The Lakers’ Luka-LeBron era begins with a stumble, not a statementRead moreHouston won 52 games to capture the No 2 seed in the Western Conference and return to the postseason for the first time since 2020. The seven seed Warriors eliminated the Rockets in the playoffs for a fifth time after doing so four times between 2015 and 2019.“We had whatever amount of wins and second place and all that, but nobody cares about that right now,” Udoka said. “It’s about where we finished.”Stephen Curry scored 14 of his 22 points in the fourth quarter and Buddy Hield made nine three-pointers and finished with 33 points to lead Golden State to the win. Hield was 9 of 11 from three-point range, setting an NBA record for a Game 7 and making more threes than the Rockets, who were 6 of 18 from long range.The Rockets didn’t lead after the first quarter and allowed Curry to get going in the second half to put the game away after Hield carried the team in first two quarters.Fred VanVleet scored a combined 55 points in the last two games to help Houston extend the series. But he was limited to 17 points on 6 of 13 shooting Sunday. He was far from the only Rockets player who struggled. Big man Alperen Sengun had 21 points and 14 rebounds. But he missed several easy shots on a 9-of-23 night.Despite the loss, Sengun was proud to see the growth of the team who won just 22 games in the 2022-23 season.“We learned how to play together,” he said. “We talk every day. It was a hard series for us. Obviously, we’re upset right now, but it’s going to be a great offseason for us and it’s going to make us better next year.”Jalen Green, who had 38 points to lead Houston to a Game 2 win, finished with eight points.“First playoffs is no excuse,” he said. “I’ve got to be better.”Green, who was the second overall pick in the 2021 draft, was criticized during this series for not doing more to lead the team after scoring fewer than 10 points in four of the seven games. But VanVleet took up for his teammate.“Everybody’s journey is different,” he said. “The weight of the world seems to be on his shoulders at times, but he played well. We knew they were going to load up on him. On the path to greatness, there’s going to be stumbles and failures.”Explore more on these topicsNBAGolden State WarriorsHouston RocketsStephen CurryBasketballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

I’ve still got my fire in my belly,” he said. “I’m not going to apologise for being a fighter. I’m not going to apologise for still wanting it. I know everyone in the team does too.”Hamilton finished eighth in the race which waswon in dominant style by McLaren’s Oscar Piastri. During the race Hamilton asked Ferrari to have his teammate Charles Leclerc, who was in front, switch places with him as the British driver was clearly quicker.He was exasperated at the time the team took took to make the call, dismissively stating, “have a tea break while you’re at it”. He also referred to it as “not good teamwork” and later, after the team switched the two drivers places back, asked with no little sarcasm whether he should also give up a place to the chasing Williams of Carlos Sainz.View image in fullscreenThe Ferrari cars of Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton at the Miami GP.Photograph: Mark Sutton/Formula 1/Getty ImagesHowever he played down the significance of the exchanges and revealed he and team principal Fred Vasseur had spoken almost immediately after the race, with Hamilton making sure the air was clear between them.“Fred came to my room, I just put my hand on his shoulder and was like, ‘dude, calm down, don’t be so sensitive’,” he said. “I could have said way worse things on the radio.

He also has his ownbusiness woesto attend to.Mass resignations at labor department threaten workers in US and overseas, warn staff – as more cuts loomRead moreBut on his way out of the White House, Musk has boasted that Doge has achieved $150bn in savings, although many budget experts question the accuracy of that figure. Musk has repeatedlymade exaggeratedanderroneous claimsabout savings, which are a fraction of Musk’s goal of $1tn in cuts.Moynihan and other public policy experts said it was unfortunate that Musk and Doge took the hard-charging focus of profit-maximizing business executives – of aggressively seeking to cut jobs and payroll – instead of adopting a broader focus aimed at making government more efficient while improving services.Martha Gimbel, the executive director of the Yale Budget Lab, said Musk evidently has little interest in making services better. “They were the ‘department of government slash and burn’,” Gimbel said. “There doesn’t seem to be an approach to dig in on places where government services could really be improved. Any improvement in government services takes time. You have to invest. You have to build it out. You have to figure out how to fix it.”There has clearly been a degeneration of government servicesMartha Gimbel of the Yale Budget LabAsked whether Musk and Doge had improved any government services, Gimbel burst out in laughter. “No,” she said. “There has clearly been a degeneration of government services.”Public policy experts and members of the public have pointed to numerous ways that government services have deteriorated due to Doge’s cuts. There have been longer waiting times to get appointments at veterans’ hospitals, longer waits when people call the Internal Revenue Service, longer lines at social security offices. The departure of many highly experienced social security employees has led to workers with far less training giving advice on benefits.At a White House news conferenceon 1 May, Musk defended Doge’s accomplishments. “In the grand scheme of things, I think we’ve been effective. Not as effective as I’d like. I think we could be more effective,” Musk said. “But we’ve made progress.”Federal workers in limbo amid whiplash White House firings and court-ordered rehiringsRead moreMusk acknowledged that his $1tn goal had been far harder to reach than he had anticipated. “It’s sort of, how much pain is the cabinet and the Congress willing to take?” he said. “It can be done, but it requires dealing with a lot of complaints.”The White House did not respond to the Guardian’s questions about the deterioration of some government services or to the Guardian’s request for any examples of how Doge has improved services.Gimbel said that Americans don’t realize that many government services will get worse in coming months as the tens of thousands of Doge-ordered job cuts play out. “Things will definitely get worse,” she said. For instance, the administration has far to go in carrying out its plan tocut 80,000 employeesin the Department of Veterans Affairs.While many public policy experts say Trump and Musk wildly exaggerate in their claims that there is huge waste, fraud and abuse in government, Gimbel said there is of course waste in government. “There is waste, and you can go after it,” she said. “People who have been in government know where those places are. There is a ton of tech that needs modernizing. Doge doesn’t seem interested in that. There’s a lot of Medicare and Medicaid overbilling. Doge doesn’t seem interested in that either. What you have is a relatively expensive exercise in slash-and-burn that sometime in the future will cost a lot to fix.”It’s hard to offer any rational basis for the decisions that are being made. There certainly aren’t any improvements that the American public will seeMax Stier of the Partnership for Public ServiceMax Stier, the president of the Partnership for Public Service, a non-profit research group, said that many business executives – including Jack Welch, the former General Electric CEO famed for cost-cutting and increasing profits – would be unhappy with Musk’s quick and brutal cuts. Stier complained that Musk and his team of twentysomething tech whizzes made steep cuts while knowing little about an agency’s operations or about the qualifications and responsibilities of the people they fired or pushed out.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s about capability destroyed. Jack Welch would never, ever have fired people without having a real understanding about the way the organization worked and about the qualities of people who were being fired. This is an arbitrary exercise that has moved out employees who are often by far the most qualified rather than the least qualified.”Stier noted that Trump has described Doge as an exercise in cost-cutting and organizational improvement. “That’s just not the case,” Stier said. “It’s hard to offer any rational basis for the decisions that are being made. There certainly aren’t any improvements that the American public will see.”“It’s burning down government capability,” he continued. “It’s unquestionably clear that they are firing people willy-nilly and are disrupting government services without any understanding of the consequences or concern about the consequences. It’s a break-it-is-to-fix-it mentality. It isn’t a mentality that predominates in Silicon Valley. It’s sheer reckless behavior in the public sector because real people get hurt.”Musk’s claim of $150bn in savings is a vast overestimate because it fails to include the considerable costs of Doge’s moves, said Stier. Stier’s group estimates that as a result of firings, rehirings, severance pay, paid leave and lost productivity involving more than 100,000 workers, Doge’s maneuvers willcost taxpayers $135bn this fiscal year. And several public policy experts said the increased wait times and hassles the public will face due to Doge’s cuts should also be subtracted from the $150bn.Moynihan said Musk has precisely the wrong vision for someone tasked with making government more efficient. “His vision is that there is no way that government employees can produce anything of value,” Moynihan said. “So the idea of tools that makes government services better is completely alien to the Musk mindset.“I think he believes that nothing public employees do has any real value, that they are not capable employees and therefore cutting them will do no harm,” Moynihan added. “It’s a vision that doesn’t understand what public services are, why they exist and how they benefit people.”Moynihan faulted Musk forgutting one of the government’s main effortsto use technology to improve services and efficiency. He also criticized Musk for helpingkill Direct File, a free and user-friendly way for people to report andfile their taxes.Move fast and destroy things: 100 chaotic days of Elon Musk in the White HouseRead moreLiz Shuler, the president of the AFL-CIO, the main US union federation, said Doge’s cuts will hurt workers. She pointed to the sharp cuts at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, saying that that agency, for instance, does important research to ensure that firefighters’ personal protective equipment is safe as possible.“There’s this notion that Doge is just cutting line items on a spreadsheet. It’s hurting real lives and real people,” Shuler said. “They’ve treated federal workers with blatant disregard and have been nothing short of dehumanizing and insulting toward them.”Gimbel of the Yale Budget Lab warned of another downside to Doge’s cuts. “Part of what government does is mitigate risk,” she said. “Take food safety. Government inspectors decrease the risk that you will get listeria or salmonella. But when theyreduce the number of food inspectors, will you get listeria or salmonella tomorrow? No. Will it probably increase the chances of people getting listeria and salmonella over the next five years? Yes.”Explore more on these topicsElon MuskTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

At the same time, Trump said he would nominate Waltz to be the US ambassador to the United Nations.The move capped weeks of controversy over Waltz’s creation of a Signal group to share real-time updates on US military action in Yemen. That chat drew particular attention because Waltz, or someone using his account, accidentally added a prominent US journalist to the group.Concerns over the security of Waltz’s communications were further heightened, when it was reported on Sunday that a hacker had broken into TeleMessage’s back-end infrastructure and intercepted some of its users’ messages.Tech news site 404 Media said the hacker provided them with stolen material, some of which the news site was able to independently verify.Smarsh did not immediately respond to a request by Reuters for more detail about the breach.Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsHackingnewsShareReuse this content"

The health secretary,Robert F Kennedy Jr, said last week that he plans to announce results from the study within months.Apetitionagainst the registry gained thousands of signatures in a single day, jumping from 2,500 to nearly 35,000 signatures within 24 hours.“I’m a quiet person who likes to just be in the background,” said first-time petition creator Ryan Smith, a parent of two neurodiverse children living in Idaho. He also didn’t want to make himself a target.“But I feel really, really, really strongly about this, and I have to speak up for my kids who can’t speak for themselves.”The petition gathered nearly 50,000 names before declaring victory when HHS seemed to walk back on the plan.“We are not creating an autism registry,” an HHS spokesperson said.But the difference seems to be in the name. The agency is creating a “real-world data platform” to “link existing datasets” for the research into causes of and treatments for autism, the spokesperson confirmed.“They’re saying it’s not an autism registry, but it sounds like they kind of just changed the name of it,” said Amy Marschall, an autistic psychologist who haslong objectedto mandatory autism registries.The health agency did not respond to the Guardian’s questions about whether individuals would be able to opt out of the database, or how it would be structured, what kind of security and privacy measures would be taken, and whether similar databases would collect information on other conditions.The causes of autism spectrum disorder, a range of neurological and developmental conditions that usually center on how people interact, communicate, learn and behave, have already been identified as genetic in the vast majority of cases.Even so, Kennedy announced at a cabinet meeting last week that the new study had been launched.“By September, we will have some of the first answers. Within six months of that, we will have definitive answers,” Kennedy said.Smith worries that the database and research could worsen stigma around autism, and it could keep individuals and families from seeking diagnoses and care.“And at worst, I worry that we’re on a slippery slope to eugenics,” Smith said. “My mind immediately goes to history and things that happened in Nazi Germany. That’s extreme, but it feels like a possibility.” Disabled people were the first to be targeted then, he pointed out.Opponents also wonder about privacy and security measures, which have not been detailed by health agencies, and how individuals’ information could be used against them.“Are you going to use this as an excuse to take away my rights, to hold me against my will, to prevent me from having children, to take away my right to manage my own finances?” Marschall asked.All of these concerns are why, typically, “human research protections are in place, to protect against that kind of damage and to protect the people’s interests,” said Diana Schendel, a professor at the AJ DrexelAutismInstitute at Drexel University.Other research projects create registries of participants, but they undertake key steps to ensure people are protected before the projects begin, Schendel said.Usually, research registries invite participants and offer informed consent on how research will be conducted and how their information will be used.“You can also create databases using existing data, which is what they seem to be describing,” Schendel said of the HHS project. But “you can’t just collect the information and then ask permission later”.The national project could jeopardize important research on autism, Schendel said: “It’s going to make people even more wary of participating in research. They could withdraw from projects that are already going on.”Kennedy’s aggressive timeline for results is also “a red flag”, Schendel said.“The idea that you can take a lot of different datasets and pool them together into a single dataset and perform an analysis with any kind of meaningful answer in a very short period of time is naive,” Schendel said. “It would be a mess.”To gather the data, the National Institutes ofHealthis exploring partnerships with other federal agencies, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs and others.Jay Bhattacharya, the NIH director, alsoproposedcollecting data from pharmacy chains, health organizations, insurance claims and medical bills, and wearable devices like smart watches, to conduct “real-time health monitoring”.Bhattacharya’s proposal to use private datasets is also likely to run into privacy concerns, since companies collected that information for other purposes and may not have permission to share it or use it for research.“The companies, I would imagine, would be very concerned, because they’re responsible for the privacy of that information,” Schendel said.Sevenstates– Delaware, Indiana, North Dakota, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Utah and West Virginia – have mandatory autism registries. Cities and local police departments sometimes also maintain registries of disabled people.There are differences in how states collect the information. In North Dakota, for instance, clinicians are required to submit autism diagnoses. Utah has a similar requirement, but it also audits hospital records, Marschall said.She hopes the increased attention on the federal database will stop that project in its tracks – and she hopes the state registries will also be scrutinized.“Why do you need my confidential information that I didn’t consent to give to you?” Marschall asked.‘Laughable, if it weren’t so dangerous’: your responses to RFK Jr’s autism stanceRead more“Nobody is saying: ‘Don’t research us.’ Nobody is saying: ‘Don’t find ways to make our lives better.’ It’s: ‘Don’t research us without any of us on your research team – and find ways to support us, not ways to eradicate us.’”New Hampshire also had a mandatory autism registry until 2024, when state representative Eric Gallager introduced alaw, with cross-partisan support, to repeal the registry and destroy the records.“I was concerned about potential personally identifiable information in it,” Gallager said of New Hampshire’s registry. “All states with registries should check them for potential privacy issues.”For those wishing to change these laws, crossing partisan lines by getting Democratic, Republican and independent lawmakers to sign on may help, he said.Smith’s petition spoke to people on all sides of politics, he said.“It’s not necessarily a political thing,” he noted. “It’s a human thing. And there’s a lot of people affected by this.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsAutismRobert F Kennedy JrMedical researchPrivacyHealthTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

So it’s a wonderful feeling to have the garden open up again – and many of you seem to agree. We were taken aback by the popularity of our pieces onhow to get your garden ready for summerand thebest secateursto help you with the spring tidy.It’s also time to dust the cobwebs off your summer wardrobe, and perhaps breathe new life into it with a few fresh items, whether that’s a“sexy spring sweater”, someviral barrel-leg trousersoran £8 mascara. (Or, if you prefer to shop secondhand, read our recentguide to buying vintage clothing.)The bargain mascaraView image in fullscreenL’Oréal Paradise Big Deal volumising mascara£8 at AmazonFormer beauty editor and self-proclaimed mascara obsessive Sabine Wiesel has been on a lifelong hunt forthe best mascaras. After retesting 25 of her favourites and five of the latest launches, she pulled togetherher ultimate editfor the Filter. “Even those who consider themselves low-maintenance usually own a mascara,” she says. “It seems no one is immune to how effortlessly eye-framing a few coats can be.” That’s certainly true of Filter readers: Sabine’s bargain pick has been one of the fastest-selling products we’ve ever recommended, after she “fell for this mascara at first swipe”.The best budget secateursView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Clemmie Power CollinsSpear & Jackson Razorsharp Advantage bypass secateurs£9.95 at Amazon“Secateurs are the single most valued tool in the gardener’s trug, an implement as personally prized as the bricklayer’s trowel,” says Matt Collins, head gardener at London’s Garden Museum, in our roundup ofthe best secateurs. They’re particularly important in spring, “the time for cutting back perennials and grasses in advance of new growth”. These Spear & Jackson secateurs are “the most simply designed and hard-working budget secateurs I’ve had the pleasure of trying”, says Matt – and they’ve also been the most popular with our bargain-loving readers.The lunch-break weeding toolView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jonathan BuckleyNiwakihorihori knife£32.95 at Sarah RavenAsk any professional gardener about their favourite tool and you’ll hear repeatedly about the hori hori knife. Once again, gardening experts chose the hori hori asone of their favourite tools for getting your garden summer-ready: “It’s perfect for digging, cutting, weeding and planting, so you can get loads done even on a quick stroll or lunch break,” said garden designerLulu Roper-Caldbeck.The spring sweaterView image in fullscreenBoden Enid embroidered jumper£112 at John Lewis“I have so much love for a sexy jumper,” says Jess Cartner-Morley in herApril style essentials. “Not easy to find, which is why ‘sexy jumper’ sounds a bit like an oxymoron,” she adds, but perfect for cooler evenings where you want a special top that doesn’t give you goose bumps. “I’d wear this out for dinner with a black cami underneath.”The five-star-rated coconut milkView image in fullscreenBiona organic coconut milk£11.95 for 6 x 400ml at Amazon“Buying a good-quality [coconut milk] – as opposed to one bolstered with sweeteners, emulsifiers and stabilisers – often makes the difference between a great dish and a bad one,” said restaurateur Ravinder Bhogal in hercoconut milk taste test.

Donald Trump’s early April trade decree has taken a month to hit theeconomy– that’s how long Chinese containers need to reach Los Angeles. And on cue, US pacific ports registered a45% dropin container bookings this week from China. When warehouses fallquietandtrucksidle in California, the silence will creepeastward.Unemploymentwill surely tick upwards.Even if Washington reverses course by the end of May, andBeijingplays nice, the best-case scenario is delayed damage. Some goods are beingreroutedto avoid charges, but you can’t reboot global logistics overnight. This isn’t strategic decoupling – it’s economic self-harm. By the time the Trump administration notices, it will be too late. The consequences of the US president’srash tacticswill reverberate through Main Street. Mr Trump offers a flippant excuse:blame 11-year-oldswith too many dolls – not his own tariffs – for rising hardship.US gross domestic product just shrank for the first time in three years – despite Mr Trump’s promise of a “golden era”. His tariffs are steering the world toward adownturn. Even the International Monetary Fund (IMF) knows it. According to its latestmodelling, the fund now sees the probability of global growth falling below 2%, a threshold widely seen as equivalent to a globalrecession, as approaching one in four. That’s double the risk it estimated six months ago. EscalatingUS tariffs, says the IMF, are the main reason behind the darkening skies.What does this mean for the world? Below 2% global growth, much of the per capita gains vanish. Most of what’s left is soaked up by expanding giants inAsiaandAfrica– places with the people and industrialcatch-upcapacity to grow even in a weakened global economy. The UK does not have this. Britain is an ageing, post-industrial economy in a productivity slump without the momentum of demographics or the slack of underdevelopment. That’s why Labour can’t afford to sit back. Rising living standards and real economic security require government to invest, build and redistribute – because the market alone won’t.Commentatorsstill blindly cling to David Ricardo’s 1817 theory of comparative advantage – as if today’s global capitalism mirrors Georgian England’s trade inwine and cloth. It doesn’t. Ricardo assumed nations specialise based on domestic costs. But in a world of mobile capital, it’s companies that specialise, not countries. That’s what the economist Dani Rodrik warned in thelate 1990s: free capital flows underminecomparative advantage. Development now depends not on obeying trade patterns, but on shaping them – throughindustrial policy.But Maga protectionism isn’t rebuilding US industry – it’s shock therapy. Mr Trump engineers atrade crisisto hike prices, kill off “uncompetitive” firms and clear the way for a leaner, capital-heavy economy. Meanwhile,tax cutshand America’s oligarchic tendency even more power to reshape markets in its image. Mr Trump’s narrative promises a revival for US workers – particularly the unionised holdouts in places such asDetroit– but what they will get is higher costs, stagnant wages and patriotic slogans. This isn’t industrial policy. It’sclass politicsdisguised as economic nationalism – a controlled demolition of what remains of US labour’s bargaining power, sold as a populist renaissance.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Citing a threat to “national security” from movies that aren’t shot in the United States, Trumpannouncedthat he would be enacting a 100% tariff on movies made anywhere else.Trump’s movie tariffs are designed to destroy the international film industryRead moreCharacteristically, this proclamation was not so bold as to make any sense whatsoever, lacking as it was any sign that Trump understands the difference between movies that are produced (at least partially) by US companies and shot in other locations, and foreign films that are produced elsewhere but released in the US (by, of course, US companies who obtain distribution rights). But the consensus seems to be that Trump is referring mainly to purportedly American productions that are lured to shoot in various international locations by tax credits that allow for substantial savings on big budgets. Andrew Pulver hasdetailed analysisof how that may work on a financial level, sifting through the detritus of Trump’s all-encompassing ignorance to explain why so many US films shoot overseas. Los Angeles film productions havedeclined in recent yearsso naturally, rather than creating incentives for more US shoots in the heart of the American film industry, Trump figures the best way to go about it is make it more expensive to shoot elsewhere.As with the idea that the US will simply materialize entire manufacturing industries if foreign goods prove too expensive, both the financial and creative reality of the situation is far more complicated. While many big productions are lured away fromLos Angelesby tax credits in England or Australia, and plenty of lower-budget movies shoot in less populated countries overseas to keep costs down, some of the Los Angeles downturn comes from movies shooting elsewhere within the United States. Atlanta, for example, has become a major production hub in recent years; large chunks of many Marvel movies have shot there, and Tyler Perry has a 330-acre studio lot for film and TV production.1:04Donald Trump announces tariff on movies from 'other nations'  – videoThe question is, are audiences yearning for more movies and shows that look like later-period Marvel or Tyler Perry movies? Granted, a lot of viewers pay almost no attention to how and why a movie looks a certain way. (This would still place most of them far above Trump in terms of art appreciation.) But particularly in the years of most prominent Covid-19 threats, a lot of movies opted to use Atlanta soundstages (or their equivalent in other areas) to cobble together movies without as many logistical headaches or risks. This is how you get a globe-trotting thriller like Red Notice that often seems to keep its stars in digitized captivity, as in a notoriously hideoussceneset in a bullfighting arena, obviously green-screened together from pieces. The only visually convincing piece among them? The crowd shots, which came from an actual arena in actual Spain. Trump may be tacitly asking for a return to pandemic-style production (maybe as a pre-emptive measure for when he helps bring about another pandemic).Of course, movies shot in the US aren’t required to head for an Atlanta parking lot, use green-screens for exteriors, or to shoot Albany for Manhattan. There are, indeed, plenty of opportunities for visually spectacular location shoots in the United States. But shooting in other countries isn’t (always) just a matter of (only) saving money. After all, the last couple of Mission: Impossible and James Bond movies shot all over the world, and were mind-bogglingly expensive. These movies follow the rich tradition of giving audiences a look at landscapes and cities that they may not be able to visit themselves – at least not all of them, and certainly not in the span of two or three hours. Part of the reason that movies like No Time to Die or Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning feel more “real” than the average streaming action picture (which also, after all, tend to feature spies, action, big stars and so forth) is that they take place in a physical world that’s both recognizable and, to people around the world, exotic in its reach and diversity.The cynical read is that these types of movies take place in multiple countries, and often include characters of various nationalities, to assure interest from multiple revenue streams in a global release pattern, and that’s probably true to an extent. But gathering locations from around the world has been a feature of big-budget film-making for decades. It can be great for verisimilitude even in the realm of fantasy; think of the Lord of the Rings films, which of course utilized plenty of special effects, but also used New Zealand locations to give audiences the illusion of a tactile Middle Earth that never existed. It’s an extreme but powerful example of a worldwide phenomenon: tourists goggling at famous real-world locations they recognize from the movies. For so many people, movies will be their first exposure to any number of other places and people, which at their best can play a role in what Roger Ebert described as an empathy-generating machine.That’s why Trump’s vaguely but forcefully worded announcement trades on a bit of fashionable xenophobia, too, implying that movies shot in other places – US-produced or not – carry dangerous levels of propaganda. Propaganda about what? Why, the idea that a world outside American serfs toiling at the behest of corner-cutting billionaires exists at all. For Trump, other countries are not objects of cultural fascination or curiosity. They’re enemy combatants who need to be vanquished and looted by American exceptionalism. It’s a simple-mindedness that many people grow out of – sometimes with the help of exposure to the arts. No wonder the president treats all forms of them with such contempt.Explore more on these topicsFilm industryTariffsDonald TrumpLos AngelescommentShareReuse this content"

That’s malarkeySteven GreenhouseThe US president is blaming ‘Biden’s economy’. In fact, there is one key cause of the poor showing – and it’s not his predecessorMon 5 May 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 5 May 2025 12.25 EDTShareWhileDonald Trumpdelusionally asserts that “we’re celebratingthe most successful first 100 daysof any administration in American history”, last week’s economic news emphatically refutes that. Trump’s commerce department reported on Wednesday that the US economy – in a sharp and dismaying reversal –shrank in the first quarterof this year.That of course is when Trump returned to the White House, but Trump, true to form, denied that he was in any way responsible for the surprisingly bad economic news. Trump, who has spent his life blaming others and refusing to admit mistakes, was quick to blameJoe Bidenfor the downturn. The nation’s gross domestic product declined at a 0.3% annual rate in the quarter, after adjusting for inflation.At Wednesday’s cabinet meeting – where cabinet secretaries sounded like North Korean officials obsequiously extolling Kim Jong-un – Trump noted the bad first-quarter report and said: “This is Biden, and you can even say the next quarter is sort of Biden.” Later in the day in a speech to corporate executives, Trump continued to try to dodge responsibility, saying: “This is Biden’s economy.”Even the very careful New York Times said that Trump was full of it.The Times wrotethat Trump “blamed his predecessor for handing him a bad economy, despite data showing that growth was strong when he took office”.When Biden left office, many economists had glowing words about the economy. “President Trump is inheriting an economy that is aboutas good as it ever gets,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “The US economy is the envy of the rest of the world, as it is the only significant economy that is growing more quickly post-pandemic than pre-pandemic.”With regard to the bad first-quarter GDP report, economists overwhelmingly agree that there was one overriding cause, and that cause was not Joe Biden. Rather, it was the huge uncertainty and fears stirred by the prospect of Trump’s tariffs. Eager to stock up on foreign goods before Trump imposed his wave of tariffs, US businesses rushed to increase their imports, and according to the formula used to calculate GDP,soaring imports have a downward effecton economic growth.Like the boy who would never admit he broke the cookie jar, Trump refused to admit that his tariffs had anything to do with the first-quarter downturn. For Trump, truth is a distant galaxy. It’s a foreign enemy that he is forever trying to repel. He stubbornly refuses to admit that the economy was in strong shape when he took office, just as he shamelessly refuses to admit that “MS-13” was Photoshopped on to the knuckles of Kilmar Ábrego García, an immigrant who was wrongly deported to a brutal prison in El Salvador. Far too often, Trump seems allergic to the truth. During aninterview with Terry Moranof ABC News, he brazenly insisted that Moran accept Trump’s falsehood about Ábrego García, telling him: “Why don’t you just say: ‘Yes, he does’” have MS-13 tattooed on his knuckles.It’s as delusional for Trump to claim that “we inherited from the last administrationan economic catastrophe”, as he did in a speech to a joint session of Congress in March, as it is for him to insist that Ábrego García’s knuckles say “MS-13”.When Biden left office, no economists were forecasting a recession anytime soon – that’s why Wednesday’s report that the economy shrank in the first quarter was such a surprising reversal. During last year’s fourth quarter, Biden’s last full quarter in office, the nation’s GDP grew at a solid 2.4% rate. Indeed, ever since the Covid-19 pandemic ended, economic growth in the USwas considerably stronger thanin Britain, Germany, France, Japan and other G7 nations. Several weeks before election day, the Economist magazine ran headlines saying the US economy was “the envy of the world” and had “left other rich countries in the dust”.When Biden’s term ended, the jobless rate was a low 4.0%. Not only that, during Biden’s four years, the averageunemployment rate was lowerthan for any president since the 1960s. Trump won over many voters by attacking high inflation under Biden – and it was a serious problem – but by the time Biden left office, inflation had slid to just 2.9%, far below its 9% peak in 2022 and nearly down to the Federal Reserve’s inflation goal.As part of his economic disinformation efforts, Trump has repeatedly said that job growth was a disaster under Biden. Sorry, Donald, that’s a lie. The fact is that during Biden’s four years, the US added 16.6 million jobs, more than during any four-year term of any previous president. (Trump will never tell you this, but during his first term, the nation lost 2.7 million jobs overall, making his first-term presidency the first presidency since Herbert Hoover’s to suffer an overall loss in jobs. The pandemic was largely responsible for that.)As part of his never-ending effort to dodge responsibility, Trump blamed Biden for the stock market’s recent troubles. During Trump’s first 100 days, the S&P 500 fell 7%, making it the market’s worst beginning to a presidential termsince Gerald Fordtook office in 1974 after Richard Nixon resigned due to the Watergate scandal.Devious as ever, Trump posted onTruth Socialon Wednesday: “This is Biden’s Stock Market, not Trump’s. I didn’t take over until January 20th.” What Trump failed to say was that the stock market didn’t begin to plunge until 2 April, when he announced his steep, worldwide “liberation day” tariffs. That was more than two months after Biden left office – so it’s absurd for Trump to blame him for that decline. And don’t expect Trump to ever acknowledge that Wall Street soared during Biden’s four years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 39% and the S&P 500 soared by 55.7%, including a 28% jump during 2024.Jared Bernstein, who was chair of the council of economic advisers under Biden, said on MSNBC on Thursday that it was ludicrous for Trump to blame Biden for the first-quarter downturn. “I have never seen a more direct connection to what we’re seeing in the economy and stock market to the action of one person, which is to President Trump and his trade war,” Bernstein said.Many economists warn that the US economy may sink further in the second quarter due to Trump’s tariffs as some supply chains break down, some imports dry up, prices rise on many goods and many consumers and business pull back on spending due to all the uncertainty and anxiety.John Kasich, a Republican and former governor of Ohio, sneered at Trump’s efforts to weasel out of responsibility. “You can’t blame Biden,”he said. “It’s like saying the dog ate my homework.”Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author focusing on labor and the workplace, as well as economic and legal issuesExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionEconomic policyJoe BidenTrump tariffsTrump administrationEconomicsTariffscommentShareReuse this content"

But he has picked up on something Democrats are missingMon 5 May 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 5 May 2025 12.19 EDTShareTrying to understand Donald Trump’s across-the-board tariffs based solely on economic theory won’t work. As the US president himselfsaid: “Chronic trade deficits are no longer merely an economic problem, they’re a national emergency that threatens our security and our very way of life.” That may be why, as manyeconomistshavepointedout, there’s simply no good economic case for his plans.Butfewcommentatorshave understood that facts and figures aren’t the whole point of the tariffs. As always, economics is part of a broader political vision. The tariffs help Trump make his claim that a way of life is under threat and he alone can protect it.Indeed, the political meaning of Trump’s tariffs is in the idea itself: “protectionism”. He is not just telling people that he’s going to improve the economy. He’s signaling that he’s going toprotecta way of life, even – orespecially– if it hurts others, by creating, in theory, good-paying factory jobs that could sustain local communities. (Never mind that thekeyto any industry’s ability to sustain communities are the practices of labor organizing Trumpopposes.) On the campaign trail, hesaid: “Whether the women like it or not, I’m going to protect them.” He’s now saying the same thing to the country as a whole.Tariffs will raise prices. But the climate crisis is the real inflation risk | Mark Blyth and Nicolò FraccaroliRead moreSuch non-economic justifications for economic policy are nothing new. They are part of what the sociologist Max Webercalled“the spirit of capitalism”. Weber argued that capitalists had to justify a claim unique in human history: profit is good. For millennia before, philosophers had argued the opposite. Jesus, for example, told his disciples that it was likelier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to get into heaven.But with capitalism, the pursuit of profit became good. How did it justify this? Weber said that’s where “spirit” comes in. He pointed to notions of work as a holy value in Protestantism and Calvinist ideas about how monetary success proved you were among God’s chosen few. These spiritual views engendered a work ethic and made capitalist excess palatable. At least for a time.When capitalist greed becomes unpalatable, new spirits emerge. To understand Trump’s protectionist spirit, we have to understand this preceding history.After the Great Depression, people saw that they might lose everything no matter how hard they worked and so the work ethic spirit lost its power. In its place, social democratic states gave a new collectivist spirit to capitalism. Social democracy limited excess and provided a moral logic by offering stability to all through a linked system of jobs and life-long public services.This collectivist spirit began to break down in the 1960s under the pressures of stagflation, oil shocks, and criticisms of a conformist, consumerist lifestyle. In response, capitalism’s spirit transformed itself again.Accordingto two scholars of this transitional period, Luc Boltanski and Ève Chiapello, it did so by ingeniously incorporating the criticisms: it became about nomads, connections, flexibility, creativity.It was no longer the staid cubicle office man; it was now the exciting creative entrepreneur who knows no allegiances and is at home in the chaos of disruption. Hence Silicon Valley. Hence the destroyed manufacturing bases where jobs were converted to low-wage poverty traps and where Trump now finds many of his most loyal supporters. Hence his protectionist vision of a new spirit of capitalism.There is some merit in this desire to help those who lost out, but, as Weber noted, the spirits of capitalism can mask more sinister desires. By also pushing massivetax breaks for the wealthy, Trump is hoping that tariffs can provide rhetorical appealwithoutradically changing the social order.The tariffs say: we will protect your community by hurting those who profited off your pain and became rich through globalization. That’s why Trumpblamed“globalists” for the dip in the stock market after the tariffs were announced: “A lot of [those selling stocks] are globalist countries and companies that won’t be doing as well … Because we’re taking back things that have been taken from us many years ago.” But that ignores the real ways in which jobs have been lost and communities upended. What the tariffs leave unsaid is that they won’t address the real issues underlying today’s economic pain: guttingwelfare, failing toretrain workers, under-utilizingtechnology, and lettinginequalityrise relentlessly.Trump’s tariffs are reckless – but they hold a key lesson for Democrats | David SirotaRead moreTrump is right that capitalism, in a period of untrammeled greed and injustice, needs a new spirit to show it the way. But the trouble with a protectivist spirit is that it implies that some get protected while others get hurt. That will just create new cycles of dismay – as we are already seeing with the tariff whiplash and draconian immigration policies.What we need is a democratizing spirit, one that isn’t about protecting some and hurting others, but instead guides us to work collectively to ensure that all people can lead decent and meaningful lives even in a chaotic world. There areeconomic policiesfor this, such as fair trade, meaningfulindustrial policy, more worker representation on corporate boards, and more cooperatively owned businesses.ButDemocratsalso need to learn from Trump and emphasize the spirit. They need to show that their democratic vision is not just technocratic, but as powerful and affirming as the feeling of being protected.The desire for this spirit may be why the rallies of Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have drawn record crowds. Most attenderssaythey aren’t there to hear the policies, which they already know. They’re there for the “community”, and toexperiencethe “closest thing to a version of America you actually want to live in”, one that works for all of us. If the Democratic party can catch that spirit, they will not only win elections; they might just bring an end to decades of destruction.Avram Alpert is a lecturer in the Princeton Writing Program.

But look at the results in those contests. No discernible impact.In 2022,as I wrote at the time, News Corporation tabloids went all out with copy that read like political advertising – in particular attacking Monique Ryan and other teal candidates. Yet look at the results. And again this time round,in the contest just ended.Sharri Markson issues own Dutton endorsement as ACM says ‘Australia is Tanya Plibersek’ | Weekly BeastRead moreUntil recently, I have always moderated observations like these by saying that sheer vote-pulling power is not the only kind of media influence, and that the Murdoch organisation remained important because its outlets articulate, amplify and spur the thinking of the right. Thus, they help set the parameters of the public debate.But I’m not sure even that is true any more.Or it has become a negative force for conservatives – a distorting mirror. News Corporation is now damaging those who fly too close to its flame.Commentators on all sides of politics are suggesting, in the wake of the election rout, that too much listening to and engagement with Sky News after dark, and the Sharri Marksons and Peta Credlins of the world, is a reason why theLiberal partyis so manifestly out of touch with middle Australia.There are lots of reasons for News Corporation’s declining power. Mostly, it is a part of the wider story of waning influence for mainstream media.There is no longer any single media outlet that reaches deep into all the demographics political parties need to win power. Once, television news served that purpose.But now there is no such thing as a mediatised national conversation. There are instead many conversations, on many mediums. To influence the population at large you need to access them all.But the decline of News Corporation’s influence has some particular characteristics within this larger story. And for journalists who value objectivity, there are some confirming messages.Only a decade ago, as the media went through agonies of declining profitability and audience, it was suggested that the way forward was to become increasingly opinionated.That was wrong.There is plenty of opinion around, of course, and always will be. But what people will pay for is reporting they trust and analysis written with integrity.TheDigital News Reportfrom the University of Canberra is one of the most reliable barometers of media trends. It shows that over half of Australians access news more than once a day – reflecting quite high levels of interest in current affairs, including among young people. Increasing numbers get their news from social media.Distrust in the news is rising, but in an important lesson for media companies trying to stay afloat, those who trust news are more likely to pay for it, and they also pay a higher price.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

ABC and SBS come first – with SBS ahead of the ABC for the first time in the most recent survey. And, whatever their faults, journalists at the public broadcasters are constrained by strict expectations of objectivity.Next in the trust ratings come the commercial television outlets and their online offerings and other newspaper outlets. And right down the bottom the News Corporation outlets News.com.au, Sky News, the Herald Sun and the Daily Telegraph.Why would any political leader lavish attention there, yet alone describe the more trusted outlets as “hate media”? It’s just plain politically stupid.Objectivity is not a mere professional fetish. It matters because it is essential to public trust. By all means media outlets can choose their topics, the areas to which they direct attention. But if the audience doesn’t trust them to reflect the world as it is, rather than as they might wish it to be, then journalism becomes little more than a vanity project.But I want to take these points, which are being widely acknowledged in election result commentary, a step further.Belief in the power of the Murdoch press has been a bit of an excuse for progressives, who have spent far too much time railing against its excesses.The problem with always reacting to a perceived powerful foe is that you unwittingly become its shadow, or its reverse image – thus being moulded by it even in the act of opposing it. The media empires are dwindling and lazy thinking simply won’t do any more.Many of Trump’s supporters like him precisely because people on the left – the dreaded “elites” – don’t like him. And getting at the left has become an end in itself – a culture war fought with the bitterness and passion of the disfranchised.After the weekend’s election result, a failure in the powers of persuasion is not an accusation that can be credibly levelled against the Labor party. But I think it is true of the broader left movement – those who so often profess to be disappointed by Labor.Identity politics, important in its way, has obscured too much of the politics of class, including economic and educational inequality.So, for once and for all, let’s accept that News Corporation will do what it does. If there are facts and arguments, think about them. If not – don’t waste your time.Sharri Markson backs Dutton? Andrew Bolt reckons the voters got it wrong? Peta Credlin thinks there should be more, not less, culture war?These are non-stories. The effusions of vanity projects. Let’s not mention them again.Instead there is harder work to be done – to write our own agenda, to engage with the world as it is – not with Murdoch’s shadow.Margaret Simons is an award-winning freelance journalist and author.

But Anthony Albanese and his climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, emerged with their ambitious goal of the country getting 82% of electricity from solar, wind and hydro by 2030 not just intact, but emphatically endorsed.Labor’s position has been relentlessly attacked by theCoalition, rightwing organisations backed by fossil fuel interests and one of the country’s biggest news media companies. Australians rejected this comprehensively.This is evident not just in the big swing to the ALP.The Greens have had a bruising timein the House of Representatives, in part because there has been a rebalance after they got a little lucky in some three-way contests in Brisbane in 2022. The swing to Labor hurt them. But their national vote largely held up and strengthened in the Senate, wherethey will have the balance of power in their own right.Albanese tells crossbench to ‘get out of the way’ on housing as he faces calls for stronger action on environmentRead moreSupport for independents continues to surge, up from about 500,000 votes in 2019 and 750,000 in 2022 to roughly 1m this time. Not all of this went to community-backed indies advocating stronger action on climate change and renewable energy, but most of it did. Wherever the seat count ends up, the independent movement that is focused on climate, lifting integrity and improving safety and respect for women continues to grow.The result is that 2025 may be Australia’s strongest vote for doing more to address the climate crisis. The Coalition’s position – unwinding or scrappingnearly all of Labor’s climate policies, abandoning the Paris climate agreementin spirit if not name, and slowing the rollout of renewable energy while substantially boosting local fossil fuel energy for the next two decades – is basically climate denial, and not what a majority of Australians want. That’s not a new idea, but the election confirmed it.It’s too soon to know what this means for the Coalition’s promise to build taxpayer-funded nuclear generators, or whether it will accept that the grid is on a path to running overwhelmingly on renewable energy backed by firming support, as the AustralianEnergyMarket Operator says it can.Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletterBut it may be a moot point by the time Australians next vote in 2028. By then, at least 60% of power should be coming from renewables.Experts differ on whether we will get to 82% renewable energy by the end of the decade. Ultimately, it is not the key point. We won’t be far away. The goal is to get there as rapidly as possible while maintaining support for the transition by managing reliability and costs – and the impact on nature. There will be few more important projects undertaken across the country over the next five years.With so little focus on climate policy during the campaign, it is worth a brief stocktake of where we are before the new parliament forms.The rollout of renewable energy is being underpinned by a federal underwriting program – acapacity investment scheme– to ensure a substantial amount of large-scale solar, wind and batteries are built as coal plants shut. State schemes also play a role in driving this change.Labor, backed by the Greens and independents, legislated a vehicle efficiency standard,requiring auto companies to sell progressively cleaner new cars. They passed“future made in Australia”laws introducing tax production credits for green industries, including hydrogen, aluminium and critical minerals. They created aNet Zero Economy Authorityto help fossil fuel communities adjust to changes ahead. They overhauledthe safeguard mechanism, a Coalition-era policy applied to major industrial sites.It will be a while before the success of some of these can be properly assessed. In the case of the safeguard mechanism, the first annual results after the revamp were mixed. Total emissions covered by the scheme were down 2% – a change in trajectory from under the Coalition – butmany emitters increased pollution. Some were rewarded with free credits after the department expected their emissions to be even higher. It suggests another overhaul, or at least some closer scrutiny, is warranted.Most of the policies above were promised, or broadly flagged, before the 2022 election. Commitments in this campaign can be listed much more quickly. They basically start and end witha subsidy program for household battery systems.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But we have some clues.‘Enormous opportunity’: how Australia could become the Saudi Arabia of renewable energyRead moreWhile it doesn’t talk about them much, Labor began work before the election ondecarbonisation plans for six sectors of the economy: electricity and energy; transport; industry; agriculture and land; resources; and the built environment. It says they will be linked to an overarching net zero plan. A national climate risk assessment and adaptation plan is also in the works.A long-promised 2035 emissions reduction target is now due by September, following advice from the Climate Change Authority and its irrepressible chair, former New South Wales state Liberal MP Matt Kean. The authority’s preliminary assessment last year was that an emissions cut of between 65% and 75% below 2005 levels “would be ambitious andcould be achievable if additional action is taken”. It tells us that new policies will be needed, and probably sooner rather than later.Later this year we will learn whetherAustralia will secure the rights to host the Cop31 major climate summit. If it does, it willbring tens of thousands of delegates to Adelaidein November next year, and is likely to lead to increased international scrutiny on the country’s biggestcontribution to the climate crisis– its still-expanding fossil fuel export industries.There will also likely be an early focus on the environment portfolio, where Albanese has again promised Labor will create a national environment protection agency and rewrite conservation laws afterboth were dropped last term. The prime minister has indicated he wantsthe policy work to start from scratch– possibly under a new minister if Tanya Plibersekmoves to a new portfolio.With so much still to be decided on both the climate crisis and nature, Labor has a rare opportunity to move boldly in the name of governing from the centre. Surveys have repeatedly found that the average voter would back more ambitious action. After a landslide election win, and with a progressive buffer in both houses of parliament, there will never be a better chance to shake off old impasses and deliver it.

Time for Keir Starmer to appeal to Britain’s best sideMon 5 May 2025 09.45 EDTLast modified on Mon 5 May 2025 11.50 EDTShareReform UK’s ascendancy to power has at times felt like watching the cliched slow-motion car crash: a wounded Tory party, the rise of rightwing populism across the globe, a damp squib of a Labour government, then – bam! – staggering local election wins accompanied byNigel Faragegrinning on the morning news.Except, rather than it being a soft collision, you could be forgiven for feeling some whiplash. With the full picture of Thursday’s results now in, one thing is clear: just seven years after forming out of the bones of Ukip and the Brexit party, Reform has had a sweeping victory across large swathes of English councils. Farage’s party gained almost 650 council seats, taking control of ten local authorities.In the coming weeks, there will be plenty of time for postmortems on how exactly we got here – the decades-long political and economic failings that have enabled a party whose selected candidates havecompared black people to “savages”andpraised Hitlerto get a hold on the levers of government.We should talk about all of it, the uncomfortable and the shameful: from big tech’s place in spreading misinformation and conspiracies, to the role of the BBC in platforming Farage over the years (while relegating the Greens), to ever-plummeting living standards and the seeming lack of interest of the major parties to raise them.And yet, for now, as we watch the map turn an ominous shade of turquoise, I can’t stop my mind from going over the comments Farage was making on the days running up to the elections.Asked at a press conference about the rising number of children with special educational needs and disabilities, and what could be done to help them,Farage replied: “It’s a massive problem. I have to say, for my own money, when you get to 18 and you put somebody on a disability register, unemployed, with a high level of benefits, you’re telling people aged 18 that they’re victims. And if you are told you’re a victim, and you think you’re a victim, you are likely to stay [a victim].”Reform UK to resist housing asylum seekers in its council areas, chair saysRead moreFarage’s comments on trans people and the recent supreme court ruling were comparatively measured (“an outbreak of common sense”, he called it on X), but the niggling unease such views foster among progressives is the same. Each nasty reactionary comment by Reform followed by the reward of an electoral gain feels as if it eats away at a diverse and decent society, pulling back hard-won tolerance while validating the worst prejudices. It is a dread that many of us will have felt over the last few days: that there is an ugliness infecting our politics – and an increasing chasm between the country we want to be, the country we actually are and the politicians we elect.Such ugliness is no longer merely rhetoric. Hours after former Conservative minister Andrea Jenkyns became the new Reform mayor of Greater Lincolnshire with a victory speech arguingtents are “good enough”for asylum seekers to live in, Farage pledged that Reform-run councils and mayoralties willblock asylum seeker accommodation.Local elections traditionally act as an unofficial referendum on national politics – a rare chance for voters in Wirral to “send a message” to Westminster. As the one-year anniversary of Labour’s landslide on the promise of “change” approaches, it is not hard to see that the conditions are ripe for cynicism, anger and protest. More and more people – already reeling from a decade that gave us austerity, Brexit and Partygate – are becoming deeply disillusioned not only about the state of Britain but about politics as a means to improve it. If you have no hope of getting on the housing ladder, your wages don’t cover the weekly shop or you live in pain but can’t even get a GP appointment, the lure of rightwing populism’s simple answers to complex problems is almost rational.This is only exacerbated by the fact that the positive things that Labour is doing for low-income voters – say, the employment rights bill and the rise in the minimum wage – are mentioned so rarely by ministers you would think they were state secrets. That in his first speech since the local elections, Keir Starmer chose to speak not about the cost of living crisis at a supermarket or waiting lists at a hospital but about Ukraine at a drone-manufacturing facility was a clear enough symbol of what led many voters to put their cross next to Reform.Here is the good news. Evidence consistently shows that the British public is progressive – and becoming more progressive still – in their attitudes on issues such as asylum and immigration,homosexuality,industrial action, andabortion.If Labour learns the correct lessons from the local elections, it will tell a story about the country that reflects this spirit, and launch a policy agenda that rebuilds hope and trust – from investment in public services, supporting disabled people into jobs rather than cutting their benefits, bold housing pledges and a fully fundedchild poverty strategyto making the case for safe and humaneasylum routes.The alternative is aLabourgovernment tacking ever further to the right, trying to beat populism by mimicking it.

But, as we report today, the data we need doesn’t seem to existLayla Moran is chair of the health and social care select committee and MP for Oxford West and AbingdonMon 5 May 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 5 May 2025 13.06 EDTShare“The NHS undoubtedly saved my life, butsocial carehelps me live it.” That is what a participant at a roundtable event on social care told me recently.Last October, the health and social care select committee I chair resolved to investigate the cost of successive governments’ inaction on reforming adult social care. Of course, the human cost to individuals in terms of unfulfilled lives is a weighty moral argument – reason enough in itself to reform the sector, as the government has promised to do, starting with anindependent commissionled byLouise Casey.But we set out to calculate something different. There are economic costs resulting from the desperate situation in social care: unmet care needs hinder individuals from being able to work, study, acquire skills and participate in the economy, with all the resulting costs to the Treasury through the loss of potential tax receipts and the costs to theNHSif physical or mental health issues result. So rather than producing yet another hand-wringing report on the state of the sector, or suggesting reforms and wading into an estimation of their costs, we decided instead to flip the lens and ask a simple question: what is the current economic cost of not doing any reform at all?Unfortunately our report,published today, does not conclude with an accurate figure – the bill to the country for not fixing the social care system. That’s because, despite our best efforts, we were frustrated in our aim by a serious lack of official data.Let’s unpack why this is important. We probably all know someone affected by the broken social care system, but when the Treasury says: “No, we can’t – that’s too expensive”, there is a cost to that too – to individuals, their carers, the sector, the NHS and the wider economy.And it’s the Treasury that most needs convincing. We spoke to Sir Andrew Dilnot, who knows more than most on this subject. After all, he also led a government-backed social care commission. That was 14 years ago. The recommended reforms then received royal assent – twice. But they were never enacted. Reflecting on the reasons for this, Dilnot told us that one of the critical tasks for the Casey commission will be getting through the Treasury “nexus”.For the Treasury to grasp the economics of this, it needs to know the pounds and pence of what the failing system is costing – very often in other areas of government.We were made aware of the impact of inaction on the people who need care, and heard how financial pressures are forcing local authorities to “care ration”, resulting in some people receiving only the most basic level of care, far from enough to enable them to live fulfilling lives. How much does it cost to find hospital beds for people who could have avoided engaging with the NHS at all if they’d received timely and effective social care at home? How many millions are missing from the exchequer because carers have quit their jobs to look after loved ones at home When we looked for answers, we found large gaps in the data.The biggest cost of inaction is clearly with unpaid carers. More than 4 million unpaid carers provide care for their loved ones, sometimes to the detriment of their own health and wellbeing, their employment and education opportunities. This costs the Treasury through loss of tax receipts as people have to give up work and withdraw from participating in the economy. There are increased demands on the NHS, as carers’ health may suffer, and on the necessary benefit payments to support low-income households. Young carers, missing more than a month’s worth of school every year, are distinctly affected. But the picture there is partial: there is only emerging data on the total lifetime costs to a young carer and the resulting knock-on costs to the Treasury.The Guardian view on social care: while politicians dither, those in need suffer | EditorialRead moreConversely, high-quality care can give people fulfilling lives and can also have economically beneficial outcomes. There are many examples of projects successfully delivering effective and life-enhancing adult social care, and we were lucky to be able to visit some of them. On a visit toCare in the Garden, a not-for-profit organisation supporting people with additional needs on the Isle of Wight, I was moved by the written testimony of a young man: “I am not a burden on society. I have so much to give,” he said. But once again, the government itself does not have figures on the beneficial outcomes of high-quality care, and this is a problem, because without such figures, how can it assess which interventions would result in the highest returns? How can it make a convincing case to the Treasury for these interventions?The lack of adequate data was a problem we found across all the areas we looked at. There is no official data on the number of hours of care needs going unmet. There is no official estimate of how much delayed discharges are costing the NHS, let alone the eventual costs of people’s care if they deteriorate while waiting for discharge.We heard about high levels of poverty among workers in the care sector and are keen to quantify that. Between 2017 and 2020, 19.6% of the residential care workforce drew onuniversal credit and legacy benefits, according to findings by the Health Foundation, twice the rate for workers in other sectors. But when we asked the Department for Work and pensions for the current figure, they could not give us an answer. In too many areas, there just isn’t the information.The good news is that there is wide acceptance of the need for reforms. Now what’s needed is strong and sustained public and political support to guarantee their longevity and the buy-in from the Treasury. For this, the government needs better, more comprehensive and joined-up data. Without this, the committee fears that the Casey commission will bedoomed to fail, leaving everyone continuing to suffer under the current unsustainable system.Because while we may not be able to quantify it in financial terms, we do know that the cost of inaction is high indeed.Layla Moran is chair of the health and social care select committee and MP for Oxford West and AbingdonExplore more on these topicsSocial careOpinionNHSHealthLiberal DemocratsLouise CaseyLayla MorancommentShareReuse this content"

You could write to your dad – it only costs a stampStephen BatesThe reaction to the prince’s BBC interview highlights his error in thinking he is anyone’s priority. Time for a reality checkMon 5 May 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 5 May 2025 05.28 EDTShareWas the timing deliberate? It did seem so as Prince Harry backed into the limelight once again last Friday evening with hisextended lament to the BBCabout the fact that he and his wife and children had beendenied taxpayer-funded security protectionby a wicked establishment if ever they choose to visit Britain again.In the great scale of world events, or even of the royal family, Harry’s private security needs are probably not near the top of anybody’s priorities, but they were enough to knock the local election results and even the picture of a grinning Nigel Farage off Saturday’s front pages.But if he thought his latest intervention was going to change minds at Buckingham Palace or effect the reconciliation he claims to want with his father, though not apparently with others like the queen or his brother, he has surely got another think coming.View image in fullscreenSunday People front page, 4 May 2025.The interview – the latest in a string of complaints emerging at regular intervals from Harry and Meghan’s home in Montecito – is likely to be filed alongside previous interviews, documentaries andhis book Spare. We have heard such complaints before, several times over. His trouble is that the family firm, the UK media and most of the public – insofar as they think of his plight at all – have given up on Harry. If he wants reconciliation, he needs better PR and less megaphone diplomacy.The spark for his latest grievance comes as the rest of the royal family and the nation prepare to celebrate that moment in UK history which gave the country something to be proud about: its role 80 years ago in the defeat of Nazi Germany. It will be a commemoration of service, duty and unity, with parades, fly-pasts and civic celebrations, which Harry will miss despite his own military service.At the interview in a private house (not his own) in California, the prince, who gave up royal duties five years ago and moved to America’s West Coast, complained, as if it were the most important thing, that he was a victim. That he was being discriminated against by the UK establishment for being, well, a prince: “My status hasn’t changed. It can’t change. I am who I am.” And he implied that the shadowy forces that had had it in for his mother were out to get him too. The old discredited conspiracy theory lives on in his brain.Harry said he wants to reconcile with his father, who might be dying of cancer for all he knew, but could not get hold of him “because of the security stuff”. He would not bring his family to Britain because of their vulnerability to attack in a country which is somewhat safer than the West Coast, or indeed Ukraine, which he has recently visited. He said: “If anything were to happen to me, my wife or my father’s grandchildren…look where the responsibility lies,” and last night, possibly coincidentally,Meghan published a photographof her husband holding their son Archie’s hand and carrying daughter Lilibet on his shoulders.The prince thought King Charles might have intervened, or at least stepped aside, to allow a proper review of his safety needs from a body other than Ravec – theRoyal and VIP Executive Committee– which reviews the security of vulnerable public figures and contains a staff member from Buckingham Palace. As the judges in Harry’s latest court case about the decision toremove protectionpointed out on Friday, his complaint has been examined several times and found groundless.Prince Harry says king ‘won’t speak to him’ and he would ‘love’ to be reconciledRead moreMore to the point, despite whatever constitutional training he ever received, the fifth in line to the throne does not seem to realise that his dad cannot intervene even in what are technically his own courts to get a favourable outcome for his younger son. That’s the sort of thing Donald Trump might try.Pragmatically, instead of revelling in victimhood, Harry and Meghan might reflect that if they turn up for official events they will get protection. If they turn up privately to stay with friends, the British public will remain blissfully unaware of their presence or even location.For now, all the palace can do is keep calm and carry on, albeit with exasperation. If Harry really wants reconciliation, he could always write a private letter. He knows where his father lives.Stephen Bates is a former Guardian royal correspondentDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Both Tories – and Labour – need to rethink hard and fastMon 5 May 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 5 May 2025 13.52 EDTShareIt takes real effort to kill a political party that has been around for nearly 200 years and is the most successful in Britain’s history. But at the very least, this version of the Conservative party is dead. To quote the famousMonty Python dead parrot sketch, it has ceased to be. It is an ex-party. Inlast week’s local elections, of the 16 councils it was defending, the Conservative party lost control of every one of them. It won just one of the six mayoralty contests. The BBC’s projected national vote share for the Conservative partywas just 15%. It’s another record low for a party that has spent the last several years achieving record-low vote shares in national elections. This is a pathetic performance for a party often described as the natural party of government.The party has no winning majority in any age group of voters other than those over 70. This is no basis for a successful electoral strategyAnd it was all so predictable. I’ve lost count of the articles I’ve written for the Guardian warning that the party’s “Reform-lite” strategy of trying to out-Reform Reform would lead to failure and electoral disaster.Back in July 2024I described it as an existential moment that required change. “Do or die,” as I put it. The party chose not to change – with fatal electoral consequences.Unlike in the past, it’s not as simple as waiting for the pendulum to swing back towards the Conservative party. There is no pendulum. Arguably, there is no such thing as a core voter any more. Those days of predictable votes in predictable places are gone. In today’s Britain, voters act the way they do as consumers. If they vote for a party that fails to deliver on its promises, then they simply choose a different one the next time an election comes around. And why not? Why should political failure be rewarded? Yet this losing version of the Conservative party, with its blinkered, ideological, culture-war preoccupations and entitlement syndrome, has failed to grasp this crucial change.What voters see is a Conservative party with no authentic sense of purpose or mission, and a Labour government that seems not have thought realistically about what its tax and spend agenda would be until after its landslide general election win last July. It’s no wonder voters have cast around for alternative political parties. Voters supported a Labour party selling “change”. Now, in the absence of seeing a sufficiently ambitious plan to deliver change on the ground, many are attracted to a party titled Reform.There are those who would castigate these Reform voters’ political choices, but they would be wrong. Instead, we should understand just how fed up millions of people are with the status quo in this country. These voters feel they’ve heard it all before from the two main parties. Grand promises, rhetoric – but then nothing changes.View image in fullscreenConservative party leader Kemi Badenoch and shadow environment secretary Victoria Atkins, campaigning on 28 April 2025.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PAIs this the end of two-party politics? The Conservative party had better hope so. Otherwise it has an even bigger problem, because for a party with no distinct, authentic purpose any more, our two party politics – driven by a first past the post system – means theConservativesare squeezed out of contention almost everywhere: in the south and south-west England by a LabourLiberal Democrat or Lib Dem-Reform run-off; in the north by a Labour-Reform run-off; in the wider UK by the presence of independent parties.In a sense it’s a healthy challenge for the Conservative party now, as it is for Labour. Both parties need to up their game. But the Labour party at least has the platform of government to show it can deliver. For the Conservatives, the challenge is existential in nature. This version of the Conservative party is finished as a political force in our country. For the first time, even a change of course may now not be enough to improve its fortunes. The party’s joyride down its political cul-de-sac has not just been a flash in the pan. It has been a long one – over the best part of a decade. The local election results prove beyond doubt that it has now reached a political dead end.Farage claims Reform UK local election gains ‘beginning of the end’ for ToriesRead moreIn a very literal sense. Political nature has taken its course. The party has attempted to be a “mini-me” version ofReform UK, and unsurprisingly Reform voters prefer the real thing. And this strategy’s consequential alienation of Conservative-leaning centre-ground voters has seen them head off to either the Lib Dems or Labour, or to the Green party. The party has no winning majority in any age group of voters other than those over 70. This is no basis for a successful electoral strategy for the longer term.Perhaps the Faragian Reform-party bubble, akin to the Johnsonian Conservative-party bubble, will also spectacularly burst when its powerful but simplistic political rhetoric is confronted with the more complex problems of the real world. Perhaps the populist revolution that both parties have fuelled will eat both its political children, not just the one. Yet the driver behind it – inequality of opportunity and the unacceptability of Britain’s endemically weak social mobility – will remain. Future policy solutions will still be required.But for now, all that the present generation of Conservative leadership can do is to own up to their abject failure. They should have the humility to admit that their strategy has been catastrophically wrong. It’s quite a political epitaph: to have essentially killed the Conservative party. But in creating this version of it, they may well have done just that.Justine Greening was the Conservative MP for Putney from 2005 to 2019Explore more on these topicsConservativesOpinionReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

As record numbers of trials stall and costs soar, it’s time for us to ditch this relicMon 5 May 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 5 May 2025 08.35 EDTShareAre the middle ages about to end? We all know Magna Cartaset the principle that justice delayed is justice denied. These days, outmoded Britishjudicial systemsamount to precisely such a denial of justice, playthings of a legal profession supremely confident of its perfection. No aspect of these systems is more superfluous than juries. There is no conclusive evidence they are more “just” than systems based on judges in the rest of Europe – or in non-jury courts in Britain.As of September 2024, a record 73,000 trials in England and Wales are, like A&E patients,waiting their turn in a bureaucratic corridor. In March, a trial of a man alleged to have been threatening members of the public with a machete waspostponed for three and a half yearsto 2028. According to a 2023 report by the charity Rape Crisis, on average adult survivors of rape in England and Wales face a wait of 787 days from reporting to case completion in court – with many victims and survivors waiting much longer. They note that the picture hassignificantly worsenedsince their report, with the latest available criminal court statistics from the Ministry of Justice revealing that the number of sexual offences waiting to go to the crown court is now 11,981 – a record high and an increase by 41% in two years.A consequence is that the number of rape victims in England and Wales withdrawing prosecutions before trial hasmore than doubledin the past five years. Sexual crime has therefore become like shoplifting, in effect de-criminalised. Meanwhile, 20% of people in prison in England and Wales are as yetuntried and on remand, a third of them for over six months.This is totally unjust. Nobody cares. Britons love their prisons.To the present government’s credit, it has asked a retired senior judge, Brian Leveson, tofind answers to the delay, and he is due to do so. One expected reform is that Britain should join the rest of Europe and end, or drastically curtail, the jury system. Already only 1% of criminal cases in England and Walesculminate in trial by jury.We could conclude that we need not bother. But the cost and delay of jury trials are enormous, and assembling 12 jurors (15 in Scotland) and countless officials day after day often results in trials being postponed. I have served as a juror three times and it was the most maddening waste of time and money in public service. None of it was really about justice, more about participating in an archaic legal ritual.The United States is equally devoted to juries – thanks to its British colonial past. There the result has been twofold. One has been accusations of racial bias and savage punishments, the other is a soaring number of settlements negotiated by prosecutors out of court as defendants aim to avoid the uncertainty of juries.The latter now embracesan astonishing 98% of US criminal cases. Such justice is secret, which raises different issues of personal freedom.Some jury trials may be scrapped in England and Wales as court backlog hits record highRead moreThe “right to a jury” is a hangover from a medieval entitlement to judgment by one’s “peers” over the whim of an unelected manorial lord or other authority. Today, a criminal trial tends to depend overwhelmingly on scientific analysis or, in fraud cases, on technicalities of finance. Leaving this to groups of amateur strangers is absurd, their reasons for ever secret. Anyway, if they make a mistake, the judge can overrule them. Last year’s intriguing Channel 4 docudramaThe Jury: Murder Trialhad two juries emotionally but plausibly debating the same real-life case and reaching different conclusions. It should have led to the death of juries on the spot.Courtroom drama is undeniably exciting, but inevitably distorting. I can see that to a barrister, it is their professional showcase, a theatre. The Old Bailey is its West End. Like all good drama it has hovering over it the climax of retribution, here in the form of prison. In other civilised countries, where experts administer justice, the purpose of denying the guilty their freedom is their rehabilitation. In Britain it is merely punishment, which is why reoffending is so rife.The ever increasing criminalisation of public activity merely adds to the problem. Politicians can hardly let a month pass without creating another criminal offence. Hate and offence crimes are current favourites, along with causing “nuisance” and committing strenuous protest. Almost anything done in the driving seat of a car is potentially criminal. Water bossesare apparently now to be imprisoned– I can hear the cheer. As for online crime, the law has barely begun.Defenders of the jury system are almost exclusively barristers, which unfortunately means a disproportionate number of MPs. They rank with doctors and academics as fierce defenders of their traditional modes of work – more powerful than any trade union. The profession embraces fine people, but their purpose was defunct centuries ago.Juries are supported by a few middle-class philanthropists who enjoy jury service as a version of “doing good among the poor”. We do not let them dissect bodies in an operating theatre or decide how to design a building. Perhaps a minority of cases may depend on public taste, but that must be truly tiny.Leveson was a radical – or tried to be – inreforming the press. If he has the guts todo the sameto his own profession he will have a tough job with his fellow lawyers. But at least this time he has two potent allies: a system that is clearly collapsing and a chancellor desperate to curb public spending.

In Friedrich Merz, it is getting a chancellor whose instincts are to divideChris ReiterandWill WilkesMerz takes charge this week, as German industry buckles and social fractures deepen. He will struggle to bring a wary public with himMon 5 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 5 May 2025 05.30 EDTShareAfew weeks before Germany’s federal election in late February, Friedrich Merz was forced to backpedal after adaring gambit went awry. His attempt to win votes by forcing through a hardline crackdown on migration had caused a rebellion in his own Christian Democratic party (CDU). Instead of positioning himself as a strong leader, he undermined the entire German political establishment.Merz’s strategy involved breaking a taboo by relying on far-right nationalists to pass legislation for the first time in Germany’s postwar history. The move fractured the country’s normally consensus-driven centrist parties in the Bundestag,sparked mass protestsand led to arare public rebukefrom the former chancellor and CDU leader Angela Merkel.Despite the backlash, Merz stuck to his trademark swagger and refused to back down from setting a disturbing precedent. His onlynod to regretwas admitting he would have liked to have seen a different result. This is the man taking the reins of Europe’s central power, and the continent has cause for concern.The 69-year-old conservative will be sworn in as chancellor on 6 May, at a moment of profound reckoning for Germany. The postwar promise ofWohlstand für Alle(prosperity for all) is slipping away, with soaring inequality anda fifth of Germansfacing poverty or social exclusion. Beyond the enduring east-west divide, new fractures split secure professionals from the precarious working class, old from young, urban from rural, homeowners from renters. Roads and railways are crumbling, digital infrastructure is behind the times and the education system is struggling to equip a shrinking workforce for the demands of an evolving economy.The country’sindustrial base is bucklingunder high energy costs, outdated technology and suffocating bureaucracy. The once dominant car manufacturers are reeling, caught between their own hubris and growing competition from China. Donald Trump’s trade wars have turned the economy’s dependence on exports into a glaring vulnerability, while Vladimir Putin’s aggression is forcing Germany to confront the threat of war.Against this backdrop, the anti-Europe, pro-Russia Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party hasdrawn levelwith Merz’s CDU-led bloc in the polls, shattering the comforting illusion that Germany’s past had insulated it from the siren calls of nationalist populism. Germany’s domestic intelligence agency last weekdesignatedthe AfD, which is now the biggest opposition party, a “confirmed rightwing extremist” force.Faced with these challenges, Germany needs a unifier who can rally a divided nation with vision and purpose. But instead of a figure like John F Kennedy, who motivated the US withplans for a moonshot, it is getting an operator closer to David Cameron. Merz’s failed migration bill finds an echo in the former UK prime minister’s fateful Brexit gamble. Both politicians tried to harness nationalist, populist causes and lost control. The difference is that Merz still has time to change course, though his record offers little reason for optimism.In the weeks since winning the election, the incoming chancellor has swung wildly back and forth. After flirting with the AfD on the migration crackdown, he took a harder line against post-election cooperation with the far-right and offered concessions to win over the Social Democrats for a governing coalition.After campaigning on fiscal restraint, Merz made an abrupt U-turn on debt financing by hastily pushing constitutional reforms with the Social Democrats and the Greens tounlock hundreds of billions of eurosin borrowing for defence and infrastructure. While changes to Germany’s restrictive debt brake had been long overdue and were cheered by European allies, the sudden move was viewed with scepticism at home and contributed to pressure from conservative allies, who worried that Merz was giving too much ground to the centre-left Social Democrats. He has responded byvowing to squeeze spending, mainly at the expense of Germany’s most vulnerable groups.Trained as a corporate lawyer, Merz has never run a state, a ministry or even a district council. Known for being petulant and prickly, he gave up on politics after Merkel blocked his path to power, only returning to grasp his opportunity in the vacuum she left behind. But even then, it took himthree attemptsto secure the leadership of the CDU.Rather than building bridges, Merz has often widened divides. In 2000, when he was vying with Merkel for control of the Christian Democrats, he proposed the concept of a GermanLeitkultur– which literally means “leading culture” – and called on migrants to conform to a set of core traditions to truly belong.In late 2023, he revived that debate. In trying to imbue the vague term with meaning, Merz suggested thatbuying a Christmas treewas part of being truly German – excluding Jews, Muslims, Hindus and secular Germans in the process.It wasn’t a slip of the tongue. The man from rural Sauerland in western Germany has called migrant children “little pashas”, accused Ukrainian refugees of “welfare tourism” and claimed that foreigners abuse Germany’s health system “to get their teeth redone” – an allegation so inflammatory that it drew a public rebuttal from the German Dental Association.His reputation and recent actions have Merz limping towards office, with an approval rating of just 36% – between the leftist Heidi Reichinnek and the AfD co-leader Alice Weidel, according to a recentBildpoll.Far from being a knockout blow to the advance of the AfD, its classification as extremist risks playing into the party’s anti-establishment narrative. The reaction from the Trump administration – secretary of state Marco Rubio called the German intelligence agency’s move “tyranny in disguise” – underscores how fraught transatlantic relations have become.To turn things around, Merz needs to find his feet fast, show that he can be the chancellor for all Germans and chart a path towards the future. With his debt-fuelled spending package, he has the resources at his disposal. But aside from boldly proclaiming that “Germany is back” on the world stage, he has made little effort to sell the plan to the public or set out goals and objectives. That needs to change, and a bold reset of the social contract is needed.The reality is that Merz’s funding plan is Germany’s moonshot, but so far it lacks a launch pad and a destination. The country won’t have access to these resources a second time and the new chancellor needs to make it count. Otherwise, the AfD will find itself with a clearer path to power. By appealing to populist sentiments and deepening divisions withinGermany, Merz may inadvertently empower a more radical political shift, much as Cameron did in the UK.Chris Reiter and Will Wilkes are the authors of Broken Republik: The Inside Story of Germany’s Descent into Crisis.

But theelection resulthas reminded us of what cuts across age and sits in our national core. That deep-seated Aussie reaction: “yeah-nah, that’s a bit much” when things go too far. We’re allergic to imported bravado, anything too loud, too messianic. And, when pushed, we don’t shout – we shrug.This election was one long shrug. A rejection of chaos and division, not through fury but through an assertive, ballot-powered recoil.I’ll admit: I expected more of a fragmented youth vote. Labor couldn’t count on all young peoplevoting progressive. Young voters don’t fit neatly into left or right. I’ve long argued that grouping 18-year-olds with 45-year-olds under a single “youth vote” umbrella never made much sense. Yes, there are shared concerns – housing, inequality, job insecurity, climate change – but the fault lines of gender, geography and ethnicity are real.Australians have soundly rejected Trump-style culture wars. Now Albanese must act with courage and vision | Julianne SchultzRead moreSo I worried it wouldn’t be all about numbers. Like many, I fussed about how young (male) voters mightpull awayfrom Labor and risk a hung parliament. Instead we saw a decisive vote for stability in the face of underwhelming national pitches and overwhelming global uncertainties.Young Australians aren’t animated by performative politics. Their concerns are deeply material – rents, wages, the price of groceries, a system that no longer delivers. While some have speculated that Donald Trump has fuelled a gender divide among gen Z men, my analysis of the Australian Election Study (1996–2022) suggests something more nuanced. Yes, gen Z men are more conservative than gen Z women – but they’re stillmore progressivethan older generations of men. And, when it comes to actual vote choice, gender differences mostly disappear. It appears that this election is a nod to that finding.Trump has also proved to be political kryptonite for Australians, especially younger ones. AMarch 2025 studyfound that Australian voters between 18 and 44overwhelmingly reject Trump-style leadership– with just 23% saying Australia would benefit from a leader like Trump and 58% saying absolutely not.But Labor should not take the wrong lesson from this result – that a win is a mandate to keep the status quo, which is clearly failing younger Australians. If Labor wants to keep their support, it needs to see the warnings wrapped up in the win. Voters – especially young ones – are crying out for action on the big structural problems: housing supply, intergenerational inequality, flatlining productivity.And Labor’sblind spotsare showing. A refusal to ban gambling ads, despite overwhelming public support. No meaningful move to lift people out of poverty, despiterepeated advicefrom its own experts. Silence on the Uluru statement of the heart in the wake of the referendum defeat. No scrutiny of Aukus, even as Trump jeopardises our alliance. These aren’t side issues for young Australians – they’re central to the kind of future they’re being asked to vote for.The election result should not be used as proof that young voters are some homogenous progressive bloc, or that they’ve thrown their weight behind a steady two-party system. The electorate is increasingly fluid, willing to swing whichever way the moment demands. Labor read the room better this time but it was the electoral environment – the campaign, the global chaos and the aversion to populism that shaped the result. The rise of the crossbench, the Greens’ stable primary vote despite seat losses and movement in inner-city seats across Victoria and Queensland all signal that shift.Finally, we should remember and acknowledge the role compulsory voting plays in keeping young people tied to the system and having a say in the future they’ll inherit. Just look at Brexit: when young people sit out, history happens to them. In Australia, they help write it.Dr Intifar Chowdhury is a youth researcher and a lecturer in government at Flinders UniversityExplore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025OpinionLabor partyHousingClimate crisisAustralian politicsYoung peopleInequalitycommentShareReuse this content"

But have some become just too seedy? Our writer checks inOliver WainwrightMon 5 May 2025 11.09 EDTLast modified on Mon 5 May 2025 11.24 EDTShareDo whales make you horny? How about UFOs? Maybe you’ve always dreamed of having a tryst in a fairytale castle, or making love inside a gigantic biscuit tin? Whatever your weird fantasy may be, it can probably be catered for on a roadside somewhere in Japan, ifa new bookon the curious phenomenon of love hotels is anything to go by.French photographer François Prost has been on a 3,000km pilgrimage of passion, driving from Utsunomiya, north of Tokyo, to the island of Shikoku in the south, to document Japan’s unique architecture of furtive liaisons. What he found spans from manga-embellished motels and Christmas-themed love nests to pastel-hued stage sets worthy of Wes Anderson. And some things stranger than your most eccentric kinks could dream of.Some of the reviews don’t inspire confidence. ‘I found a pillow with dried semen,’ reads one“I find love hotels culturally fascinating,” says Prost, whose previous projects have included photographing thefacades of strip clubs in the USandnightclubs in Ivory Coast. “Japan is generally a fairly conservative society, but these are places of escapism, fantasy and almost childlike wonder. And you find them everywhere.”Estimates vary, but some put the number of love hotels – orrabu hoteru– in the country as high as 37,000. They pop up in city centres and rural villages, at busy highway junctions and secluded among fields in the middle of nowhere. As Prost’s photographs show vividly, they come in all shapes, sizes and stylistic genres.View image in fullscreenSea Stork Hotel, Machida, Tokyo prefecture, 2023.Photograph: François ProstSome are modelled on castles, topped with pink crenelations and turquoise turrets. Some look like alpine chalets, others like tiki huts, while plenty are modelled on cruise ships, promising to take you on a voyage to love paradise. Whether French chateaux get your juices flowing or you have a penchant for Arabian onion domes, there’s a place waiting for you to be greeted by an anonymous receptionist, pay for akyukei, or “rest”, and live out your carnal dreams.While most of the buildings in Prost’s book date from the 1960s onwards, the Japanese love hotel has its origins as far back as the 1600s. They began to emerge during the Edo period, in the form of discreet establishments known asdeai chaya, or lovers’ teahouses, where couples could meet away from the prying family gaze.They looked like regular teahouses from the outside, but were designed with secretive entrances and multiple exits, and – crucially, for a shoes-off-at-the-door society – somewhere for customers to hide their footwear so as not to be identified.View image in fullscreenWorthy of Wes Anderson … Hotel Flower Style in Nara.Photograph: François ProstBy the early 20th-century Shōwa era, these teahouses had transformed into themed, colourful places that offered a sense of escape from the daily routine. Japan’s postwar economic boom saw love hotels blossom into elaborate sexual amusement parks in the 1970s and 80s, with themes ranging from fairytale to sci-fi to medieval cosplay.The country’s high population density, small apartment sizes and tradition of living at home until marriage helped fuel the appetite for places for people to meet in private. Some have also put love hotels’ continuing success down to thesexual liberation of women in Japan, sometimes highlighting the cute, cartoonish nature of the decor – designed to feel safe and inviting, rather than tacky and sordid.Quite different from seedy pay-by-the-hour motels elsewhere in the world, love hotels aim to cater to everyone. In his 2005 book,Law in Everyday Japan, legal scholar Mark D West estimated that Japanese couples make more than half a billion trips to love hotels each year, suggesting that as much as half of all sexual intercourse in Japan could be taking place in these establishments. In turn, that would mean that a good deal of the country’s population were conceived on a rotating bed, in a beshackled boudoir, or inside a fantastical tropical grotto surrounded by model dinosaurs.View image in fullscreenHotel LaLa Resort, Kobe, Hyogo Prefecture.Photograph: François ProstProst’s photographs don’t take you inside the bedrooms (there are other books for that), but instead focus on the exterior iconography of the hotels. Far from fading into the background, they stand as loud roadside billboards, designed to be easily identifiable by libidinous couples at a glance from a moving vehicle.Who could miss the Hotel Artia Dinosaur, which rises on the corner of a highway intersection in Machida city near Tokyo, crowned with a huge T rex? A tableau of a Jeep being crushed by a velociraptor at the entrance sets the tone. Online reviews warn that the bedroom doors lock automatically once you’re inside, and you have to call reception to be let out – a feature common to love hotels, but here adding an extra frisson of danger, in tune with the Jurassic Park-inspired theme.Or might you live out your Moby-Dick fantasy at the huge pink concrete whale of Hotel Festa Qugiela, in Okayama, which waits ready to swallow you inside its grinning mouth? Or embrace the kinky King Kong spirit at the LaLa Resort in Kobe? It features a massive gorilla climbing up its bright red and orange-striped facade, and a model tiger keeping watch over the underground car park (a common feature so punters can be shuttled directly to their rooms).View image in fullscreenHotel UFO, Chiba Prefecture.Photograph: François Prost“The hotels are often designed so you don’t have to cross paths with anyone else,” says Prost. “You can go straight from your car into a lift going up, and there is always a separate lift to go back down, to avoid bumping into people. A lot of the hotels don’t even have receptionists any more – you book online, or choose your room from an automatic vending machine.”The faded decor and tatty appearance of many of the establishments makes you wonder if love hotels are becoming a thing of the past. A lot of them have the forlorn look of semi-abandoned amusement parks, with flaking paintwork and sun-bleached signage. And some of the online reviews don’t inspire much confidence.Who could resist the lure of Shibuya’s Sweets Hotel, a pink battenberg fantasy dripping with huge slices of cake, cookies and plastic icing? It turns out those aren’t the only treats on offer. “I found a pillow with dried semen,” reads one review. “The walls and doors were covered in scratch marks,” says another, “more fitting for a murder hotel than a love hotel.” “This place is gone now,” adds the most recent entry. “Too bad.”View image in fullscreenChapel Christmas, Narita Chiba PrefecturePhotograph: François ProstDespite some seedy failures, Prost says that love hotels are still just as popular as ever, and they are evolving to keep up with changing habits. “Nowadays, many young people go to love hotels to have parties,” he says. “They have karaoke machines, big TVs, massage chairs and hot tubs – people rent them in groups for a few hours.”TheBali An group, for example, offers big rooms forjoshi-kai, or girls’ nights out, complete with bars, 75in TVs and eight-person beds. The rooms also come with hammocks and camping equipment. After castles, cruise ships and cartoons, glamping appears to be the latest love hotel design trend, so you can sample the romance of the great outdoors without venturing outside.Love Hotelis out now.

It has a power that’s beyond us. We’re just the vessels’Interviews byRich PelleyMon 5 May 2025 10.29 EDTLast modified on Mon 5 May 2025 12.16 EDTShareCrispian Mills, singerIt’s not our song; it’s as old as the hills. The first time I heard it was in a Krishna temple as a kid. George Harrison was the first person I know of who recorded it – it’s the last track on 1971’sThe Radha Krsna Temple album. We were all living together as a band in Swiss Cottage, London, and that record got played all the time. So I had it absorbed.The first time we played our version was at Glastonbury festival in 1993. We’d smuggled ourselves in, in the back of somebody’s van, then blagged our way on to the stage in the Hare Krishna free food tent, which seemed appropriate. The arrangement with the droning chords and the chant in the middle pretty much happened on the spot. We continued to play it every night at every show for two years until we got a proper record deal.It’s not just a song: it’s a doorway into thousands of years of tradition with the promise of spiritual adventureIt’s one of those songs that continues to evolve and surprise you however many times you play it. It’s not just a song. It’s a doorway into thousands of years of tradition, woven with philosophy, ontology and history encapsulating the promise of spiritual adventure.We’re still discovering things now, because of the song’s origins. You have to have a mood of service towards it because it belongs to the world. It’s one of those songs where the band are getting as much benefit as the audience.As for the lyrics: Sanskrit is often called “the language of the gods”. Why on earth would you not want to try that in a pop song? Govinda is one of the “intimate” names of God, which translates as “reservoir of pleasure”. On the whole, any of the names with the prefix “Go” (meaning “cow”), like Gopal or Govinda, glorifies Sri Krishna’s youthful time as the divine cowherd, who protects the cows, plays his magic flutes in enchanted forests and steals the hearts of heavenly milk-maidens.It always got a reaction live. There was never a beige response. One of the turning points was when we were touring our debut album, K, to a sold-out show in Blackburn in front of 2,500 people in various states of intoxication with their arms in the air, singing this ancient spiritual folk song. I thought to myself: “God, we’re not in control of this, are we? This has got a life of its own.” It was the perfect, miraculous convergence of sublime and ridiculousness, and that’s what pop music should be.Alonza Bevan, bassistWe were playing around the north London Camden scene but also going out to the West Country and playing to a very different, often very hippy crowd. Our drummer is from near Glastonbury, so if we could play Glastonbury Assembly Rooms alongside some psychedelic sitar player, we’d jump at the opportunity.We’d always loved the hippy music of the 60s and 70s, and had been equally fascinated by Indian classical music and eastern mysticism. A friend introduced us to the Bengali musicians who ended up playing on Govinda, who were a Hindu family from east London.Govinda always feels fresh. We always finish live sets with itWe worked with John Leckie, who had produced the first Stone Roses album and before that, this brilliant psychedelic record by the Dukes of the Stratosphear. The verse is repetitive but we’d been listening to the George Harrison version for months, so it was quite easy to get down. There’s lots of the tambura – the four-string sitar from Indian classical and folk music that gives the droning sound – and the tabla (the hand drums) all over the record. We had to remember that we were still these whitey westerners, laying down our groove.It was great to get a song that’s entirely in Sanskrit on Radio 1, although I think most people saw it as one of those gimmicky songs. I remember people at early gigs shouting the lyrics as: “Go cash your giro giro.”Some old songs you get tired of playing live, but Govinda always feels fresh, so we always finish live sets with it. It has a power that’s beyond us; we’re just the vessels. All we have to do is play and let the universe do the rest of the work.Kula Shaker are performing atChalfest, Stroud, 18-19 July, andLakefest, Eastnor Castle, 6-10 AugustExplore more on these topicsPop and rockHow we madeHinduismReligionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Trump appears partly motivated byChina’s decision to limit imports of Hollywood filmsas part of its tit-for-tat trade war with the US, but a quota system into North America would appear, on the face of it, to be unworkable. Films are no longer manufactured objects that have to pass through a port of entry into the US, and their nationality of production is far from clear. Most film production – and indeed TV shows – are a complex patchwork of corporate investment, globally sourced labour and multinational revenue. Some are tiny, hand-to-mouth operations, others are gigantic behemoths whose turnover dwarfs the GDP of a minor island nation. Added to which, the digital evolution has allowed it to become a fully globalised industry that moves too fast to allow the imposition of consistent financial levies.1:04Donald Trump announces tariff on movies from 'other nations'  – videoHowever, Trump’s target does not appear to be foreign films per se, but rather the outsourcing of production by Hollywood studios who for decades have used overseas studios and locations to lower costs as well as take advantage of interesting or unusual backdrops. To take some random recent examples: the new Tom Cruise film Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning was mostly shot in the UK, at Longcross studios in Surrey and the Lake District, but also in Malta, Norway and South Africa, as well as an American aircraft carrier docked in Italy. Marvel’s new superhero blockbuster Thunderbolts* was filmed in Atlanta Georgia, but a key scene took place at Merdeka 118, a skyscraper in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and its score was recorded at Abbey Road studios in London.Revenue plays a large role in Hollywood thinking. While North America (comprising the US and Canada) remains the biggest single market,with around $8.8bn(£6.6bn) in box office takings in 2024, it is dwarfed by international income of around $21.1bn. It is capturing a significant proportion of this that has geared Hollywood to its internationalist thinking, from shooting in locales and casting actors designed to appeal to specific audiences, to continent-hopping global roll-outs with large-scale premieres taking place in different cities across the world.So the questions are being asked: what would make an individual movie incur tariffs? If it is released in cinemas (in which case expect a wholesale shift to streaming)? Would it include streaming releases (in which case a wholesale rebranding as “TV shows”?) And what would actually be taxed? Could an American-produced, (mostly) British-shot film such as Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire really incur import duty? Would distributors of non-American films have to pay a levy to release them in the US? In any case, if a film shows on streaming, consumers don’t pay directly to watch it, but for a subscription to a platform, so the idea of targeting an individual film’s streaming revenue appears meaningless.More pragmatically, Trump appears to be taking aim at the system of tax subsidies that allow Hollywood producers to accrue large sums if they shoot at studios in qualifying countries. It was recently revealed, for example, thatUniversal Studios received £89m from UK taxpayersafter agreeing to film Jurassic World: Rebirth in Elstree in Hertfordshire. This partly explains the decline in film production in Los Angeles – nearly 40% in the last decade, according to FilmLA – but the California film industry has also been under attack from other production centres in the US, where states such as New York and Georgia offer tax incentives. California governor Gavin Newsom, a regular target of Trump, recently announceda $750m schemeto try to reverse the industry decline in his state, and Trump’s announcement was in some ways clearly a shot across his bows afterNewsom filed a lawsuit in Aprilagainst Trump’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA) to impose tariffs in other industries.The current thinking is that Trump’s most realistic optionis to levy a tariff on any financial packages a film receives from a foreign government, rather than tax cinema tickets or streaming subscriptions. However, the effect of any tariff is likely to be dramatic.Recent figures from the British Film Institute (BFI)show that in 2024 £4.8bn($6.37bn) of production spend on film and high-end TV in the UK came from international sources, 86% of the total spent on film and TV made in Britain. In Australia,the film industry stands to lose up to AUS$767m.A programme of studio building in the UK, designed to increase capacity and therefore revenue, is likely to feel the chill almost immediately. And the effect on the domestic industry in the US is forecast to be adverse, as production costs rise without the injection of overseas tax incentives, with mid-level projects potentially wiped out.But whether,as Newsom suggests, this is all a “distraction”, or if this announcement turns into something more solid, a shocked film industry is waiting to find out.Explore more on these topicsFilmFilm industryTariffsDonald TrumpTrump tariffsanalysisShareReuse this content"

If only they hadn’t wheeled out a naked old woman …Lucy ManganMon 5 May 2025 17.00 EDTShareWell, here’s a tricksy little proposition! What happens when you give a television studio audience a prize pot of £250,000 to share equally among themselves, then tell them that all they’ve got to do to get it is remain silent (any words, gasps, laughs, exclamations will lose them £5,000 or £10,000, depending on the size of the transgression) while the show throws various acts at them precisely designed to elicit such responses?You get Silence is Golden, that’s what – an unexpectedly entertaining, unexpectedly nerve-jangling foray into the repression of all natural instincts in the face of relentless temptation. Presenter duties are in the safe hands of Dermot O’Leary, who both introduces the guests (the main ones in the episode available for review are comediansKatherine Ryan, Seann Walsh and Fatiha El-Ghorri) and tries to trick the audience – who are individually miked and being monitored on cameras – into making the usual whoops and cheers that typically accompany such a show.Is it a rip off of Prime Video’s hit Last One Laughing (comedians trying to make each other laugh in front of Jimmy Carr), the UK’s adaptation of Documental, the Japanese hit created by Hitoshi Matsumoto? Or is it a wholly coincidental invention arising from our universal understanding that an injunction against laughing in church is the fastest way to ensure we do just that? We may never know.Australian comic, singer and drag artist Reuben Kaye is the first challenge to the audience’s quarter-of-a-million-pound crown, and his act is near the knuckle enough on several occasions (he says “My erection is audible” as he stands in front of a handsome bloke who does very well to keep his counsel) to draw £30,000 worth of gasps and laughs).He also identifies the weak link – possibly the weakest link there’s ever been in the history of gameshows – in the audience. That weak link is called Will. Will likes to laugh. Will, it becomes clearer and clearer, was born to laugh. If you concentrate on making him laugh, he will laugh. If you concentrate your attentions elsewhere, he will laugh. He costs the audience a fortune. They are – silently, but very powerfully – livid. Dermot wonders if they should start looking for a security escort to take him home. Will laughs. Will shouldn’t.Fortunately, the group’s focus is pulled from this threat to their finances by a new set of villains: those who shout out in response to Dermot’s offers of cash and gifts to enrich themselves personally at the expense of the group’s pot. Absolutely fiendish. Chief fiend is Lorenzo, who does it multiple times and looks unfazed by his decisions and the fact that if looks could kill, he would have been bleeding out in the aisle before he had finished the first “Yes, please!” and pocketed the inaugural £200. I haven’t seen the like sinceNasty Nick made his move25 years ago (yes, sorry) in the first series of Big Brother. It’s quite thrilling in a way. A way that suggests I need to get out more, or that the next series of Traitors needs to hurry up and get here because I have appetites that need slaking.Ryan does some comedy, but her main turn is threatening a couple’s dog. The couple remain silent, knowing there is no chance that a TV production will let anything happen to their pet. I mean no disrespect to the mighty Ryan here, but I have absolutely no doubt that if the cameras were not there, or if Ryan’s own personal finances were involved, that dog would be in a sandwich the moment the first £5,000 was lost.The final segment identifies the strongest (Deborah) and the weakest (Will, obviously) performer in the audience and one is randomly selected to face the final challenge – but it’s Will. The remaining prize money is frozen and he will win or lose it all for the group if he can just survive one minute of jokes-and-anything-else-that-might-work onslaught from previous acts. No spoilers, but Lorenzo – you’d better start sleeping with one eye open.I’m not a big fan of the bit where they bring on a naked old lady to try to winkle out laughs or exclamations of disgust as she makes her way into the audience, but other than that it’s all good, clean, harmless fun. Probably. No, I’m sure Lorenzo will be fine.Silence is Golden is on U&DaveExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionDermot O'LearyKatherine RyanreviewsShareReuse this content"

It was 1996, and Hanks (her initials stand for Elizabeth Ann), had recently left her mother, Susan, to go to live with her father, the actorTom Hanks, in Los Angeles. “Things between my mother and I were at an absolute low point,” she says. The drive, she remembers, from California – long hours on the road, her mother chain-smoking and listening to Christian rock music, stopping only to eat and sleep – was “three awkward, silent, painful months that would end up with us in Florida”. It is not clear what the point of the road trip was – though Hanks met members of her mother’s family for the first time in Florida – but then not many things were clear with Susan.In 2019, nearly 20 years after Susan died, Hanks took to the same road, Interstate 10, in an attempt to make sense of her mother’s life. This forms the basis of her memoir, The 10. “I had no idea where my mom grew up, or how she grew up, or who was around. All I knew is that she never spoke of it,” says Hanks. “It always had this tinge of southern gothic drama and violence.”Hanks’s childhood had been abusive and neglectful; her mother had at times left her without food or clean clothes, and when she was 13, punched her in the face for no apparent reason. Susan, who had also been an actor and used the stage name Samantha Lewes, was a cocaine addict and mentally ill (not diagnosed, but Hanks writes that her symptoms led her to believe she had bipolar disorder). She also knew almost nothing of her mother’s family. When Susan became ill with cancer, none of them visited her, and none went to her funeral.View image in fullscreenHanks with her father, Tom, in 2007.Photograph: Patrick McMullan/Getty ImagesYears later, going through Susan’s belongings, she found a journal. In it, Susan makes an accusation against her own father that Hanks describes as “an absolutely hellacious crime of sexual assault, murder and cannibalisation of a young girl”. It was so overblown that it seemed unbelievable – this was also the woman who heard the voice of God, and thought her ex-husband had installed men in the walls of her house to spy on her.“I was increasingly aware that my mother’s mental health was precarious and, as her life went on, was devolving into a state of utter paranoia and delusion,” says Hanks. “But my mom’s stories always had a grain of truth and I think when I read the journal, something about this felt resonant. If this is the type of trauma that my mom experienced in her youth, her life makes a little bit more sense to me.” From her father, she borrowed a van – a Ford Transit, affectionately known as the “Shit Box” – packed a typewriter (an appreciation she shares with her dad), researched how to survive on the road, and went in search of answers.Hanks, who will be 43 this month, had become a journalist after university, living in New York City and working for the Huffington Post, “where I was living on a four-hour news cycle, and was essentially working in an HTML sweatshop. I stumbled out the other end in my late 20s, with the beginnings of an ulcer and absolutely no creative process whatsoever.” She moved back to LA in 2012, and did various jobs, including working as a personal assistant and in bookshops. Out with friends of friends, she made them laugh – when we speak over Zoom, Hanks has the articulacy and wry humour of her father – and they offered her a job writing jokes for a TV show. She started creating scripts for shows and films, “that were, thank God, never going to get made”, but it rekindled her love of writing.View image in fullscreenHanks’s parents, Susan and Tom, at the premiere of the 1984 film Splash, in which her father starred.Photograph: Bei/ShutterstockInspired by that 1996 road trip, she pitched her idea of recreating it as an investigation into American politics that would take her from the Democrat-stronghold of California, through Texas and the deep south, to Trump’s Florida. “No editor was interested in that story from me.” She laughs. “Just not the right writer, not the right voice. Basically, [The 10] starts off as a magnificent failure of a magazine piece.” Then it became personal.As Hanks was hoping to uncover the facts behind the mystery of her mother’s life, and her grandfather’s potential crime, she was also trying to get to grips with the truth behind the US’s mythology at a time of growing danger. (She never mentions him by name, but the other man who lurks in the book’s shadows is the current US president. The first time Trump was inaugurated, Hanks writes, she spent a rainy day at Disneyland, a place of consolation as much as celebration for her, Hollywood child that she is.)The places the Interstate 10 passes through, she says: “the south-west, Texas and the deep south, are really doing the heavy lifting in the myth of American exceptionalism – manifest destiny, cowboys and Indians, the ‘gallant south’ – these are at the root of our most pernicious, glamorous and dangerous building blocks of American exceptionalism.”The US she journeys through is extremely beautiful (the deserts, forests and swamplands) and brutal. She sees the best of the country – to Hanks, that’s New Orleans, with its culture defined by its people – and the worst. The vast emptiness of the landscapes isn’t a fact of geography, she points out, but “because we killed 90% of the Indigenous population in a single generation. It’s not empty, it’s a crime scene.”In Mississippi, she visited the Confederate flag-lined estate of Jefferson Davis, who was the first and only president of the Confederate States between 1861 and 1865. The estate is now a museum and Hanks listened to a guide with disgust. “We’re still debating what the civil war was about,” she says. “Is this a war about states’ rights, or is this a war about being able to own human beings?” It made her think about the similarities between personal and political trauma, even if the stakes are wildly different – that one way to deal with it, maybe the only way, is to face it. “You can’t move on from something like the civil war if we can’t even agree on what the facts are,” she says. “That’s why we’re still stuck in it.”View image in fullscreenWith her father in Paris in 1994.Photograph: Arnal/Gamma-Rapho/Getty ImagesWhen Hanks was about five, her parents split up and Susan took Hanks and her elder brother, Colin, to live in Sacramento. She writes about a house full of cigarette smoke, the fridge empty and a back garden too full of dog’s mess to play in. Sometimes, when Susan disappeared for a night or two, Colin would have to look after his sister. Friends’ parents banned their children from having sleepovers at her house, not least because: “The one time a kid did, we found a loaded gun in the box where we kept the television remotes.”When did she realise her home life wasn’t like other people’s? “I think when I was really young I had a language for my mom as an addict which is, I guess, the plus side of what happens when your mom hosts multiple 12-step meetings in your living room.” There were often people with addictions at the house, which was frightening to a child. “I did not have an understanding of why my mom heard the voice of God and why she felt empowered to be in conversation with him in public, no matter how people around her responded.”When Hanks was older, schoolfriends started to notice that she was often without a packed lunch, or that she would ask the teacher for food, or her hair wasn’t brushed and her clothes were dirty. “And let’s not talk about how often I went to the dentist.” Sometimes her mother could be wonderful – she introduced Hanks to classical music, important films and books. She let the teenage Hanks dye her hair, and she drove her around the state to the horse shows in which she competed. The switch between good times and bad was unsettling. It would have been easier, thinks Hanks, if her mother had just picked a side.There was also the wild swing between life with her mother and life with her father, with whom she would spend some weekends and most school holidays, in LA or on film sets (she had a small part in Forrest Gump, the 1994 hit that won Tom his second Oscar). “It was like visiting a bizarre planet occasionally,” she says. Tom Hanks was at the very centre of a booming Hollywood in the 90s. In the family, she says with a laugh, there was “what Colin and I call BG and AG – before Gump and after Gump”.In Sacramento, it was quiet, usually just Hanks and her mother, who would often be chain-smoking in bed and reading the Bible. At her father’s house, it was full of “assistants, and the phone was always ringing, the doorbell always ringing”. And there was family – her two younger half-brothers, and her stepmother, Rita Wilson, and usually many members of Wilson’s extended family. “It’s family dinner and three meals, and suddenly I have to do my homework, which was not something [my mom] cared about,” says Hanks. She remembers going to the Oscars – she thinks it was the night her father won for Forrest Gump – and then going back to Sacramento, where her mother, unable to face cooking, would feed her fast food most nights, and thinking: “My life is not what it was last weekend.”View image in fullscreenHanks … ‘I’m still letting my mom go, and also choosing what parts to keep.’Photograph: Mathew AndersonTo Susan, her ex-husband’s immense success and fame was “catastrophic”, writes Hanks. In Susan’s view, she says: “It obliterated whatever chance she had at an artistic path, a career as a great stage actress.” But for her father, too, fame has been a kind of catastrophe, “in that it obliterates his humanity. He doesn’t get to be a fully rounded person with his own version of good days and bad days. He can only be Tom Hanks, and people lose sight not only of his personhood, but also, I think, his artistry. It just becomes a brand.” In Sacramento, however frightening: “The one thing that I had is that I was growing up in anonymity, with privacy, mostly before the internet, and certainly before the heyday of the tabloid industry that was documenting the lives of the ‘daughters of …’ I got to skip all of that.”As a child, she remembers feeling deeply embarrassed on behalf of the people who became so starstruck and emotional around her father – these days, he’s not just the Hollywood Everyman, but America’s Dad. “As I got older, I changed how I feel. I think I have a much deeper respect for what is happening for those people in that moment, which is that they are recognising a true friend. It’s a one-sided friendship, but I don’t think I can question the genuine nature of what is playing out on their face, the joy they have in recognising someone.” For those in their 20s and 30s who grew up with Toy Story – the main character, cowboy Woody, being voiced by Tom Hanks – it’s especially true. “I would argue, and I know that my dad would agree, that Woody is his great artistic legacy. If you can be cynical about a grown person who instantly transforms back into that child when they hear [his voice], you’re a sharper person than I am.” She adds with a smile: “I also think you get a little older and you’re, like: ‘Oh, that is why I don’t have college debt, so let’s respect it.’”When she was a child, her father knew what her home life with her mother was like, but despite trying, says Hanks, he did not have custody of his children. “While my mom was a scary and physically threatening presence who pushed, and pulled hair, and locked me in closets and used food deprivation as a tool, she was not someone who, up until that point, was hitting me.”View image in fullscreenEA Hanks (right) with her father, her stepmother, Rita, and her half-brother, Truman Theodore Hanks at the Oscars in 2020.Photograph: UPI/AlamyThen, one night when Hanks was 13, seemingly out of nowhere, her mother dragged her across the room, and punched her in the face. “It wasn’t until that happened, and we had evidence of assault that I was able to leave.” But Hanks had always felt the threat of violence. “It’s a lifetime spent on very thin ice, and you’re aware of every step you take, and the threat of pushing someone from it being a good day, into it being a bad day. You get very agile with good jokes, changing the subject.” As an adult, it led to “emotional distance, discomfort with intimacy”.By the time she took to the road, with her mother’s death nearly 20 years in the rear-view mirror and years of therapy, Hanks had reached a degree of peace. It is probably not a spoiler to say her book does not have a neat Hollywood ending, this being real life, but Susan emerges as someone who was failed by the culture she grew up in. As in 1996, her mother was her travel companion – she brought along Susan’s journal and a white binder full of her poetry, some of which she includes in her book. Some of her writings are rambling and alarming, her illness on the page, but some of her poetry is lovely. “I think anybody who’s buried a loved one knows that feeling when the two-way conversation suddenly becomes one-sided,” says Hanks. “To engage with her on that level, in good faith as her editor [Susan wrote multiple drafts of her poems], was like entering back into conversation with her.”Six months on the open road gave Hanks the time and space to think about her mother – not just the sadness of her life, and the damage she did, but other things too. “When someone’s been dead for 20 years, you forget. Were my mom’s eyes hazel? What did her voice sound like? What was that recipe that I really enjoyed that she made on the rare occasions she cooked? It was remembering that 20 years on, I’m still letting her go, and I’m also choosing what parts to keep. That is something that the book gave me – to remind me that I’m still my mother’s daughter.”In the UK, theNSPCCoffers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000.

What has she learned?Kate MossmanMon 5 May 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 5 May 2025 06.40 EDTShareYoung musicians have so little to say. Give me a rocker in his later years any day. Ask him about his childhood, his relationship with his mum, his painful lifelong love affair with his lead guitarist. Many belong to a specific anthropological group: born after the war, they got their first guitars on hire purchase and went on to date the aristocracy. They became my specialist subject as a journalist: it was impossible to resist the combination of vulnerability, extreme oddness and sharp business nous I found in so many, while others were living in strangely compromised circumstances despite years of deathless hits. I was particularly drawn to those who had continued a career under the radar, or who had slipped under it but hadn’t quite noticed.It was a strange subject to pursue, but always a labour of love – because on some level, I felt a strange identification with these “cosmic dads” of rock’n’roll. The obsession has culminated in a book, Men of a Certain Age. Here are 10 things I learned in the course of writing it.They’re victims of dental crimeAccording to guitaristJeff Beck, the rock star’s distinctive “egg-timer” face (sunken cheeks, faintly simian) was the result of bad 1960s dentistry and a teenage lust for sweets. A man on a flying horse would be hard-pressed to pull Beck out of a lineup with Ronnie Wood, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. He was the inspiration for Nigel Tufnel from Spinal Tap and his stage gear was designed by Hilary Wili, who did the costumes for Downton Abbey. (“She still finds time to stitch me something.”) With their little legs, narrow hips and mysterious “proceeding” hairlines, rockers often look like pickled versions of the boys they were when they first picked up a guitar.Their mindsoperate on a militaristic scaleGreg Lake, talking about Emerson, Lake & Palmer’s biggest gigs, once told me: “I’ve never seen so many people together in one place, apart from in a war.” Paul O’Neill, of the US prog outfit Trans-Siberian Orchestra, claimed to have walked in disguise among his audience before a show in Germany like Henry V before Agincourt. There he met two Sunni Muslims from Iraq and, 90ft away, two Shia Muslims from Iran: “God forbid, two years from now, they end up in two different militias and recognise each other,” he told me. “They would unchamber their weapons and say, ‘Hey, weren’t we at a TSO concert together?’” Many US rockers see themselves as quasi-political figures, ambassadors of western might.View image in fullscreenPlaying for peace … Greg Lake of Emerson, Lake & Palmer.Photograph: Ilpo Musto/REX/ShutterstockThey’re self-made menThis is why Sting is beloved in America. He grew up in the shadow of a 10,000-tonne ship in the docks of Wallsend. One was built and launched every year, a constant cycle of constraint and departure. TheQueenMother attended one of the launches and waved at him from her car. He told himself: “One day, I’ll be on the inside of a car like that.” His father was a milkman, and Sting and his brother would be at the dairy at 4am. The class divide between him and his bandmate Stewart Copeland, son of a CIA diplomat, fuelled much press in the early days. “I developed no accent,” he told me. “Now I only speak Geordie when I’m angry – and I can speak it well.”Their wivesmake sure they behaveRock wives correct mistakes, monitor manners and oversee the business side of things. Gene Simmons claims to have slept with 4,600 women. By the time I met him in Moscow, he was married to Shannon Tweed, a former erotic-thriller actor known for her work in Meatballs III. She was there at the table, flicking through Time magazine. Gene talked about the postwar British diet, citing faggots (lowgrade meatballs) in gravy. Tweed read a definition of faggots from her phone in a slow, Beverly Hills voice: “A bundle of pieces of iron or steel to be welded, rolled or hammered together at high temperature.” “It’s a question of semantics,” said Gene. “Though I’m not anti-semantic.” She told him to finish his porridge. “You’re burping while talking,” she added. “I was?” he said. “At least I didn’t fart.”View image in fullscreenBehind every great man … Gene Simmons and Shannon Tweed.Photograph: DMI/The LIFE Picture Collection/ShutterstockThey like to mock themselves“You find the truth by ridiculing yourself,” Johnny Rotten told me. Punk is the most exhausted story in pop music but Rotten speaks in strange, fresh phrases, as though he’s found a way to keep himself interested. “Vivienne’s clothes were always awful,” he volunteered of Westwood. “All those zips – she had no concept of men’s dangly bits.” Shaun Ryder was similar, spectacularly engaged for someone so blasted by drugs, and strangely amused by the interview and portrait process. His hair had recently fallen out after testosterone injections for an underactive thyroid – head, eyebrows, chest and nethers. He could have been self-conscious, but he made it part of the act as he peered at the photographs and said: “I look like Uncle Fester.”They pine for the sheepskin rug daysRock stars are from another age, when journalists and musicians hooked up on sheepskin rugs and wrote features together in blissful, claret-fuelled symbiosis. After four days with the Soft Machine exile Kevin Ayers in Carcassonne, he made a little bed up for me in his large, empty house. Later, as his manager explained that no romance was to take place, I heard a brief crashing of pots and pans. It’s a shame this all sounds a bit #MeToo in hindsight. It really wasn’t.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

From the late 1960s on, it was a male domain, and male journalists were often at pains to compete with them and disguise their admiration, making statements such as: “Let me tell you why your second album tanked.” Time and again, I have seen relief on the face of a rocker as I enter the room, a loosening of the shoulders. He would then tell me things he wouldn’t tell a man, probably thinking: “Ah, it’s just a girl!”They long to play their new stuffBruce Hornsbyhad a big hit in 1986, The Way It Is, and found a way to live well off it by allowing lucrative cover versions by various rappers, most notably Tupac Shakur. These helped finance his life of bluegrass, jazz and atonal pointillism in the concert halls of middle America. “Look, if you really hate it, don’t come back,” he said of this new material. “You shouldnotcome back, because I am not going to be a vehicle for your stroll down memory lane.” I love these figures who found a way to play only the music they wanted. Jeff Beck was asked to join the Stones once, but told me: “I wouldn’t have been my own master – and that would be my wholebeingtruncated.”View image in fullscreenWill not truncate his being … Jeff Beck.Photograph: Robert Knight Archive/RedfernsTheylove a rivalryThe artist formerly known as Terence Trent D’Arby, nowSananda Maitreya, made plenty of records but struggled to listen to them. His exit from the industry, after his second album flopped, was too painful to recall. Yet like all the best rock stars, he knew the value of his story and exaggerated his musical rivalries. Claiming that Lenny Kravitz was a “cheaper model” of himself, he announced: “Record companies say, ‘Hey, if you likethisasshole, you’re going to likethisasshole, plus we’re making a higher margin onthisasshole!’” I even found a poem on his website to his old nemesis. It was called Lenny K and read: “Fear not / Your girls are safe! / I’ve got an Italian girlfriend now / And my leash is pretty short.”Men of a Certain Age by Kate Mossman review – close encounters with charismatic male rockersRead moreTheir feelings are easily hurtQueen were always suspicious of journalists, ever since the NME ran a piece about Freddie Mercury with the headline: “Is this man a prat?” I chose a clumsy moment to ask Brian May why the press hated Queen: he was trying to swallow a piece of goat’s cheese. “I don’t know,” he winced. “Why don’t you ask them what their problem was?” Sitting in his dressing room, Paul Stanley ofKissput it like this: “The press’s dislike of Kiss was so out of whack, so out of proportion, you almost have to look at someone and go, ‘Who beat you as a child?’”Kate Mossman is senior writer for the New Statesman.

The huge success of “burlesque parody” The Empire Strips Back suggests that, yes, there just might be.Created in Australiaand since performed globally, the show recasts scenes and characters from a galaxy far, far away as sexy strip-and-dance numbers, stylishly lit and slickly performed to a banging pop and rock score. If you like the sound of Boba Fett bumping and grinding to Guns N’ Roses, or Han Solo and Chewbacca getting jiggy to the Backstreet Boys – well, these are the droids you’re looking for.What makes the show stand out is the fidelity of its design, its unofficial status notwithstanding; and its sense of humour. The scenes you’ll remember are the funny ones – Jabba the Hutt rapping, anyone? – or at least, those that put a cheeky spin on the original material. See a scantily clad female Luke Skywalker seeking warmth in the belly of her disemboweled tauntaun, or C-3P0 being undressed, rather than disassembled, by two busybody Jawas. There’s a once-seen, never-forgotten number (you may sense a great disturbance in the Force) featuring a naked Emperor Palpatine and a mirrorball shaped like the Death Star.View image in fullscreenPretty good fun … The Empire Strips Back, performed in Las Vegas.Photograph: Denise Truscello/Getty ImagesThe set pieces are freestanding, and between them, MC Pete Anderson jollies things along fan convention-style, soliciting the audience’s R2-D2 impressions and bestStar Warstattoos. Anderson too clarifies the distinction between striptease and burlesque, the latter of which (he claims) is empowering, not creepy. It’s hard not to notice that it’s mainly women being empowered in The Empire Strips Back, whose male cast members alone end the show fully clothed. But if it’s not striking a Rebel Alliance-like blow for freedom, The Empire Strips Back is at least striking one for pretty good fun.AtRiverside Studios, London, until 17 AugustExplore more on these topicsStageBurlesqueCabaretComedy (Stage)Star WarsComedy (Culture)Science fiction and fantasy filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

He wore a sweater over a white collared shirt and grey slacks, which the judge had allowed rather than jail clothing. Combs, 55, has been held in a grim federal lockup in Brooklyn since his arrest last September. His hair and goatee were almost fully gray because dye isn’t allowed in jail.Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs faces new criminal counts alleging ‘forced labor’Read moreUnlike other recent high-profile celebrity trials, Combs’s court case won’t be broadcast live because federal courtrooms don’t allow electronic recordings inside – meaning courtroom sketch artists serve as the public’s eyes in the courtroom.The trial is expected to take at least eight weeks. If convicted, he faces the possibility of decades in prison.Several prospective jurors indicated they had seen news reports featuring a key piece of evidence in the case: a video of the hip-hop mogul hitting and kicking one of his accusers in a Los Angeles hotel hallway in 2016. One prospective juror described a still image she saw from the video as “damning evidence”. That woman was rejected from consideration.After another juror was dismissed, Combs asked for a bathroom break, telling the judge: “I’m sorry your honor, I’m a little nervous today.”The 17-page indictment against Combs – which reads like a charging document filed against a mafia leader or the head of a drug gang – alleges that Combs engaged in a two-decade pattern of abusive behavior against women and others, with the help of people in his entourage and employees from his network of businesses.Combs and his lawyers say he’s innocent and any group sex was consensual. They say there was no effort to coerce people into things they didn’t want to do, and nothing that happened amounted to a criminal racket.Prosecutors say women were manipulated into drug-fueled sexual performances with male sex workers that Combs called “freak offs”. To keep women in line, prosecutors say Combs used a mix of influence and violence: he offered to boost their entertainment careers if they did what he asked – or cut them off if they didn’t.And when he wasn’t getting what he wanted, the indictment says Combs and his associates resorted to violent acts including beatings, kidnapping and arson.

The executive, Steve Stoute, later asked prosecutors to go easy on Combs, who pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and took an anger management class.Later that same year, Combs was stopped by police after he and his then girlfriend, Jennifer Lopez, fled a nightclub where three people were wounded by gunfire. Combs was acquitted of all charges related to the episode at a 2001 trial, but a rapper in his entourage, Jamal “Shyne” Barrow, was convicted in the shooting and served nearly nine years in prison.Then in 2015, Combs was charged with assaulting someone with a weight-room kettlebell at the University of California, Los Angeles, where one of his sons played football. Combs said he was defending himself and prosecutors dropped the case.Explore more on these topicsSean ‘Diddy‘ CombsHip-hopRape and sexual assaultNew YorkUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

The UK is among the countries offering film-makers generous tax incentives.1:04Donald Trump announces tariff on movies from 'other nations'  – videoThe US president said he had already ordered the commerce department and the US trade representative to begin instituting such a tariff. He said on his Truth Social platform the issue was a “national security threat” because of the “concerted effort by other nations” to attract productions.“Hollywood is being destroyed,” he later told reporters. “Other nations have stolen our movie industry.”His outburst caused immediate concern in the UK, a regular location for some of Hollywood’s biggest movie productions, including Barbie, parts of the Mission: Impossible franchise and Disney’s Star Wars productions. More big movies are scheduled to be shot in the UK soon, including Star Wars: Starfighter.Philippa Childs, the head of the creative industries union Bectu, said: “These tariffs, coming after Covid and the recent slowdown, could deal a knockout blow to an industry that is only just recovering, and will be really worrying news for tens of thousands of skilled freelancers who make films in the UK.“The government must move swiftly to defend this vital sector and support the freelancers who power it, as a matter of essential national economic interest.”One senior figure in the British creative sector said: “If it becomes real, it will be huge. It could possibly wipe out the British film industry and its crews.”Trump’s movie tariffs are designed to destroy the international film industryRead moreThe international feature film production spend in the UK was £1.9bn last year, with high-end TV production bringing in £2.8bn. Investment from the US on filmsincreased 83%from the previous year.Adrian Wootton, the chief executive of the British Film Commission, said the announcement was “clearly concerning” but said it was crucial to know more about the details of the plans.“We will be meeting with government and our industry policy group in the coming days to discuss further,” he said. “The UK and US have long enjoyed a strong, shared history of film-making.”Senior politicians are calling for Keir Starmer’s government to prioritise the UK film industry in US trade talks, though sources have already told the Guardian that a deal is asecond-order priorityfor Trump.Caroline Dinenage, the chair of the culture, media and sport committee, said: “Last month the committee warned against complacency on our status as the Hollywood of Europe. President Trump’s announcement has made that warning all too real.“Making it more difficult to make films in the UK is not in the interest of American businesses. Their investment in facilities and talent in the UK, based on US-owned IP, is showing fantastic returns on both sides of the Atlantic. Ministers must urgently prioritise this as part of the trade negotiations currently under way.”James Frith, a Labour member of the committee, said any tariffs on UK film production would be self-defeating.“Any US tariffs on foreign-made films would harm not just British jobs and creativity but also the US studios and audiences who rely on our skilled workforce and production expertise,” he said. “It is in everyone’s interest to protect this deep, highly successful partnership.”Industry insiders said it was unclear how the tariffs would work in practice, warning they would end up penalising US studios and cutting production and jobs.Trump is facing resistance in the US from the likes of Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, whose office said the president had no authority to impose such tariffs.Trump’s declaration was not a complete surprise to industry and government insiders, given his previous declaration that he wanted to help “troubled” Hollywood.Before his inauguration, he appointed Sylvester Stallone, Mel Gibson and Jon Voight as “special ambassadors” charged with bringing back production lost to “foreign countries”.Film and television production in Los Angeles has fallen by nearly 40% over the past decade, according to FilmLA, a non-profit that tracks the region’s production.Trump’s move could also be a reaction to a decision by the China Film Administrationin Aprilto “moderately reduce the number of American films imported”, in response to US tariffs on China.Trump’s attack on the film industry is a sign of xenophobic contempt | Jesse HassengerRead moreStephen Galloway, a former editor of the Hollywood Reporter, said: “There is a gigantic problem, which Trump’s social media post addresses, which is that Hollywood has been decimated – there has been a complete flight of production from Los Angeles.“It’s a locomotive that’s going faster and faster and – based on the expense of living and shooting in Los Angeles, and tax breaks and subsidies from different states and other countries, and the strength of the dollar – that all makes foreign production a bargain. There’s an arms race among states and countries to up the tax breaks and subsidies they offer.”Galloway suggested Trump may be acting out of a romantic fantasy, much like imagining that under steel tariffs Pittsburgh could once again become a place of US steel production, when in reality there are now about 5,000 steel mill jobs in the area.“Hollywood is the source of all modern romantic fantasy, but can you restore it to its golden age? No, you can’t,” he said. “Everyone would love to do it, but the invention of the computer chip destroyed Hollywood as we knew it as a film manufacturing hub.“There’s a contradiction between ‘let’s preserve Hollywood as the centre of manufacturing’ and ‘let’s protect ourselves from foreign propaganda’. But if foreign propaganda is a Disney movie that happened to be shot in Pinewood, what kind of propaganda is that?”A UK government spokesperson said: “Talks on an economic deal between the US and the UK are ongoing – but we are not going to provide a running commentary on the details of live discussions or set any timelines because it is not in the national interest.“We will continue to take a calm and steady approach to talks and aim to find a resolution to help ease the pressure on UK businesses and consumers.”Amid confusion over how any tariff could work in the complicated process of movie-making, a White House spokesperson said no final decision had been made on new levies. They said all options were being explored to deliver on Trump’s concern over Hollywood.Explore more on these topicsFilm industryTrump tariffsTariffsTelevision industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Some of the country’s most famous rivers, such as the Severn, feature, but so do unheralded ones such as the Adda in north Wales, much of it forced by humans into culverts.View image in fullscreenThe front cover of Afonydd, a bilingual book of poems about Welsh rivers.Photograph: Arachne PressCherry Potts, the director ofArachne Press, said when the publisher toured Wales withA470: Poems for the Road/Cerddi’r Ffordd, the energy and good humour the book generated made it keen to do another with a Welsh theme.“Rivers came up quickly as the next theme,” said Potts. “We wanted specific poems about specific rivers, not generic descriptions, and we wanted at least some of them to deal with the threats to our waterways.“I think this is the strength of both books – personal responses to identifiable, specific places. You can’t use Afonydd to navigate like you could A470, but I feel like I’ve been to every one of those rivers.”About 400 poems were submitted for consideration and 50 chosen. Of these, 18 originated in Cymraeg (Welsh) and 32 in English. The poems that arrived in just one of the languages were translated into the other. The English and Welsh poems are set out side by side with the originating language leading.The editor and translator, Ness Owen, said: “The submissions really were as varied as the rivers they were inspired by, ranging from the deeply personal to the political, the humorous and the glorious, folklore-filled.”The poet and lavender farmer Rae Howellswrote about Pennard Pill, which flows into Three Cliffs Bay in south Wales.She tends to write in English first and translate to Welsh. “It’s been a brilliant challenge to push outside my comfort zone and use my Welsh in this way.”Howells said some phrases were difficult to translate. “One example is my phrase ‘some nights’, which translates as ‘ambell noson’ but ‘ambell’ means ‘occasionally’ rather than ‘sometimes’, which isn’t quite what I wanted to say, but there is no elegant translation of ‘sometimes’. You have to compromise.”She said Welsh rivers were a brilliant way to tell the story of the country. “Wales is a country of water, of rivers, of brooks and streams and rain clouds and mythical lakes and political reservoirs.“Like the road running down the middle of the country, our multitude of rivers is another powerful image that represents what Wales is about – connection, and people, and politics, and the use of resources, and where history is remembered and legends are made.“A publisher giving equal weight to both English and Welsh in the same volume is actually pretty innovative, and not something you tend to see much of in Welsh publishing, let alone UK publishing, where it feels like Wales is very much kept ‘over there’ and separate.”The book is published on 29 May, but is available for pre-order from Arachne Press. The books are being released to trade next week so bookshops will be able to place orders or take pre-orders.Explore more on these topicsWalesPoetryRiversnewsShareReuse this content"

It attracted an estimated 2.1 million fans to Copacabana beach and had crowds screaming and dancing along.‘Like a religious thing’: free Lady Gaga concert draws 2.1m to RioRead more“They were clearly saying that they were planning an attack at Lady Gaga’s concert motivated by sexual orientation,” Felipe Cury, secretary of the Rio police, told a press conference on Sunday.The Rio police chief, Luiz Lima, said the group disseminated hate speech and violent content online “aimed at gaining notoriety in order to attract more viewers, more participants – most of them teenagers, many of them children”.Even as Brazilian authorities said they arrested suspects in the hours before Lady Gaga’s show, the event went ahead without disruption – leading some to question the seriousness of the threat. Serious security concerns typically lead organisers to cancel such massive events – as happened with Taylor Swift’s concerts in Vienna last year.Police said nothing about the alleged plot at the time in an effort to “avoid panic” and “the distortion of information”.A spokesperson for Lady Gaga said the pop star and her team “learned about this alleged threat via media reports this morning. Prior to and during the show, there were no known safety concerns, nor any communication from the police or authorities to Lady Gaga regarding any potential risks.”The statement added: “Her team worked closely with law enforcement throughout the planning and execution of the concert and all parties were confident in the safety measures in place.”Security was tight at Saturday’s concert, with 5,200 military and police officers deployed to the beach where fans were revelling in the pop singer’s classic hits including Born This Way, which became an LGBTQ anthem after its 2011 release.Authorities arrested two people in connection with the alleged plot – a man described as the group’s leader in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul on illegal weapons possession charges, and a teenager in Rio on child sexual abuse charges. Police did not elaborate on their exact roles in the plot or on how the group came to target Lady Gaga’s free concert.“Those involved were recruiting participants, including teenagers, to carry out integrated attacks using improvised explosives and molotov cocktails,” police said.The Justice Ministry said it determined the group posed a “risk to public order”. It said the group falsely presented themselves online as Little Monsters – Lady Gaga’s nickname for her fans – in order to lure teeangers into “networks with violent and self-destructive content”.During a series of raids on the homes of 15 suspects across several Brazilian states, authorities confiscated phones and other electronic devices. Although police said they believed homemade bombs were intended for use in the planned attack, there was no mention of the raids turning up any weapons or explosive material.Cury said one of the suspects whose home was raided in the city of Macaé, near Rio, “had a religious motivation” and “claimed [Lady Gaga] was a Satanist”.In an Instagram post, Lady Gaga has expressed gratitude for the enormous crowd.“Nothing could prepare me for the feeling I had during last night’s show – the absolute pride and joy I felt singing for the people of Brazil,” she wrote. “The sight of the crowd during my opening songs took my breath away. Your heart shines so bright, your culture is so vibrant and special, I hope you know how grateful I am to have shared this historical moment with you.”Lady Gaga at Coachella review – a thrilling all-timer of a performanceRead moreHer free beach concert stood out at a time of surging ticket prices for live music around the world as concertgoers pay budget-busting costs to see their favourite artists.Last month Lady Gagaperformed at Coachella Valley music festivalin California, where tickets fetched upwards of $600 for one weekend.The high prices of tickets for her upcoming shows in Australia have also attracted criticismlocally.Last May, superstar Madonna also performed on Copacabana beach, playing the final show of her latest world tower for some 1.6 million fans on the sprawling sands.Explore more on these topicsLady GagaRio de JaneiroBrazilAmericasPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

A doubledecker bus suspended above a calm sea bay. A dishevelled middle-aged couple frolicking down a high street, caught in their own private musical. There’s an irrepressible fountain of dream imagery erupting out of Nick Cheung’s fourth feature, which imaginesHong Kongafter the 2008 financial crash as a nightmarish inland empire awash in outrage, anguish and guilt. “Other people’s money!” crows one investor – but the real business here is other people’s dreams.Loose-cannon psychiatrist Dr Man (Terrance Lau) is under censure from his bosses for investigating his patients’ private lives. Maybe it’s his own uneasy dreams that motivate him to trespass, though a new bizarre case gives him added cause to go the extra mile. A narcoleptic taxi driver admitted to hospital after nodding off and veering into the opposite lane, Choi (Nick Cheung) is trapped in a twilight between reality and reverie. Prying into the circumstances once again, Dr Man discovers something even more disturbing at the man’s home: his wife Fiona (Fala Chen), an obsessive shut-in who monitors financial feeds.A Hong Kong industry veteran and Johnnie To bit-player, Cheung has inherited some of that master director’s way with fine-milled visuals; his lambent and baffling headscapes also feel very reminiscent of another maestro, the dear departed David Lynch. Initially presenting these visions in fragmentary fashion, threading between Man, Choi, Fiona and a former psychiatrist (an Andy Lau cameo) who claims to enter people’s dreams, the irrational is the city’s governing force – surfacing both in the nocturnal unconscious and stock-market eddies.The transition to a more conventional narrative shadowing Dr Man’s shrink-cum-gumshoe is a little abrupt, dissipating the film’s oneiric kick. And a stylist though he undoubtedly is, Cheung doesn’t invest heavily enough in a single character to bring the story home. That’s especially clear in the case of Choi and Fiona’s supposedly fateful love affair, wafted along, in a Wong Kar-Wai-esque touch, onthe old-timey strains of Broadway standard Peg O’ My Heart. Instead, somewhat disingenuously Cheung pushes Man’s credo of emotional honesty to the fore. This powerfully textured psychological warren he has lovingly created says otherwise.Peg O’ My Heart is released in cinemas on 9 May.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersDrama filmsHong KongAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

It Feeds is in the latter category, about a shadowy thing whose MO is attaching to people and, per the title, feeding on them. He’ll seem familiar if you’re au fait with the likes of The Conjuring and Insidious, but he is at least neatly realised by the FX team.Heading the human cast is Ashley Greene, known to Twilight fans as peppy clairvoyant vampire Alice Cullen. She is once more tapping into the supernatural here as psychic psychiatrist Cynthia Winstone, who is able to perceive the entity and is terrified of getting involved – although given the demands of the genre, we know that she will have to eventually. Also reporting for duty is former X-Man Shawn Ashmore, playing a twitchy father whose daughter (Shayelin Martin) is seeking deliverance from entity-based longueurs.In 2015, the breakout horror hitIt Followscreeped audiences out via a supernatural game of tag with a shape-shifter whose attentions were sexually transmitted. It Feeds isn’t officially related but, in both its title and the idea of an unknown thing targeting people in a particular sequence, there are echoes. One for the jump-scare crowd, It Feeds is light on gore but heavy on the dark spooky wraith guy with thin, sinister fingers. It may not stick around in your memory with the persistence demonstrated by the entity towards its victims, but it passes the time chillingly enough.It Feeds is on digital platforms from 12 May.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Shot a few months prior to Russia’s full-scale invasion ofUkrainein 2022, Elwira Niewiera and Piotr Rosołowski’s documentary probes this thorny question with a searing intimacy. The film observes an alternative production of Hamlet, which brings together a group of Ukrainian performers from all walks of life and as volatile emotions are spilled on to the stage, performance becomes a conduit for personal catharsis as well as artistic expression.In the film, scenes of the rehearsal process are interspersed with revelations about the actors’ backgrounds. Many of them are soldiers on the frontline: Slavik and Katia, for example, have endured the bloodshed of combat as well as the horrors of captivity. Roman, a trained actor, was thrust on to the battlefield as a medic, a responsibility for which he was both professionally and emotionally ill-equipped. As the actors battle inner demons, the stage transforms into a common ground for understanding. Hailing from a conservative region of the country, Slavik admits to having his preconceptions erased through meeting Rodion, who proudly incorporates his traumatic experience as a queer person into his performance. The rigid parameters of national pride are also up for debate, as Oksana, a feminist actor, raises important inquiries about the place of women in Ukrainian society.These differences of opinions are processed not just through heated arguments, but also via the medium of dramaturgy. By emphasising the collaborative process of performance, the film stresses that unity must be achieved through holistic dialogue rather than an autocratic consolidation of ideas. The documentary’s postscript feels even more shattering in this regard: with most of the cast called up for military conscription, opportunities for creative experiments like this are already a thing of the past.TheHamletSyndrome is on True Story from 9 MayExplore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsUkraineHamletWilliam ShakespeareEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

When two Gypsies-cum-demons chantLeaning on the Everlasting Arms, Robert Mitchum’s ditty from Night of the Hunter, not to mention bearing love-hate tattoos on their knuckles, it indicates that this low-budget British home-invasion horror is missing the same fairytale concision. Which is a shame, as this messy but entrancing, faintly surrealist feature by Shani Grewal has entirely different qualities of its own.Blinded in a car accident that killed her husband, Harper (Suzanna Hamilton) has lived alone for several years; until recently that is, as stepson Taran (Viraj Juneja) returns home to find that his mother and sister Megan (Francesca Baker) have kidnapped the drunk driver responsible and shackled him in an upstairs bedroom. This is Sebastian (Michael Maloney), who in their eyes dodged jail with a fake insanity plea; they intend to stage a retrial on their own terms. But, spouting in multiple tongues including one belonging to a sinister entity, Sebastian may genuinely have a few cables unplugged.The arrival of Sebastian’s daughter Lilith (Miranda Nolan) on the front porch kicks off a transgressive free-for-all similar to the cloistered early films of Ben Wheatley. Mostly shot in a low-sun dazzlement redolent of some threshold being traversed, boundaries are trampled in this Anglo-Indian household: of civility, between step-siblings and – with late paterfamilias Pal (Madhav Sharma) seen wandering in a parallel hellscape – between worlds. Grewal and cinematographer Jamie Knights display a flair for bleary, dissociative ambience; at one point, a confrontational tea party morphs into a chirpy curry cook-out.At the same time, Ride the Snake is maddeningly imprecise when it comes to plot details, with an obscure and confusing early setup resulting in brittle acting from cast members trying to stand it up. Especially problematic is not finding a visual register that firmly grounds Sebastian’s possibly diabolic nature, leaving Maloney at first overacting until he builds into an erratic turn reminiscent of Don Logan-era Ben Kingsley. The real threshold in play here in this experimental delirium is between the ludicrous and the sublime – and Grewal is mostly camped on the right side.Ride the Snake is available on Amazon PrimeExplore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsThrillersreviewsShareReuse this content"

Dream State opens in 2004 with the image of a young woman, a month before her wedding, diving into a perfect lake whose “blue expanse of water” reflects the “overlapping peaks of the Salish range”. From this Edenic outset, it traverses decades, barrelling through our present day into a projected future: dipping in and out of the lives of a tight cast of characters as they succeed and fail; love and fall out of love; change and stay the same.The young woman is Cece. She has stepped out of the lakeshore family home of Charlie Margolis, a cardiac anaesthesiologist to whom she’s engaged. Route 30 traffic noise aside, the place is a bucolic idyll, marked by abundance and continuity: orchards filled with “ancient apple trees”, “raspberry bushes, magically replenishing”, mountain slopes “bristling with pines”. Cece “loves it more than any place on the earth”.She’s come to Montana early to put the finishing touches to the wedding plans before the guests, or even Charlie, arrive. In his absence, Charlie has deputed his best friend, Garrett, to lend a hand. Garrett appears on the lakeshore as Cece is swimming – and from there, events unfold more or less as we’d expect. Cece and Garrett move rapidly through antagonism into fascination; the wedding looms; and decisions taken in the heat of the moment profoundly shape the lives of all three characters from that point on.Puchner carries off his novel’s first act with aplomb, deploying the elements of the love triangle as the formula demands, but deftly, and with humour: light relief comes in the shape of a recalcitrant mountain goat, and a norovirus outbreak that topples the wedding party like dominoes. But it’s in the second act – and all the acts thereafter – that Puchner really flexes his muscles. His interest, it turns out, is not in the resolution of his love triangle, but in the idea that any such resolution is a chimera. Cece, Charlie and Garrett become parents, move through careers that wax and wane, grow old. Far from being finalised in the first act, their feelings about and for one another continue to shift and complicate as the decades unfold.As the years pass, the book itself evolves, from romantic drama into elegyThis absence of resolution is most visible in the lives of the trio’s children, via whom Puchner presents us with a dichotomy: they’re at once actors in their own right, and vessels carrying forward a queasy inheritance. The relationship between two of them, Jasper and Lana, is the subject of a perfectly formed chapter at the heart of the book, in which Puchner makes it clear that their own feelings are at once deeply personal, and at the same time inflected by their odd, slanting glimpses into the relationship between their parents. By following his characters over the course of years, Puchner shows us that we’re not fixed at the point of early adulthood; that change remains not just possible but inevitable. Yet in revealing how profoundly the children’s lives are shaped by the actions of their parents, he simultaneously calls the whole idea of free will into question.And free will means something different for those born in the 21st century. In its scope and plenitude, Dream State feels, at times, like a Victorian novel: an unhurried depiction of a rich, full world, in which actions have consequences that ripple across generations. But where the great novelists of the Victorian age tended to set their players’ foibles and insecurities against stable, knowable landscapes, these characters’ journeys take place amid a landscape that is slipping and changing, year by year, degree by terrifying degree. Puchner measures the passage of time by the disappearance of wildlife, the recession of the snowline and, most poignantly, by the retreat of the lake from the shore, leaving behind a “dry lake bottom … bleached grey as the moon”. Lana and Jasper’s summers are hotter and less bounteous than their parents’, and their choices, as a result, are curtailed. As the years pass, the book itself evolves, from romantic drama into elegy: for the characters’ lost youth, but more profoundly for the loss of a version of youth that is carefree and filled with potential.In his wrenching final chapter, Puchner takes us back to the beginning, and shows us the events that set his central characters’ feet on the path to their endings. We feel, in an instant, both the loss of the promise their own lives contained and the collective loss of a steadily unfolding future that once we took for granted. In Dream State, Puchner seduces us with a familiar and deeply secure narrative structure, only to undermine that structure, to force it to tell a tale of profound and fatal insecurity. But he tells his tale so compellingly, so engagingly, with such warmth and humour, that it’s not until you set the book down that you can appreciate the breadth and brilliance of what he’s done.Dream State by Eric Puchner is published by Sceptre, £18.99.To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Maybe you’ve always dreamed of having a tryst in a fairytale castle, or making love inside a gigantic biscuit tin? Whatever your weird fantasy may be, it can probably be catered for on a roadside somewhere in Japan, ifa new bookon the curious phenomenon of love hotels is anything to go by.French photographer François Prost has been on a 3,000km pilgrimage of passion, driving from Utsunomiya, north of Tokyo, to the island of Shikoku in the south, to document Japan’s unique architecture of furtive liaisons. What he found spans from manga-embellished motels and Christmas-themed love nests to pastel-hued stage sets worthy of Wes Anderson. And some things stranger than your most eccentric kinks could dream of.Some of the reviews don’t inspire confidence. ‘I found a pillow with dried semen,’ reads one“I find love hotels culturally fascinating,” says Prost, whose previous projects have included photographing thefacades of strip clubs in the USandnightclubs in Ivory Coast. “Japan is generally a fairly conservative society, but these are places of escapism, fantasy and almost childlike wonder. And you find them everywhere.”Estimates vary, but some put the number of love hotels – orrabu hoteru– in the country as high as 37,000. They pop up in city centres and rural villages, at busy highway junctions and secluded among fields in the middle of nowhere. As Prost’s photographs show vividly, they come in all shapes, sizes and stylistic genres.View image in fullscreenSea Stork Hotel, Machida, Tokyo prefecture, 2023.Photograph: François ProstSome are modelled on castles, topped with pink crenelations and turquoise turrets. Some look like alpine chalets, others like tiki huts, while plenty are modelled on cruise ships, promising to take you on a voyage to love paradise. Whether French chateaux get your juices flowing or you have a penchant for Arabian onion domes, there’s a place waiting for you to be greeted by an anonymous receptionist, pay for akyukei, or “rest”, and live out your carnal dreams.While most of the buildings in Prost’s book date from the 1960s onwards, the Japanese love hotel has its origins as far back as the 1600s. They began to emerge during the Edo period, in the form of discreet establishments known asdeai chaya, or lovers’ teahouses, where couples could meet away from the prying family gaze.They looked like regular teahouses from the outside, but were designed with secretive entrances and multiple exits, and – crucially, for a shoes-off-at-the-door society – somewhere for customers to hide their footwear so as not to be identified.View image in fullscreenWorthy of Wes Anderson … Hotel Flower Style in Nara.Photograph: François ProstBy the early 20th-century Shōwa era, these teahouses had transformed into themed, colourful places that offered a sense of escape from the daily routine. Japan’s postwar economic boom saw love hotels blossom into elaborate sexual amusement parks in the 1970s and 80s, with themes ranging from fairytale to sci-fi to medieval cosplay.The country’s high population density, small apartment sizes and tradition of living at home until marriage helped fuel the appetite for places for people to meet in private. Some have also put love hotels’ continuing success down to thesexual liberation of women in Japan, sometimes highlighting the cute, cartoonish nature of the decor – designed to feel safe and inviting, rather than tacky and sordid.Quite different from seedy pay-by-the-hour motels elsewhere in the world, love hotels aim to cater to everyone. In his 2005 book,Law in Everyday Japan, legal scholar Mark D West estimated that Japanese couples make more than half a billion trips to love hotels each year, suggesting that as much as half of all sexual intercourse in Japan could be taking place in these establishments. In turn, that would mean that a good deal of the country’s population were conceived on a rotating bed, in a beshackled boudoir, or inside a fantastical tropical grotto surrounded by model dinosaurs.View image in fullscreenHotel LaLa Resort, Kobe, Hyogo Prefecture.Photograph: François ProstProst’s photographs don’t take you inside the bedrooms (there are other books for that), but instead focus on the exterior iconography of the hotels. Far from fading into the background, they stand as loud roadside billboards, designed to be easily identifiable by libidinous couples at a glance from a moving vehicle.Who could miss the Hotel Artia Dinosaur, which rises on the corner of a highway intersection in Machida city near Tokyo, crowned with a huge T rex? A tableau of a Jeep being crushed by a velociraptor at the entrance sets the tone. Online reviews warn that the bedroom doors lock automatically once you’re inside, and you have to call reception to be let out – a feature common to love hotels, but here adding an extra frisson of danger, in tune with the Jurassic Park-inspired theme.Or might you live out your Moby-Dick fantasy at the huge pink concrete whale of Hotel Festa Qugiela, in Okayama, which waits ready to swallow you inside its grinning mouth? Or embrace the kinky King Kong spirit at the LaLa Resort in Kobe? It features a massive gorilla climbing up its bright red and orange-striped facade, and a model tiger keeping watch over the underground car park (a common feature so punters can be shuttled directly to their rooms).View image in fullscreenHotel UFO, Chiba Prefecture.Photograph: François Prost“The hotels are often designed so you don’t have to cross paths with anyone else,” says Prost. “You can go straight from your car into a lift going up, and there is always a separate lift to go back down, to avoid bumping into people. A lot of the hotels don’t even have receptionists any more – you book online, or choose your room from an automatic vending machine.”The faded decor and tatty appearance of many of the establishments makes you wonder if love hotels are becoming a thing of the past. A lot of them have the forlorn look of semi-abandoned amusement parks, with flaking paintwork and sun-bleached signage. And some of the online reviews don’t inspire much confidence.Who could resist the lure of Shibuya’s Sweets Hotel, a pink battenberg fantasy dripping with huge slices of cake, cookies and plastic icing? It turns out those aren’t the only treats on offer. “I found a pillow with dried semen,” reads one review. “The walls and doors were covered in scratch marks,” says another, “more fitting for a murder hotel than a love hotel.” “This place is gone now,” adds the most recent entry. “Too bad.”View image in fullscreenChapel Christmas, Narita Chiba PrefecturePhotograph: François ProstDespite some seedy failures, Prost says that love hotels are still just as popular as ever, and they are evolving to keep up with changing habits. “Nowadays, many young people go to love hotels to have parties,” he says. “They have karaoke machines, big TVs, massage chairs and hot tubs – people rent them in groups for a few hours.”TheBali An group, for example, offers big rooms forjoshi-kai, or girls’ nights out, complete with bars, 75in TVs and eight-person beds. The rooms also come with hammocks and camping equipment. After castles, cruise ships and cartoons, glamping appears to be the latest love hotel design trend, so you can sample the romance of the great outdoors without venturing outside.Love Hotelis out now.

I am not, surprisingly enough, in outer space. I’m at theCrawick Multiverse, a cosmos-themed land art installation in the south of Scotland that was built on the site of an old open-cast coal mine and is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year.The galaxies here are huge, spiralling mounds of earth, their perimeters reaching out towards one another but never quite touching.“These galaxies are slowly moving towards each other, and eventually they’ll collide,” says Gillian Khosla, chair of the Crawick Multiverse Trust. “When that happens, it will be the end of our universe.” Thankfully, we’ve got a few billion years until then.We stroll around the grounds and watch as visitors climb the mounds, looping around the spirals to reach the sandstone boulders on top. Parents are chased by kids, who are less interested in the cosmological ideas of the art than the fact it happens to double up rather well as an obstacle course.View image in fullscreenThe north to south avenue is lined with hundreds of stones salvaged from the old open-face coal face.Photograph: Stuart Kenny“We’re open to everybody’s way of looking at it,” laughs Caroline McMillan, a local farmer and Crawick Multiverse trustee, who joins us for the walk. “It can be an artsy thing, or it can be a nice place to come for a coffee – or to roll down some hills with your kids.”The coal mine that once operated here was shut and abandoned in the 1980s,when the “black gold” ran out. The land is owned by the Duke of Buccleuch – one of Scotland’s largest landowners. In 2005, he invited the late land artistCharles Jencksto transform it.“It was a depleted site,” says Khosla. “Everything was removed that was worth money and nothing was left. What open-cast coal mining tended to do was take, take, take; and what we’re trying to do here is add – add interest, diversity, nature and add value to the community.”What open-cast coal mining did was take, take, take; and what we’re trying to do here is add – add interest, diversity, nature and add value to the communityGillian KhoslaMcMillan lived in a house overlooking the site for much of the development. “It was grey and uninteresting,” she says. “Now it’s green and there’s a lot more biodiversity – ponds and dragonflies. It’s created jobs and it’s somewhere people bring people now; family and friends.”View image in fullscreenA view of the Northern Lights from Crawick Multiverse.Photograph: Mike BolamThe installation was built with existing materials – sandstone boulders were transformed into planets and black holes. At the centre is a 400-metre avenue lined with hundreds of stones on a north to south bearing, leading to a centralamphitheatrethat hostsconcerts in summer.Above it all, theBelvedere viewpointoffers sweeping 360-degree vistas of this eclectic 22-hectare (55-acre) site, where megaliths pose cosmological conundrums amid the farmland and hills of the Nith valley.“Charles wanted to make this a place people would come to from all over the world, and we’re starting to go down that track now,” says McMillan.Charles Jencks wanted to make this a place people would come to from all over the worldIt’s a Saturday morning, and families run among superclusters and climb on rocky comets. This remains a little-visited part of Scotland, despite its beauty, which is particularly apparent in early spring, with the sun shining and daffodils disrupting the greenery. Some old coal bings (piles of waste rocks) are still visible beyond the boundary walls, though digging ended decades ago.I continue my artistic voyage atA’ the Airts, a community art centre and cafe in the historic town of Sanquhar, just minutes from the Crawick Multiverse. Andy Williamson, chair of the centre, is originally from the neighbouring parish of Kirkconnel. Decades ago, like many in the local area, he worked at the Fauldhead colliery in Kirkconnel, which at the time was the largest pit in Dumfriesshire. In Sanquhar and Kirkconnel, thousands once relied on the pits to earn their living. The closure of the mines had a profound impact here, still felt today.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s down to maybe 2,000 now. The village never recovered.”A’ the Airts has a busy programme of music, film and poetry – some of it inspired by that mining legacy – as well as workshops on quilting, pottery and the distinctiveSanquhar knitting pattern. “I think one of the redeeming features of a mining village anywhere is the community spirit,” Williamson says. “That’s still relevant here. Everybody pulls together.” Green shoots sprout from mined land.Sanquhar is a picturesque town with a long history. On the edge is the ruin of a 13th-century castle where Scotland’s national hero William Wallace is said to have battled the English and Robert the Bruce is also believed to have visited. The poet Rabbie Burns frequented the town in the 1780s, often staying the night. Sanquhar is also home to the oldest working post office in the world, established in 1712.The story of such Scottish legends is told at theSanquhar Tolbooth Museum, which is to be found in an 18th-century baroque building on the high street that also houses old Davy lamps and mining pickaxes.View image in fullscreenThe historic town of Sanquhar, which boasts the world’s oldest working post office.Photograph: Duncan IrelandToday, there are new paths leading to Sanquhar Castle, new play parks and increasing tourism. “It’s all about making the place a bit better for the next generation,” says Lisa Black of the Sanquhar Enterprise. “That means something.”I spend a comfy night at theNithsdale hotelbefore continuing my journey on theSouthern Upland Way– a hiking route running 214 miles, coast-to-coast across the south of Scotland.The trail turned 40 last year and marked that anniversary with sculpted way markers, which were installed at the start and end of thethree sections(western, middle and eastern) that make up the trail.Sanquhar marks the end of the western Spirit of Galloway segment and the beginning of The Big Hills section through the centre of Scotland. I’m walking the eight miles to Wanlockhead, the highest village in Scotland and home to theMuseum of Lead Mining, which offers the only underground mine tour in Scotland.It is early, and I follow a farm road steeply out of Sanquhar as a dawn chorus of song thrushes, blackbirds, robins and wrens sing to welcome in the day. A pair of curlews pass overhead as I cross rough, scenic moorland, and the sun slowly rises over the Nith valley behind me.Crawick Multiverse costs£8.50for anadult day pass,£5forfive to 16-year-olds,freeforunder-fives, and£25forfamilies,crawickmultiverse.co.uk.

You could describe zhoug as a green chilli sauce, but that wouldn’t quite do justice to this amazing Yemeni condiment, which is packed with flavour from preserved lemons, cardamom and garlic. Use some to stir through the hot, just-cooked jersey royals, then serve the rest as a sauce for the chicken. The only accompaniment you then need is a light green salad: a handful of whatever leaves are to hand, some finely sliced fennel and a few pumpkin seeds, all dressed with lemon juice, olive oil and sea salt.Crispy chicken with zhoug and jersey royalsPrep20 minCook16 minServes2350g jersey royals, cleaned and halved2chicken breasts4 heapedtbsp plain flour2tsp za’atar(optional)1½tsp flaky sea salt1egg75g panko breadcrumbsOlive oil, for fryingGreen salad, to serveFor the zhoug50g coriander(if you dislike coriander, use an extra 50g parsley)15gflat-leaf parsley1 preserved lemon, skin and flesh roughly sliced1 smallgarlic clove, peeled6 green cardamom pods, seeds only2 green chillies, pith and seeds removed if you prefer less heat½tsp caster sugar½tsp ground cumin50ml olive oilCook the potatoes in a large pan of boiling water for 10 minutes, until cooked through. Meanwhile, put the chicken breasts on a large board, spacing them well apart, and cover loosely with a double layer of clingfilm. Use a rolling pin evenly to bash out the chicken to 3mm thick (by the time you get round to coating it in breadcrumbs, it will have bounced back to about 5mm); if the chicken breasts have mini fillets attached, separate them and flatten them, too.Get three shallow bowls or trays, each one large enough to hold one piece of the flattened chicken. Mix the flour, za’atar, if using, and half a teaspoon of salt in one dish, beat the egg in another and tip the breadcrumbs into the third. Dip each chicken piece first in the flour, then in the egg, and then in the breadcrumbs (use a different hand for the dry ingredients and for the egg, or you’ll end up with crumbed fingers), then put on a large plate or tray. Repeat with the remaining chicken.Try this recipe and many more on the new Feast app: scan or clickherefor your free trial.Heat a tablespoon of oil in your largest saucepan – if it’s not large enough to do both pieces at once, do them in turn. Fry the chicken on a medium-high heat for three to four minutes on each side, until cooked through, adding a little more oil as needed. Transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper to drain while you fry the rest of the chicken.Meanwhile, tip all the ingredients for the zhoug, plus a teaspoon of salt, into a small food processor or high-speed blender, and blitz to a smooth, green sauce. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed, then stir four heaped teaspoons through the potatoes.Serve the chicken with the potatoes, a green salad and the remaining zhoug in a bowl alongside.Explore more on these topicsChickenQuick and easyMiddle Eastern food and drinkSauces and graviesFoodMeatMain courseHerbs and spicesrecipesShareReuse this content"

Cooking with the seasons isn’t just a philosophy, it’s how my executive chefBen Boeynaemsand I get the best flavour from every ingredient, and spring is our (and probably every chef’s) favourite season, especially after all those months of working with winter’s roots and brassicas – spring produce is like colour after black and white. Today’s two dishes celebrate that ethos by letting exceptional ingredients do the talking.Pea guacamole (pictured above)English peas at their peak are unbeatable – sweet, vibrant and packed with freshness. This guacamole dials up their natural flavour with a bit of smoky heat from charred jalapeño, bright lime and fresh coriander.Prep10 minCook25 minServes4120g shelledpeas15g fresh coriander leaves, plus 1 tbsp extra, finely chopped, to finish1 tbsp sunflower seeds1 medium fresh jalapeño chilli1½ tspcoarse sea salt, plus a little extra to finish2 ripe avocados, halved, pitted, peeled and diced3 spring onions, white parts only, thinly sliced2 tbsp finely grated lime zest, plus the juice of 1 limePlain tortilla chips, to serveFill a large bowl with ice and water. Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil, drop in the peas and cook for just a minute or two, until tender. Add the whole coriander leaves to the pan, blanch for five or so seconds, just long enough to wilt them, then drain both the peas and the coriander into a fine-mesh sieve. Immediately plunge the sieve into the bowl of iced water to stop the cooking and to cool. Once the peas are cool, transfer them to a plate lined with kitchen towel to drain; put the blanched coriander in a few layers of kitchen towel and wring dry.Toast the sunflower seeds in a heavy-based frying pan on a medium-high heat for a minute, until fragrant and golden brown, then tip on to a medium plate.Put the whole jalapeño in the hot pan and cook, turning it often with tongs, for eight to 10 minutes, until the chilli is charred and blistered all over. Transfer the chilli to a small bowl, cover with clingfilm and leave to steam and cool for five minutes. Peel the charred skin off the jalapeño, remove and discard the stem, then cut the jalapeño in half lengthways and scrape out and discard the pith and seeds.Put all but two tablespoons’ worth of the cooled peas in a food processor (or mortar), add the blanched coriander, the charred jalapeño and a half-teaspoon of coarse salt, then pulse (or grind) until everything is coarsely broken up. Transfer the pea mixture to a medium bowl.Add the diced avocado, sliced spring onion whites, lime zest and juice, and remaining teaspoon of coarse salt to the pea mixture and mash with a fork. Transfer to a serving bowl, then sprinkle over the sunflower seeds, the reserved peas, the chopped coriander and a pinch of sea salt to taste. Serve with tortilla chips.Asparagus quesadillas with jalapeño and avocado salsaView image in fullscreenJean-Georges Vongerichten’s asparagus quesadillas with jalapeño and avocado salsa.English asparagus is one of spring’s prime ingredients: tender, fresh and packed with flavour. Here, we layer raw, thinly sliced spears with rich melting cheese, and serve them in tortillas with a bright salsa to cut through the richness. We use artisan tortillas fromMasafina, who make exceptional blue corn tortillas using heritage corn that’snixtamalisedin London.Prep15 minCook25 minServes4For the quesadillas400g oaxaca cheese, or a good-quality melting cheese such as mozzarella, grated4 tortillas– ideally blue corn ones140g fresh asparagus, very thinly sliced, on a mandoline, ideallyRapeseed oilFor the salsa100g fresh jalapeños, stalks, pith and seeds discarded, flesh roughly sliced70g ripe avocado flesh(ie, from about ½ avocado)30g fresh lime juice30g extra-virgin olive oil25g roughly chopped onion15gmint leaves1 tspflaky sea salt1 small garlic clove, peeled, halved and germ removedFirst make the salsa. Put all the ingredients in a blender, add 50g cold water, then blitz until completely smooth. Transfer to a bowl, then chill over a larger bowl of ice, stirring occasionally, until very cold.Meanwhile, prepare the quesadillas. Lay a quarter of the grated cheese over one half of each tortilla, then arrange the sliced asparagus evenly on top. Season to taste, then fold each tortilla in half to create four half-moons.Have ready a tray or large plate lined with kitchen towel. Put a large frying pan or griddle pan on a medium heat, brush the surface with a little rapeseed oil, then, working in batches if need be, cook the quesadillas until crisp and golden on both sides, which should take six or seven minutes in all. Lift out, drain on the kitchen paper and, if need be, keep warm in a low oven while you repeat with the remaining uncooked quesadillas.To serve, cut each quesadilla into four, then serve hot with the chilled salsa on the side.Jean-Georges Vongerichtenis chef/patron ofABC Kitchens,The Connaught GrillandJean-Georges at the Connaught, all in London.Explore more on these topicsSpring food and drinkMexican food and drinkFoodVegetablesSnacksStarterBreadrecipesShareReuse this content"
