A place where nothing ever happens. Where dreams come to die. Where the only joy to be found is in the possibility of forgetting. Oblivion is the hottest ticket on offer. Above all else, a microverse of infinite sadness and suffering.The banners around the conference compound carry the catchy slogan “Stronger economy. Stronger borders”. They should say “Abandon hope, all ye who enter here”. A colleague asked the guard whether this was the media entrance. He replied: “It’s anyone’s. It’s so quiet in there. I’ve been to busier dinner parties.” You can’t help feeling that the security is there to stop people leaving, rather than keeping the unwanted out.Inside the complex there is almost nothing going on. The exhibitors’ hall a ghost town. All the Tories have to offer is some Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher tat. It’s like entering a time warp. Ask if there’s any Kemi Badenoch merchandise and you get a shrug of the head. “Nah, mate. We’ve left that back at the warehouse. This is the only stuff that sells.”All around there is just bewilderment. No one seems quite sure exactly why they have come. Mostly out of habit or because they are in the shadow cabinet and are rather obliged to make an appearance. Either way, it’s four days of misery for everyone concerned. They are all counting down the minutes till they can leave.The stench of decay is overpowering. An event dedicated to “young voters – under 50”. Nothing that happens here really matters. During a fringe Spectator event, everyone was so bored that the interviewer asked Robert Jenrick if he would fight a horse-sized duck. It was by far the most interesting point of the day.No one embodies this sense of existential melancholy more thanMel Stride. A man who has been through so many political iterations that he had long since forgotten what he actually believes. If anything. Mel is a natural-born follower. Someone who puts loyalty to the party above all else.The Melster can be relied on to say whatever he is told to say. Even when he suspects it’s all nonsense. There was something heartbreaking about him having been the last man standing to defend Rishi Sunak during last year’s election campaign. No embarrassment is ever too much for Mel. He treads a fine line between decency and halfwittedness. And is all too often found on the wrong side.These days Mel is to be found as shadow chancellor. Not because he has any deep grounding in economics but because the Tories don’t really have anyone else. He is the natural heir to the air-headed Jeremy Hunt. And not in a good way.But these days Kemi has to take what she can get, so the Melster was first up in the main hall on Monday morning. The audience had clearly come pre-warned as there barely was one. The seating capacity is already far smaller than in previous years and the room was barely half full. It was like a fringe event for friends and family. He had to beg people to stay.But let’s be generous. Even if Mel had a decent story to tell, he’d have struggled to keep what passed for an audience awake. Put simply, he is no public speaker. All the emphases come in the wrong place. It’s like he’s talking in a third or fourth language that he doesn’t properly understand.At one point he even felt the need to explain a joke as no one had laughed. No one had the heart to tell him that the silence was because it wasn’t funny. The Melster looked crestfallen. He had chuckled himself to sleep with that one-liner the night before.That was just one of Mel’s tragedies. Humiliation heaped on humiliation. What made his speech an act of desperation was that it was both intellectually dishonest and completely irrelevant. “We need hope,” he said. “We need a plan.” Unfortunately, Mel was offering neither. Least of all an explanation for the way successive Tory governments of which he had been part had left the country in such a desperate state. He seemed to think Labour had been given a wondrous economic inheritance. About as far from reality as you can get.Enjoying the implosion of the Tories? That’s understandable – but completely wrong | Zoe WilliamsRead moreMel ploughed on. A quick bit of backstory that he seemed to think made him more interesting. It didn’t. Then a whole load of promises. Keeping the two-child benefit cap. Because why would you want to do the one thing that would make most difference to reducing child poverty? Cutting a whole load of benefits – though obviously not to pensioners. Got to protect the last remaining Tory core vote. He ignored the irony that he was proposing cutting the benefits that he had increased in one year as work and pensions secretary.By now the Melster was desperate. He was promising all these things and no one was clapping. Because none of this was going to happen. Mel could have promised anything. Made any numbers up. It was just words to fill dead air. The audience was only here because they had nowhere better to be. This was just a meta conference. A conference that only existed because someone had thought there needed to be a conference. His closing words came out as a shout. As if volume made them more real. “We can. We will,” he said. He can’t. He won’t.You’d have thought we’d just hit rock bottom after that. But then you probably hadn’t banked on Claire Coutinho being up next. Complete with slideshow that she hadn’t mastered. Quite how she has come to be shadow energy secretary is a mystery. Maybe she knows even less about other things than she does energy. Or maybe her role is just to make the Melster feel better about himself.Claire’s big suggestion that also isn’t going to happen is to get rid of the Climate Change Act, install air conditioning in every building and dent investor confidence in the energy market. Brilliant. You can’t buy Claire’s level of stupidity.The morning ended with a desultory debate on the Online Safety Act in which no one was much interested. As if there was a prize for the last person left awake. Toby Young argued that the act needed to be abolished. Far better that teenagers watched unlimited porn so long as rightwing activists had a platform to say whatever they liked. Julia Lopez excitedly announced the meaningless results of the online audience poll. Toby had won by 12 votes to eight. In current Tory circles, that counts as a landslide.Explore more on these topicsConservative conferenceConservativesMel StridecommentShareReuse this content"

As comedy goes, it couldn’t be more pleasurableRachel AroestiMon 6 Oct 2025 07.15 EDTLast modified on Mon 6 Oct 2025 18.55 EDTShareLike anyone who has grown up in the shadow of Alan Partridge’s three-decade dominion over British comedy, I want only the very best for Norwich’s most relentless broadcaster. By which I mean the absolute worst. For me, Partridge is at his finest when he’s scrabbling around the media’s outer fringes, rebranding past humiliations as glories and furiously name-dropping 1980s television personalities to the nonplussed acquaintances he genuinely believes to be his closest friends.Sadly, Alan has been riding (relatively) high in recent years. In 2022, Steve Coogan’s creation – now co-written by Rob and Neil Gibbons – embarked on a UK arena tour as a motivational speaker, imparting dubious advice to tens of thousands of adoring fans. Before that, he landed the job of a lifetime: a presenting gig on the BBC’s daily tea-time magazine show This Time. Obviously, he was disastrous – but was still invited to return for a second series.So it brings me great pleasure to report that Alan is finally back where he belongs: at rock bottom. In How Are You? It’s Alan (Partridge) – a self-produced, self-directed and largely self-funded series about the nation’s mental health – we are reunited with the presenter four years after the on-air meltdown that ended his BBC career. Since then, he’s pivoted (involuntarily) to the corporate sphere. He spent time in Saudi Arabia, shilling camel milk products with the requisite servility, and still presents Gulf Digital’s breakfast show from “downtown Jeddah” (AKA a Norwich business park) on an ad hoc basis. He hosts events for a pig feed manufacturer. He leads focus groups. He commentates on school sports days (“all-these-boys-racing-with-each-other-but-they’ve-already-won-the-race-of-life-by-going-to-a-fee-paying-school”). He lends his dulcet tones to everything from supermarket vans to the lift at Norwich library.Once a degrading step down of its own on the steadily descending staircase that was Alan’s pre-This Timecareer (previous rungs included military quiz Skirmish on digital channel UK Conquest andthe graveyard slot onterrestriallocal radio), Alan’s stint presenting Mid Morning Matters on North Norfolk Digital now seems like a peak never to be scaled again. At one stage, he wheedles his way into the station’s depressing offices where no one remembers his name in order to film content for the documentary with his erstwhile sidekick Simon Denton (Tim Key). Yet even the chronically amenable Denton hates his guts. Meanwhile, his supposed best mate Daryl Flench (whose tanning salon franchise is also sponsoring How Are You?) is clearly having an affair with his nasty new girlfriend Katrina (Katherine Kelly).View image in fullscreenThe perfect pairing? … Steve Coogan and Katherine Kelly in How Are You? It’s Alan (Partridge).Photograph: BBC/Baby Cow/Matt FrostWhy is there so much joy in seeing Partridge brought so low? It’s not quite schadenfreude – although his narcissism means it’s hard to feel particularly sorry for him. And while cringe comedy can also be feelgood TV – there is true comfort in knowing we are not Alan – that’s not the whole story. Instead, there’s something spellbinding and strangely uplifting about the way Alan reacts to the bottom falling out of his life. Ostensibly prompted by a fainting spell at a farming event, How Are You? is really an attempt to jump on the mental health bandwagon – if anything, the series fails because Alan is too functional to be an interesting case study. His arrogance and pettiness never falters, but neither does his resilience and determination. Really, it should have been over for Alan the moment he accidentally shot and killed a guest on his 1990s chatshow Knowing Me, Knowing You. Inspirationally, he has staggered on for decades.Alan is, of course, spurred on by steely delusion. He reframes his This Time exit as parting “ways with the BBC after delivering a few home truths”. A master of bullish doublethink, you believe him when he says he finds corporate work just as fulfilling as TV, even though he clearly doesn’t. He does, however, seem genuinely impervious to criticism. During a tense exchange with Denton in which the pair are encouraged to speak their truths therapy-style, his former sidekick admits, “I want to tell you to fuck off and say that when you worked here no one at the station liked you.” Alan seems invigorated, not wounded, by the exchange. He finds endless tiny ways to sate his ego – showing off a framed picture of himself with Crimewatch presenter Sue Cook’s brother, for example. He is either able to push guilt down into the furthest recesses of his being, or simply doesn’t feel it at all. Alongside a festering contempt for Noel Edmonds (the basis of many great gags here), this combination of denial and solipsism has coalesced into the kind of get-up-and-go that is unquestionably impressive for a man on the edge of 70.View image in fullscreen‘I want to tell you to fuck off’ … Alan Partridge with sidekick Simon Denton, played by Tim Key in How Are You? It’s Alan (Partridge).Photograph: BBC/Baby Cow/Ollie UptonThe other reason it’s so satisfying to see Alan on his uppers is because the character has long been an exquisite study in dwindling celebrity. Opportunities for the once-famous have never been greater: podcasts, crowdfunded content, social media, personalised video messages (“a nice little earner” for Alan), an entire ecosystem of reality TV and gameshows (we get a sublime glimpse of Alan on a celebrity cooking series, tearily admitting he’s forgotten what dill looks like). In an almost sketch show-less world, few are able to spoof the celebrity landscape. Often, fame seems effortless and aspirational – a product of the audience’s desire rather than the celebrity’s – yet Partridge’s interactions with the public remind us that most pursue it, feverishly.In How Are You? Alan is the funniest he’s been in years. This Time certainly had its moments (Sidekick Simon’s eye-watering struggles with the studio smart screen; Partridge demonstrating the optimal technique for corporal punishment on a visit to his old school), but it was always difficult to believe anyone would give Alan that job. Still, sometimes you just need a little boost to get you back on that comically fertile downward spiral.How Are You?

Sometimes Gal Gilboa-Dalal feels trapped in an eternal present, still living the agonising, endless day when his brother, Guy, was kidnapped byHamas.The siblings were at the Nova festival, dancing in a grove of trees just a few kilometres from Gaza, when militants broke through the border to launch the deadliest attacks sinceIsraelwas founded and take 250 people hostage.“Time has been passing very weirdly,” Gal said. “In a way I feel that I was with him at Nova yesterday and in a way I feel like I haven’t seen my brother in more than 100 years.”The family’s tragedy is a very public one. Guy’s face is on posters around the country, from the airport to suburban garden walls, news about his condition regularly makes headlines, and his fate is debated on talkshows and in parliament.View image in fullscreenPeople pay their respects to the victims of the massacre at Nova festival on 7 October 2023 near the border with Gaza. A total of 378 people were killed and 44 were abducted by Hamas at the festival.Photograph: John Wessels/AFP/Getty ImagesBut their grief is lonely. There were relatively few other people in Israel who could understand even their initial agony, the waves of hope that Guy was alive, fear that he would be killed, and desperation about the abuse and torture he faces.After two years, most of the other hostages have nowcome homeor werekilled inside Gazaeither by their captors or Israeli forces. Only 20 are thought to still be alive, although militants are also holding 28 bodies, denying their families the closure of a burial.“It’s so hard missing him all day every day, thinking about him all day every day,” Gal said. “And as time goes by it’s getting harder and harder [to bear], and harder and harder to see the light at the end of the tunnel.”There has been joy and pain inwatching other hostages released. Bonded by the particular horror of having a loved one taken captive, many relatives describe themselves as a big family and Guy is no exception.“You can’t not feel happy for them,” he says of watching dozensof reunionsbroadcast live. But the past two years have taken a heavy toll, forcing his little sister to grow up early and ageing his parents. So there is envy as well.“I have to say the truth: I am honestly jealous seeing them reunited with their loved ones, seeing this nightmare has ended for them,” he said. “You see their tears of happiness and wish they were yours.”The last time he saw his brother was at sunrise on Saturday 7 October two years ago, when the first rockets were fired fromGaza, warning sirens sounded over the Nova festival and police ordered festival-goers to evacuate or take cover.The party had begun on Friday but was at its peak that morning with about 3,500 guests and 500 staff at the site. More than one in 10 would become victims ofthe biggest single massacreon that day, with 378 people killed and 44 taken hostage.Approximately 1,200 people were killed in Israel on 7 October, the majority of them civilians. Israel has since killed more than 67,000 people in Gaza,also mostly civilians, in a war thatgenocide scholars, international politicians and aUN commission of inquirysay is genocidal.Israel has not orderedan independent inquiryinto how the country was so vulnerable on 7 Octoberbut media and military investigations have already revealed a damning litany of complacency and incompetence.‘They told us a big attack wouldn’t happen’: the intelligence failures before 7 OctoberRead moreOnly a month earlier, the police commander for the Gaza border region had banned parties and events in the area due to security concerns, Israel’s Haaretz newspaperreported, but he left his post soon after issuing that order and was not replaced.Even without his oversight, two local police stations in the border area had turned down Nova organisers’ request for a permit to host the festival, citing factors including a shortage of security staff.Their third attempt in the town of Ofakim was signed off on 5 October, the day before the festival started. The Israeli military had approved the permit but did not send any forces to secure the site, and police officers at the perimeter carried only pistols.View image in fullscreenGal Gilboa Dalal.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianThe brothers knew none of this, but on 7 October, with the party obviously over and with nowhere nearby to take cover from rockets, they decided to leave.Gal set off straight away with his roommate, followed a few life-changing minutes later by Guy. He was travelling with friends who wanted to smoke a last cigarette before getting in the car for a long journey home.The road to and from the festival site was single lane in each direction, and the surge of panicked crowds trying to get away slowed traffic to a crawl. Twenty minutes later, Gal heard gunfire and called his brother, telling him to take cover and stay in touch. They have not spoken since.“People started to run in my direction covered with blood, screaming that the terrorists were closing in on us,” Gal said. He fled the car for a nearby wadi, or dry river gully, the only possible hiding place in a largely flat desert landscape.He spent 10 hours running, hiding and trying to call his brother, as Hamas attackers armed with guns and RPGs fired at festival-goers scattered across the area. Guy never picked up the phone again and when Gal was finally rescued by police he found out why.Footage of his brother’s abduction was already online. “When I saw this video it was similar to the way I had felt all day running away from the terrorists, but worse,” he said. “I felt helpless. I’m seeing my brother in the worst condition ever. He had just been with me and I couldn’t do anything to help him.”Trying to change that is now the focus of Gal’s life. He still has a day job doing tech support, thanks to generous employers who allow him to work remotely as much or little as he wants, but he often finds it hard to concentrate on normal tasks.“I can’t stop thinking about my brother, I can’t stop hearing him screaming at me from the tunnels of Hamas, asking me what did I do for him today, what more can I do for him, when is he coming back,” Gal said. “I can never stop fighting for him.”The question of how best to do that has divided Israel as a nation and the hostage families as a group. They all desperately want their loved ones home, but the life-and-death stakes make it hard to compromise about best tactics.The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, says military pressure on Hamas is the best way to get hostages back. Critics point out that most of those who returned were freedin ceasefire deals, and accuse him of prolonging the war for personal political reasons.Gal is conflicted. He fears that without intense military pressure Hamas will not agree another hostage release but is also terrified Israeli attacks could kill his brother. Commanders warned that Israel’s most recent offensive in Gaza City would put some of the last surviving hostages at risk, as many are thought to be held there.“It’s so complicated, and I can’t know if its right or wrong, if its going to affect the hostages badly,” he said of the military campaign. He tries to avoid getting drawn into “exhausting” debates with other relatives and to focus instead being his brother’s voice.An end to fighting and the return of the hostages appeared to come much closer this week after Donald Trump said Israel and Hamas had both signed on to a new plan. Gal said that because previous promised deals had fallen apart before Guy’s release he was “trying not to be too optimistic”.“Its not the first time that we were just before having a deal and then Hamas refused or didn’t accept it,” he said. “We pray that this time would be different.”Guy is fascinated with Japan, taught himself the language and had bought a ticket to fly out there after Nova. Gal hopes the brothers can fulfil that dream together, then aims to retrain for a new career in something that will allow him to harness two years of pain, and help others as a way to heal himself.For now, a therapy dog helps him keep not just surviving but campaigning, and several new tattoos are a way to “wear his scars”.One contains lyrics from Gunslinger, a song by the metal band Avenged Sevenfold that is a favourite of both brothers, and has helped sustain him through Guy’s captivity.After 7 October, Gal liked listening to one line – “the stars in the night, they lend me their light to bring me closer to heaven with you” – and dreaming of their reunion. To him, heaven represented Guy’s freedom.Then two hostages who had been held with Guy came home with messages for the family. Guy wanted his brother to know that he was holding on to the lyrics of Gunslinger in the underground tunnels, they said.“That was just crazy because we have a lot of songs that we like, but it was this specific one he sent me through them. I had to get a tattoo, it has so much meaning for me.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelIsrael-Gaza: two years onMiddle East and north AfricaHamasPalestineGazafeaturesShareReuse this content"

What took so long?Lyndsey WinshipMon 6 Oct 2025 12.41 EDTLast modified on Mon 6 Oct 2025 13.04 EDTShareAcentury ago, the dancerMartha Grahambegan teaching at a small studio above Carnegie Hall in Manhattan. It was the start of a dance revolution. Graham wasn’t the first dancer to cast off ballet’s shackles and look for new ways of moving as the world shifted in the early 20th century: free-spirited Isadora Duncan had wafted her way through European salons; Loie Fuller experimented with costume and light effects; Ruth St Denis and Ted Shawn, with whom Graham trained, explored dance aping the styles of India, Egypt and Japan. But it’s Graham who became the true godmother of modern dance, developing a technique that would become the foundation of many dancers’ training around the world, and starkly modernist choreography that would point dance in a new direction.Where ballet leapt to the sky, Graham was rooted to the earth. Where classical backs stood straight, Graham curved the spine and tilted the pelvis in deep contractions, connecting to some primal place of power. In the most famous images of Graham dancing, she wears a full skirt kicked into a semicircle while she reaches high or far into space, but also into the psyche. You can sense her gravity by just looking at the photo. Masha Maddux, who joined the Graham company in 2007 (Graham herself died in 1991 aged 96) describes the technique: “It’s restrained. It’s very deep, very visceral, theatricalised and with a certain bite.” And what does it feel like to dance it? “Liberating!”View image in fullscreenStarting a trend … Edd Mitton and Abigail Attard-Montalto in Errand Into the Maze by Yorke Dance Project at Linbury theatre, London, in 2024.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianYet as Graham’s company prepares to celebrate its centenary in 2026, what’s strange about such a legendary performer, so fundamental to dance’s history, is that her work is rarely seen in the UK. “I do not understand why,” saysYolande Yorke-Edgell, whose London-based company Yorke Dance Project has presented a number of short Graham works.Aaron S Watkin, artistic director of English National Ballet (ENB), felt the same when he moved to London after working in Europe. “I was thinking, she’s the mother of modern dance, she’s so iconic and famous, but hardly anyone is doing it.”Yorke-Edgell, however, may have started a trend. Last year, her company performed Graham’s 1947 piece Errand Into the Maze, a Minotaur-inspired heroine’s journey (with demons real and metaphorical); it was then picked up by ballerina Natalia Osipova for her solo project. And now ENB is performing the same piece. “It’s like a 15-minute introduction to Martha Graham, everything that you’d want,” says Watkin. For an autumn tour, YorkeDanceProject is mounting another Graham piece, Deep Song, an angry, despairing solo made in response to the Spanish civil war. So, finally, there’s more Martha Graham on the menu.Born in 1894 in Pennsylvania, Graham later moved to California with her family. Her father, a doctor and psychiatrist, gave her what she called her first lesson in dance. “Movement never lies,” he told her. After dancing with St Denis and Shawn’s Denishawn company, Graham took a job with the Greenwich Village Follies musical revue, but was certain that her art form could be more than what Maddux says she called “inconsequential entertainment”. Graham soon established her school and company, creating weighty work inspired by Greek mythology, history, the American west and our rich interior worlds (as in 1930’s Lamentation, a study of grief), with strong female characters at the fore.So many important artists passed through her studio, from other dance pioneers such as Merce Cunningham, who performed with Graham’s company before setting out his own trailblazing path in modern dance, to Madonna, who took classes when she first arrived in New York. It was Graham who gave the rebellious student the moniker Madame X, a name Madonna used for an album title decades later. Graham was a force, no doubt, in person and on stage. In her photographs, dark hair swept back into a chignon, she emanates seriousness, and she was passionate too. Or as Maddux puts it: “Not the kind of person who would civilise herself. So if emotion was raw she didn’t hold back.” Yorke-Edgell, who encountered Graham at an audition, describes her having the kind of energy that vibrates. “She just had this presence; a total commitment to her art form,” she says, remembering what the former Graham dancer and teacherRobert Cohanwould say: “When she left the stage, she took the stage with her.”View image in fullscreenRooted to the earth … Martha Graham performing in Salem Shore.Photograph: Hulton Deutsch/Corbis/Getty ImagesBack in the present day, in ENB’s east London studio, Maddux is coaching dancers Minju Kang and Rentaro Nakaaki in Errand Into the Maze, trying to pass on some of that Graham energy. Nakaaki is the Minotaur character, with a horned headpiece attached to a bit he holds in his teeth. (Which can be painful, apparently. Yorke-Edgell tells of a performer in New York who dislocated his jaw from biting too hard during a performance. The physical challenge, she says, “does create more of a monster”). Between Nakaaki and Kang it is a battle of wills rather than blows. The shapes they make are like a woodcut, every movement so defined, solid, economical; there’s no visual noise. When Kang throws her leg straight up to the ceiling, turning her whole body into an arrow, it’s so decisive. But then the famous Graham contractions tug at the torso like inner turmoil. Some of the geometry is like jazz dance, but the context and the energy is so different it feels completely other.At the side of the studio, dancer Emily Suzuki is practising a step, her face intensely focused. She’s simply turning from facing the front to the side, but the resistance in the body has to be exactly right for it to work. “It’s like being pulled in both directions,” Maddux tells her. “Maybe her mind or her heart wants to resolve something, but physically she says no. It’s a very emotional internal dialogue.” It is not just a step to the side. These ideas are clear to see when you watch. The dancers’ faces don’t betray too much emotion, the point is that the dance does it for you. “We try to cultivate a physical voice that travels and projects far,” says Maddux. “To use the movement to crank up the volume on your entire body.”There is nevertheless a lot going on psychologically for the dancers at the same time. “They have to do some really deep emotional digging,” says Maddux. But for Graham, the movement itself could give you the emotion you need to portray. “Something here so deep produces that frightened state that the audience responds to,” says Maddux. You’re not “acting” emotions, she says: “You really have to internalise it and then let it bubble up. I call it the can of soda, you know, you shake it until …”Having recently seen three different dancers in the lead role in Errand, what’s interesting is that while Graham’s choreography is so recognisable and specific, each interpretation is still very different. “It’s such a fabulous role for the lead woman,” says Watkin. “It’s such a character, it’s like doing a full-length Onegin or Manon.”The sense of high drama, Watkin admits, could feel somewhat dated. But, at the same time, the distinctive choreography cuts through. The designs are striking too, and integral to the dance. A V-shaped sculpture by Isamu Noguchi for Errand Into the Maze is like a portal or gateway the protagonist steps through. In the iconic Lamentation, which Yorke Dance Company has performed, the dancer sits inside a stretchy tube of fabric. “You have to keep it completely taut the whole time,” says Yorke-Edgell, so that tension becomes an innate part of the dance. Graham designed her own costumes, such as the amazing yellow, green and black striped dress recently worn by singer (and classically trained dancer)FKA twigsto perform Graham’s 1932 piece Satyric Festival Song.English National Ballet’s R:Evolution review – a triple whammy of Balanchine, Forsythe and GrahamRead moreFKA twigs said the opportunity to perform Graham’s work was “like winning a Grammy”, such is the stellar power of her legacy. Why should we still be watching Graham’s dance – and maybe even watching more of it – a century on? “I think because there’s a purity to her technique,” says Yorke-Edgell. “It all comes back to the humanity of her work,” suggests Maddux. Graham wrote in her memoir Blood Memory that the essence of dance is the landscape of the soul. “I hope that every dance I do reveals something of myself or some wonderful thing a human can be,” she said. But I like another quote of hers that points to the transcendent power of her art: “Dancers are the messengers of the gods.”English National Ballet is performing Errand Into the Maze as part of R:Evolution atSadler’s Wells theatre, London, until 11 October.

It sums up a stillness, a sadness and a romantic passion that breathes in this show – but you won’t notice it straight away. Instead you’ll be carried along in a rush of cheeky provocations and ludicrous juxtapositions of word and image: a joyous embrace of modern life or even, pardon my French, ajouissance.The pictures tower and expand in this perfect brutalist setting as if you’re walking through a city of art – a dirty, disreputable city. Ages (2001) is a yellow and red slab almost the scale of a cinema screen on which their blandly smiling faces are surrounded by male sex workers’ adverts: “27 YEARS OLD Latin, and very good looking,” “BLACK GUY 24 Marco. Sexy, horny and waiting,” “SKINHEAD JOE, 26. East End/10 mins Liverpool St. Administers firm service.”Where are they now? Is skinhead Joe running a cafe or is he dead? You find yourself not sniggering but wondering about these young men. It’s a slice of life, a montage of transactions, moments, relations of power, desire and money in a metropolis. Gilbert & George are great scabrous chroniclers of London in the tradition of Hogarth. Like him, they dive into the dirty alleys of a city that can be brutal and they come up laughing at it all. One of their obsessions a few years ago was Evening Standard headline hoardings that tempted commuters with the latest horrors. One picture is an array containing the word “Murder”. So many murders. Other such pictures highlight bombings, and brothels – “VICAR FIGHTS BROTHEL CLOSURE” is a gem.View image in fullscreen‘Almost the scale of a cinema screen’ … Ages (2001).Photograph: Guy Bell/ShutterstockIt’s hard to resist quoting Gilbert & George’s choice gobbets of found language. I won’t do it again, promise, except: “PEARLY PENILE PAPULES” and “LIFE AFTER DEATH PROVED.” The latter is at the centre of a picture that includes people snapped on a bus, Gilbert & George wearing terroristic balaclavas and a telephone box and postbox perhaps offering communication with the next life. It’s funny but serious, too – what if life after death was proven?You might find it hard to look past the words Sex, Money, Race and Religion on Gilbert & George’s epic quadripartite picture entitled, what else, Sex, Money, Race and Religion. But if you do, another story is told. Postmarks from old letters or postcards, surely hoarded by the artists, are scattered across masses of brightly coloured leaves. The dates are meaningful. On Sex, they come from the 1960s and early 70s: “Aylesbury, Bucks, 1969”, “Cambridge, 1971.” Money takes us through the late 70s into the 1980s when they began to make their pictures, thus monetising as well as preserving their previously ephemeral art. Race preoccupied them in the 1980s while religion worried them in the 1990s: “Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, 26. 2. 1996”, says one of the last postmarks.Religion still gets their goat. They are opposed to all authoritarianism, especially religious. Their insults to God have got ruder as religion in this century has grown as a sociopolitical force. Pixie Hill conflates Christ with a grotesque toy pixie, Was Jesus Heterosexual makes merry with crucifixes while other ginormous works are covered with graffiti against multifarious faiths. But you would have to try hard to be offended. The moment you see something that contradicts your personal politico-religious bubble, it’s contradicted. You might expect them to flaunt the union jack, and they do, but did you expect to see their Antifa inspired series that includes “Our grandparents didn’t vote for fascists … They shot them!”View image in fullscreenHeadline news … Murder (2011).Photograph: Jordan Pettitt/PAThey don’t mean to make a political point by the flag waving, or the fascist-killing – they just show what they see, and what they see is everything. All human existence is crystallised in their particular urban world, living and dying in their local streets. Yet the hardcore truth behind the hilarity is poetic. What stays with you is beauty. For they don’t just find rude objects and words on their walks. They collect leaves and twigs and photograph pockets of urban nature among the comic horrors. In Cross Kissing, a curly frond of city weed links their mouths. And the most recent work I noticed here, from 2024, portrays them with a twig they found. It’s called Twig. In a way, lust for life is their religion. What are all these vast multicoloured pictures if not stained glass windows? Gilbert and George worship in their own way – they reverence nature, the city, their relationship.‘Too soothing’: why have music-hating art duo Gilbert & George gone orchestra mad?Read moreAnother picture here, 28 London Streets, is a gallery of evocative street names from their neighbourhood – Princelet Street, Henriques Street, Chudleigh Street. Instead of gurning or cavorting as in their other self portraits, the artists here are two misty, spectral entities: the ghosts of Gilbert & George, haunting their old streets for ever. They made that back in 2003, at the start of their 60s. Now they are in their 80s. And they haunt the same streets, but not as ghosts. Not yet.Some sophisticates may be a bit sick of their antics, but to rip off Dr Johnson on London itself – to be tired of Gilbert & George is to be tired of life.Gilbert & George: 21st Century Pictures is at theHayward Gallery, London,7 October to 11 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsGilbert & GeorgeArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

Despite being utterly fearless on the pitch he was not brilliant with heights. That day, he wrote in his autobiography, was “the most terrifying experience of my life”. Or at least it was. A fortnight ago, he and his family were plunged into something infinitely scarier.Moody’s diagnosis with the incurable motor neurone disease at the age of 47 is, first and foremost, desperate news for all those who know and love him. There are good guys and then there is “Moodos”, about whom nobody in rugby has a bad word. Cruel doesn’t come close to describing it.Former England rugby captain Lewis Moody reveals MND diagnosisRead moreBecause, aside from being an unfailingly nice bloke, Moody’s almost childlike relish for the game was just as infectious. He threw himself into places from which most normal people would flee in the opposite direction. Whether he was out there representing England’s 2003 World Cup winners, the British & Irish Lions, Leicester, Bath or Bracknell minis, he was the personification of an English lionheart who unfailingly put his body on the line for the cause.It made him the most popular of teammates and earned him the affectionate nickname “Mad Dog”. His former captain for club and country, Martin Johnson,summed it upwhen Moody retired in 2012 having won 71 caps for England. “When I look back at playing with Lewis it always brings a smile to my face – it was never dull. He was one of the most committed guys I ever played with and had a complete disregard for his own physical wellbeing.”But even those of us who followed his entire playing career and, at one stage, collaborated with him on a fly-in-the-ruckcolumn for the Guardianbarely knew the half of it. Among other things he was diagnosed with the inflammatory bowel disease ulcerative colitis in 2005, preferring to keep his condition secret while continuing to play top-level rugby.His steadily growing list of other rugby-related injuries would also have tested anyone’s resolve. Even as a baby there were hairy moments, not least when a motorcyclist with a concrete slab in a sidecar smashed into his mum’s Beetle with him in the back in a baby seat. The vehicle was a write off and his mother suffered whiplash but Lewis was fine.View image in fullscreenLewis Moody breaks away from Stephen Moore’s attempted tackle at the 2007 World Cup. England beat Australia 12-10 in the quarter-final.Photograph: Andrew Fosker/ShutterstockPerhaps most wince-inducing of all was the 2007 World Cup game against Tonga, during which he was knocked out twice but staggered back up to complete all 80 minutes and then featured in a winning quarter-final the following week. Knowing what we all know now about the risks of second impact syndrome and the need to protect players from themselves, it is a case study which has not aged well.Talking of which there will inevitably now be those sucking their teeth and instantly pronouncing that all that physical punishment must have contributed to his MND diagnosis. They would be wiser to leave that to the experts. Lewis’s father passed away with Alzheimer’s in January last year and his father’s brother has been diagnosed with the same condition. Moody has previously said there was “an added weight” to knowing what being potentially genetically predisposed to dementia might mean alongside the cumulative effects of his rugby career.For the past 12 yearsthe Lewis Moody Foundationhas sought to raise funds to support those affected by brain tumours. And, as it happens, Moody has also been campaigning for mandatory time limits on contact in training and for more money to be made available for the care of players once their careers have concluded.He has been saying for a while that, even for gung-ho back-row forwards of his ilk, times need to change. “People may go: ‘That’s really hypocritical of you, Lewis “Mad Dog” Moody, because you used to play like an idiot, you were insane.’ Well, I wasn’t insane. I loved playing the way I did, I loved the contact element of the game, I loved the hours we spent battering each other on the training field. I played the game within the parameters – and in the way that I could – at a time that I could. And I would do it differently now.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Furthermore, he has long had a passion for military history and, in dressing rooms before big matches, used to clasp his great-grandfather’s first world war medal for motivation. “I have always been interested in how people deal with adversity,” he explained. “Sometimes the only answer is to just put one foot in front of the other and keep going.”Which is precisely how he, his wife Annie and their family will now seek to respond. There will be a tsunami of support from across the world of professional sport – one of his boys, 17-year-old Dylan, is a promising goalkeeper for Southampton and has represented England at youth level – not to mention from millions of others who admire Moody from afar. Nobody deserves a truly horrible disease like MND but this time it has singled out the bravest and most admirable of men. Best wishes, Lewis.

They declined to answer a range of specific questions about his financial affairs.Cottrell runsGeostrategy.com, which states that it advises political parties and governments, according to information provided by his lawyers. Its website says that it has four locations: London, Washington, Podgorica in Montenegro and Zurich, Switzerland.He is also working on a book titled How to Launder Money,alongside an international financial investigator. Publicity materials for this book describe it as a “guide for law enforcement, prosecutors and policymakers” which “provides concrete recommendations on how to reduce the crime associated with money laundering”. It also states that Cottrell’s proceeds from his book will go to “charitable causes”.Cottrell has provided financial support to Farage,paying £15,000 for flightsto the US for the party leader last year, at a time when Cottrell is understood to have claimed he was tax resident in Montenegro. In 2024, his mother, Fiona Cottrell,gave £750,000 to the party, according to public records.UK political parties can only accept donations from individuals on the UK electoral register, unless it is for the cost of a trip overseas, in which case foreign residents can help fund the travel.View image in fullscreenGeorge Cottrell does not hold an official role in Reform UK but is said to be part of Farage’s inner circle.Photograph: Stuart MitchellSources with knowledge of the examination of his finances have said scrutiny is under way by HMRC. At present, HMRC’s interest is understood not to be a formal investigation. The tax authorities could ultimately decide to take no further action if they are satisfied Cottrell has paid the right taxes.Questions over his income from wealth and business activities are understood to have in part been due to Cottrell’s continued pursuit of high-stakes gambling, sources told the Guardian.In 2017 he was jailed for eight months in the US after pleading guilty to wire fraud, after he offered money laundering services on the dark web.At that time he characterised himself as having “a years-long multimillion-dollar gambling addiction” and his legal representative said he would seek treatment in order to stop, blaming it for triggering his illegal activity.Gambling can result in large sums of money moving in and out of bank accounts and therefore spark the interest of HMRC, causing officials to reassess an individual’s finances.Questions over compliance with tax residency rules can also be another trigger for tax officials. Authorities are understood to be paying particular attention to Cottrell’s use of the multimillion-pound property in west London.Non-UK residents do not have to pay UK tax on their overseas income, providing they spend no more than 90 days a year in the country.Longer stays can mean that an individual is treated as a resident for tax purposes, and tax authorities conduct strict tests to assess compliance, including checking for “significant ties”, such as whether an address is available to them for a continuous period of 91 days or more during a tax year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This appears to be at odds with public records at the Land Registry and Companies House, which list it as being owned by a company controlled by a different supporter of Reform UK. It was last sold in 2021 for more than £4m. Cottrell refused to answer questions about the property.Cottrell’s lawyers said he lives in Montenegro, has not been a tax resident in the UK for several years and complies with residency rules about how long he can stay in the country.The individual recorded as owning the west London property did not respond directly to a request for comment. A representative for them said that they do “not respond to speculative requests, particularly where the facts are wrong”.Quick GuideContact Guardian Business about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact the Business team confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

This is understood to include a clutch of transactions made through the crypto exchange Tether.bet and its parent company GT Holding.Lawyers acting for Cottrell said he was not a director, shareholder or stakeholder in Tether.bet or GT Holding, and has had “no involvement” in any companies that use cryptocurrencies.Reform UK has been an advocate for allowing political partydonations in cryptocurrencies, claiming to be first to allow support this way. Farage has said he wants the UK to be a “power house” for such digital assets. Cottrell is understood to be one of the leading advocates within Reform for campaigning to make the UK and the party’s policies more crypto-friendly.Before he became involved in Farage’s political career, Cottrellhas said thathe pursued a career in financial services, including helping to set up a private office in Mayfair to manage the finances of a “well-known ‘international’ family” at the age of 19. He has previously told the Guardian that he gained wealth through an investment portfolio.In recent years, Cottrell has moved between Montenegro and the UK. He had been closely involved with Ukip, Farage’s former party, and rose to prominence again last year, helping Farage during the general election campaign for Reform UK.A spokesperson for HMRC said they could neither confirm nor deny investigations and cannot comment on identifiable taxpayers or businesses due to strict confidentiality laws.Explore more on these topicsBusinessNigel FaragenewsShareReuse this content"

It’s as close as I’ve come to a slum in this country. But the other thing I noticed there was that it was one of the worst integrated places I’ve ever been to. In fact, in the hour and a half I was filming news there I didn’t see another white face.“That’s not the kind of country I want to live in. I want to live in a country where people are properly integrated. It’s not about the colour of your skin or your faith, of course it isn’t. But I want people to be living alongside each other, not parallel lives. That’s not the right way we want to live as a country.”A spokesperson for Jenrick declined to comment. A source close to him said it was clear what he meant about integration and that he had made an observation, immediately followed by a statement that it was not about skin colour or faith.Khalid Mahmood, the former Labour MP for Birmingham Perry Barr, which covers Handsworth, said Jenrick was “stoking divisions” and it was “absolutely not” possible to say whether an area was integrated by looking at people in the street.“I was immensely privileged for 23 years to serve that area and they are fantastic people of all colours, creeds, religions and no religion at all in Perry Barr and Handsworth,” he said.“I think it’s very, very negative. These people have struggled day in day out to make ends meet under the Conservative government. We’ve got a huge amount of HMOs [houses of multiple occupancy] in the area and the bin strike by the local authority hasn’t helped either. He’s playing on that. For the comment that he’s not seen a white face in Handsworth, that’s just ridiculous. There are all sorts of people, white, black, other sorts of people of all heritages and cultures.”The area’s independent MP Ayoub Khan said: “The claims made by the shadow justice secretary are not only wildly false but also incredibly irresponsible. He has misrepresented a storied and diverse community, awkwardly distorting the product of an all-out bin strike to fit his culture-warrior narrative filled with far-right cliches.“What could be seen on the streets that day … was not the result of some failure of multiculturalism. It is the result of 14 years of sustained austerity measures under the Tory governments that he so loyally served, combined with continued neglect and mismanagement by the Labour-run council.”According to Birmingham city council, the ethnicity of Handsworth is 25% Pakistani, 23% Indian, 10% Bangladeshi, 16% Black African or Black Caribbean, 10% mixed or other ethnic group and 9% white.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In May, he told Sky News that “if you look at parts of Dagenham [in east London], the white British population has reduced by 50% in the last 25 years”. When pressed on why this mattered, Jenrick responded: “It’s not about the colour of someone’s skin.”When questioned about those “white British” comments, the Conservative party leader, Kemi Badenoch, said: “People will use different words from what I would use. I’m not a micromanager.”Anna Turley, the Labour party chair, challenged Badenoch to explain how Jenrick’s comments fitted in with her speech saying the party stands “against a politics that ‘reduces people to categories and then pits them against each other’”.“Robert Jenrick in his leaked comments reduces people to the colour of their skin and judges his own level of comfort by whether there are other white faces around,” Turley said. “His comments clearly cross a red line that his leader has rightly laid down.”ANew Statesman profile of Jenrickin July 2025 referred to his visit to Handsworth. It said Jenrick “agreed that there was an English ethnicity” but suggested he was concerned with “Britain’s cultural identity, not questions of race and religion”.Georgie Laming, the director of campaigns at Hope Not Hate, said: “If Robert Jenrick truly wants to see people live alongside each other, he shouldn’t make such inflammatory remarks.

I thought [one relative] was being radicalised because he wouldn’t speak to us for a bit.“He was coming up the road preaching to kids about the Qur’an. It was quite intimidating. It was intrusive.”The neighbour, who did not want to be named, said she was “really concerned” and reported it toGreater Manchesterpolice in the summer of 2020 or 2021. “I would never do that if I weren’t [concerned],” she said.The disclosure is likely to raise questions about the extent to which these concerns were investigated before the attack last Thursday. One witness reported hearing him shout: “This is what you’re going to get for killing our children,” as he attempted to break into the building armed with a knife. Shamie was shot dead by police after the attack.Greater Manchester police have been contacted for comment. The force said on Friday they believed he “may have been influenced by extreme Islamist ideology”.The neighbour said she had been invited for meals at their home when they first moved in around 15 years ago – but that stopped when the father, Faraj, moved out a short time later. Their mother, Formoz, was “really nice” and chatty and a “strong woman”, who raised the three boys mostly by herself, she said.Neighbours said they noticeda change in some of the family during Covid. “It was the change because I would talk to them all the time and then [one of the family] just started rocking up in the robes. He went from not going down that path to going down that path,” said one resident in Prestwich, north Manchester.They said the “followers” of Shamie and the family member would “congregate” in the family’s front garden: “They didn’t have any white friends. I thought: what the heck is going on? It wasn’t just praying in the garden – it was private and secret.”Neighbours also claimed that police had visited Shamie’s family home earlier this year, apparently because of safeguarding concerns.Shamie told one resident “a few months ago” that his partner had moved out. He apparently did not know where they were now living.The Guardian has also been told that Shamie “became reclusive” after suffering what they described as “brain damage” when he fell off a cliff about 20 years ago, when he was a teenager.“Jihad had a bad accident,” said one neighbour. “He fell off a cliff and got airlifted to London. He had massive head injuries, it was horrific. You didn’t see much of him after that – he became very quiet and reclusive.”The Guardian revealed on Friday that Shamie was on police bail under investigation for an alleged rape when he attacked the synagogue, about two miles from the family home, last Thursday morning.On Friday Jihad’s father,Faraj al-Shamie, condemned his son’s “heinous act”.He wrote: “The news from Manchester regarding the terrorist attack targeting a Jewish synagogue has been a profound shock to us.“The al-Shamie family in the UK and abroad strongly condemns this heinous act, which targeted peaceful, innocent civilians. We fully distance ourselves from this attack and express our deep shock and sorrow over what has happened. Our hearts and thoughts are with the victims and their families, and we pray for their strength and comfort.”Explore more on these topicsManchesterUK security and counter-terrorismPoliceGreater ManchesternewsShareReuse this content"

He said it was “unbelievable” that one in three people in London had been a victim of phone theft – drawing on a fintech survey of 1,000 people, rather than the police-reported figures which suggested that far fewer had been affected.On Monday, the Met promoted its operation against phone theft as part of a drive to step up the targeting of so-called volume crime – such as shoplifting, phone theft and burglary.After an investigation lasting nearly a year, the force said it had taken down a criminal network suspected to have smuggled up to 40,000 stolen phones from the UK to China over the past 12 months – up to 40% of all phones stolen in London.The Met said it believed it had “significantly disrupted” London’s stolen phone market in an operation known as “Echosteep”, which started last December when a box containing about 1,000 iPhones being shipped to Hong Kong was found at a Heathrow warehouse.Specialist detectives who would ordinarily investigate armed robberies and drug smuggling were brought in, leading to the interception of further shipments and the use of forensics to track down suspects. Two men in their 30s, who were arrested last month in north-east London on suspicion of handling stolen goods, were charged and remanded in custody.A further 15 people were arrested in relation to street-level offending such as robberies and pickpocketing.However, the force expressed frustration at phone companies includingApple, whose iPhones account for 80% of stolen phones in London. Apple had the ability to effectively render phone theft a crime of the past, Featherstone said.“We do have a frustration with this. We believe that Apple’s phones have the ability to use certain software and technology which prevents from being recycled,” he said.“The biggest problem is that while a phone would not necessarily be recycled in the UK – the network providers would not allow it – that isn’t the case if it leaves the country.”Featherstone said the Met “knows the technology” is there because Apple have no trouble blocking phones stolen from their stores.The group investigated had specifically targeted Apple products because of their profitability overseas, according to DI Mark Gavin, the senior investigating officer for Operation Echosteep.“We discovered street thieves were being paid up to £300 per handset and uncovered evidence of devices being sold for up to $5,000 in China,” he said.Explore more on these topicsLondonCrimeMetropolitan policeEnglandPoliceSmartphonesApplenewsShareReuse this content"

Anyone who failed to keep their eyes down was punished with a hit to the head.”Israeli forces intercepted all the boats of the Global Sumud flotilla (GSF), carrying more than 400 people including parliamentarians and the environmental campaignerGreta Thunberg, last week. Most of the people were held at Ketziot, a high-security prison in the Negev desert used primarily to detain Palestinians whom Israel accuses of involvement in terrorist activities.Israel’s foreign ministry has dismissed all claims of mistreatment of members of the flotilla as “brazen lies”, posting on X: “All the detainees’ legal rights are fully upheld.”The national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has said he was “proud” of the way staff behaved at Ketziot. He said in a statement on the activists: “They should get a good feel for the conditions in Ketziot prison and think twice before they approach Israel again.”Rafael Borrego, a Spanish activist and lawyer, told Reuters: “At any time that any of us called a police officer, we risked that seven or more fully armed people entered to our cell, as they did on mine, pointing us with weapons at our heads, with dogs ready to attack us, and being dragged to the floor. This happened on a daily basis.”The Australia and New Zealand branch of the Global Movement toGaza, part of the flotilla, said the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) had notified the family of one participant that he had reported being assaulted during the interception of his vessel, receiving injuries to his shoulder and ribs.It said the DFAT had been told the man was later attacked while in prison, slapped in the face, mocked and verbally abused, denied clean water and kept awake as guards shouted at him throughout the night.1:27'Our systems are betraying Palestinians,' says Greta Thunberg after Israel deportation – videoAda Colau, the leftwing former mayor of Barcelona, said on her return toSpainon Sunday night that the prison yard by her cell had been decorated with a huge photograph of a bombed-out Gaza, with a caption in Arabic that read: “Welcome to the new Gaza.”She said it showed that the jail was “the prison of a fascist state”. She said that when “we asked for a doctor, we were told that that was for humans”.Lorenzo D’Agostino, an Italian journalist, told the Guardian there were crew members who had urgently needed medication. “The Israelis ignored them,” he said. “When we all protested, they came in wearing riot gear, set dogs on us and aimed the laser sights of their automatic rifles at our heads.”He added: “When they stripped us of our shirts and of Palestinian symbols like the keffiyeh, they stamped on them forcefully.”D’Agostino and several other members of the flotilla said Israeli forces appeared to single out Thunberg for harsher treatment than the others. “I saw with my own eyes that they draped an Israeli flag over her while soldiers took selfies with her. Greta is a strong and courageous woman, but during detention she looked deeply shaken,” D’Agostino said.An email sent by the Swedish foreign ministry and seen by the Guardian confirmed that the activist had been forced “to hold flags” and had been “detained in a cell infested with bedbugs, with too little food and water”.The Israeli foreign ministry statement said Thunberg “did not complain to the Israeli authorities about any of these ludicrous and baseless allegations – because they never occurred”.At the White House, Donald Trump said Thunberg was “just a troublemaker”.“She has an anger management problem. I think she should see a doctor,” the US president told reporters. “She’s angry – if you ever watch her, she’s a young person, she’s so angry.”Thunberg arrived on a flight toGreeceon Monday, among 171 people Israel said it had deported. Speaking to the media, she said: “Let me be very clear: there is a genocide going on in front of our very eyes, a live-streamed genocide on all of our phones.”When journalists asked her about the alleged abuses, Thunberg chose instead to speak about the plight of the Palestinian people.“I could talk for a very, very long time about our mistreatment and abuses in our imprisonment, trust me,” the campaigner said. “But that is not the story. What happened here was Israel … continuing to worsen and escalate their genocide and mass destruction with genocidal intent, attempting to erase an entire population in front of our very eyes.”Monday’s expulsions brought the total number deported to 341, from 479 detained.The first of four Scottish people on the flotilla returned home to Glasgow on Monday. Margaret Pacetta, 72, described the detention in Israel as “absolute hell”.Pacetta, who has a broken leg, said the Israeli authorities took everything off her and made her remove her clothes in front of a man.She told a crowd who had gathered at the station to greet her: “They took all my meds … my inhalers and my nebuliser, they eventually gave the nebuliser back but threw the medicine for it away. They took my glasses off me and my hearing aids. They ripped my necklace off my neck and my watch.“They took everything. They took my T-shirt off me, they stripped me and opened the door and there’s a guy standing staring in.”Twenty-seven Greek nationals including a leftwing MP, Peti Perka, were also returning home on Monday after Athens’ foreign ministry announced it would dispatch a specially chartered plane to southern Israel’s Eilat-Ramon international airport.Greece’s centre-right government has faced mounting criticism over its hesitation to criticise Israel, with opposition parties and relatives of the activists accusing the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, of prioritising the two countries’ “strategic alliance”.The Greek foreign ministry lodged “a strong written protest” on Friday in which it called on Israel “to promptly complete the required procedures [of repatriation] and to respect the rights of the citizens involved”, but opponents noted it was only issued after complaints of official indifference by the activists’ relatives.Stopping short of naming Ben-Gvir, who was filmed taunting the activists as they came ashore, the ministry criticised “the unacceptable and inappropriate behaviour of an Israeli minister directed against Greek citizens”.Meanwhile, a new flotilla that set sail from Turkey is making its way toward Gaza and is about 200 nautical miles from the territory. It is carrying about 250 people including doctors, nurses and journalists on a ferry converted into a floating hospital.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

EDTSharePolice have disrupted an international network suspected of smuggling tens of thousands of stolen phones from the UK in its largest operation to tackle phone theft in London, theMetropolitan policesaid.The criminal organisation is believed to have smuggled up to 40,000 stolen phones from the UK toChinaover the past 12 months – up to 40% of all phones stolen in the capital, the Met said on Monday.The force launched Operation Echosteep in December 2024 after a box containing about 1,000 iPhones being shipped to Hong Kong was found at a warehouse nearHeathrow airport.Two-fifths of mobile phone thefts in Europe happen in UK, shows insurance dataRead moreOfficers discovered almost all the phones had been stolen, police said.They intercepted further shipments and used forensic evidence found on the packages to identify the suspects.A man was charged with handling stolen goods after being stopped with 10 suspected stolen phones at Heathrow on 20 September, the force added.Officers also discovered two iPads, two laptops and two Rolex watches.Further inquiries revealed the same man had travelled between London andAlgeriamore than 200 times in two years, police said.Two other men aged in their 30s were arrested three days later in north-eastLondonon suspicion of handling stolen goods.A number of phones were found in their car and about 2,000 more devices were found at properties linked to the suspects.They were subsequently charged and remanded in custody, police said.Two more men – also in their 30s – were arrested on 25 September on suspicion of money laundering and handling stolen goods after Met officers recovered about £40,000 in cash at a phone shop in Seven Sisters Road, Islington, north London.Officers also seized a number of stolen devices during the search.The men have since been bailed pending further investigation, police said.MPs accuse Apple and Google of profiting from rise in phone theftsRead moreOfficers carried out a total of 46 arrests after a two-week operation, including 11 arrests made while police tackled criminal gangs robbing delivery vans for the new iPhone 17.Another 15 people were arrested over the past week on suspicion of theft, handling stolen goods and conspiracy to steal, the Met said.More than 30 suspected devices were also found during searches at 28 properties across London and Hertfordshire.The mayor of London,Sadiq Khan, thanked the force for “responding to Londoners’ concerns”, with the Met adding that robberies and thefts in London had dropped by 13% and 14% respectively so far this year.“This is, without doubt, the largest operation of its kind in UK history, and it was humbling to see first-hand how the Met are going after the leaders of international smuggling gangs as well as the street robbers and snatchers fuelling this industrial-scale crime,” Khan said.But Khan also called on the mobile phone industry to assist authorities by making it impossible for smugglers to use stolen phones.“Criminals are making millions by repurposing stolen phones and selling them abroad, with many still able to access cloud services,” he said. “It’s simply too easy and too profitable.“I will continue to call on the mobile phone industry to go harder and faster in designing out this crime by making stolen devices unusable.“We need coordinated global action to shut down this trade and build a safer London for everyone.”Det Insp Mark Gavin, the senior investigating officer for Operation Echosteep, said: “Finding the original shipment of phones was the starting point for an investigation which uncovered an international smuggling gang which we believe could have been responsible for exporting up to 40% of all the phones stolen in London.”Gavin added smugglers specifically targeted Apple products because of their profitability overseas, with street thieves being paid up to £300 a handset and stolen devices being sold for up to $5,000 (£3,710) in China.This comes as cities around the world face a surge in mobile phone theft, with about 80,000 devices stolen in London last year, the Met said.Commander Andrew Featherstone, the Met’s lead for tackling phone theft, said: “This is the largest crackdown on mobile phone theft and robbery in the UK in the most extraordinary set of operations of this kind that the Met has ever undertaken.”Explore more on these topicsMobile

I think he may be backpacking in the backcountry in Idaho,” Bluestone told AFP.The Nobel committee also hit a roadblock trying to reach Brunkow – both researchers are based on the US West Coast, which is nine hours behind Stockholm – but eventually got ahold of her.“I asked them to, if they have a chance, call me back,” said Thomas Perlmann, secretary-general of the Nobel committee, at the press conference announcing the winners.The three won the prize for research that identified the immune system’s “security guards”, called regulatory T-cells.Their work concerns “peripheral immune tolerance” that prevents the immune system from harming the body, and has led to a new field of research and the development of potential medical treatments now being evaluated in clinical trials.Sakaguchi, 74, made the first key find in 1995, discovering a previously unknown class of immune cells that protect the body from autoimmune diseases.Brunkow, born in 1961 and now a senior project manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, and Ramsdell, a 64-year-old senior adviser at Sonoma Biotherapeutics, made the other key discovery in 2001.In 2020 the Nobel committee hadsimilar difficulties in contacting the winnersof the prize for economics. When Bob Wilson’s phone rang in Stanford in the middle of the night, he unplugged it so the committee had to call his wife instead.When the committee couldn’t reach his fellow winner, Paul Milgrom, either, Wilson had to go and wake him up. Footage from Milgrom’s security camera captured the moment he was told of his Nobel win, to which he responded “Yeah I have? Wow.”Explore more on these topicsNobel prizesnewsShareReuse this content"

Here is a look at what just happened, why – and what could come next.What just happened?Lecornu, who was appointed 27 days ago, tendered his resignation and that of his government on Monday, barely 12 hours after the key members of his cabinet had been announced. He became the shortest-lived prime minister in modern French history.The 39-year-old former defence minister, a close ally of Emmanuel Macron, was France’s fifth prime minister since the president’s re-election in 2022 and the third since Macron dissolved parliament and called early legislative elections that were held last summer.Lecornu blamed party-political intransigence, saying he had been “ready to compromise, but every party wanted every other party to adopt its full programme”. It would “not take much for it to work”, but “partisan attitudes” and “certain egos” stood in the way, he said.His departure alarmed markets, with the CAC 40 stock index dropping 2% and the euro 0.7%. France’s debt-to-GDP ratio is the EU’s third-highest after Greece and Italy, almost twice the 60% permitted under EU rules – as is its projected budget deficit of nearly 6%.After a meeting with Macron at the Élysée, Lecornu said he had agreed to the president’s request for one last heave in the negotiations. He would inform Macron by Wednesday evening “whether this is possible or not”, he said.Why did it happen?The roots of the crisis lie in that 2024 snap general election, which produced a hung parliament divided between three more or less equal blocs: the left, the far right and Macron’s own centre-right alliance, with no group coming close to a clear majority.A graphic showing the three main blocs in the national assembly as well as seat distribution by party or groupFrance’s financial crisis has only added to that instability, as have presidential elections due in 2027. Macron cannot stand again, and with each party keen to stake out its ground before the vote, common ground in parliament has become even harder to find.Lecornu faced the tough job of passing an austerity budget through the divided assembly aimed at reining in the yawning budget deficit – a task that defeated his two immediate predecessors,François BayrouandMichel Barnier, who were ousted by MPs over the plan.The immediate trigger for his resignation appears to have been the reaction of the centre-right Les Républicains (LR) to the new cabinet. The party said the largely unchanged lineup did not reflect the “profound break” with past politics that Lecornu had promised.But the announcement of the main cabinet posts on Sunday evening prompted fierce criticism from across the political spectrum, with allies and opponents denouncing it as either too right wing or not right wing enough, and threatening to topple the new government.The return of Bruno Le Maire, Macron’s economy minister for seven years, to government as defence minister particularly enraged politicians from most parties, who saw it as a confirmation that Macron’s pro-business economic policies were not up for discussion.His return, however, was as short-lived as it was controversial: on Monday evening Le Maire said he was pulling out of the government in an attempt to end the crisis.What could happen next?Government sources told French media that Macron would “assume his responsibilities” if the effort to reach a last-ditch consensus by Wednesday failed. It was not immediately clear what this may entail.Should that effort fail, Macron has three main options, none very appealing. First, he could name a new prime minister. A figure from within his own camp now appears unlikely, while even a moderate leftwinger would challenge his hard-won pension overhauls.On the other hand, appointing a confirmed rightwinger would infuriate the left bloc. Given the pressing need to achieve a minimum of consensus to at least pass a budget for this year, some analysts have suggested he may try to turn to a non-party political technocrat.Second, he could dissolve the national assembly and call fresh legislative elections, a move he has consistently said he is reluctant to do and which polls suggest would probably return another divided parliament – or potentially usher in a far-right government.The anti-immigrant National Rally of Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella have made clear this is their preferred option, calling on Macron to dissolve parliament and hold fresh elections.His final option would be to resign, but again, he has repeatedly ruled out standing aside before the presidential election in 2027 – a vote seen as a historic crossroads in French politics, with Le Pen sensing her best ever chance of taking power.The radical left France Unbowed has reiterated longstanding calls for the president to go.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

But the seasonal influx of tourists stretches the sanitation infrastructure to breaking point – and even a legal victory has not provided a solutionSupported byAbout this contentSoledad Dominguez in El Chaltén, ArgentinaMon 6 Oct 2025 08.00 EDTShareWhen people in the Patagonian village of El Chaltén saw untreated waste flowing into waterways and found the sewage plant was faulty, they grew increasingly concerned about the health risks from pollution in two glacier-fed rivers, the Fitz Roy and Las Vueltas.The incident in 2016 led Marie Anière Martínez, a conservationist with the Patagonian environmental organisation Boana, and Lorena Martínez, aLos Glaciares national parkofficial, to form a group to investigate water contamination at the Unesco world heritage site.View image in fullscreenThe park is the heritage of ‘all humanity’, says Marie Anière Martínez.Photograph: Natali OrmazabalLast year, they secured alandmark court rulingagainst water pollution in the Argentinian national park. Supported bythe Escazú agreement, a regional treaty on environmental rights, residents filed a collective lawsuit, forcing authorities to acknowledge failures in waste management and commit to upgrading systems by January 2025.Yet despite this victory, the pollution persists and activists are still calling for more robust enforcement. “What have the authorities done to prevent environmental damage?” asks Marie Anière Martínez.Nestled in a 135-hectare (330-acre) valley in the shadow of Mount Fitz Roy, El Chaltén is home to up to 2,900 people during high season in the area, which is a paradise for hikers exploring Patagonia’s spectacular trails.Los Glaciares protects part of the southern Patagonian ice field – a massive freshwater reservoir in South America. Spanning 600,000 hectares of lakes, forests and glacier-fed rivers, the national park includes the Las Vueltas River sub-basin, where231 ice bodies feed the watercoursesrunning through El Chaltén.View image in fullscreenWaste from a sewage outlet is discharged into the Fitz Roy River.Photograph: Natali OrmazabalBut environmental problems escalate during the peak tourist season, from November to April, when the village hosts up to 10,000 people a day, putting pressure on sanitation infrastructure.Complaints were first filed in 2022 by the community in El Chaltén, concerned about the sewage system’s collapse and the lack of clean energy. “In 2019, the Los Glaciares national park guidelines plan was developed with input from residents and experts,” says Lorena Martínez. “We had already warned about the lack of data and water monitoring.”We don’t know how, over time, sewage discharges into the river can impact ecosystemsPaula Chaparro, guideIn 2023, 21 residents sought an injunction to defend their constitutional right to a healthy environment. “We gathered previous studies, which already indicated that sewage effluent from the treatment plant of the public utility were reaching the Vueltas and Fitz Roy rivers without proper treatment,” she says.Local residents together with Martínez’s group, calledGuardians of the El Chaltén Basin, proved that untreated sewage and resistant bacteria from overflowing treatment plants were contaminating waterways, threatening public health, according to judges. But still residents are waiting for action.View image in fullscreenSewage along the Fitz Roy River, which flows through El Chalten.Photograph: Natali OrmazabalLike many in the village, Paula Chaparro, a mountain guide, has been involved in monitoring the water and public advocacy over pollution for more than a decade. “We don’t know how, over time, sewage discharges into the river can impact ecosystems,” she says. “The pollution goes beyond the village and affects the entire course of the Las Vueltas River to Lake Viedma.”The activists are now supporting new legal action against thenational parks administrationfor roadworks and other projects carried out in protected areas without environmental assessments.During the legal process, Karina Soledad Esquius and fellow biologists from the National University of Mar del Plata sampled water from 82 watercourses in the north of Los Glaciares park.View image in fullscreenA Nasa satellite image of the south Patagonian icefield, which straddles Chile and Argentina.

A court in Comodoro Rivadavia found that, according to a 2019 audit, the state utilities company was operating the treatment plant without monitoring liquid waste or assessing environmental or public health effects.The company acknowledged that the two treatment plants could not handle the number of visitors during high season. “The system collapses when the population jumps from under 3,000 to more than 14,000,” says Melina Lorenti, the residents’ lawyer. “The public utilities state company committed to having the modules fully operational by mid-January 2025 and launched a public tender – now under evaluation – to expand the plant.”The company says it has two treatment plants with a third under construction, and is increasing capacity. On 1 July last year, it invited bids for a grease and oil separation system to be added to the El Chaltén plant.The big mistake is that El Chaltén expanded rapidly without an environmental framework in placeMelina Lorenti, lawyerAccording to Adrián Alonso Durán, municipal director of environmental policy, the study on pollution in Las Vueltas River is inconclusive and needs more data. But he acknowledges the treatment plant’s limitations. “It has a fairly small capacity and does not operate at full capacity during the high season,” he says.He highlights less visible sources of pollution related to overtourism. “In restaurants, oil is often poured down the sink, which builds up and eventually clogs the pipes,” he says. “A municipal ordinance now requires the installation of grease traps in restaurants and hotels, which are mandatory for renewing commercial permits.”View image in fullscreenThe confluence of the Las Vueltas and Fitz Roy rivers.Photograph: Natali OrmazabalThe utilities company says it has worked with the municipality to better regulate wastewater discharges, especially from laundries, restaurants and hotels.The national parks administration, a federal agency under the authority of theclimate-change denier president, Javier Milei, did not respond to a request for an interview.‘Making Argentina great again’?

They also argue that AI performers do not get ill, do not need to have days off, do not get exhausted at the end of a shift, or feel humiliated by the demands made by clients.“Do you prefer your porn with a lot of abuse and human trafficking, or would you rather talk to an AI?” Steve Jones, who runs an AI porn site, asked. “We hear about human trafficking, girls being forced to be on camera 10 hours a day. You’ll never have a human trafficked AI girl. You’ll never have a girl who is forced or coerced into a sex scene that she’s so humiliated by, that she ends up killing herself. AI doesn’t get humiliated, it’s not going to kill itself.”View image in fullscreen‘Do you prefer your porn with a lot of abuse and human trafficking, or would you rather talk to an AI?’ says Steve Jones of porn.ai.Photograph: Bjoern Steinz/Panos PicturesMost sites provide users with a selection of ready-made girlfriend options on their homepages – predominantly smiling, white women in their early 20s – but also offer subscribers the chance to create their own fantasy online companion. The options provide insights into the website developers’ views on optimal female prototypes. On one site, available professions range from film star, yoga teacher and florist to lawyer and gynaecologist. Possible personality options include “submissive: obedient, yielding and happy to follow”, “innocent: optimistic, naive, and sees world with wonder”, and “caregiver: nurturing, protective and always there to offer comfort”. Users can dictate age, opting for teen models if they want them, and specify hair, eye and skin colours and breast sizes.Online brothels, sex robots, simulated rape: AI is ushering in a new age of violence against women | Laura BatesRead moreThe rising popularity of AI girlfriends has prompted unease among campaigners for women’s rights, who note that they embed unhelpful stereotypes. In her book The New Age of Sexism,Laura Batesobserves that AI companions are “programmed to be nice and pliant and subservient and tell you what you want to hear”.Amidrising concernabout AI-generated child sexual abuse imagery, developers at the Prague conference discussed ways that built-in moderation systems might prevent users from attempting to create illegal material, using key words and phrases such as “kid” or “little sister” to trigger alarms. But many sites allow users to choose to dress their AI girlfriend in school uniforms.View image in fullscreenMerchandise at the TES conference in Prague.Photograph: Bjoern Steinz/Panos PicturesAn employee of Candy.ai, one of the new AI dating sites exhibiting at the conference, said the site’s AI girlfriends offered a range of services. “If you want more adult-type relationships, like porn, we have this content. Or if you prefer to have deep conversations, that’s there as well. It really depends on what the user needs,” he said, while asking for his name not to be printed. Most users are heterosexual men, although AI boyfriends are also available. Some of the ready-made AI girlfriends are programmed to be willing to remove their clothes immediately. “Others will say: ‘No, I don’t know you.’ So you need to evolve the relationship with them in order to ask for something like this. It’s like a game, and the goal is to develop that full relationship,” the employee said.The development of AI girlfriend sites has been made possible by advances inlarge language modelsthat allow for more realistic conversations with chatbots, and rapid developments in AI image-making. Most sites still largely operate with text and images, although short AI-generated videos are becoming more widespread. The demand is highest in the 18-24 age group, among users who have grown up playing video games and creating avatars.There has been a rush of new businesses joining the sector in the past year. “AI products are appearing like mushrooms. It’s super dynamic right now – they appear, they burn out and they’re replaced by another 10,” Alina Mitt, of Joi AI, a site specialising in “ai-lationships”, said. “You need to be brave and strong to stay in this market. It’s like a bloody war.”Developers gave presentations highlighting the rapid improvements in the realism of AI-generated pornographic images and progress in moving towards convincing-looking AI video clips. Daniel Keating, the chief executive of a company that offers users the chance to talk to and watch AI girlfriends, gave a presentation aiming to show delegates the difference between mediocre AI-generated women and higher-quality AI girlfriends. His site offers users a selection of dozens of AI-generated women in their underwear; he highlighted how poor-quality AI gives women’s skin “an overly polished, plastic smoothness, shiny in the wrong places”, while a good-quality AI girlfriend incorporates “natural skin textures, bumps, imperfections, moles, freckles, slight asymmetries that appear much more natural”.View image in fullscreenThe UK regulator Ofcom highlights updates to Britain’s Online Safety Act at TES Prague.Photograph: Bjoern Steinz/Panos PicturesHis company was licensing images of established adult performers to create AI twins, allowing them to generate non-stop income. “It’s a win. Costs are lower. Creators love this because they don’t have to get dressed up and shoot the content,” he said.An advertising executive withAshley Madison, a dating website for people who may be married and are seeking to have discreet relationships, said she was concerned by the rapid growth of sites promoting AI relationships. “AI dating is very new for us. How do we deal with competitors which allow you to build your own fantasy rather than having a real connection with a woman?” she asked, also requesting not to be named. “Some people opt out of having real connections because they want to build whatever they want in their head. In the end when you want to actually meet someone, no one’s going to fulfil that expectation.”“It’s not replacing going out on a date and getting a girlfriend or having a lover, wife or a relationship. AI is a good place to let younger people practice their social skills,” Jones said, adding that AI allowed people to behave badly without consequences. “People will say things to an AI that would be abusive if they said them to a real person. Like: ‘Hey stupid slut, what’s up?’ In a fantasy roleplaying game, people like to be different than how they are in the real world.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)PornographySex workSexDatingnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s frightening viewing that refuses to hold backJack SealeMon 6 Oct 2025 16.00 EDTShareWell, that’s me never eating a protein bar again. Bars, shakes, powders and snack balls that promise a short-cut to a muscle-building higher protein intake constitute perhaps the biggest food-retail phenomenon of the past decade. And protein bars are at the forefront of the craze: this is doing us good, we tell ourselves, as we struggle to chew through a lump of uncanny matter that resembles a Mars bar from a malfunctioning factory. After watching the bracing campaigning documentary Joe Wicks: Licensed to Kill, that illusion will surely, for millions of consumers, be shattered.You know Joe Wicks, the baby-faced, curly bobbed geezer whopopped up during Covid lockdownand became a star through his easy, positive approach to exercise, leading the nation in daily bursts of squats and star jumps. Now, he’s going down the Jamie Oliver route of using his success – we see the country house fame has bought him, and, boy, it’s a whopper – for good by trying to shame the government into tackling a public health emergency.View image in fullscreenCooking up something demonic … Joe Wicks and Dr Chris van Tulleken in Joe Wicks: Licensed to Kill.Photograph: KEO FilmsProtein bars are to Wicks what Turkey Twizzlers were to Oliver, for similar reasons: they are almost always loaded with artificial additives, making many of them what these days is called ultra-processed food. These things are just not natural. The sweeteners and sticky gubbins that lurk within them have been linked to all sorts of health problems, from diarrhoea and other gut issues to an increased risk of stroke, cancer, and what this programme refers to, sweepingly but still frighteningly, as “early death”.This is true even when the additives are within legal limits, because those legal limits are so weak. Learning this has led Wicks to conceive a stunt that is admirable in its lack of compromise: rather than just politely ask for regulations to be tightened, Wicks plans to demonstrate how useless they are by designing, making, advertising and selling a protein bar that is intentionally harmful to the health of those who eat it.For this project he teams up withTV health journalist Dr Chris van Tulleken, who for these purposes resides in a laboratory bunker, lit in cold blue and adorned with shelves full of mysterious white powder and inscrutable clear liquid. The evil-professor vibes might be theatrical, but it’s obvious that Van Tulleken’s anger at the rise of what he calls “industrially produced edible substances” – he thinks “food” is a generous misnomer – is anything but. As he likens the prevalence of ultra-processed foods to the collective delusion of the mid-20th century, when the populace believed smoking was safe because companies who sold cigarettes had arranged for them to think that, he is visibly a man at the end of his patience.The duo’s assessment of the protein-bar and processed-food industry does not hold back. Numerous famous brands are mentioned by name. Nor do they accept half measures as they rope in an expert in food-product development, one of several industry whistleblowers who will help them along the way, to make the worst possible bar that can still legally be described as offering health benefits.With the demon bar made – marketing boffins come up with the cutely double-edged brand name “Killer” – the film takes a fascinating turn. Wicks, understandably, wobbles at the prospect of going through with the scheme and knowingly foisting poison on the public. The staff at Wicks HQ have to sign waivers before they taste-test the bar; his lawyer, a specialist in getting these things to market, says the Killer is legally fine but not something she would eat herself. Smiling, bouncing Joe Wicks faces a spiky ethical dilemma. Those YouTube videos where he did a bit of light aerobics feel a long way away. But Wicks still remembers growing up in poverty, and eating junk food without the means or knowledge to buy something better. He is torn.View image in fullscreenTotally torn … Joe Wicks and Dr Chris van Tulleken need to decide whether they can stomach feeding people the ‘killer’ bar they know to be harmful.Photograph: Anthony Harvey/Shutterstock for Channel 4Van Tulleken puts him straight. “We have to think in revolutionary terms,” he says, not in the least perturbed by a relatively small number of people potentially ingesting carcinogens at his behest for the benefit of the cause. Suddenly, Licensed to Kill, with its unabashed anger at rampant commercialism and its belief that the problem has gone far enough to demand radical, even reckless political action, feels like it might be part of something wider than an argument about snack food.At least, it will be when it’s a complete story. Frustratingly, the show ends abruptly just as Killer goes to market, with the fallout of that to be covered in an as-yet unscheduled follow-up. But the basic point has been made, with force. If Licensed to Kill leaves you hungry for more, maybe have an apple or a handful of nuts.Joe Wicks: Licensed to Kill is on Channel 4 now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewJoe WicksHealthFood TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

Beloved of anyone with any sense over a certain age (45), she was introduced to a new generation last year with the Disney+ adaptation ofRivals.Cooper purists would have preferred to watch the Rutshire chronicles in order: starting with Riders, first published in 1985, in which Rupert Campbell-Black, cad, heartbreaker, rider, is first introduced. But that’s a sidebar – what was striking about seeing Rivals as a box set was how well Cooper’s universe had aged. The chronicles distilled the 80s: the shoulder pads and puffball skirts; the obsession with class, aristocrats sneering at the Technicolored nouveau riche, both ignoring everyone else while they snipped about how warm their champagne was; the sexual politics, with harassment and assault so routine they were practically characters in their own right, a double act you could trust to move the plot along.View image in fullscreenAlex Hassell and Luke Pasqualino in the Disney+ adaptation of Rivals.Photograph: Robert ViglaskyWhile Cooper might have inhabited this age completely, she was never the proverbial fish not noticing the ocean because it’s everywhere. She had a humanity and an observational intelligence that you maybe wouldn’t guess from listening to her speak. Everyone, from the dog to the pony to her parents to her French exchange’s brother, was always “absolutely sweet” – unless, that is, they were “absolutely divine”. People got groped and worse in Cooper’s work, but that was never OK – it’s surprising how OK it is in many far more literary books of the era.She was upper-middle-class, which for practical purposes meant that her father had to work for a living, but she’d have described the classes more by their mores. The middle classes worried about everything, all the time – what other people might think, mainly – and the upper classes didn’t give a … well, she’d have said “stuff”. She was raunchy, at times incredibly so, but her language was never coarse.View image in fullscreenJilly, c1978.Photograph: Tony Evans/Timelapse Library Ltd/Getty ImagesShe’d describe her family life in fairytale terms: “Daddy went to Dunkirk and Mummy was terribly, terribly worried” (this is a real thing she said, to Kirsty Young on Desert Island Discs). They were both utterly beautiful, engaged in a lifelong love match, and this Cooper replicated in her own marriage, to a publisher of military histories, Leo Cooper. She was 24, he was 27, the union wasn’t without hiccups (he was a bit of a shagger), but she was never less than comfortable giving people the formula for a happy marriage, which is creaking bed springs but (big reveal), they’re creaking with all the laughter. He never read her books – he read Prudence once, when he had flu, and said it made him feel worse. She didn’t mind, and said it was reciprocated: she wouldn’t be seen dead reading military history.Always keep a diary – it’s very hard, when you’re 25, to remember what being 24 felt likePrudence (1978) was the fifth book in the Romance series, which started with Emily in 1975. If you came to Cooper backwards, having started in Rutshire, the Romances, AKA “those ones named after posh girls” – also Imogen, Bella, Octavia and Harriet – were close but no cigar, every hero feeling like a test-run for Campbell-Black, every heroine a little bit drippy. Plus, page for page (I haven’t actually run the numbers, but just trust me), there wasn’t as much sex in them. They were a bit uptight on matters of modesty, women always worrying that men would think they’re loose, men saying batshit things about why they preferred virgins (in much the same way, apparently, as a real man always wants to be the first to open a jar of Nescafé). I don’t know if I’d recommend reading these novels at a formative age. I thought for a while that that’s what posh people really thought.They were, however, incredibly tightly written, high-functioning romances, which is much harder than it sounds. You lived Harriet’s unwanted pregnancy, Bella’s pissy in-laws, Emily’s Scottish isolation – Cooper could take you from an all-is-lost moment to a lottery win of the heart, and you could never, even in the early days, put your finger on how she did it. One minute you’d be laughing at her incredibly close descriptions of the bed linen, the next you’d have tears in your eyes and no idea how they got there.View image in fullscreenAt home with her pets in 1982.Photograph: Kim Sayer/AlamyAsked how to be a writer, Cooper used to say the kind of thing that Ernest Hemingway would have said, if he could have been arsed to help out a novice: use all five of your senses, say how things smelled and looked and sounded and felt and tasted – it really lifts the prose. But probably more useful was: “Always keep a diary – it’s very hard, when you’re 25, to remember what being 24 felt like.” That’s one of the first things you notice, in the longer, more populated books, which have 17 heroines rather than just one, all with extremely posh names, unless they’re American, in which case they’re called Helen. Even an age difference of four years, between two sisters, between a man and a woman, you can hear in the dialogue.View image in fullscreenKatherine Parkinson and Danny Dyer in Rivals.Photograph:  /Robert ViglaskyThe origin story of Riders was so pitch-perfectlyJilly Cooperit can’t possibly have been true, except it definitelyistrue because London’s Evening Standard ran an appeal about it at the time: she finished the whole manuscript in 1970, well before the Romances, took it into the West End and left it on a bus. Some texture has been deliberately left out of this story – what, for instance, was so important in the West End that you would leave the only copy of your book on a bus, which is not that far from leaving your baby on a train? Surely an assignation, butwhat kind?View image in fullscreenJilly at her home near Stroud, October 2024.Photograph: Francesca Jones/New York Times/Redux/eyevineCooper was wont to amp up her own chaos and haplessness – loved telling people, for instance, that she was fired from 22 jobs when she started working – and this was just a charming shortcut to put people at their ease since there was nothing ditzy about her. She had a mind like a mantrap. Anyway, the manuscript never did turn up and she was so devastated that it took her more than a decade to start again. Praise be that she did, because these books are absolutely fantastic.The original cover of Riders has a guy’s hand on a woman’s jodhpurred butt, and one of them is carrying a riding crop, but it’s genuinely hard from the framing to figure out which – not uncharacteristic of her love arcs, actually. It’s never immediately obvious where they’ll land. To look at now, you’d think: that’s exactly the cover you’d expect a bonkbuster to have, but that’s because Jilly Cooper invented the bonkbuster (OK, fine, I’ll take your case for Jackie Collins, but some other time).View image in fullscreenA fan reading Polo by Jilly Cooper at a polo match in the CotswoldsPhotograph: Roger Hutchings/Corbis/Getty ImagesThat look wasn’t a cliche when Riders did it, and was considered quite scandalous, particularly in the kind of Cotswolds bookshops where all Cooper’s characters would have actually bought their books, had they had any time to read, which they absolutely did not, because they were always, always shagging. The books were banned in the school library of Cooper’s daughter, Emily (not named, I don’t think, after the novel), until the author pointed out that those filthy books were paying for the school fees, whereupon they were unbanned.View image in fullscreenWith her husband, Leo, in 1972.Photograph: David Reed Archive/AlamyBy the late 80s, Jilly Cooper was known, everywhere, as sex-obsessed. Spitting Image had a puppet of her, which just popped up and said “sex sex sex sex sex”, and she found that hilarious, whereas in fact it was condescending and rude, and I’d like to see anyone involved in Spitting Image sell 11 million of anything. She used to tell people that was a hangover from an all-girls boarding school: it turned you boy-mad – a classic narrative-build from someone raised in the 1940s upper-middle-classes, because she absolutely hated boarding school and thought it was like a prison. Of course, it would be unspeakably crass to dwell on the trauma; much funnier to ogle the caretaker.For my money, Rutshire should have ended at Polo (1991), a book so stunningly romantic that I can still start crying at the name “Perdita” and I sure as hell am not talking about Shakespeare’s one. The Man Who Made Husbands Jealous and Appassionata aren’t as good, and then we get into the exclamation mark titles (Score! Jump! Mount! Tackle! – that last written only two years ago, and it was flabby, but not gonna lie, I was happy to see the Campbell-Blacks again, even though Taggie had cancer).Cooper started her career in journalism (she interviewed Harold Pinter once, but was more famous for raunchy short stories and columns) and had a massive, unexpected soft spot for journalists – all of us, it often seemed. If you ever wrote about her, she’d write you a little postcard – a friend got a wooden postcard of Banksy’s gun-toting panda. I wrote about my ardent admiration when she got her OBE in 2004, and got a little card saying, “Thank you, but I didn’t realise I waslowbrow”, and I felt bad about that but I’m medium-sure she was joking.She was a magnificent storyteller who defies categorisation, having invented her own category. It’s impossible to say how she did it, but worth taking a look back at Riders to see if you can figure it out. It will take you eight hours, and you’ll need some champagne.Explore more on these topicsJilly CooperSexfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We’ve now been together for 30 years’Interviews byDave SimpsonMon 6 Oct 2025 09.44 EDTLast modified on Mon 6 Oct 2025 18.28 EDTShareGrant Nicholas, singer, songwriter, guitaristI wrote Buck Rogers in a drunken state in my flat in Camden, London. I’d broken up with my long-term girlfriend but was hoping that we’d get back together, which is why the chorus goes: “I think we’re gonna make it.” A friend had told me she was dating a guy who’d just done a car advert, which must have been in my head when I wrote: “He’s got a brand new car. Looks like a Jaguar.” The second verse, about us starting again in a house in Devon and drinking “cider from a lemon”, was probably inspired by playing gigs in little clubs down there when Feeder were starting out – and by my teenage years in Wales, when we mixed cider with lemonade. They were throwaway lyrics to get a song going. I never intended keeping them.Some time after that, I was asked if I’d be interested in co-writing songs with a band who were working with producer Gil Norton, the sort of thing which happened a lot in those days. Gil was top of my list of dream producers for our third album, Echo Park, because I loved his work with Pixies, but he was in demand and out of reach. Taking up the offer was a way of meeting him.We had a few drinks in my local, went back to my flat and I played him some songs. As soon as Gil heard my old rough demo of Buck Rogers, he said: “That’s a hit.” The record company said the same thing. I tried to tell all of them: “It’s not finished!” But everyone insisted changes would ruin it.When we recorded it with Gil, he kept the “It’s got a CD player … player … player” effect from my original demo, because he thought it made a great hook. We repeated it for “lemon … lemon … lemon”.Jon Leeloved the song more than I did, but he was never happy with his drums and replaced them at the last minute. He played all the parts in one or two takes because he was a great drummer, and just gave it a bit more energy.Even at that stage, I thought the song would end up as a B-side at best. I would have been quite happy to leave it off the album – but it’s probably just as well I left it on! I must have written more than 300 songs but Buck Rogers is the one everybody knows and loves. It’s popular with cover bands and people sing it at karaoke. I went through a period of refusing to play it live, but I’ve made my peace with the song now. My wife finds the whole thing hilarious. She was the girlfriend who inspired it, and we did “make it”. We’ve now been together for more than 30 years.Gil Norton, producerMy wife was a big Feeder fan. I didn’t know them so much but I did really like their songHigh. Then, when I was working with an American band called SR-71, Grant’s name came up as a potential collaborator. We met and he played me Buck Rogers assuming it was a throwaway song that he was going to give to another band and never hear again. But I said: “You can’t give that away! You should keep it for yourself.”We started recording in the Kinks’ studio, Konk, near where we both lived in London, but there were electrical problems so we relocated to Great Linford Manor, near Milton Keynes. The vocals on Buck Rogers will be a very early take. I liked to get a guide vocal down and work from that, because you get a more honest, innocent take on the lyrics. I don’t remember Jon redoing the drums but I’m not saying it didn’t happen. He was the band’s grounding influence. Whenever there were any doubts, he’d be the person going: “Don’t worry. This is great.”Grant actually tried changing the words – especially the lines about the house in Devon and the cider lemonade – but I thought it was great imagery so convinced him to leave them well alone. Sometimes you don’t need to be Shakespeare – you just need to tell a story. Buck Rogers is seen as lightweight but if you listen closely, it’s actually quite a deep, emotional song. The best songs strike something within you, even if you don’t know what it is.A deluxe reissue of Feeder’s album Comfort in Sound is out now on BMG.Feeder play Bristol Beacon on 9 October and O2 Academy Birmingham on 11 OctoberExplore more on these topicsCultureHow we madePop and rockIndiefeaturesShareReuse this content"

So I started to log and learn every new word I came across, and felt my brain begin to flexEmma LoffhagenMon 6 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 6 Oct 2025 13.39 EDTShareAs a child I devoured books until my eyes blurred. When my GCSEs came around, I exercised the stamina of a monk, revising for hours without pause. But in recent years, I’ve watched that capacity for intense concentration dissolve into infinite scrolling on my phone. My attention span now contracts like a slug at the touch of a finger. Reading for pleasure feels less like nourishment and more like endurance training. And for someone who writes for a living, this is a professional hazard as well as something that made me sad. I wanted to restore that mental elasticity, to halt the brain rot.So, about a year ago, I made a small vow: every time I came across a word I didn’t know – whether in a novel, an article, or an overheard conversation – I would look it up and write it down. Nothing elaborate, no leather-bound journal or fountain pen. Just a running list kept, ironically, on my phone. Each week, I’d spend a few minutes reading the list back in an attempt to lodge the word into my memory.The list now spans almost 20 pages, and this tiny ritual has been quietly transformative. The payoff is less about peacocking with obscure adjectives – which, let’s face it, can make you sound insufferable – and more about the mental calisthenics of the ritual. Each time I look up and record a word, I feel a faint stretch, as though some neglected part of my brain is flexing again. Even if I never deploy “eidolon” in conversation, the very act of noticing, logging and revising it interrupts the slide into passive, semi-skimmed attention.View image in fullscreenCombating the brain rot … Emma at home, making a list of words on her phone.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianThere is also a journalling element to it – it functions as something of a diary, a record of where I’ve been reading, what I’ve been thinking about and who I’ve been listening to.Not that it’s an easy habit to keep up. It is often extremely impractical. If I’m reading on the tube, I have to stop mid-paragraph, pull out my phone and type “millenarianism” into my Google doc while trying not to elbow the stranger pressed against me. It can slow my reading to a maddening crawl. (The Kindle, with its built-in dictionary, is much kinder). And then there’s the revising (which I often forget to do), dutifully scrolling through my growing word-hoard like I’m preparing for a vocabulary test.Realistically, I incorporate maybe 5% of these words into my everyday speech. “Incorrigible” made the cut. “Lugubrious” too. But most of them remain like museum pieces – admired and catalogued but rarely handled.The one change that worked: I started sketching – and stopped doomscrollingRead moreStill, it’s made my mind much sharper. I find myself reaching less often for the same tired handful of adjectives, and more often for something precise and muscular. Few things are more satisfying than unearthing the exact word you were searching for – like finding the missing puzzle piece that locks the picture into place.In an era when our devices siphon off our attention with merciless efficiency, it feels subversive to use mine as a tool for slow thinking. And it has given me back something I feared I’d lost – the pleasure of exercising a mind that, after years of slack scrolling, is finally waking up again.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

That’s exactly why we love itThe actor famous for intensely immersing himself in film roles has spoken out about the technique and the attempts of others to ape itStuart HeritageMon 6 Oct 2025 10.24 EDTLast modified on Mon 6 Oct 2025 11.14 EDTShareIt has been a while since anyone saw or heard fromDaniel Day-Lewis. After he issued the statement “Daniel Day-Lewis will no longer be working as an actor,” in 2017 before the release of The Phantom Thread, the man quietly faded from view. However, in his absence, it’s fair to say that his legend grew somewhat.Largely, this legend revolved around his favoured style of working. As someone who famously prefers to disappear into his characters while making a film – forLincoln, he had Steven Spielberg call him “Mr President” for the duration of the shoot – the world has grown increasingly obsessed with his process. Did he really send texts to Sally Field as Abraham Lincoln? Did he only eat animals he’d killed and skinned himself for The Last of the Mohicans? Did he insist on being spoon-fed food for My Left Foot?Madness in their method: have we fallen out of love with actorly excess?Read moreHowever, now Daniel Day-Lewis is back in the limelight, somewhat reluctantly, for his new filmAnemone. And he is using this as an opportunity to vocalise his anger at how method acting is perceived. “I’m a little cross these days to hear all kinds of people gobbling off and saying things like ‘gone full method’, which I think is meant to imply that a person’s behaving like a lunatic in an extreme fashion,” he told the New York Times. “Everyone tends to focus on the less important details of the work, and those details always seem to involve some sort of self-flagellation or an experience that imposes upon oneself a severe discomfort or mental instability. But of course, in the life of an actor, it has to principally be about the internal work.”To be honest, this sounds as if Day-Lewis has burrowed out of his hole and found himself aghast at the world that has been created in his image. If you’re widely considered to be one of the greatest actors to ever work, and your process involves headbutting a dummy until you break your nose (Gangs of New York) or spending two days in solitary confinement without food or water (In the Name of the Father), then it stands to reason that other actors will want to fill that vacuum by trying to mimic your hero.View image in fullscreenFunctionally Italian … Lady Gaga in House of Gucci.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/APIn other words, we now live in a landscape full of half-cocked Day-Lewis impersonators who want nothing more than to show the world the sheer amount of effort they put into a character. At the shallow end of the pool we have people likeLady Gaga, who was so desperate to win an Oscar for House of Gucci that she spent the whole campaign trying to convince everyone that she became functionally Italian for a year and a half in preparation.Then we have Jared Leto, who chose to immerse himself in the character of the Joker (in, of all things, Suicide Squad) by sending “horrifying” gifts to his castmates. These, depending on who you ask, range from dead pigs and rats to anal beads and used condoms, althoughLeto denied those worst excesses. And then, of course, we have Jim Carrey, who went so deep into Andy Kaufman for Man on the Moon that they literally managed to get afeature-length documentaryout of B-roll of him making life as impossible as he could for everyone around him.The main Method Guy at the moment would appear to beJeremy Strong(once Day-Lewis’s assistant), whose process during Succession was so laboriously intensive that it formed the basis of a derisive New Yorker profile, full of quotes from people who were either concerned for his behaviour (“It’s the cost to himself that worries me,” said Brian Cox) or annoyed beyond all measure by it (“I remember [him] making everyone else roll their eyes,” said an unnamed co-star).Daniel Day-Lewis says he ‘never intended to retire, really’Read moreThere are so many other examples. Andrew Garfield went celibate for six months for Silence. Leonardo DiCaprio slept in an animal carcass for The Revenant. There’s a fighting chance that Austin Butler still speaks like Elvis Presley, three years after that film came out. All of this, to some extent, is meant to invoke the seriousness in which Day-Lewis takes his work.And, while his fightback against method detractors might be noble, a brief promotional cycle might not be enough to change anyone’s mind, let alone their behaviour. Perhaps if he wants to remind people what method acting is, or to show them what it can achieve, then Day-Lewis’s best bet is to simply start making more films. Surely we could all get behind that.Explore more on these topicsFilmDaniel Day-LewisCelebrityFilm industrynewsShareReuse this content"

That’s understandable – but completely wrongZoe WilliamsThe world’s most successful democratic party is in a death spiral of its own making – leaving no bulwark between the moderate and truly far rightMon 6 Oct 2025 11.18 EDTLast modified on Mon 6 Oct 2025 13.45 EDTShareThere have been times in living memory that Conservative leaders have sounded almost sensible on the surface – and times where they have sounded animal crackers, yet were still adored by their party. This is not either of those times. Kemi Badenoch left the crowd unmoved when she addressed her conference, even as she threw out thered meat of migrant-baitingshe thought they wanted. It’s not so much that they’d all woken up with a renewed sense of humanity; more that they didn’t believe she’d ever be in a position to deliver it. It was, in effect, fake vegan meat. Tories hate that. One senior Conservative apparently called it a “New Orleans funeral”: noisy, energetic, but still a goodbye.What next for the group with a decent case to make for itself as the most historically successful democratic party in the world? Some are having another squiz at Robert Jenrick, who was a hard “no” at the start of the night – but now it’s the end, and everyone else has left. Others are creating a buzz around Katie Lam, a 34-year-old MP of the 2024 intake, who looks like a Shires Tory whilewallpapering her socialswith anti-migrant content. Could she be the figurehead to beat back Reform, nowoutpolling the Conservatives by 20 points? Is there a word for beating your rivals by becoming exactly like them? And, if there isn’t, surely we could borrow one from martial arts?If you’re enjoying any of this, in a how-the-mighty-are-fallen way, in a serves-them-right-for-austerity way, that is understandable – but absolutely bananas. You don’t even have to look at the US to know this, nor read Daniel Ziblatt’s seminal 2017 book,Conservative Parties and the Birth of Democracy: every one of your synapses is screaming it. The mainstream right is the essential firewall against the far right.Ziblatt’s thesis is that democracies survive by keeping the “propertied and powerful” happy. I’m not wild about it as an organising principle. It feels as though we’ve been keeping the propertied and powerful happy for ages, at the expense of everyone else, and they never seem quite happy enough to stop wanting to take a bite out of disability benefits. But his analysis isn’t a hunch, it’s an archival deep dive into the pre-Nazi German National People’s Party during the Weimar Republic (along with the BritishConservativescirca 1906). When the mainstream right loses its confidence, when it starts to chase the buzzwords and symbolic politics of the far right, it hands them the steering wheel.View image in fullscreenOne nation, divided?Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAWe saw some of this during the Brexit years – Boris Johnsoncosying up to Steve Bannonwas one particularly egregious examples – but far-right flirtation has become so pronounced now as to obliterate any other Tory talking points. What happened to the old-school Conservatives, who treasure stability, conservation, the constitution, the pride of Britain on the world stage? What happened to the modernisers, who described the nation in terms of powerhouses, not powder kegs? Don’t get me wrong, I wasn’t wild about any of them either, but it’s absolutely striking how those worldviews – the one nation Tory, theCameroonian Conservative– have been erased, in favour of relentless demonisation: of migrants, Muslims, benefit claimants and protesters.They walk on stage to music that sounds like the theme tune to Game of Thrones, and talk about what they cannot stand for any more. They describe demonstrations by 75-year-old pacifists as “carnivals of hatred” and use flags – union flags, Saint George’s flags, anything with a splash of matadorial colour – as an open challenge to anyone who doesn’t think being British through and through is the best thing a person could possibly be. There doesn’t seem to be any natural braking system, where they check back in with their own values, their own hinterland, their own plan. Any stick Nigel Farage throws for them, they’ll chase. So, no, it’s not fun to watch them implode. They’re taking civil society down with them.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsConservative leadershipOpinionConservativescommentShareReuse this content"

But where will the crackdown on Britain’s democratic freedoms end?Owen JonesIn making dissent a privilege, not a right, Labour is crafting a repressive toolkit. Imagine it in the hands of a Farage governmentMon 6 Oct 2025 13.13 EDTLast modified on Mon 6 Oct 2025 13.22 EDTShareIn Britain, protest is no longer a right. Instead, it is a privilege that is granted – or withheld – at the whim of those in power. This is the implication of new rules that the Labourgovernment is proposing, which would dictate the time and place that protests are permitted to occur, and carry the risk of prison time for those who defy orders. Successive governments had already chipped away at this right: the last Conservative administration granted the police sweeping new powers, which theUnited Nations’ human rights chiefcondemned as “serious and undue restrictions” on democratic freedoms. Taken together, these incremental assaults on freedom have effectively abolished the hard-won right to freedom of protest.The latest assault is justified by last week’s heinous antisemitic attack on a mosque in Manchester. There should be universal agreement that the security of British Jews must be protected. Using this atrocity as a justification to throttle dissent is not only unrelated to that duty, but perverts it. Consider Britain’s history of protest and direct action against racism and fascism, from thebattle of Cable Streetin 1936, to postwar Jewish anti-fascist movements such as the 43 or 62 Group, or the mobilisations against the National Front in the 1970s. Many of these protesters were derided as extremists in their day, even while they were fighting for the rights of minorities.In today’s upside-down world, here’s what is actually going on. Israel – a foreign state – iscommitting genocide. Its war crimes have led the international criminal court to issue arrest warrants against Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defence minister. Public opinion in the west hasturned sharplyagainst Israel’s violence. In Britain, a large majority of peoplebelieve Israelhas likely committed war crimes. Most people wouldback a total banon arms sales to the state, andsupport the arrestof Netanyahu.Having long since lost the argument, Israel’s cheerleaders are now seizing on a vile antisemitic crime to try to silence a mass movement against a moral catastrophe. The British government are included in this. Ministers have failed to impose large-scale sanctions on Israel, and have allowedarms exportsto continue. As the US author Ta-Nehisi Coates recently said of the Democrats, “if you can’t draw the line at genocide, you probably can’t draw the line at democracy”. The same applies to the Labour government.People who are protesting against the erasure of Gaza have been deemed hateful extremists. But there is a reason that there hasn’t been a more extensive crackdown on these protesters before now. The former cabinet minister Penny Mordauntrecently claimedthat demonstrators were calling for “death to Jews”, but the reality is that so few protesters have made hateful (and thus illegal) statements about Jews that the police have had no reason to crack down on them. Meanwhile, Jewish protesters marching for Palestinian lives have been slandered. After one such protester told the BBC that he had joined every protest for the last two years,Ben Houchen, a non-Jewish Tory Lord, called him a “useful idiot”.Collapsing Jewish identity into the actions of the Israeli state is not only cynical, it is dangerous. The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliancedefinition of antisemitism, adopted by the British government and many other institutions, has been rightly challenged forstifling critique of Israel. But there should be no controversy over one of its examples: that “holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel” is antisemitic. Despite this, Israel’s defenders have repeatedly attempted to conflate criticisms of Israel with antisemitic attacks on all Jewish communities, regardless of what many Jewish people make of these actions.This is why we’re now at a point where the Metropolitan police can suggest that protests opposing Israel’s crimes should be called off on the basis that they could “inadvertently or deliberately” endorse antisemitism, and why whyPriti Patel, the Conservative shadow foreign secretary, has declared that Labour’s belated recognition of Palestinian statehood had rendered the party “complicit in the appalling abuse we see across our streets and across Britain’s Jewish community”.On the same day as the synagogue attack, the Israeli army killedat least 57 Palestiniansin Gaza– another hideous tally in two years of daily atrocities that have left tens of thousands dead. British politicians and media outlets have barely concealed the lack of value they attach to Palestinian life. It is among the most brazen expressions of racism of our time. One wonders how history will judge this moment: politicians are accusing people who are protesting against genocide of inciting hatred, while they are supporting those who are committing genocide.Our government has already crossed a dangerous threshold by proscribing Palestine Action, a non-violent, anti-genocide direct action group.More than 2,000 British protesters have been arrested, mostly for holding placards opposing genocide and supporting the banned organisation. Many of them are pensioners; one is a retired priest, another the daughter of a Holocaust survivor. When the state begins calling movements “terrorism” when they are nothing of the sort, it is attacking democracy itself.It’s not hard to see where this all leads. In the US, Democrats helped to demonise pro-Palestinian protests: the former house speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested that some were“connected to Russia”, while Joe Bidencalled such protests antisemitic. In doing so, they only helped to legitimise the authoritarian crackdown on such protests – and on freedom of expression in general – under Donald Trump. If Nigel Farage becomes prime minister, a hard-right government would be granted sweeping powers to control dissent. What do you think a Reform government would do with this repressive toolkit? Our ancestors struggled, suffered and died to secure our freedoms. We will come to rue how casually we let them go.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It is comical, but also worryingMon 6 Oct 2025 12.03 EDTLast modified on Mon 6 Oct 2025 13.08 EDTShareIf last year’s general election marked the death of the Conservative party,this week’s conference in Manchesteris the wake. Based on the policies unveiled in recent days, one can only assume there’s an open bar.Watching Kemi Badenochkick things off on Sundayby setting out plans to leave the European convention on human rights (EHCR), it was hard to know what to focus on: the unhinged idea or remembering who exactly Badenoch was. Kimmy, is it? I’m trying to place her. Since being elected last November, the former engineer has turned being the leader of the opposition into a part-time job to the extent that you half expected conference to start with a missing person’s appeal.Still, she’s here now! And she’s making up for lost time. Badenoch’s pledge to get rid ofthe landmark Climate Change Actwas dismissed as “catastrophic” by former prime minister Theresa May, business groups, scientists and the Church of England before delegates had even made it up the M40. Not that we should be worried. You can trust Badenoch’s scientific credentials. She thinks she was offered a place to study for a(pre) medical degree.And she’s not stopping at the climate. Badenoch wants you to know she’s up for a bonfire of treaties to curb immigration and protect Britain from “the radical Islamist ideology” and “values hostile to our own”. The Human Rights Act! Legal aid for migrants! Basic decency! Everything must go!Meanwhile, the shadow chancellor, Mel Stride, set out plans tocut social security spending by £23bnby limiting benefits to people with UK citizenship, removing it even from those who have been in the country for decades and have indefinite leave to remain. Asked by the BBC how such people could survive financially, Stride said: “If they’ve come from other parts of the world, they would have an option to return to those other parts.”It all rather has the air of your ex-boyfriend screaming incoherently on the driveway, begging for another chance. Suddenly, it’s very clear why you blocked his number.Badenoch will break convention on Wednesday by making a second leader’s speech at conference, not dissimilar to a supermarket 2 for 1 deal to offload out-of-date meat. With their number of MPs slashed from 365 to 121, two-thirds oflocal council seats wiped out, and Reform dominating in the polls, Tory conference 2025 is not so much a quest for relevance but a cry for help. Few cries were more repulsive than the promise to create a£1.6bn “removals force”based on the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) currentlydragging naked children from their bedsin the US.Britain’s so-called natural party of government and one of the most successful electoral forces in history has been reduced to cosplaying as Donald Trump, pitching a briefcase of divisive and inhumane policies in order to get some attention from the electorate. At the time of writing, part-time employee Badenoch has not got round to explaining what would happen to the 150,000 people she wants to deport. Asshe told the BBC: “I’m tired of us asking all of these irrelevant questions about where should they go?”At least one person at conference seems to be enjoying themselves. Though he denies it,self-avowed non-xenophobeRobert Jenrick is said to be using the time out of office to soft launch his leadership campaign, with allies reportedlycollecting letters of no confidenceready for when the party rules say Badenoch can be challenged next month. Or as one shadow ministerput it ahead of conference: “I’m going there to be loyal. Can I say that about my colleagues? No, but then some of them are twats.”Quite. It tells you something about where the Conservative party now resides that Jenrick’s early leadership rival could beKatie Lam– a woman who has only been an MP for 15 months and mainly talks about migrants and sexual assault. “We already have British sex criminals,” Lam recently tweeted. “We don’t need any more!” Hard to disagree with the logic there.Any progressive would be well within their rights to feel rather smug watching all this. From Brexit to austerity, Windrush to Covid VIP lanes, the Tory vandals of Britain are getting further and further away from the levers of power and no one could deserve obscurity more. And yet it is hard to be celebratory. The electoral decline of the Conservative party being followed by the rise of Reform feels akin to an exterminator finally getting rid of the rats from your basement only to say he’s found a termite infestation rotting the walls. Out with one, in with another.The death of the Tories – if such a thing has not been greatly exaggerated – has not meant the death of its economic and social project. British politics has continued to drag rightwards long after Liz Truss wasousted in a sports hallat 6am, pulled by the tide of global rightwing populism and a conservative press to new darker waters. Indeed, ideas about immigration that would have been seen as fringe even a few years ago are now being applauded from the main stage at the Conservative party conference.“We have listened, we have learned and we have changed,”Badenoch told delegates on Sunday. But the Tories have only listened to Nigel Farage, they have learned nothing, and if they have changed, it is in the same way a crab spider morphs its colour to catch prey. The real question is, what will happen if the party gets a leader with some work ethic and skill? The progressive fight is not over – it’s just begun.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

How far can he take the party?Mon 6 Oct 2025 08.58 EDTLast modified on Mon 6 Oct 2025 12.21 EDTShareThe Green party members in Bournemouth at the weekend were, largely, exuberant. More than one person I spoke to used the word “joyful”. “The energy is amazing,” said Jean Lambert, the former London MEP. “It’s exceeded my expectations,” said the new leader,Zack Polanski. “Even the most unfriendly journalist can’t find anyone that isn’t fired up and ready to go.”Polanski himself contributed to this feeling. He has a talent for expressing members’ views clearly and without fearing how the rightwing press might respond. The recent boost he’s brought to the party’s profile combines the gnawing anxiety produced by rising Faragism, the experience of watching a genocide in real time, anger at inequality, Keir Starmer’s move to the right and profound climate anxieties, with an overwhelming feeling of relief: “thank God someone’s saying this.”Where once there was a nervousness about defending controversial but internally popular policies such as drug decriminalisation or denouncing Israeli “apartheid”, the party has now abandoned this caution – and members love it. Standing ovations used to be a rarity at Green conferences. Polanski got multiple.He benefited from a surprising consensus about external messaging – his speech focused on ending what he called “rip-off Britain” bynationalising public utilitiesandtaxing wealthto fund public services such as childcare. Prominent members I spoke to from across the party’s spectrum largely agree that this is the right approach.Migration is Britain’s superpower. Our future depends on embracing that truth, not denying it | Zack PolanskiRead moreThe two new deputies – Rachel Millward and Mothin Ali –contributed, too. As Alex Armitage, a councillor with the (independent) Scottish Green party in Shetland, who travelled to Bournemouth for the conference, said, itwas their speecheswhich “emotionally grounded and unified the party”. When Millward reworked the old “first they came for the …” poem to add lines about how people fought back, when Ali talked about telling his son that he thinks he isn’t a good politician, but he hopes he’s a good man, many members were in tears.Part of the reason for this level of emotion is the party’s recent success. It’s grown from 58,000 members in December to86,000 today. Justsix years ago, it was consistently polling at around 2%. Now, that’sabove 10%. The number of Green councillors has gone fromfewer than 200tonearly 900over the same period. The number of MPs has gone from one to four.Partly, it comes from the feeling of moving in the right direction in other ways, too. Many members have long been concerned about the party being overly white. While that’s still true, there were, as party chief executive, Harriet Lamb, said to me, “more global majority Greens at this conference than ever before”. An anti-racism policy, described by another senior official as creating “a toolkit for unpicking the structures of racism”, internally passed overwhelmingly, and Polanski told me that 30% of people on the party’s “pathway to parliament” scheme are from the global majority.What’s also important is that, for many members, the last few annual conferences have been – as more than one person said – “horrible”, marred by transphobic behaviour. Polanski highlighted the difference this year. “When someone’s won 85% of the vote when they are LGBT and explicitly LGBT inclusive,” he says, “I think that is about as strong a mandate as the party can give to say ‘we’ve moved on from those days’, and actually now let’s focus on the cost of living, and inequality and the climate crisis”.Some motions were more contentious – a policy entitled “abolish landlords” (which might have more accurately been called “phase out the need for landlords”) passed. There was some opposition to a motion calling for the Israeli military to be proscribed as a terrorist organisation, but that too passed.But, mostly, the party was focused on steering activist energy into winning new seats: it’s now confident of getting at least one Welsh Senedd member in May, and aiming for two. London’s local elections will be a big focus. And it’s hoping to win mayoralties in Hackney, Norfolk and Suffolk, and Sussex and Brighton – in the latter two, against Reform – in the latter,Millward herself is the candidate.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Well, more of a light drizzle actually, but three flotations or float announcements in the space of a few days will be a relief for the parchedLondon Stock Exchange.The biggest is Shawbrook, a bank focused on buy-to-let mortgages and lending to small businesses. It was taken off the market in 2017 by a pair of private equity firms, BC Partners and Pollen Street, and should now return by the end of the year with a likely £2bn-ish valuation.The timing is superficially odd because the talk is of higher taxes on banks in Rachel Reeves’s budget next month, but makes sense in other ways. Bank valuations have soared in the past 18 months, helped by a benign climate for bad debts and a backdrop of (slowly) falling interest rates. From the point of view of private equity sellers wishing to cash in a few chips, wider price-to-book valuations count for more than a possible tweak to bank levies.Yet Shawbrook’s intended initial public offering (IPO) is exactly the sort that London should land every time. The US is not an option for a UK-only lender of £2bn size. It’s good that it is happening, but let’s not pretend that the wider weather has changed overnight. Much the same can be said of the Cheshire-headquartered Beauty Tech Group, a maker of LED face masks thatdebuted last week at £300m, and the Liverpool-based food business Princes, targeting a £1.5bn listing by the end of the month. In the old days there was a steady stream of such arrivals.What have been more conspicuously missing are big, splashy arrivals of companies that have options on where to list. It is why SoftBank’s decisionto choose the US Nasdaq market for $65bn Arm Holdings in 2023was felt so keenly.There is one possibility on the horizon that may fit the bill. Visma is a €19bn (£16.5bn) Norwegian software company, majority-owned by the private equity firm Hg, whichreportedly has a preference for London over Amsterdamfor its planned IPO next year. Given the size, that would represent a proper win. The reverse, of course, is also true: given the pre-publicity, it would now be a bad blow for London if Visma were to opt for any other venue.Hopes were lower for Revolut, the most valuable UK fintech firm, until the Sunday Timesreported recentlythat the novel idea of a dual listing in New York and London, with enough of a UK flavour to allow entry into the FTSE 100 index, was under consideration. With the suggested £55bn price tag, Revolut would genuinely change the mood.London needs all sizes of new listings, of course – the domestic operators and internationally active multibillion operators. But it’s the latter, inevitably, which creates more buzz.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Our message to the British public was clear: that we offer decency, not decline, and that we’re determined to build a Britain that is better for all.As education secretary, I’ve led this mission from the front: announcing the roll-out offree breakfast clubs, thereturn of maintenance grantsfor low-income students – delivering opportunity for young people, and showing that education is the key to giving them the freedom to choose their own path in life. This year, I’ve been putting our party’s values of solidarity, compassion and social justice into action, delivering on the pledges we made at the last election.But none of this has happened by accident. There’s a reason I’ve been able to givemillions of free breakfaststo our poorest children, that I’ve been able torevive Sure Startfor a new generation, that I’ve secured thebiggest ever expansionof free school meals that will lift 100,000 more children out of poverty.It happened because I had a seat at the table, because I had the power in government to fight for policies that unite our whole movement.But I’m not going to stop there. I want a mandate to do more: on tackling child poverty, our party’s historic mission, and to spread more opportunity for young people, delivering the policies that our members want to see.Make no mistake, change is on the ballot in this deputy leadership election. The choice is what kind of change. Members can choose to push our government to be bolder, to go further and do more with me as their voice at the cabinet table, or they can choose the kind of division and disunity that fills the pages of the rightwing papers and energises our opponents.Choosing that path isn’t risk-free or without consequence. It would be a mandate for more of the disruption we’ve seen in recent weeks, permission to throw more stones, to create more distraction from our crucial mission of giving working people better lives. It would be a vote for instability, a vote to divide our party, to pit regions against each other, and hand our political opponents the upper hand with crucial elections just around the corner. It’s a vote, quite simply, that puts us back on the dark road back to opposition.After 14 years of Tory misery, the last thing our members want, and the last thing our country needs, is to take that path. I want all of us to come together to tell that hopeful story about how our policies are changing the lives of young people.Too often, Labour’s achievements in key policy areas have gone unnoticed because of unforced errors, and strong announcements have been obscured by self-generated noise. It frustrates me, just as it frustrates you.I’m not going to pretend we’ve not made mistakes as a government. I’ve been the first to admit it – that’s why I’ll never shy away from offering challenge where I think we should do better. I know the importance of fighting my corner and airing concerns, but I do so where those concerns belong – in private.And while I’m not going to defend our errors, neither will I shy away from promoting our successes. That is what the deputy leader’s role is all about. Angela Rayner knew this well: it’s why she encouraged us to focus on the 90% of things we got right, rather than the 10% of things we got wrong.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But lasting peace cannot be built on the denial of basic rightsMon 6 Oct 2025 13.48 EDTLast modified on Mon 6 Oct 2025 15.39 EDTShareTwo years after the Hamas atrocitiesof 7 October 2023, in which militants killed about 1,200 Israelis, and amid the genocide in Gaza, in which Israel has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians, the need for peace has never been more urgent. Palestinians are desperate for an end to starvation and airstrikes. Israeliswant the war to endfor the sake of remaining hostages and soldiers. Violence has reverberated across the region. Momentum has been growing around Donald Trump’s proposal, with both Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas grudgingly indicating acceptance under US threat.With indirect talks between Israel and Hamas beginning in Egypt on Monday afternoon, there are frail hopes of progress at last. Yet both parties have made it clear that they reject major parts of the20-point US plan, which begins with an immediate ceasefire, the return of all hostages – followed by the release of Palestinian prisoners – and the resumption of full aid.For Netanyahu, perpetual war in Gaza and beyond extends his political survival. His far-right coalition partners want to expel Palestinians and settle Gaza.Hamashas no desire to sign itself out of existence, and handing back the last hostages would remove any leverage it retains. It has seen much of its leadership destroyed, as well as life in Gaza – but has also watched international public opinion shift unprecedentedly towards support for Palestinians, pulling governments in its wake. It can recruit from a huge pool of angry and traumatised young men.The full peace plan is still more contentious. Pledges of broad support from governments in the region and in Europe do not mean that they think it feasible – still less that they want to commit troops to an “international stabilisation force”. But some hope that a more plausible and just way forward might somehow emerge from all this.True, this proposal is less grotesque than the initial Trumpianvisionof a “riviera” built on the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians.Palestinians would remain, but would be sidelined, as they were in drawing up the plan. The “board of peace” overseeing Gaza appears to be acolonial administrationheaded by Mr Trump himself and,disturbinglygiven his history in the region, Tony Blair.The plan pays lip service to eventual self-determination and statehood as a mere “aspiration” – not a right – of the Palestinian people, via a path that could not be more vague, conditional or tentative. It states that Israel will not occupy or annex Gaza. Mr Netanyahu has already said that the military would stay in most of it andwould “forcibly resist”a Palestinian state.Mr Trump has strong-armed the Israeli prime minister at last, but deadly strikes continue and he, like Joe Biden before him, could have halted the slaughter long ago. Telling the two parties to “move fast” now reflects his short attention span as much as the pressing need for peace. He will surely settle for whatever allows him to claim credit. If Israel does stop, it could resume the offensive at any time – just as itbroke the ceasefireearly this year.Any opportunity to end this war of annihilation must be seized. Something better may emerge from this path, if – a huge if – Mr Trump and others apply heavy, sustained pressure to Mr Netanyahu and forge a deal that Arab nations can fully support, ensuring pressure on Hamas. But lasting peace should not and cannot be built upon an abandonment of basic Palestinian rights.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Its leadership team is mistaking slogans for policy and nostalgia for purposeMon 6 Oct 2025 13.47 EDTLast modified on Mon 6 Oct 2025 15.38 EDTShareThe opening speeches by the Tory leader,Kemi Badenoch, and her shadow chancellor, Mel Stride, to their party conference were loud with conviction but thin on substance. They felt like ritual incantations in a world turned upside down. Mr Stride’s pitch – £47bn ofsavingsvia welfare cuts and business rebates – is an empty promise given the party’s standing in the opinion polls. But it is a tenet of modern-day Toryism to preach austerity to the poor and indulgence to the wealthy.The Tory party faces an existential moment. If an election were held tomorrow, some polls have the Conservatives infourth placein terms of seats – having never finished lower than second in a general election since the 1830s. Their voters are turning away to support Reform UK or just not turning out. But why have we got here? A backward glance offers an explanation.From David Cameron onwards, every Tory leader has faced the same dilemma: how to reconcile globalisation’s promises with its discontents. Mr Cameron’s politics led to a triangulation: he appeared sociallyliberalin a Blairite sense, economically liberal in a Thatcherite one. His project assumed that open markets andEuropeanintegration would last. Like many centre-minded politicians, Mr Cameron thought politics was about managing capitalism rather than redistributing its proceeds.That error lies at the root of a wider technocratic failure, according to one of Europe’s most important thinkers,Jean Pisani-Ferry. He admits that mainstream centrism “gravely underestimated the social and territorial consequences of our collective choices”. The trouble is, he says, that history is back. First the 2008 financial crash shattered the illusion of permanence; then Brexit gave political voice to the regions left behind.Mr Cameron’s brand of liberal conservatism could not survive the return of politics as conflict.Theresa Maytried with talk of duty and belonging, yet she lacked the parliamentary majority to deliver. Boris Johnson substituted theatre for policy, trading economic reality for spectacle. Liz Truss mistook performance for a governing philosophy, and her plans imploded on contact with markets. Rishi Sunak brought composure but not direction.Mrs Badenoch inherits this exhaustion. When she says that “individuals know better than governments how best to spend their own money”, she offers certainty rather than strategy. She mistakes the repetition of Thatcherite slogans for renewal. Such is the intellectual torpor that at a Spectator fringe event, Pitt the Younger was voted a greater Conservative than Margaret Thatcher.The Tory leader’s latest flourish is a Trumpianimmigrationhit squad, vowing to deport 150,000 a year. Like much of the post-Brexit right, Mrs Badenoch confuses decisiveness with coherence. There is no credible plan for where these people would go, how treaties would be upheld, or how overstretched institutions would cope. But the point is not to solve the problem, it is to dramatise it.Mr Pisani-Ferry’s lament and Mrs Badenoch’s bravado share the same reckoning. The technocratic centre mistook stability for permanence; the nationalist right mistakes collapse for destiny. From Mr Cameron onwards, there has been a slide from complacency to panic to burnout – with each Tory leader trying to master a storm their own choices summoned. The Tories are finding out that history, having beendeclared over, has returned for its revenge.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It is really rewarding being a Samaritan, but can also be very challenging. Volunteers need a high degree of motivation, and this has inevitably been affected by the proposals.Interestingly, in 2021 our chair, Keith Leslie, published A Question of Leadership, which is about leading organisational change. According to theAmazon descriptionof this publication “60% to 70% of change initiatives fail”, caused by the leader’s “inability to fully consider the consequences and magnitude of the situation”. Also it states that change initiatives often overlook the mental health of those involved. I haven’t read this book, but I really can’t understand how its author could consider continuing as our chair when the leadership has run roughshod over the charity’s very core: the volunteers. I believe that our CEO, Julie Bentley, should also consider her position.I am sure that most volunteers realise that change is inevitable and important. The drastic measures initially proposed do not take into account the dedication, loyalty and  hard work that it takes to keep us all going. We still have no details of the new proposals, but a kinder and more inclusive approach would be greatly appreciated.Name and address suppliedHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Much of what we believe to be “rational” is shaped by delusion: we cling to simplified explanations, even when evidence proves them false.Human beings have always lived with a psychological structural stupidity, a kind of symbolic impoverishment contained within our intelligent capacities, a tendency to mythologise events, distort memory and behave as if half aware of our own misperceptions. We idealise leaders, invent grandiose theories and develop conspiracy stories hoping that they will all fulfil our deepest yearnings; they feel real enough to shape collective behaviour, whether in politics, religion or social movements.Psychologists map this terrain with concepts such as “bullshit receptivity”: the readiness to accept superficial slogans, pseudo-scientific claims or comforting myths, rather than engaging in critical thinking. As the historianRick Shenkman observed, this manifests either as “wooden-headedness” (believing what we wish were true) or “bone-headedness” (succumbing to cliches and stereotypes). None of this requires malevolence, but it demonstrates an unacknowledged wilful attitude.Dietrich Bonhoeffer wrote in 1943that under the spell of rising power, people cease to act autonomously; they become vessels for slogans and catchwords. In today’s politics, this is painfully familiar. The challenge is to confront the universal and stubborn presence of stupidity in all of us, an enduring part of our intelligence, which makes us susceptible to propaganda, delusion, pseudoscience, being gaslighted and self-deception.Gregorio KohonLondonWilliam Davies’ article on stupidity touched on the rich lexicon that has arisen during the Trump era. Examples such as “post-truth”, “alternative facts” and “fake news” were given as examples. There’s another word which should surely be used in common parlance and it’s been around for a while. That word is “trumpery”. According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, the word “trumpery” first appeared in English in the mid-15th century with the meaning “worthless nonsense.”. Less than 100 years later, it was being applied to objects of little or no value.There is a noteworthy example of its use in 1851 when the opening of the Great Exhibition was drawing near. The English-born King Ernest Augustus I of Hanover thought that the exhibition was a bad idea, and he wrote to Lord Strangford about it: “The folly and absurdity of the queen in allowing this trumpery must strike every sensible and well-thinking mind.”Vaughan DeanAmpthill, BedfordshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Really? Is it that difficult for a Labour chancellor to find ways to fund a major reduction in child poverty?The higher taxes on the gambling industrysuggested by Gordon Brownmight well be “baked into” the Treasury’s calculations already, but there are many other opportunities available for raising the cash, from closing loopholes and ending tax reliefs to equalising capital gains and income tax.Even Margaret Thatcher and her chancellor Nigel Lawson came to the conclusion that the rate of capital gains tax and income tax should be equal, with the latter saying, in 1988, that it was “by no means clear” why earned income should be taxed more heavily than unearned. Did the rich leave in their hundreds after the decision? Of course not, and not only would equalisation raise billions, but being the fair thing to do, it wouldn’t be difficult either.Furthermore, as the Institute for Fiscal Studies said in 2019, low rates of capital gains tax on business income lead to large tax savings but “do not boost investment”.Reeves claims the “world has changed” since her last budget, but rents are still being raised simply to maximise landlords’ profits, businesses’ pay ratios often exceed two figures, banks still escape windfall taxes despite record profits made by holding down savings rates, council tax still needs reform, and increased profit margins still make the term “greedflation” relevant today. In such a time of emergency, the taxes on businesses need to be at the “historic highs”referred to by the CBI’s chief executive last week, and all those with the means should not complain at having to pay them. What’s so difficult, Ms Reeves?Bernie EvansLiverpoolKeir Starmer has declared that “the defining mission of this government is to grow the economy”. You rightly claim that “such language leaves voters cold” (Editorial, 30 September). Moreover, such a claim does not distinguish Labour from Reform UK or any other political party. No party is going to declare itself to be against growing the economy. Labour’s defining mission should be to ensure a fairer social distribution of the wealth created by the economy, whether it is growing, static or even declining. Diminishing inequalities in our society should be Labour’s defining and distinctive mission. Its blinkered vision, its focus on the economy, fails to recognise, let alone redress, the growing social inequalities in Britain today.Dr Alan BakerCambridgeIf we needed any more damning evidence of the demise of the Labour party, the expulsion of Owen Jones and Rivkah Brown from the party conference surely seals the deal (My conference pass was revoked for asking difficult questions: this is Keir Starmer’s Labour, 30 September). It sends a strong message about who is welcome within the Labour movement. A commitment to media freedom and open debate is a hallmark of democratic politics, and Labour is straying from its traditional broad left-leaning position.It can only be interpreted as an attempt to control the narrative, limit dissent and marginalise critical voices. This is taken directly from the Trump playbook and is made even more damaging by the fact that GB News had an on-site studio in the conference zone.Donald ThirdKillin, StirlingI was disappointed to see the Guardian adopt the conservative press’s language of “raid” to describe proposed tax changes (Rachel Reeves gets a warm reception but business chiefs are wary of another tax raid, theguardian.com, 30 September). To call the ordinary business of funding public services a “raid” is to smuggle in the assumption that taxation is theft. It isn’t: it is how we pay for hospitals, schools and other necessities of a civilised society.James DouetAylsham, NorfolkHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The only way forward is more researchMon 6 Oct 2025 15.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 6 Oct 2025 16.50 EDTShareLewis Moody, 47, is the latest in a long line of players who has beendiagnosed with a neurodegenerative diseasethat may or may not be linked to his career in collision sport. Over the past decade I’ve interviewed more of these men, and their friends and families, than I ever wanted to. Many of them chose to first reveal their diagnoses in the Guardian. First there’s the shock, then the sorrow, then the expressions of sympathy and support. And after all that, a lot of hard questions that are left unaddressed.The one thing everyone involved wants is clear answers, and unfortunately, they are very hard to come by. The current science can only tell you so much. The Motor Neurone Disease Association’s position is that the latest research suggests a correlation between traumatic brain injuries and MND, but that the same research has not proven that traumatic brain injuries are a cause of MND. Such injuries are just one on a long list of genetic factors and environmental factors.There are good guys and then there is Lewis Moody – MND has cruelly singled out the bravest of men | Robert KitsonRead moreStudies have found possible links with electrical trauma, mechanical trauma, high levels of exercise, exposure to assorted heavy metals and agricultural chemicals, and, yes, concussions and other traumatic brain injuries that occurred while playing sport.A 2022 study on a group of more than 400 former international rugby players found that their risk of MND was15 times greater than the members of the general publicwho also participated. But then similar studies have also shown that the risks are just as high, or higher again, among cohorts of farmers and veterans. The difference is that their stories don’t lead the news. Moody is one of more than 2,100 people in the UK who will be diagnosed with the disease this year. If there’s a public perception that rugby players are especially prone to the disease, it is partly because the players who have been diagnosed have done so much to raise awareness about it.The more you learn, the more you know you have to learn. Last year another study, out of Durham University, was widely misreported as having found that “players who have suffered multiple concussions had biological differences that make them more prone to developing MND”. According to the team who actually worked on it, it did nothing of the sort.The science is never straightforward. Asthe MND Association says, the evidence “has often been conflicting and clear conclusions cannot be given”. It also points out that the numbers involved in some of the studies themselves are so small that it is impossible to rule out random chance as a factor in the findings. No one wants to scaremonger people out of playing. Over a decade of reporting on traumatic brain injuries in sport, and rugby union in particular, I’ve found that the only thing two scientists in the field are likely to agree on is that we need to do more research. They ask for longer studies, bigger studies and better-funded studies.In the meantime it’s up to the governing bodies to educate the participants about the potential risks, and provide the best guidance it can on how to mitigate against them. One aspect I have come to believe to be unequivocally true after all this reporting, all those interviews, documents and court hearings, is that rugby union failed to do this in the years after the sport turned professional in 1995.View image in fullscreenLewis Moody says he thinks the idea that anyone else was to blame for damage he may have suffered from his playing days makes him uncomfortable.Photograph: Colorsport/ShutterstockMoody grew up in that era. If you’ve read this far it should be clear that his diagnosis can’t necessarily be attributed to the brain trauma he suffered during his playing career. And, while he’s said he would go about things differently if he were playing today, he has never joined the group of players taking legal action against the game’s governing bodies for failing to better protect them from the long-term consequences of playing. He has said that he thinks the idea anyone else was to blame for any damage he may have suffered from playing makes him uncomfortable. There are plenty of men he played with and against who disagree with him on that.There are five other players who have been diagnosed with MND who have joined the three legal actions across league, union and football.Moody’s own autobiography, Mad Dog, is an invaluable insight into the culture in professional rugby union during this era. He describes being knocked unconscious for five minutes in a match against Tonga in 2007. “The team doc suggested I should come off. I told him where to go,” Moody wrote. “I’d waited this long to get my chance in the World Cup, and there was no way I was walking off after five minutes. A lineout followed and I had no idea what was going off.”He was hit in the head again later in the same game. Moody didn’t just play on each of the following weekends, he even went along on a team outing to Disneyland Paris on the day after the game, and spent the day riding rollercoasters.“Every loop the loop was torture, every jerk of my car was like having a needle shoved through my head,” Moody wrote. It is unthinkable behaviour now. It should have been unthinkable then.Explore more on these topicsLewis MoodyMotor neurone diseaseRugby unionanalysisShareReuse this content"

To find yourself submerged in a vast rolling wave of information in the course ofonly seven rounds of Premier League games.As English football entersits latest international breakit is a little startling to think we have had only 70 Premier League matches to this point, with 310 more still to go through the slog of autumn into spring. Seven rounds of games? Really? Is that all?If it feels like more, this is to some extent a function of the Bald Fraudification of English football, the acceleration of the narrative arc. Careers must now rise and fall at alarming speed. The dominance of social media has created this relentlessly overstimulated hive-mind, a networked conversation that must always happen, that rewards and promotes the loudest and most scandalised voice.As an example – and in fact the source of the original term – it is now axiomatic that there must always be at least two Bald Frauds operating in the Premier League at any given time, a non-negotiable that created its own lovely moment of synergyat Stamford Bridge on Saturdayas Enzo Maresca literally passed the Bald Fraud Baton – an actual baton – to Arne Slot in the course of their post-match handshake.View image in fullscreenEnzo Maresca (left) shakes hands with Arne Slot at Stamford Bridge (Bald Fraud Baton out of shot).Photograph: Liverpool FC/Getty ImagesOne obvious consequence is that nobody seems to like an international break much these days. This is logical. The product is designed to be consumed in constant rotation, an addiction fed to a strict schedule. But it is still a timely moment of cold turkey, with the league frozen at an unusually interesting point. Liverpool are off the top, having dominated since last September. Bournemouth, Crystal Palace, Everton, Sunderland and Tottenham are among the top nine.So what is the story of the season so far? At this early stage it is perhaps more useful to identify what isn’t. Some narrative-busting first (disclaimer: narrative may turn out to be true; short-term crisis meter can go up as well as down).Most notably Manchester United are in a terminal state of freefall. Ruben Amorim is no more than a pair of trainers and a spiffy zip-up jacket that has somehow worked out how to do a sexy cackle.Or … Manchester United are also six points off the top. They fielded an actual reliable goalkeeper on Saturday and kept a first clean sheet. Benjamin Sesko has two in two. Exiting the Carabao Cup plus no European games may turn out to be quite handy from here.View image in fullscreenSenne Lammens, the Manchester United goalkeeper, takes the plaudits after making a save against Sunderland.Photograph: Phil Oldham/ShutterstockOther myths that may or may not be myths. Ange Postecoglou is the victim of a media narrative. Reality: Postecoglou is the victim of numbers, mainly losing 30 of his past 49 league games. Bournemouth are doomed‑adjacent, but actually not doomed at all. Brentford were doomed then became not doomed, then may be doomed again, a fitting state of paradox for a club coached by a man with the brow, the curls and the limpid blue eyes of a romantically doomed Celtic poet but who is still called Keith Andrews, rather than, say, Kavan Bismarckius De La Gallway.The main takeaway, and an object of genuine interest, is the prominence of set pieces, not just as a source of goals but as a dominant tactical note. This has become fixed as a story of the season so far, the idea that after several years of ground-level possession fixation the English top tier is embracing the potential of airborne set plays.There was a good discussion about this on the Second Captains podcast recently involving the tactical writer Jamie Hamilton, a high priest of “relational” football as the opposing pole of “positionism”. For those not already engaged with this debate, relationism is the idea of creative, inventive attacking play, a licensed freedom. Positionism is control, strict patterns, eliminating variables in player movements. It’s Miles Davis using musical scales as a platform to noodle versus unsmiling men with quiffs fiddling with synthesisers.There is a theory the prevalence of set-piece moves derives firstly from the increased volume of matches, and a lack of time to implement more complex patterns. And another that it comes from the death throes of Pep-derived positionism, the fact there is simply not much left to control, just some last remaining apples on the tree to dice and slice into orderly shapes. We’ve done 60% possession, which seems to be the human ceiling. What have we got left? Corners and throws? Chuck ’em in the hay bale machine.Is this actually true? Do we really have not just more goals from set pieces, but set-piece-centred patterns in the average game? There are some false notes in this. The touch-finder kick-off routine is surely a gimmick, one that makes very little difference under the eye test. Brentford have been held up as a key driver of this tactical shift. Brentford have also scored one goal from set pieces all season. Manchester City have scored none.But there are obvious shifts. Goals from set pieces have increased overall, according to stats from WhoScored. So far they account for 45 of 182 scored, or 26%, up from 18% last season and 19% the season before. Goals from corners, Opta stats show, are up to 0.49 per game, from 0.36 last season and about 0.41 on average across the three seasons before that.View image in fullscreenAll eyes are on the ball as a Brentford long throw is launched into the Manchester United penalty area.Photograph: Javier García/ShutterstockThrow-ins are the big growth area. Last season total goals from throws more than doubled on the recent norm, up to 20 from a flat eight or nine. So far this season eight have been scored, on target to hit a giddy 32 if that rate is maintained.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Long throws direct into the opposition penalty area are running at two and a half times as many per game compared with the previous four seasons. Will people stop being surprised and work out how to defend them? Probably. Will arms get tired, distances drop, fast bowler-style back injuries become a new problem?Is this even surprising or significant if people are simply throwing the ball into the box more in any case? Is the uplift in goals scored this way really meaningful, given the amount of additional time spent coaching it? Would you just score more in breakaways if you coached that instead?As ever, lumping all 20 teams into the same trend is simplistic. There is variation within any group. And here the overall number is boosted by a few outliers. Of possession‑based teams only Arsenal and Chelsea (seven and five) have really scored a lot of set‑piece goals this season. Had Arsenal and Chelsea scored set pieces at their usual rate the league would be running at 20% of all goals, its usual ratio. These two are, so far, skewing the headline number.But two things do stand out from those seven rounds of games, and the blizzard of maybe-yes-not-sure numbers. The more powerful, top‑of-the-table teams are using this tactic more, which also explains why Thomas Tuchel is so attuned to it. These are the games he watches more, and with which he wishes to associate his England team.More broadly, and the second point here, is that the bigger, more possession-based teams are going long more often. Overall long balls are up after a brief lull, although the combined per-game total of the 20 clubs is 997 compared with 969 last season. City, Arsenal, Chelsea, Spurs and Liverpool are playing on average a combined 226 long balls per game, compared with 203 last season.Anecdotally, on the neck-crick test, less time is being spent staring at the penalty area of the dominant team while a goalkeeper does Cruyff turns, or watching centre‑backs act as playmakers. There is more willingness to go forward quicker, to attempt to score from two or three passes.This is something Brentford really have excelled at, transforming a phase of open play into a set piece in itself, the moment their opponents push on to them the trigger for a sudden long pass in search of quick‑breaking forwards. Erling Haaland is still scoring most of Manchester City’s goals, but doing so from different angles, breakaways, goal-bound charges with the ball at his feet.View image in fullscreenErling Haaland holds off the challenge of Nathan Collins to score the only goal of the game in Manchester City’s victory at Brentford.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe addition of more direct transitions is a fun note of variation. It also reflects other elements at the top of the league. The signing of Florian Wirtz has raised some tremors, an apparently ill-fitting player in the current structure. But this is deliberate, as Arne Slot has pointed out, an attempt to find new angles and patterns as the league evolves.So there you have it: what may or may not be happening, a series of maybe-stats and vibe-based hunches on the outline numbers. It remains a key part of the game’s indissoluble appeal that it remains so hard to read, a set of endlessly complex variables that will no doubt have shifted again by the time the next international break swings around. But England’s manager is right in one obvious sense. Even getting it launched seems to have found a fresh angle in the mini-age of the throw-in, the intrusion of the hand, now, into the game of feet.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

That becomes back-to-back world champions – a historic first for England on the world stage.“That inspires 3 million passionate Red Roses fans who are united in pride and purpose. And that generates over £60m in revenue – powering a future where meaningful profits are fuelling the growth of the community game.”Teasdale said that women’s rugby had made huge strides from when she started at the RFU in 2011, when there were just 12,500 registered players, “and in some clubs whilst women weren’t stopped from playing, they certainly weren’t welcomed either”. But she insisted that, despite the progress since, there was still more to be done to boost the game, even during a cost of living crisis.“Last weekend we witnessed an extraordinary milestone as 82,000 fans flooded through the gates at Allianz Stadium to see our Red Roses claim the 2025 Rugby World Cup,” she said. “And looking ahead to 2030, we want to keep this momentum going.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Netanyahu said: “Great job to Sylvan and Israel’s cycling team for not giving in to hatred and intimidation. You make Israel proud!”Thedisruptions throughout the three-week raceaffected multiple stages and led to the cancellation of planned stage finishes and the shortening of the race distance. There were isolated protests during the sport’s other two grand tours, the Giro d’Italia and Tour de France.Israel-Premier Tech announced On Monday that it would be rebranding the team, adding that Adams would be relinquishing his current duties. “With steadfast commitment to our riders, staff, and valued partners, the decision has been made to rename and rebrand the team, moving away from its current Israeli identity,” the team said in a statement.“In sport, progress often requires sacrifice, and this step is essential to securing the future of the team. Looking ahead to the 2026 season, Sylvan Adams has chosen to step back from his day-to-day involvement and will no longer speak on behalf of the team, instead focusing on his role as president of the World Jewish Congress, Israel.”One of the team’s sponsors, the UK‑based Factor Bikes, had said its support was conditional on disassociating from Israel. Another sponsor, the Canadian-based manufacturer and horticulture firm Premier Tech, had taken a similar stance, saying it expected that Israel-Premier Tech would “evolve to a new name excluding the term Israel, and that it will adopt a new identity and a new brand image”.Although the scrappy end to the Vuelta in Madrid was criticised by rightwing Spanish politicians, the country’s socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez,praised those who had protested peacefully.Sánchez said he had “a deep admiration and respect” for the cyclists in the Vuelta and for “a Spanish society that mobilises against injustice and defends its ideas in a peaceful manner”.Agence France-Presse and Reuters contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsCyclingVuelta a EspañaIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

Thomas Frank, the Tottenham manager, has said Kane would be welcomed back if he wanted to move.European football: Harry Kane sets latest record in Bayern’s Frankfurt winRead moreThat remains a distant prospect, even though coming back to England would give Kane an opportunity to get the 48 goals he needs to break the Premier League’s scoring record. The 32-year-old is hungry for more success after winning the Bundesliga last season to end his wait for a trophy, and his views on playing in English football again have evolved in the two years since he left Spurs for Bayern.“In terms of staying longer I could definitely see that,” Kane said. “I have not had those conversations with Bayern yet but if they were to arise I would be willing to talk and have an honest conversation. Obviously it depends on how the next year or so goes, what we achieve together. We are in a fantastic moment and I am not thinking about anything else.“In terms of the Premier League, I don’t know. If you had asked me when I first left to go to Bayern, I would have said for sure I would come back. Now I have been there a couple of years I would probably say that has gone down a little bit, but I wouldn’t say I would never go back.“I am fully all in with Bayern. If there was a conversation about extending then we will see, but I have still got this season and another season. It is not like I am in my last year, it is not like there is any panic. I am calm, I love the manager at Bayern and as long we are improving and I am improving then I am happy to see what we can achieve.”Kane has made a sensational start to the season, scoring 19 goals for club and country. But he knows that being crowned the best player in the world will require winning the Champions League with Bayern or the World Cup with England next summer.“I would love to win the Ballon d’Or,” Kane said. “Essentially it is a team trophy that the best individual from that team wins, so it is going to be a Champions League winner or a World Cup winner … It would be an accumulation of doing something great individually and as a team. It would be almost the perfect season.”View image in fullscreenHarry Kane is preparing for England’s matches against Wales and Latvia.Photograph: George Wass/PPAUK/ShutterstockKane considered whether he has become a better player at Bayern. His analysis was that he is “seeing the game at the highest level I’ve ever had”. It was interesting to note that Vincent Kompany, Bayern’s manager, talked about Kane’s work out of possession after he scored twice against Chelsea last month.“When you win a title maybe it could be easy to go the other way and be like: ‘OK I’ve done what I wanted to achieve,’” Kane said. “But it’s given me motivation to do more. My numbers are 11km a game, a lot of high‑speed running. Sometimes when I’m watching the games back, I’m more looking forward to watching tackles or one of my defensive actions than watching my goals back. I don’t know if that means I’m getting a little bit bored of my goals or like the tackling part as well but it’s been enjoyable.“I was interested in how I would feel after winning a trophy. It could have been easy to be a bit more relaxed.

Tuchel has said he wanted to reward the players who excelled in training and against Serbia last month.“There are a lot of players who are different from past tournament squads,” Kane said. “But I think the boss has made it pretty clear that those players, it’s not like they’re out of the squad for sure. A lot of them are maybe just coming back into form. Some of them, Jude especially, he’s not been fit, and just played one or two games. It is a big change, but that’s not my decision. That’s the boss – he will feel the feeling amongst the players.”Kane urged England to maintain the standards set during the 5-0 win over Serbia. “The energy around the place was in a really good place,” he said. “Probably the best camp since Gareth [Southgate] left I would say was the September camp but now that is the standard.”England have added Manchester City’s Nico O’Reilly to the squad after the Chelsea right-back Reece James withdrew with a minor injury. Declan Rice reported after going off in Arsenal’s game with a back injury.Explore more on these topicsHarry KaneBayern MunichEnglandWorld Cup 2026World Cup 2026 qualifiersnewsShareReuse this content"

The simple fact of it is that the numbers flying around at Tatts this week will be jaw-dropping, both for the average individual on the Clapham omnibus and the average politician in Westminster, many of whose constituents are still gripped by the cost-of-living crisis.Daryz dazzles in Arc de Triomphe to catch hot favourite Minnie Hauk in dying stridesRead moreA total of 345 yearlings were sold at last year’s Book 1 sale, generating a record turnover for the three-day event of 127m guineas (£134m), a 33% increase on the previous year’s figure of 95.3m gns (£100m). A significant factor in the total was an astonishing spending spree by Kia Joorabchian and his associates in the Amo Racing operation, including Evangelos Marinakis, the Nottingham Forest owner, and the Qatar-based Al Shaqab, which eventually ran to 22.9m gns (£24m) and saw 25 lots led out of the ring to join Amo’s ever-increasing string.The results of the Amo splurge at last autumn’s Book 1 have – as yet – been decidedly mixed. The sale’s top lot, a 4.4m gns (£4.62m) Frankel filly subsequently named Partying, was initially sent to Ralph Beckett and then moved to join Kevin Philippart De Foy at the historic Freemason Lodge in Newmarket – another big-money purchase by Joorabchian and co – in July. She has yet to see a racecourse.Also unsighted thus far is Alpinara, a 2.5m gns (£2.6m) full sister to the2022 Prix de l’Arc de Triomphewinner, Alpinista, although she could hardly be said to have a two-year-old pedigree, while Poker, by Wootton Bassett and the 2024 sale’s 4.3m (£4.5m) second-top lot, started favourite for his racecourse debut in a Haydock novice a couple of weeks ago – and finished sixth of the nine runners.View image in fullscreenVenetian Sun – on the way to winning the Albany Stakes on day four of Royal Ascot in June – was picked up for 240k gns.Photograph: John Walton/PAThere were five seven-figure lots among the Amo buys 12 months ago, and Ancient Egypt, who cost 1.1m gns (£1.15m), is the only winner as yet (and he then ran a shocker when upped to Group Two company at Newmarket last month after two wins in minor company). There have been winners from Amo’s cheaper purchases, including Lyneham, who repaid £11,000 of his 425k gns (£446k) purchase price in a Newmarket maiden on Saturday, but so far, they seem to be learning the lesson that it is not necessarily the size of your bankroll that matters at Book 1 – all the buyers, after all, are loaded. It is what you spend it on that counts.It may not have escaped Amo’s attention, for instance, that Venetian Sun, winner of the Albany Stakes at this year’s Royal Ascot, was picked up for 240k gns (£252k) – below the average for the sale as a whole – to race for Marinakis’ Premier League rival in the Brighton hot seat, Tony Bloom.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Tuesday tipsShowLeicester 2.00Portoro (nb)2.30Koffee And Kale3.00Maasai Mata3.30Oh Yes You Do4.00Lillie Margo4.30Smart Vision5.02Sovereign Sea5.35Holbache (nap)Brighton2.15Antiphon2.45Starsong3.15Ciarrai Abu3.45The Dark Baron4.15Stintino Sunset4.45Gone Rogue5.15King Of WarHuntingdon2.37Settle Down Jill3.07Carlton3.37Midnight Jewel4.07Lyness Dancer4.37Casting Aspersions5.07BankatarySouthwell4.57Nova Centauri5.28Zarinca6.00Noel Fox6.30Unico7.00Colors Of Freedom7.30Tamaris8.00Shamardal Star8.30CreateWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Distant Storm, the likely favourite for Saturday’s Group One Dewhurst Stakes, also slipped through the net. He was knocked down to the bloodstock agent Cormac Farrell for just 90k gns (£94.5k) – pin-money by Book 1 standards – before giving his temporary owner the profit of a lifetime when he was resold to Godolphin at this year’s breeze-ups for €1.9m (£1.65m).The best news of all for Tattersalls – since they take the spare shilling in every guinea – is that Joorabchian and his Amo associates show every sign of returning for a repeat performance at Newmarket this week, for what seems certain to be a concerted – and somewhat surreal – flaunting of mega-wealth across the three-day sale. The fuse will be lit when the first lot enters the ring at 11am, and the serious fireworks may well begin moments later when Lot 3, the first of 26 Frankel yearlings in the catalogue, goes under the hammer.Betting tax turnover ‘rebalancing’ urgedBack in the real world, meanwhile, there was a timely contribution to the debate over racing’s future funding on Monday from a somewhat unexpected source.Plumpton racecourse is familiar to National Hunt fans as one of the most pleasant and picturesque jumping tracks in the country, but it has also been owned by Peter Savill, the former chairman of the British Horseracing Authority’s predecessor, the British Horseracing Board, since 1998.The gambling industry is a licence to print money. Tax it properly – and turbocharge the fight against child poverty | Gordon BrownRead moreIt could therefore be said to have a view on racing’s complex internal politics from both sides of the divide between the Thoroughbred Group – owners, trainers, jockeys and so on – and the racecourses, and it launched a detailed report on Monday titled Securing Racing’s Future which proposes a “rebalancing” of the overall taxes on betting turnover to “provide fair funding for a sport that delivers £4bn to the economy”.The report’s author is Tom Savill, Peter’s son and a director at Plumpton, who has picked up and run with an idea that wasinitially floated by the Social Market Foundation earlier this year.The SMF proposed a “flip” in the rate that betting firms pay on their gross profits to General Betting Duty and the Horserace Levy, with GBD reduced from 15% to 5% and the Levy raised from 10% to 20%, which would leave the overall charge on racing profits at 25%.Savill argues that while the UK Treasury’s headline tax-take from bets on racing would inevitably drop, the long-term deficit that would result from an irreversible decline in an industry that supports 80,000 jobs would be far more significant.A rebalancing between tax and Levy, he suggests, alongside an extension of the Levy to bets on foreign racing, could generate an extra £130m annually for racing without adding to the overall rate imposed on operators’ racing profits.Gordon Brown, the former prime minister,argued for additional support for racingif or when the tax regime around gambling is reformed in an article for the Guardian in August. Savill’s report offers one possible way to provide that support, and will land on the Treasury’s doormat on Tuesday.Explore more on these topicsHorse racingTalking HorsesHorse racing tipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Lazio were losing at home toTorino, who had been outscored by their previous five league opponents by a combined 10 goals to two. Ultras from the Curva Nord were wrapping up the latest protest in their never-ending feud with the club’s owner, Claudio Lotito.Was Lazio’s season coming unstitched, or had there never been a thread holding it together in the first place? They reappointed Maurizio Sarri as manager this summer, only for him to later acknowledge that the club had not mentioned the transfer ban they were about to receive for financial irregularities. Rumours that he might quit were unfounded, but he did say Lotito had “swindled” him.Brooke Norton-Cuffy: ‘Vieira was great as a player and he’s a great manager now’Read moreTheBiancocelestibecame as messy on the pitch as they were off it, beating Verona 4-0 and Genoa 3-0 but losing the rest of their first five games,including the Rome derby. At any given moment, it has been hard to tell if they are improving or imploding.At least one man kept smiling through it. Matteo Cancellieri was not even supposed to be at Lazio this season. He spent the last one on loan at Parma and, early this summer, his parent club were pushing for him to stay there a while longer. The transfer ban forced a rethink. Lazio could not afford to thin their squad without replacements.He joined in the first place during Sarri’s previous tenure, then a 20-year-old graduate of Verona’s academy. He made 20 league appearances for Lazio in 2022-23, all but one of those as a substitute. The club’s longtime sporting director, Igli Tare, who left at the end of that season, would later accuse Sarri of “telling everyone Cancellieri would be a star then never playing him”.Perhaps the manager was still trying to work out the nature of the player’s talent. Billed as a wide forward on arrival, Cancellieri nevertheless spent much of that season as an ineffective backup to Ciro Immobile at No 9. In 63 appearances on loan at Empoli and Parma over the last two seasons, he scored seven times. Shoehorning him into a poacher’s role was always going to be a poor fit.Quick GuideSerie A resultsShowVerona 0-1 Sassuolo, Atalanta 1-1 Como, Inter 4-1 Cremonese, Lazio 3-3 Torino, Parma 0-1 Lecce, Juventus 0-0 Milan, Napoli 2-1 Genoa, Bologna 4-0 Pisa, Fiorentina 1-2 Roma, Udinese 1-1 CagliariWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Or maybe it was just a question of timing. If the transfer ban ensured Cancellieri’s place in Lazio’s squad, then it was a lengthy layoff for the Denmark international Gustav Isaksen, who contracted glandular fever during the summer, that gave the Italian a chance to claim a spot in the starting XI during pre-season.He did exactly that, delivering a string of impressive friendly performances. Left-footed and playing as an inverted winger on the right of a 4-3-3, his manner of cutting in from the flank to shoot had commentators remembering why he was billed by more optimistic observers as a “next Arjen Robben” when he joined the club in 2022.To call that a premature comparison would be to pretend there is a comparison at all. We don’t know yet if Cancellieri is an unpolished diamond or simply having a purple patch, but he has carried that pre-season form into the start of this campaign. He was a lone bright light for Lazio in their opening defeat by Como and did well again in the thrashing of Verona.View image in fullscreenCancellieri battling for the ball with Torino’s Ché Adams.Photograph: Giuseppe Maffia/NurPhoto/ShutterstockLeft out ofthe derby defeat, Cancellieri marked his return with a fourth-minute goal and a man-of-the-match performance in the win over Genoa. And then came this weekend against Torino. The saying goes that a person who smiles in a crisis is the one who worked out who to blame, but sometimes the secret is simpler. A ball, a pitch, an opponent to run at. Cancellieri is just delighted to be back in Rome, the city of his birth, and starting regularly.Lazio looked ripe to fall apart on Saturday, not just because they fell behind early but because they were outplayed during the opening exchanges by a Torino side coached by their former manager, Marco Baroni. Then Valentín Castellanos released Cancellieri with an angled ball to dissect Torino’s centre-backs from inside his own half. Realising he didn’t have the legs to get away from them, Cancellieri instead gave people cause to think once again of a certain Dutchman, wrongfooting his pursuers with a touch to the left before smashing his shot into the top corner.He wasn’t the only one grinning now as he jogged back to halfway, stopping to give a little butt-wiggle. What to do for an encore? Perhaps the same thing? The ball forward this time came from Toma Basic and Cancellieri received it running into the corner of the penalty box, much closer to the goal. But the meat was the same: drive the defender off-balance, cut back inside and stick the ball into the (this time bottom) corner.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A better team might have capitalised on their momentum against fragile Torino. But Lazio are not that team. The game stabilised until Ché Adams popped up with a 73rd-minute equaliser. Lazio’s defenders lost track of him completely as he attacked Niels Nkounkou’s cross.Torino thought they had claimed a precious win when Saúl Coco headed in from a corner at the start of injury time. But the same player would subsequently give away a penalty at the other end with a hip check on Tijjani Noslin. The Dutch forward was initially judged to have dived, but that decision was reversed after a lengthy VAR review and a scuffle between the two teams. Danilo Cataldi smashed home his penalty in the 103rd minute.View image in fullscreenMaurizio Sarri witnessed another wildly inconsistent performance from his side on Saturday.Photograph: Federico Proietti/DPPI/ShutterstockBy the end it was hard to know what conclusions to draw beyond the fact that these two flawed teams had served up an entertaining spectacle, and that Cancellieri is one of the players to keep an eye on inSerie Aat the moment. Perhaps this is a flash in the pan, or maybe something more.A nation that has spent so many years lamenting its shortage of high-quality forwards is itching to see one of the current flock of prospects flourish into a genuine star, from Pio Esposito at Inter to Francesco Camarda at Lecce. Cancellieri is a few years ahead of those two, but a breakthrough season at 23 would hardly make him a late bloomer.A dig into his underlying numbers gives more reasons for hope. Besides now being Lazio’s top scorer this season, Cancellieri has also won more tackles than any teammate, is joint-first in passes intercepted and second for headers. He certainly puts himself about, in other words. Sarri has hailed him for returning from his loans “more mature” than when they last worked together.“Going away on loan did me good,” agreed Cancellieri. “I’ve grown up, in lots of ways.”PosTeamPGDPts1Napoli66152Roma65153AC Milan66134Inter Milan69125Juventus64126Atalanta66107Bologna64108Como6299Sassuolo60910Cremonese6-1911Cagliari60812Udinese6-3813Lazio63714Parma6-4515Lecce6-5516Torino6-8517Fiorentina6-4318Verona6-7319Genoa6-6220Pisa6-72Explore more on these topicsSerie AEuropean club footballLazioTorinofeaturesShareReuse this content"

Underneath, an effusive Narendra Modi posted congratulations to his country’s para-athletics team. “A historic performance!” the Indian prime ministerwrote on social media, celebrating a record 22-medal haul for his country at the World Para Athletics Championships in Delhi, which ended on Sunday. “I am proud of each and every member and wish them the very best for their future endeavours,” he said. “Hosting the tournament in Delhi has also been an honour for India.”This was India’s first time staging the biggest track-and-field event in disability sport, outside the Paralympic Games, and they made a suitable noise about it. After a last-minute decision that confirmed Delhi as host city last December, the hope was that the championships might expand awareness of para-sport in India and, in the process, perhaps help to wake a sleeping giant. With India 10th in the medal table and stars such as the visually impaired sprinter Simran Sharma breaking out into the public consciousness, it could be argued that mission has been accomplished.View image in fullscreenSimran Sharma has become a star in India thanks to her gold and silver medals across the T12 sprint events.Photograph: Avijit Das/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockThe Indian ministry of youth affairs and sports said the championships had shown the country had “entered a space usually reserved for elite and established organisers” while an “elated” Deepa Malik, the first Indian woman to win a Paralympic medal, at the 2016 Games, said it would “create so much awareness and love in the hearts of Indians”. That many of the events took place in front of sparse crowds at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium does not appear to have taken the edge off.Over the course of the 186 medal events held across nine days on a stadium with a newly installed Olympic specification Mondo track, the Delhi world championships saw 35 world records were broken and 104 championship records set at the Delhi world championships. The busting of previous bests is generally par for the course in para-sports as participation, coaching and technology continues to improve with each cycle. However, it has happened without a significant narrowing of the pool of medal-winning countries, with 45 of the competing nations – athletes from 104 countries took part – winning at least one gold and 64 at least one medal, figures comparable to the previous three editions of the event.View image in fullscreenFans salute India’s Preeti Pal’s silver medal in the women’s T35 100m but empty seats were a regular feature throughout the nine days of competitions.Photograph: Ranjith Kumar/IPA Sport/ipa-agency.net/ShutterstockFor Great Britain it was an average championships, albeit one peppered with individual moments worth celebrating. GB finished seventh in the medal table with 25 in total – seven gold, five silver and 13 bronze – down from fourth with 29 medals in 2023 (but significantly up on Kobe in 2024, an event affected by preparations for the Paris Paralympics). Among the athletes to find success were stalwarts Dan Pembroke, who achieved the threepeat in the F13 javelin, and Aled Davies, who won a seventh successive title in the F63 shot put. Naturally, Hannah Cockroft also added more world titles to her unparalleled CV in wheelchair racing, winning three gold medals in the T34 category.Particularly good news for Britain came lower down the card, where new names excelled on the world stage. Victoria Levitt was competing at her first world championships, in the T44 classification for athletes with an impairment in the lower leg, and claimed gold and silver in the 100m and 200m respectively. “Being world champion is probably the scariest thing I’ve ever heard,” said the 29-year-old who, when not recording 13.22sec in the 100m, works for Tesco in her home town of Mansfield. The wheelchair racer Nathan Maguire, meanwhile, beat the Swiss legend Marcel Hug to finish third in the T54 1500m. There was a brilliant bronze, too, for Finlay Menzies in the 100m sprint in frame running, a sport that will be making its debut at the Los Angeles Paralympics in 2028.Katie Jones, head of Paralympic performance at UK Athletics, said the event had been “a positive experience” for GB and a chance for two generations of athletes to learn from each other as they begin the road to LA. “The athletes have all come together, the team spirit has been fantastic and we have come away with 25 medals. We couldn’t have asked for more than that,” she said. “The newbies always bring an enthusiasm, an optimism, a vigour back into the team, so it’s lifted everyone. What’s been really nice is seeing the more experienced athletes putting their arm around the shoulder and giving some advice, because the [new members of the team] didn’t know what to expect. They had not had the opportunity over the past four years to actually be in this environment and get the skills, so our older athletes are sharing that.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Pakistan boycotted due to heightened tensions in Kashmir. From outside came the news that the International Paralympic Committee had reversed its ban on Russian and Belarusian athletes from taking part under their own flag (“Neutral Paralympic Athletes” came third in the medal table in Delhi). There was an issue over competitor numbers in some events, with Britain’s Fabienne André denied a bronze medal, after a British one-two-three in the women’s T34 400m, because only four participants started the race. Then there was the absence of spectators, with Cockcroft arguing it was “hard to believe” the Indian public was behind the games, when even free events were not full.Uncertainty and slow progress is a consistent backdrop for disabled athletes. Once again, the location for the next championships in two years is yet to be decided. But while the struggle is long and the gains made often piecemeal, the power of para-sport to change lives and perceptions is very much alive.As the Indian sprinter Sharma put it, para-athletes “still face challenges, from accessibility to infrastructure”. All of which means that any race, never mind any medal, commonly means more. “It wasn’t just a race,” said Sharma of her T12 100m triumph. “It was the culmination of years of quiet struggle, discipline, and unshakable faith.”Explore more on these topicsSportDisability and sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He went on to take the place and finished third in front of Piastri in fourth.The Australian was furious at the time, telling the team in no uncertain terms he believed it had been unfair and counter to McLaren’s single most important rule that the teammates should not clash with one another as part of the approach to letting them race.Norris hit back afterwards, however, saying: “If you fault me for just going on the inside of a big gap then you should not be inFormula One. There was nothing wrong with what I did.”McLaren did not switch their driver’s places, having assessed at the time that Norris had not been at fault as he had been jolted into Piastri as a result of having tagged Verstappen. Stella confirmed this was the case afterwards but said they would carefully appraise the decision with both drivers.“The review needs to be very detailed, very analytical, and it needs to take into account the point of view of our two drivers,” he said. “We will form a common opinion and we will see whether it confirms our initial interpretation, or if there is something else that we should compute.“We need to be accurate because there is a lot at stake, not only the championship points but the trust of our drivers and the way we operate as a team.”Norris closed the gap to his teammate by three points in Singapore and is now 22 in arrears with six meetings remaining in what is likely to be an increasingly tense title run-in, during which how McLaren manage their drivers may prove a complex process.View image in fullscreenThe McLaren team principal, Andrea Stella (centre), acknowledges it will be difficult to be fair to both drivers during a tense final six races of the season.Photograph: Florent Gooden/DPPI/ShutterstockPiastri acceded to a request to move over for Norris at Monza when the British driver lost a place to his teammate after a slow pit stop, which was the most recent case of the team attempting to pursue their principles of fairness scrupulously to both drivers while allowing them to race. It is, however, proving progressively more complex to deal with each time they are forced to adapt to a new situation, an issue that was acknowledged by Stella.“When you are racing as a team, you cannot have exactly the same interests for the two drivers because they want to pursue their aspirations,” he said. “We want to protect this ‘let them race’ concept and we know as soon as you adopt this concept you face difficulties.”Explore more on these topicsFormula OneLando NorrisOscar PiastriMcLarenMotor sportAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

No one was injured in the incident, but police said “significant damage” was caused to the front of the building and a nearby vehicle.On Sunday, Sussex police said they were investigating the incident as a hate crime. CCTV images of two suspects were also published by the force.A Sussex police spokesperson said: “Footage showed two people wearing masks and dark clothing approaching the front door before spraying accelerant on the entrance of the mosque and igniting a fire. Emergency crews from Sussex police and East Sussex fire and rescue service promptly attended the scene and were able to extinguish the fire.”DCI Mark Cullimore, from the force’s Surrey and Sussex major crime team, said on Monday evening that the investigation was “progressing at pace”.“We are pursuing all lines of inquiry to identify those responsible for this appalling and reckless attack,” he said. “We are continuing to appeal for information from the public in relation to the incident. If you have any knowledge, no matter how small you think it might be, we urge you to contact us immediately by calling 999, quoting Operation Spey.”Supt Rachel Swinney said: “We acknowledge the serious distress and concern this has caused in our communities. There is an increased police presence at the scene and additional patrols taking place at places of worship across Sussex to provide visibility and reassurance.“We will continue to engage with our religious communities to support them and ensure their concerns are heard and acted upon.”Keir Starmer’s spokesperson said the incident was “appalling”, adding that an attack on Muslims was an attack on all Britons.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Now, in an interview released just days after her death, the famed primatologist reveals what she would do withDonald Trump, Elon Musk and other human beings she saw as showing similar traits: launch them on a one-way trip into space.The insight into Goodall’s thinking comes in the Netflix documentaryFamous Last Words, recorded in March and kept under wraps until herdeath last weekat the age of 91.“There are people I don’t like, and I would like to put them on one of Musk’s spaceships and send them all off to the planet he’s sure he’s going to discover,” Goodall tells interviewer Brad Falchuk during the revelatory 55-minute special discussing her life, work and legacy.Would Musk, the SpaceX founder and Trump ally with apenchant for apparent Nazi-style salutesand firing thousands of federal workers, be among them, Falchuk wanted to know.“Oh, absolutely. He’d be the host. You can imagine who I’d put on that spaceship. Along with Musk would be Trump and some of Trump’s real supporters,” she said.“And then I would put [Russian president Vladimir] Putin in there, and I would put [China’s] President Xi. I’d certainly put [Israeli prime minister Benjamin] Netanyahu in there and his far-right government. Put them all on that spaceship and send them off.”It is not the first time that Goodall, a champion of environmental advocacy, has been critical of Trump in particular.In a2022 interviewwith MSNBC she said he exhibited “the same sort of behavior as a male chimpanzee will show when he’s competing for dominance with another. They’re upright, they swagger, they project themselves as really more large and aggressive than they may actually be in order to intimidate their rivals.”In the Netflix interview, the first in the streaming network’s new series capturing the thoughts of iconic world figures to be broadcast only after their death, Goodall further explained her thinking.“We get, interestingly, two types of alpha. One does it all by aggression, and because they’re strong and they fight, they don’t last very long. Others do it by using their brains, like a young male will only challenge a higher-ranking one if his friend, often his brother, is with him. And you know, they last much, much longer,” she said.She also examined the “politicization” of behavior, and what her studies had taught her about aggressive behaviors shown by groups of humans and chimpanzees when confronted with something they perceived as hostile, even if no threat existed.“Chimps see a stranger from a neighboring community, and they get all excited, and the hair stands out, and they reach out and touch another, and they’ve got these faces of anger and fear, and it catches, and the others catch that feeling that this one male has had, and they all become aggressive,” she said.“It’s contagious,” she added. “Some of these demonstrations that turn aggressive, it sweeps through them. They all want to become and join in and become aggressive. They’re protecting their territory or fighting for dominance.”Falchuk asked if she believed it was the same for humans. “Probably, sometimes yes. But I truly believe that most people are decent,” she said.“My biggest hope is raising this new generation of compassionate citizens, roots and shoots. But do we have time? I don’t know. It’s a really grim time.”Goodall, born in London five years before the start of the second world war, likened the fight against the darkness of present-day politics to Britain standing up to Nazi Germany, and the “spirit of obstinance” shown by Winston Churchill.“That doesn’t mean you don’t have moments of depression, but then you come out of it and say, ‘OK, I’m not going to let them win,’” she said.“It’s like Churchill in the war, his famous speech, we’ll fight them on the beaches, we’ll fight them in the streets and the cities, then he turned aside to a friend and was heard to say, ‘and we’ll fight them at the ends of broken bottles because that’s all we’ve bloody well got’.”Goodall, in a post-interview address to camera, ended with a message of encouragement for those fighting against political oppression and the climate emergency.“Even today, when the planet is dark, there still is hope. Don’t lose hope. If you lose hope, you become apathetic and do nothing,” she said.“And if you want to save what is still beautiful in this world – if you want to save the planet for the future generations, your grandchildren, their grandchildren – then think about the actions you take each day. Because, multiplied a million, a billion times, even small actions will make for great change.”Explore more on these topicsJane GoodallDonald TrumpElon MuskUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

But at this very early stage of the trial, can we make it clear that Julia Wandelt is not Madeleine McCann.”View image in fullscreenMadeleine McCann was three when she disappeared on holiday in the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz in 2007.Photograph: PAAt these words, Wandelt, wearing a white shirt, began crying loudly, stood up and attempted to leave the dock through a back door leading to the cells.She was comforted by her co-defendant Karen Spragg, 61, who hugged her and appeared to be telling her to stay calm. Spragg, from Cardiff, is accused of joining Wandelt in her stalking campaign of the McCanns. The pair deny the charges.Duck said Wandelt had “no familial link” to the McCanns and that, during the trial, the jury would be shown detailed scientific evidence to support that.He said Wandelt was nearly two years older than Madeleine would be, an inconvenient truth that she had tried to make excuses for by saying that she looked young for her age.“When faced with awkward propositions, attempts were made to find a way around them” but she had “nowhere to go” when faced with scientific evidence, he said.The jury was told she had previously pretended to be two other missing children, Inga Gehricke from Germany, who was born eight years after her, and Acacia Bishop from the US, whose grandmother stood trial for the girl’s murder but was found not guilty by reason of insanity.The court heard how Wandelt used ChatGPT to make fake pictures that she sent to Madeleine’s younger sister, who is now an adult, that purported to show them both as young children.In messages to Amelie McCann that Duck described as “emotional manipulation of the first order”, Wandelt introduced herself as “this girl that went viral saying she thinks she’s Madeleine McCann”. She said she had had hypnosis and “got so many flashbacks” about being Madeleine, something the prosecutor said would have been “extremely distressing” for Amelie.Wandelt is also accused of sending messages, voicemails, emails and letters to Kate and Gerry McCann, as well as turning up in their Leicestershire village and at their home between 1 June 2022 and 21 February this year.The jury was told how she called Kate McCann’s number on what appeared to be 60 occasions and left voicemails that were played to the court.In one, Wandelt could be heard to say: “If I’m her then everything will be OK, and if I’m not, as you probably think, then I will leave you alone.”She said: “I know I look fat and I know I’m not pretty … but I know what I know and I know what I remember.”Wandelt blamed “large corruption” for the reason she had not been identified as Madeleine, and said the media had made her “look crazy”, adding: “Don’t give up on our daughter because I’m not a liar and I’m not crazy.”The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

I think that’s an extraordinary dereliction of duty by the leadership of the department – both political and civil service. It was perfectly clear to me as just somebody who was running schools that there was a high likelihood that schools would have to close and we were planning for that, whilst also of course doing everything we could to keep schools open.”Coles told the inquiry that from early March 2020 he and his team were beginning to meet and discuss the challenges Covid was likely to present. “From 10 March onwards we were starting to communicate, really on a daily basis, about what we could see coming down the track,” he said. “And on 10/11 March we were saying to schools: ‘We can see that schools are going to close in the near future.’ I don’t think that was based on anything other than common sense.”In the absence of any direction from the DfE, the trust began running webinars for its schools on how to provide remote education, as well as offering advice on safeguarding – which was to become a key challenge – as children and staff increasingly had to isolate as the virus spread.The trust also pushed the DfE on what might happen to children on free school meals, who would miss out if schools closed, suggesting vouchers as an alternative. “All of that was self-initiated,” Coles said. “We had received no direction as apparently the DfE was waiting for a direction from No 10 before it started its planning work. We had received no direction and we got on with planning, because that’s obviously the right thing to do in the circumstances.”In a statement to the inquiry in 2023, Williamson said he had not asked DfE officials to prepare an assessment on the impact of school closures in early 2020 because the advice at the time “was not recommending closures” and No 10 had not commissioned it.He described a “discombobulating 24-hour sea change”, with opinion moving from keeping schools open on 16 March to talking about closing them on 17 March, and an announcement to shut them was made the following day.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This marks the beginning of a shift where clean power is keeping pace with demand growth.”China and India were largely responsible for the surge in renewables, according to the Ember report, in contrast with the US and Europe, which relied more heavily on fossil fuels.A separate report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) found that globalrenewablescould more than double by the end of the decade, with 80% of new clean energy capacity expected to come fromsolar power.Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director, said: “The growth in global renewable capacity in the coming years will be dominated by solar PV – but with wind, hydropower, bioenergy and geothermal all contributing, too.”The IEA said China would remainthe world’s biggest growth market for renewables, with India emerging as the second largest over the rest of the decade.“In addition to growth in established markets, solar is set to surge in economies such as Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and several south-east Asian countries,” Birol added.China added more renewable energy generation than the rest of the world combined, leading to a 2% drop in its use of fossil fuels in the first half of the year compared with the same months in 2024, Ember found.Over the same period India grew its renewable energy by more than three times its electricity demand – which was significantly weaker this year – causing its coal and gas use to fall by 3.1% and 34% respectively.By contrast, demand for electricity in the US outpaced its growing renewables sector, leading to a 17% increase in coal generation in the first half of the year.In the EU, demand showed only modest growth compared with the first half of last year, but a weather-related slump in wind and hydro power meant even fast-rising solar power could not prevent gas and coal generation increasing by 14% and 1.1% respectively.Explore more on these topicsRenewable energySolar powerWind powerEnergynewsShareReuse this content"

While the industry and diplomats have made efforts to improve the system, it found much-awaitedrulesagreed at a UN climate summit last year “did not substantially address the quality problem”.“We must stop expecting carbon offsetting to work at scale,” said Stephen Lezak, a researcher at the University of Oxford’s Smith School and co-author of the study, in Annual Reviews. “We have assessed 25 years of evidence and almost everything up until this point has failed.”Carbon offsets are a tool to cut emissions efficiently by crediting rich polluters for financing cheap climate action abroad while pumping out the same amount of planet-heating gas at home.In theory, the practice could lead to lower levels of global heating by funnelling money to the places where it will do the most good as soon as possible. But voluntary carbon markets have long been plagued by“junk offsets”that overstate their impact.5:11How countries cheat their carbon targets – videoThe researchers said the worst problems were with issuing additional credits for projects that were already in the pipeline, such as building a windfarm that would have gone up anyway; impermanent projects, such as planting trees that later burn down in a wildfire; projects with leakage, such as protecting part of a forest but effectively pushing loggers elsewhere; and double-counted projects, such as restoring a peatland but letting the seller and buyer claim the drop in emissions.“An offset may be robust on three of these four dimensions, but if it lacks in the fourth, it may represent a far lower emissions reduction than was credited – or no real reduction at all,” the study warned.Ameta-analysispublished in Nature Communications last year found that less than 16% of the carbon credits investigated showed real reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.The lead author, Benedict Probst, founder of the Net Zero Lab at the Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition, who was not involved in the new paper, said it provided a “valuable high-level overview of the well-documented problems plaguing existing carbon crediting projects”, despite not providing a critical appraisal of the underlying studies.“This study echoes the main conclusions of our own research, but it provides a broader picture across the carbon crediting landscape,” he said.Probst added that the study identified some of the root causes of over-crediting, such as information gaps, but warned of other systemic factors such as the small constituency advocating for high-quality projects, conflicts of interest when drafting standards, and “chronically understaffed” regulators.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

In response to recent criticism, industry-led initiatives such as the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM) have gone through the latest scientific research on which offsets are effective, only approving schemes that meet strict requirements. Separately, so-called “ratings agencies” for carbon offsets now provide buyers with information on whether offsets are likely to represent real-world emission reductions.The review authors recommended urgently phasing out offsets that did not actively suck CO2from the atmosphere and shifting the focus of offset markets to high-quality carbon dioxide removal and storage. Instead of financing other meaningful climate projects through carbon offsets, they called for a contribution-based scheme that did not allow donors to claim it negated their own emissions.But they also found some types of projects that currently suffer from over-crediting could still be remedied, such as issuing cleaner cookstoves and capturing gas from landfill.“We don’t want to throw the baby out with the bathwater,” said Lezak. “There are a couple of important domains where it is important to highlight success, or the potential for it.”Explore more on these topicsCarbon offsettingGreenhouse gas emissionsClimate crisisPollutionTrees and forestsnewsShareReuse this content"

The warning comes after the country’s fisheries ministerblocked the transfer of the captive whalesto a theme park in China.Marineland, an amusement park, zoo, aquarium and forest occupying nearly 1,000 acres (400 hectares) of land in Ontario, has endured mounting scrutiny over allegations the animals are living inpoor conditions. The park, which once saw millions of visitors, did not open for the summer season and is winding down its operations in anticipation of a sale. In February, a lawyer for the park said it was planning to “expeditiously”remove the remaining animals still on the grounds.The fate of the park’s beluga whales has long been an urgent concern for activists who argue the cetaceansshould be transferred to a sanctuary– though few viable options exist. Twenty whales, 19 belugas and one orca, have died at the park since 2019, according to documents compiled by the Canadian Press.‘A life of captivity’: Canada refuses marine park’s request to export its whales to ChinaRead moreMarineland says it had planned to send the whales to Chimelong Ocean Kingdom in the Chinese city of Zhuhai, but Joanne Thompson, Canada’s fisheries minister,blocked the export permit last week, saying she “could not in good conscience approve an export that would perpetuate the treatment these belugas have endured”.Thompson added: “To approve the request would have meant a continued life in captivity and a return to public entertainment.”In a letter from 3 October, Marineland warned the debt-ridden park is in “a critical financial state” and does not have the resources to “provide adequate care for the whales”. The company said that if the federal government is unable to fund the park or authorize the whales’ export by 7 October, Marineland will “face the devastating decision” of euthanizing one of the world’s largest captive whale populations.“The gravity of the funding crisis at Marineland cannot be overstated; any further delay jeopardizes the welfare and security of the whales, and we fear we are running out of time to act,” the letter says.Ontario’s premier, Doug Ford, said the province will “do whatever it takes” to give the remaining whales the “best life possible”, adding the state of the park was “just terrible”.Five years, multiple deaths: what is happening at the home of the last captive whales in Canada?Read moreUnder provincial law, Ontario has the power to seize the whales to ensure their safety – recouping any costs incurred when the park is sold.“Marineland has spent decades profiting from keeping whales in miserable tanks, and is now sitting on hundreds of millions of dollars worth of property in Niagara Falls. Marineland has a moral obligation to fund the future care of these animals,” Camille Labchuk, lawyer and executive director of Animal Justice, said in a statement.Marineland previously told the Guardian the whales “receive far better healthcare and around-the-clock attention than any human in the UK, or anywhere else”, and that the park, which was inspected “dozens” of times a year, had specialists that “care for the animals when they are sick and every effort to save them is made”.The park also said that for decades, “animal rights activist have sought to equate any animal death with alleged ‘abuse’ by the facility caring for the animals” which was “effective as propaganda” for those groups to fundraise.“This crisis didn’t appear overnight,” Labchuk added. “It’s the product of decades of neglect and cruelty. Marineland’s attempt to strong-arm the government into reversing its decision, even implying it may kill the whales, is reprehensible.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaSeascape: the state of our oceansWhalesWildlifeChinaMarine lifeAnimalsAnimal welfarenewsShareReuse this content"

For butterflies, bold and bright wings once meant survival, helping them attract mates and hide from prey. But a new research project suggests that as humans replace rich tropical forests with monochrome, the colour of other creatures is leaching away.“The colours on a butterfly’s wings are not trivial – they have been designed over millions of years,” says researcher and photographer Roberto García-Roa, who is part of a project in Brazil documenting how habitat loss is bleaching the natural world of colour.View image in fullscreenAmiga arnacafound in a eucalyptus plantation, where scientists observed butterflies were less colourful than in native forestsWhether dazzlingly red, deep green or ghostly pale, the richness of a tropical forest provides butterflies with a diversity of habitats in which to communicate, camouflage and reproduce. As humans replace tropical forests with environments such as eucalyptus monocultures, however, those requirements are changing. In a plantation, the ecological backdrop is stripped bare and drab species do better. Being bland – like your surroundings – becomes an advantage.The difference is stark, researchers say. “You feel alive in the tropical forest, everything is wild – you never know what you are going to find,” says García-Roa. “When you arrive at a eucalyptus plantation it’s very frustrating – you can feel that things are not happening as they should be in a natural ecosystem.Animalsare not around, and sounds are not as they should be.”DiscolorationView image in fullscreenEucalyptus plantations, such as this one in Espírito Santo, Brazil, are warmer, drier and flooded with direct light, compared with cooler, humid mature forestsThese preliminary findings are part of a broader body of research into“discoloration”, which examines how nature loss is altering the colours of the natural world.Butterflies are an ideal subject for study because they are among themost colourful organismsin the world. They display a vast array of colours across habitats, respond quickly to environmental changes and are easy to monitor.Colour isn’t just about aesthetics, it has important evolutionary functions. In abroader trend, ecosystems that once supported many colours are becoming more muted as they are degraded, simplified and polluted by humans. Coral reefs are bleaching, oceans arebecoming greener– even rainbows are predicted tobecome less visiblein densely populated and polluted areas.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenThe research team trapped butterflies in nets and carefully transported them to the lab in entomological envelopes – designed to safely immobilise the insects while allowing them to breatheOne obvious thing is that in eucalyptus plantations, butterfly communities are dominated by brown-coloured speciesMaider Iglesias-Carrasco, researcherNature’s palette is always changing in response to natural selection pressures. A notable mid 20th-century example is the peppered moth, which turned black during the Industrial Revolution to fit in with the sooty surroundings. But there arelikely to be more rapid and widespread changes aheaddue to human activity. “Even planet Earth itself islosing brightnessas seen from space. It is truly remarkable and concerning how interconnected these processes are, and how every impact cascades into further consequences,” says Ricardo Spaniol from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul.So far, researchers have identified 21 species in eucalyptus plantations and 31 in the natural forest, although there are many yet to be identified. They studied forests and plantations in the Brazilian state of Espírito Santo, north of Rio de Janeiro. “One thing that is obvious is that in eucalyptus plantations, butterfly communities are dominated by brown-coloured species,” says lead researcher, Maider Iglesias-Carrasco from the University of Copenhagen. There was a “general feeling of emptiness” in the plantations, she added.Amazonian butterfliesView image in fullscreenTwo scientists examine a butterfly inside the Augusto Ruschi biological reserve in Brazil. The team performs a careful double-check of each specimen and the information recordedResearchers first discovered that being colourful in the Amazon may be turning into a disadvantage in 2019. Spaniol spent several weeks in the rainforest, and his team discovered butterfly specieschanged significantly depending on their environment, and their colours followed suit.“The most colourful species are often the first to disappear locally after deforestation, probably because of the loss of native vegetation and their increased exposure to predators. This represents an accelerated process of discoloration in Amazonian butterfly communities,” says Spaniol.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenTop and bottom left: Heliconius butterflies; and right, a tiger butterfly . The bottom images were taken using a visible-spectrum filter and an ultraviolet-spectrum filter to understand how colours may vary in visibility where sunlight is scarce or absentWhat’s happened to all the butterflies? – podcastRead moreButterflies that persisted in deforested areas typically had brown or grey wings and bodies. In a preserved forest, however, a dazzling array of very colourful butterflies were found alongside the duller ones. Researchers did not expect to find such a clear and consistent pattern, and say it opened up a new area of research on how habitat loss can shape diversity.“Discovering that forests are losing their colours was frightening and revelatory,” says Spaniol. “It felt like we were uncovering a hidden dimension of how species respond to environmental change, a dimension that had remained invisible until then, but is incredibly rich.” When the colour diversity decreases, it may signal the erosion of ecological functioning.Butterflies are often considered indicators of broader biodiversity trends, says Spaniol: “A decline in their colour diversity may reflect a loss of complexity in ecosystems as a whole, with potential cascading effects on other organisms and ecological processes.”Protecting nature-rich forestsView image in fullscreenTropical forests, such as the Santa Lúcia biological reserve in Brazil, encompass a wide range of microhabitats. The more complex the habitat, the more opportunities butterflies have to develop diverse traitsFrom the Amazon rainforest to California to Spain, monoculture forests are being grown over huge areas. According to one estimate, eucalyptus plantations – among the most common type, farmed for wood pulp, timber and toilet paper –cover at least 22m hectares(54m acres) around the world.Researchers don’t know whether the impact of plantations is homogeneous across the planet. “Coffee and banana plantations are always green, and people associate green with nature, but they are not [natural],” says García-Roa.View image in fullscreenMaider Iglesias-Carrasco checks the condition of butterflies about to be released into the eucalyptus grove from which they were collectedIf nothing is done to protect native habitats and prevent the further loss of forests, many of the most colourful and ecologically specialised species of butterfly could disappear, leaving behind only a few generalist species. “This would mean not only a loss of beauty, but also the disruption of important ecological interactions that depend on colour signals,” says Spaniol.However, this outcome is not inevitable. Spaniol’s research found that forested habitats in the Amazon rainforest that have been regenerating for 30 years after being used as cattle pasture showed a remarkable increase in butterfly colour diversity. “We still have the opportunity to restore this colourful world,” he says.View image in fullscreenA fallen leaf found in the Santa Lúcia biological reserve resembles the broken wing of a butterfly – a quiet tribute from the forest itselfFind moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsThe age of extinctionButterfliesInsectsTrees and forestsEndangered habitatsWildlifeZoologyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While other countries offer immediate paths to settlement for nurses, the UK is going in the opposite direction.”Labour is proposing to double the time that overseas workers will have to wait – from five to 10 years – before they can apply for indefinite leave to remain or claim any kind of benefit, including tax-free childcare, disability living allowance or housing support.Hundreds of prison officers may have to leave UK after Labour’s visa rule changeRead moreThe plans, outlined by the home secretary,Shabana Mahmood, at the Labour conference last week, would also mean foreign workers would have to volunteer in their local communities and pass a number of other existing tests to gain British citizenship.The proposals were first outlined the government’simmigration white paper in Mayand are seen as a direct response to the rising electoral threat of Reform UK.The RCN, which represents more than 500,000 nurses in the UK and overseas, said the policy would “deny people access to vital support for a decade or more, increase poverty and ultimately drive them away when there are already gaping holes in the workforce”.Ranger, who is also the union’s chief executive, added: “These proposals are no way to treat people who come to the UK to care for patients, become part of our communities and pay tax.“It is pandering of the worst kind, ignorant of the impact on valued migrant staff and their families, but also the patients who need safely staffed services. Yes, ministers need to grow the domestic workforce, but the UK must also be a welcoming, secure place for international nurses.”More than 800 NHS workers criticised the plan on Mondayas “harmful, divisive and xenophobic” and warned that the health service would “crumble” without them.Foreign staff have ‘changed our lives’: Scottish farmers fear for future after changes to skilled worker visasRead moreThe plans have caused concern in several key public services – including the NHS, social care and prisons – which rely heavily on overseas workers. About one in five NHS staff in England are not British, according toofficial figures.In a letter coordinated by the groups Praxis and Medact, the 800-plus medics said the “already strained NHS would crumble under the pressure” of these proposals, potentially triggering a staff exodus and discouraging overseas medics from working in the UK.A social worker who spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity said 25-50% or more of his team would be likely to leave the UK if the government made it harder for them to gain citizenship. “The policy is foolish in terms of the impact it’s going to have on the NHS and [it’s] cruel on all the people it’s going to affect,” he said.The letter says nurses, doctors, dentists and other NHS professionals are “deeply concerned” by Mahmood’s plans to impose “longer and more precarious” routes to settlement.“These extended pathways – often requiring up to 10 years or more of continuous residency – exacerbate instability, making it harder for people to fully participate in society and rebuild their lives,” it said.Praxis, a human rights charity, said 40% of people on the existing 10-year route to settlement were healthcare workers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Labour’s new 10-year rule will cause untold pain | Nesrine MalikRead moreCate Bailey, an NHS consultant psychiatrist, said she was outraged by the “attacks” on migrant workers: “The hundreds of signatures on this letter shows that health workers will not stand for these harmful, divisive and xenophobic policies.”An NHS psychologist who moved to the UK nearly a decade ago said it was “quite upsetting to be told by the government: you can’t be here”.An NHS midwife, who moved to the UK from Nigeria as a child, said she felt “dragged through hell” battling the complex and expensive immigration system and that many would now simply give up.The 26-year-old, who works in a London hospital, said the NHS would “crumble” without foreign-born workers. “I think it’s absolutely ludicrous. I’m not sure how the NHS would survive … The message it says is you’re not welcome here and all the hard work you put in isn’t welcome here.”Government sources have indicated that the tough new measures would not apply to migrants already in the UK. However, it was reported last week that Mahmood was exploring ways to prevent this group from gaining citizenship after five years.Charities have long called for an end to the protracted and expensive route to settlement, with several studies showing that in-work migrant families are far more likely to suffer poverty and destitution as they are excluded from basic welfare support including universal credit, child benefit and disability living allowance.Research from the IPPR thinktank estimates that 1.5 million children in families with migrant parents live in poverty – accounting for more than a third of the total despite making up a fraction of the population.A private briefing to ministers, seen by the Guardian, estimated that between 152,000 and 254,000 children in this cohort were in poverty in 2023, although other research has suggested this is closer to 400,000 children.The proposals, which are due to be consulted on, do not have to be put to a vote before being introduced.TheHome Officehas been contacted for comment.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Thames Water has been crippled by huge debts built up over two decades by owners who have been criticised for paying out dividends without investing enough in its leaking pipes and malfunctioning treatment works.Fatbergs are formed when oil, grease and fat poured down drains combine with non-biodegradable items such as wet wipes, nappies and cotton buds. If left to grow, they can cause flooding and widespread effluent pollution when sewers back up.It was after such an incident that investigators discovered the latest fatberg lurking 10 metres below the streets of Feltham. It was composed primarily of wet wipes, compacted into a fibrous and gelatinous mass blocking the flow through a major sewer pipe beneath the district.View image in fullscreenThe solid mass consisted mainly of wet wipes held together by fat, oil and grease.Photograph: Thames Water/PASpecialist engineers in protective gear entered the sewers in a two-person safety cage lowered into a maintenance-hole chamber measuring 3 metres in diameter. Working deep underground, they used picks, shovels and high-pressure hoses to dislodge the vile accumulation from along 125 metres of sewer main, before it was sucked to the surface and trucked away for disposal at a landfill site as toxic waste.“The clearance of this fatberg was hugely complex for our team of engineers,” said Alexander Dudfield, engagement lead for network protection at ThamesWater.“But while some blockages in our biggest sewers can weigh as much as 25 elephants, we must not forget most blockages occur in local pipes – often narrower than a mobile phone and usually caused by a few households.“When these pipes get blocked, we can’t simply switch off the sewage. It backs up and must come out somewhere, whether that’s roads, rivers or even people’s homes.“The consequences can be devastating.”Thames Water says it spends £18m clearing 3.8bn wipes from its network every year. So far this year, the company said it had cleared 28,899 rag blockages, which were primarily made up of wet wipes; 14,810 fat, oil and grease blockages; and 686 third-party blockages, made up of concrete and other sewer-blocking materials.The Feltham fatberg fiasco followed a recent announcement by the government that it would introduce legislation to ban wet wipes that contain plastic. But some problems remain more stubborn:a recent surveyfound that 48% of Britons still pour fats, oils and grease down the drain.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentLondonThames WaterWaterPollutionnewsShareReuse this content"

The prime minister’s spokesperson said on Monday that Powell “takes his accountability responsibilities very seriously”.The committee, chaired by the Labour MP Matt Western, is in discussions with officials over the date of the hearing. It is made up of several select committee chairs such as Emily Thornberry, Sarah Champion and Liam Byrne and peers includingthe former cabinet secretary Mark Sedwilland former David Cameron adviser Kate Fall.Powell is likely to face questions about theabandonment of a major Chinese spying caseas well as the government’s approach to national security more broadly.Separately theintelligence and security committee, which is chaired by Labour peer Kevan Jones and scrutinises the operation of the UK’s security agencies, expects to receive information about the case as part of its regular work and will examine if further investigation is required.The trial of Christopher Cash, a former parliamentary aide, and Christopher Berry was due to begin this month but was suddenly dropped by theCrown Prosecution Serviceon 15 September. Both men denied the charges. Prosecutors said they could not proceed because the evidential standard was “no longer met”.Downing Street strongly denied suggestions that government interference was behind this move on Monday. “The suggestion that the government withheld evidence, withdrew witnesses, or restricted the ability of witnesses to draw on particular bits of evidence are all untrue,” the prime minister’s political spokesperson said.Powell is facing questions about his role after the Sunday Timesreportedthat the CPS withdrew charges days after senior Whitehall officials, including Powell and the Foreign Office’s top civil servant, Oliver Robbins, met to discuss the trial.In order to prove the case under the Official Secrets Act, prosecutors would have had to show the defendants were acting for an “enemy”. Powell reportedly told the meeting that the government’s evidence would be based on this year’s national security strategy, which does not use that term to describeChinabut instead called it a “geo-strategic challenge”, so it could not be used in court.Government sources have pointed out that theConservativesdid not describe China as a threat in their strategy either.Ministers including Shabana Mahmood, the home secretary, haveexpressed their disappointmentat the collapse of the case. Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons speaker,has said the development leaves MPs vulnerable to espionageand is considering bringing a private prosecution.The government had resisted requests for Powell to appear before parliament for months, arguing it would not be appropriate because he is a special adviser rather than a civil servant.In response, Western accused ministers of “using a quirk of his appointment as a special adviser” to “erode democratic norms”, and said Powell was the first national security adviser not to appear before the committee since the role was created in 2010.Powell has emerged asone of the most important figures shaping foreign policyunder Starmer, and is referred to by some in Whitehall as the de facto foreign secretary. He is heavily involved in managing relations between the UK and US.Before his appointment as national security adviser, he was tasked with negotiating the sovereignty dispute between the UK and Mauritius over the Chagos Islands. A veteran of the New Labour years, he served as chief of staff for the entirety of Tony Blair’s premiership and helped to negotiate the Good Friday agreement.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

An investigation is ongoing, and we urge anyone with information to contact us as soon as possible. Any information, no matter how small, may be relevant to the investigation.”A museum spokesperson added: “We are saddened by the events in what was a targeted attack on St Fagans National Museum of History in Cardiff. The objects presumed stolen are examples of bronze age gold jewellery and were on display in the ‘Wales is …’ gallery.“We would like to thank south Wales police for their cooperation in this investigation and their prompt response when they were alerted in the early hours. We are also very grateful to the staff members who were on duty overnight, followed protocol and who were thankfully uninjured during the incident.”The museum stands in the grounds of St Fagans Castle and gardens, a late 16th-century manor house donated to the people of Wales in 1948. More than 50 historic buildings from all over Wales have been recreated at the museum including a Victorian school, a medieval church and a workmen’s institute.Last year a Cardiff pub, the Vulcan Hotel,opened at St Fagansafter being moved brick by brick from its location in the city.Upcoming events include a family day celebrating Somali heritage and Christmas carols in the chapel. A statement on the museum’s website on Monday said it had closed due to storm damage.The St Fagans burglary comes after a haul of antique pocket watches dating from the late 18th century and an early 19th century blunderbuss were stolen from the Royal Albert Memorial Museum and Art Gallery in Exeter.Two suspects are believed to have forced entry into the museum on Queen Street in September and stolen 17 watches and the gun, which is likely to have been used to defend mail coaches.Some of the watches were made by Charles Frodsham, a renowned 19th-century clockmaker.Devon and Cornwall police said the suspects – believed to be men – were dressed in black and riding bicycles, and spoke with Liverpudlian accents.The watches taken ranged in date from 1775-1907. One was made close to Exeter in Tiverton, while others, including a musical repeating watch, came from as far afield as Switzerland.Three were by London-based Charles Frodsham & Co. By the mid-1850s Frodsham had established himself as one of the period’s most eminent horologists – maker of clocks and watches – renowned for producing high-quality precision timekeeping instruments. One has a lunar disc that shows phases of the moon with a calendar on the reverse.Explore more on these topicsMuseumsCardiffWalesHeritagenewsShareReuse this content"

Government sources told French media that Macron would “assume his responsibilities” if the effort failed. It was not immediately clear what this might entail.On Monday morning Lecornu made what he called a “spontaneous” speech on the steps of the prime minister’s residence in Paris, appearing to blame his resignation on opposition political parties inFrance, who he said had not wanted to compromise.Criticising political “egos”, he said parties continued to behave with “partisan appetites”. He said he had been “ready to compromise, but each political party wanted the other political party to adopt its entire programme”.Speaking in the courtyard of Matignon palace, the prime minister’s headquarters, the 39-year-old former defence minister, the shortest-lived premier in modern French history, said he had worked for weeks to forge a viable path forward.Terms of office of each prime minister during Emmanuel Macron’s presidency graphic“It would not take much for it to work,” added Lecornu, whose cabinet had been announced barely 12 hours previously. “By being more selfless for many, by knowing how to show humility … One must always put one’s country before one’s party.”Lecornu’s decision had left Macron facing a choice between appointing a new prime minister – someone capable of passing a budget for this year – or dissolving the national assembly and calling fresh legislative elections, options that could still be available to him after Wednesday.He has consistently said he is reluctant to hold another vote, which polls suggest would return another divided parliament or possibly usher in a far-right government, and has also said he will not resign until the end of his mandate in 2027.Lecornu had faced furious criticism from opposition politicians as soon as the new government was revealed on Sunday evening to be virtually unchanged since his immediate predecessor, François Bayrou, was forced to quit last month over proposed budget cuts.The proposed new government was dominated by Macron’s allies. Opposition parties said Lecornu had backtracked on the “profound break” with past politics that he had promised when he took over from Bayrou, who wasousted on 9 September.His announcement alarmed markets, with the CAC 40 stock index dropping 2% and the euro 0.7%. France’s debt-to-GDP ratio is the EU’s third-highest and almost twice the ceiling permitted under EU rules, as is its projected budget deficit of nearly 6%.Lecornu’s attempted departure compounded a political crisis that has rocked France since Macron dissolved parliament last summer and called legislative elections that ended in a hung parliament divided into three blocs: the left, the far right and Macron’s own centre-right alliance, with no group coming close to a clear majority.A graphic showing the three main blocs in the national assembly and distribution of seats by party or groupThe far-right National Rally (RN) of Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella called on Monday for the president to dissolve parliament again, while the radical left France Unbowed (LFI) reiterated its longstanding call for the president himself to step down.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Bardella said he expected the legislative elections to take place and added: “The RN will obviously be ready to govern.”Bardella, the RN’s president, said: “There cannot be a return to stability without a return to the ballot box. It was very clearly Emmanuel Macron who decided this government himself. He has understood nothing of the political situation we are in.”Mathilde Panot of LFI said: “The countdown has begun. Macron must go.” David Lisnard, of the conservative Les Républicains (LR) party, which has thus far backed Macron as part of the governing alliance, was also among those who called on the president to leave.LR’s vice-president, François-Xavier Bellamy, said the party was not going to offer Macron and his allies “a final lap”. The party’s leader and outgoing interior minister, Bruno Retailleau, was more cautious, saying the ball was now in Macron’s camp and he must speak soon.Pierre Jouvet, the general secretary of the centre-left Socialist party (PS), said after a party meeting that it was“not calling for dissolution or the departure of the head of state, but for a solution”. That could come in the form of the “appointment of a prime minister from the left, open to compromise”, Jouvet said.Macron’s allies and opponents had denounced the new cabinet lineup, with the return of Bruno Le Maire, a Macron ally and former economy minister, to government as defence minister particularly enraging politicians across the spectrum who saw him as the incarnation of Macron’s economic policies.Le Maire said on Monday evening he was leaving the government in an effort to end the crisis. “Under these conditions, I proposed to the president to withdraw from the government without delay,” he said. “The president has accepted my proposal.”Lecornu’s two immediate predecessors,BayrouandMichel Barnier, were ousted over Macron-approved plans for an austerity budget. Pressure on the president to come up with a solution is mounting fast, with a budget for next year needing to be agreed within weeks.Explore more on these topicsFranceEmmanuel MacronEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

However fans quickly noticed that even by the standards of bland streaming-platform imagery, the results were particularly startling.Most prominently, all guns appeared to have been removed from already well known images, including a portrait of Sean Connery cradling a Walther PPK pistol in his crossed arms used as a publicity shot for Dr No, andnow in the National Portrait Gallery. A widely seenteaser poster for the Daniel Craig film Spectrehas been apparently edited to crop out the gun he is holding by his side (though the shoulder holster Craig wears is still visible). A similar crop appears to have been made on apublicity image of Roger Moore in Live and Let Die, in which Moore is holding a .44 Magnum, a departure from the Bond tradition of relatively small handguns.Criticism of the move erupted immediately across social media, and the new artwork was immediately denounced as “woke” by outlets includingthe Sunandthe Daily Mail.However,Amazonhas now removed the artwork from its Prime Video streaming platform, replacing it with more traditional still images from the films themselves – though notably also gun-free.Amazon has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsFilmJames BondSean ConneryRoger MooreDaniel CraigAmazonAmazon Prime VideonewsShareReuse this content"

There were other parallels in their stories: Corrie was protesting against the demolition of a Palestinian family’s home in Rafah when a soldier drove over her; Eygi was at a protest against settlement expansion near Nablus. Both had traveled to the region with the International Solidarity Movement, a group that for years has brought foreign activists to stand with Palestinians against Israel’s occupation. An Israeli military investigationconcludedthat it was “highly likely” Eygi was hit “indirectly and unintentionally by IDF fire which was not aimed at her”; the Israeli military said that Corrie’s death was an accident and that she was responsible for it.Cindy and Craig Corrie pulled over at a highway rest stop when they got the call. “There’s really not much you can tell somebody,” Cindy told the Guardian in an interview recalling her first conversation with Eygi’s parents. “I told them all I was trying to do was hug them through the phone.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenTop: Rachel Corrie, then 23, stands between an Israeli bulldozer and a Palestinian physician’s house in the Rafah refugee camp in the Gaza strip in 2003.Bottom: Ayşenur Ezgi Eygi after her commencement ceremony at the University of Washington in Seattle, Washington, in June 2024.Photograph: International Solidarity Movement/Getty Images/ReutersSince Rachel Corrie’s killing in 2003, about a dozen US citizens are known to have died at the hands of Israeli soldiers or settlers, or while in Israeli custody. At least six have been killed in the West Bank alone since Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attacks and Israel’s ensuing war in Gaza.More than 40 US citizens were killed by Hamas in Israel on 7 October 2023, or after being taken hostage into Gaza. In those cases, the US justice department launched investigations and brought terrorism charges against the Hamas leaders it determined to be responsible, with the attorney general, Merrick Garland,pledgingthat the US government would investigate “each and every one of Hamas’ brutal murders of Americans”.But when it comes to killings by Israeli forces, the US government has consistently deferred to the Israeli military’s own investigations, which Israeli rights groups have for years condemned as a “whitewash” . Rights groups havefoundthat Israeli forces are almost never held accountable by the Israeli legal system when they harm Palestinians.To date, nobody has been charged or held accountable for any of the deaths of US citizens at Israeli hands. A spokesperson for the state department said in a statement to the Guardian that the department offers consular assistance to the families of citizens killed overseas; it declined to comment on individual cases citing “privacy and other considerations”. The spokesperson referred questions about the investigation of US citizens’ killings to the justice department. A spokesperson for the justice department declined to respond to a detailed list of questions from the Guardian, citing the government shutdown.Last month, the Corries joined a group united by grief and purpose for a series of meetings in Washington DC to demand the US government investigate their loved ones’killings. Eygi’s sister, Özden Bennett, and her husband, Hamid Ali, were there. So were the fathers ofTawfic Abdel Jabbar, a 17-year-old from Louisiana who was shot at least 10 times while driving his car in the West Bank in 2024, and ofSayfollah Musallet, a 20-year-old from Florida who witnesses say was beaten to death by Israeli settlers in July. (Israel claims Jabbar was suspected of stone throwing, an account contradicted by an investigation by the Israeli rights group B’Tselem. After Musallet’s killing, Israeli police arrested three settlers, but later released them. Israeli police did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for the IDF said that an investigation of the incident was ongoing.)Kamel Musallet, Sayfollah’s father, told legislators that his son, an ice-cream shop owner from Tampa who had traveled to the West Bank to visit family, often boasted to his friends about his “blue” passport. “He used to say, don’t worry, we are Americans,” said Musallet. “He felt safer.”View image in fullscreenTawfic Abdel Jabbar with his father, Hafeth Jabbar.Photograph: Obtained by the GuardianBut it turns out American citizenship offers little protection. Musallet was killed in al-Mazra’a ash-Sharqiya, a relatively wealthy village north of Ramallah home to a population of Palestinian Americans so large some have taken to call it the “Miamiof the West Bank”.One of the first people to reach his body was Hafeth Jabbar, the father of Tawfic. “This is what we are dealing with every day,” Jabbar told Representative Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts in a meeting. On his phone, he showed her videos of settlers attacking his land, and a photo of one of the men who he believes shot his son. “We’re in a climate that does not see the humanity of people.”At a private dinner at a Balkan restaurant before three days of meetings with legislators, the families bonded over their shared grief and fears their loved ones’ deaths would go unpunished – and that the impunity would lead to more killings. Ali, Eygi’s husband, recalled with a smile that when he had first spoken to the Corries, Craig had called the families an exclusive “club nobody wanted to be a part of”.The meetings – with more than a dozen Congress members and senators – along with apress conferenceon Capitol Hill attended by several legislators, underscored a gradual shift in Congress on Israel over the last two years: a measured reflection of a more tectonic shift on Israel in American society more broadly. In an op-ed published just minutes before he sat down with the families, Bernie Sanders from Vermontbecame the first US senatorto accuse Israel of committing genocide in Gaza. And days after meeting with them, Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon, joined by several colleagues,introduced a resolutioncalling on the US government to recognize a Palestinian state – another first.While Gaza has been more prominent in headlines, Israeli military and settler violence in the West Bank has also spiked since 7 October – with more Palestinians killed in the last two years than at any pointsince the second intifadain the early 2000s.“Since Hamas’ horrific attack on October 7th, there has been a massive increase in settlers harassing Palestinians in the West Bank: blocking access to water, vineyards, and olive orchards, and threatening and assaulting Palestinian villagers as they go about daily tasks,” Merkley said in a statement to the Guardian after a meeting with the families and Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, with whom he recently traveled to the West Bank.View image in fullscreenKamel Musallet shows Ayanna Pressley videos of settler attacks on his land.Photograph: Ayla Kadah for the Center for Constitutional Rights“This rising violence is unacceptable, and so too is the lack of justice for these families from the Netanyahu government,” Merkley added. “As Israel’s close ally, the US government must do more to ensure accountability for those impacted.”While the changes in Congress have been subtle, and US government support for Israel remains largely unchanged, the shift in public opinion has been more significant. More than half of US adults hold unfavourable opinions of Israel, according to a recent Pew Research Centersurvey, compared with 42% before the war started.‘Here we are again’The US justice department can exert jurisdiction over the killings of US citizens abroad butnormally does sowith the consent and assistance of authorities of the relevant country. It’s rare for US civilians abroad to be killed by a state’s own security forces. Israel has become an exception.“When Americans are killed abroad, it’s a standard procedure for our US government to open an investigation,” Representative Rashida Tlaib said at the families’ press conference. “But when murderers wear Israeli uniforms, there’s complete silence. Not only that, they ask the actual government that committed the crime to do the investigation.”View image in fullscreenRashida Tlaib speaks as families of Americans killed by Israeli forces and settlers gather outside the Capitol in Washington DC on 16 September.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe Corries spent years after Rachel’s killing trying to get the US government to open an independent investigation, lobbying legislators on countless trips to the capital in a futile crusadeI documenteda few years ago. After losing a years-longlegal battleagainst the Israeli government, andanotherin the US against bulldozer manufacturer Caterpillar, the family eventually gave up. They resumed their advocacy after the 2022 killing of the journalistShireen Abu Akleh, who was shot in the head while reporting in the West Bank city of Jenin. The IDF has apologized for the killing.Abu Akleh’s death is the only killing of a US citizen by Israeli forces over which the FBI is understood to havelaunched a formal investigation. (Although the FBI has interviewed witnesses, sources say, the US justice department never publicly confirmed the existence of the investigation, which appears to have stalled.)View image in fullscreenMohammed Ibrahim.Photograph: Obtained by the GuardianIn their meetings with legislators, the families repeatedly pointed to the US government’s response to the killing of Americans in the 7 October attacks, lamenting the double standard and warning that continued impunity all but ensured more killings to come. They also coalesced around a demand that US legislators apply more pressure on Israel to releaseMohammed Ibrahim, a 16-year-old American Palestinian boy – and Sayfollah Musallet’s cousin – who has been held in Israeli military prison for more than seven months over allegations of stone throwing.“If there had been any accountability in Rachel’s case some of these families wouldn’t be here,” Cindy Corrie said in a meeting with Senator Peter Welch of Vermont. “And yet, here we are again,” her husband added.View image in fullscreenA pin bearing the face of Aysenur Ezgi Eygi.Photograph: Alice Speri/The GuardianOver tea at a congressional cafeteria, Cindy Corrie said she had tried to be “honest” about the path ahead when speaking to the Eygis. If history is any indication, their calls for justice may lead to nothing.But she also recognized a perceptible shift, on the hill and off. “The climate in 2003 around this issue was very different,” she said.In their early meetings in Congress, the Corries recalled, they would often show up to congressional offices with maps showing where Gaza was. Few legislators were willing to publicly criticize Israel at the time, and some were dismissive of the Corries and even hostile.Now things are different: within days of Eygi’s killing,more than 100legislators called on the Biden administration to launch an independent investigation. In Washington, Eygi’s husband was stopped at a Mexican restaurant by a woman wearing a keffiyeh who recognized the activist on a pin he was wearing. A security guard at one of the congressional buildings where the family met with legislators also recognized Eygi on a pin her sister was wearing.“I’m sorry about your loss. I hope that they listen to you,” he told her. She handed him a pin.Explore more on these topicsUS newsIsrael-Gaza: two years onIsraelPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But look closer and these beguiling works evoke societal as much as material collapseMon 6 Oct 2025 08.43 EDTLast modified on Mon 6 Oct 2025 10.26 EDTShareIf you’re considering bathroom renovations, I would perhaps advise against hiring Lisa Herfeldt to do the work.Yes, it’s true, she’s something of a whiz with a silicone gun – creating compelling sculptures from this unlikely art material. But the more you look at her creations the more you realise that something is a littleoff. The thick lengths of sealant she produces stretch beyond the shelves on which they sit, sagging off the edges towards the floor. The knotty foam pipes bulge until they split. Some creations escape their acrylic glass box homes entirely, becoming a magnet for dust and hair. Let’s just say the Checkatrade reviews would not be pretty.“I sometimes have the feeling that things are alive in a room,” says the German artist when we meet in Margate, where she is about to open her first UK solo show atRoland Rossgallery. “That’s why I came to use this foam material because it has this very bodily texture and feeling.”Indeed there’s something rather body horror about Herfeldt’s work, from the phallic bulge that protrudes, hernia-like, from its cylindrical stand in the centre of the gallery, to the intestinal coils of foam that rupture like medical emergencies. On one wall Herfeldt has framed photocopies of the works viewed from different angles: they look like wormy parasites picked up on a microscope, or growths on a petri-dish. “It interests me that there are things in our bodies happening that also have their own life,” she says. “Things you can’t see or control.”Talking of things she can’t control, the poster for the show features a photograph of the leaky ceiling in her own studio in Kreuzberg, Berlin – a brown, uneven stain on a square white panel. The building was built in the early 1970s and, she says, was instantly hated by local people because a lot of old buildings were torn down in order to make way for it. It was already in a state of disrepair when Herfeldt – who was born in Munich but grew up north of Hamburg before arriving in Berlin as a teenager – moved in.This decrepit property was frustrating for the artist – she couldn’t hang her art works without fearing they might be damaged – but it was also fascinating. With no building plans available, nobody had a clue how to repair any of the issues that arose. When the ceiling panel in Herfeldt’s studio became so sodden it collapsed entirely, the only solution was to replace the panel with a new one – and so the cycle continued.At another site on the property, Herfeldt says the leaking was so bad that a series of shower basins were installed in the suspended ceiling in order to redirect the water to a different sink. “I realised that the building was like a body, a totally dysfunctional body,” she says.View image in fullscreen‘Things you can’t see or control’ … Lisa Herfeldt.Photograph: Peter Flude/The GuardianThe situation reminded her ofDark Star, John Carpenter’s debut 1974 film about an AI-powered spacecraft that takes on a life of its own. And as you might notice from the show’s title – Alice, Laurie & Ripley – that’s not the only film to have influenced Herfeldt’s show. The three names refer to the female protagonists inFriday 13th,HalloweenandAlienrespectively. Herfeldt citesa 1987 essayby the American professor Carol J Clover, which identifies these “final girls” as a unique film trope – women left alone to save the day. “She’s a bit tomboyish, on the silent side and she can survive because she’s quite clever,” says Herfeldt of the archetypal final girl. “They don’t take drugs or have sex. And it doesn’t matter the viewer’s gender, we can all identify with the final girl.”Herfeldt sees a parallel between these characters and her sculptures – things that are just about holding in place despite the pressures they’re under. So is her work more about societal collapse than just leaky ceilings? Because like so many institutions, these materials that should seal and protect us from damage are actually slowly eroding around us. “Oh, totally,” says Herfeldt.Before finding inspiration in the silicone gun, Herfeldt used other unusual materials. Recent shows have involved tongue-like shapes made from the kind of nylon fabric you might see on a sleeping bag or inside a jacket. Again there is the sense these strange items could come alive – some are concertinaed like caterpillars mid-crawl, others lollop down from walls or spill across doorways attracting dirt from footprints (Herfeldt encourages viewers to touch and dirty her art). Like the silicone sculptures, these nylon creations are also housed in – and escaping from – cheap looking acrylic glass boxes.

Her fellow countryman Sam Campbell has boyish charm, after all – and in some of those frocks, even Dame Edna cut quite the dash. But if you’re thinking in these terms – if you’re taking the claim at face value – you’ve already got the title toEftos’s hit standup showall wrong. You wouldn’t be the first. “I had fellow comedians telling me, ‘You shouldn’t call yourself that,’” says Eftos. “I found that so fascinating and sad, that I was told I was stepping out of line just for using this silly title.” She pauses. “Comedians are some of the most serious people I’ve met in my life. I do find it funny that they can’t take a joke.”Eftos speaks from the vantage point of the outsider – as a still-recent arrival in comedy, and because of her Greek-Macedonian heritage, palpably a significant thing for her when we talk over a video-call while she holidays after the Edinburgh fringe. From that perspective, she rips into comedy and its macho myths in her show (“Everyone tells you how hard it’s going to be [to do comedy] … It’s not that hard at all”), and publicly airs her beef with several prominent comics, too. Titled Australia’s First Attractive Comedian, the set secured for the 33-year-old a best newcomer nomination in Edinburgh, making gleeful play in the uncomfortable space between comedy, feminism and sex appeal.The fact that I don’t do self-deprecating comedy rubbed people up the wrong wayIt was, I say to Eftos, one of those shows you can’t believe hasn’t been made before – so fertile is its territory for comedy, so uncomfortable (clearly, still, for some) the inquiry: “Can you be both funny and sexy?” You might have thought that question had long since been resolved: there are no shortage of good-looking comics, after all. “But in Australia,” says Eftos, “everybody’s doing self-deprecating humour and dressing down. Nobody’s talking about how good-looking they are on stage. The fact that I don’t do self-deprecating comedy rubbed people up the wrong way.”Prior to life as a comedian, Eftos was an actor, and an MC in a cabaret with “a Pussycat Dolls vibe. The whole shtick was high status, ‘You can’t touch us up here.’ It was sexy and funny and strong.” So when she moved to Sydney and took up live comedy (“How else am I going to get on stage? How else am I going to get my name out there?”), performing as a glam siren supremely confident in her own sexiness felt like an obvious way to go.View image in fullscreenJokes – or brassy statements of facts? … Eftos.Photograph: Matt FordIt took chutzpah. “I am obviously confident on stage,” says Eftos, “but I also have self-doubt.” You’d never guess when watching the show, which begins with a homage to Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct and just gets sexier. Or sillier: one of its most fantastic qualities is that you’re never certain what’s a joke and what’s a brassy statement of fact. Do “couples in the crowd”, as Eftos would have it, “look at me as the other woman who’s about to steal their husband when I walk out on stage”? And does she really consider herself so superior to we “normies” in her audience? – whose supposed erotic excitement at the very sight of her is animated in a hilarious running joke.The character is, says Eftos, “a heightened version of me. Except, I’m a very anxious person in real life.” The flak her act has drawn – from veteran female entertainers including (greatly to Eftos’s alarm) Nia Vardalos ofMy Big Fat Greek Weddingfame – can only have added to that anxiety. But Eftos confronts that criticism head-on in the show, taking the attack right back to the sceptics. “I don’t mean to have a go at them,” she says, “but I try and encourage us all to think differently. I can only imagine what they went through, getting into comedy as women in the 80s and 90s. But my experience isn’t that different. And it doesn’t mean I’m a bad person or a bad comedian just because I wear a dress on stage and you can see my nipples.”She goes on: “As a woman, and as a woman in comedy, you’re always being told, ‘Don’t be too attractive.’ And even though the title doesn’t refer specifically to female comedians, female comic friends of mine would say, ‘Well, that’s how people will interpret it, so you shouldn’t say it.’” Is it an act of feminist betrayal to foreground, or send up, your own attractiveness? “What roles do you have to play to please society?” asks Eftos. “To please men? Versus this whole idea that if you’re a real feminist, you mustn’t do anything to please men.” Alongside the big laughs, her show engages thoughtfully with those questions, receiving acclaim for doing so.Elouise Eftos: Australia’s First Attractive Comedian review – fabulously provocative jokesRead more“I had a dream run,” says Eftos now of her fringe show, the goal of which was to secure UK management and profile, prior to a London move. “They get my sense of humour more over here,” says an act who cut her comedy teeth watching “Benny Hill, French and Saunders, Monty Python – all the old-school British comedy”. Now a follow-up standup show is brewing: “My next hour will focus on the fact that I’ve never been in love and I don’t think it’s real,” she says, tantalisingly.The comedy world, at least, now seems to be falling for Australia’s First Attractive Comedian – and she couldn’t be happier. “I’m so grateful I get to do this as a job. I’d love to be performing live for the rest of my life.”Elouise Eftos: Australia’s First Attractive Comedian is atSoho theatre, London, 7-11 OctoberExplore more on these topicsComedyEdinburgh festival 2025featuresShareReuse this content"

The director reveals how she made itDavid Smithin WashingtonMon 6 Oct 2025 10.53 EDTLast modified on Mon 6 Oct 2025 12.36 EDTShare‘To this day,” says Geeta Gandbhir, “I’m devastated.” The film-maker is talking about the killing of Ajike “AJ” Owens, a black woman shot dead by her white neighbour inFloridatwo years ago. Gandbhir first came to the case in a personal capacity, as 35-year-old Owens was a family friend.But things quickly changed. She and her team worked hard to drum up media attention and pressure law enforcement and government institutions to take action – and hold this neighbour, 60-year-old Susan Lorincz, accountable. They began filming protests and vigils, intending to create short pieces for news outlets.The law says you only have to prove you feared your life was in danger. This is being weaponisedAll this grew and has now resulted in The Perfect Neighbor, a film by Gandbhir, who may well have invented a new subgenre of true crime documentary. By telling the story almost entirely using official – and harrowing – police body camera footage, the 55-year-old director has moved beyond traditional narrative to present an unfiltered and unflinching account of a tightknit community facing a horror in its midst.It was made possible by Owens’ mother, Pamela Dias, who consented to footage being made public. “I showed Pam the film when it was completed,” says Gandbhir, “and I said, ‘Is this what you want?’ She said, ‘Yes – the world needs to know what happened to my baby.’”The central themes of the film, which premiered at this year’s Sundance festival and is about to stream on Netflix, include the devastating impact of Florida’s “stand your ground” laws, the weaponisation of race and fear, and the failure of law enforcement to de-escalate a known threat. The shooting was the culmination of a long-running argument between Owens and Lorincz over the former’s children playing in a grassy area near both their houses in Ocala, about 80 miles from Orlando. Owens went to Lorincz’s home after her children complained that she had thrown rollerskates and an umbrella at them, annoyed yet again by their boisterous play.Lorincz claimed she was acting in self-defence when she fired a single shot from a .380-caliber handgun through her front door, killing Owens. “She dehumanised Ajike over time,” says Gandbhir, “to the point where she was like, ‘The only answer is that I shoot her.’” There were protests in the black community in Ocala when prosecutors took weeks to charge Lorincz with manslaughter – a lesser count than second-degree murder, which carries a potential life sentence. She was eventually sentenced to 25 years in prison for manslaughter.The project’s trajectory shifted dramatically after one crucial development. Dias’s lawyers used the Freedom of Information Act to compel the police to release all materials pertaining to the case. As well as a huge amount of police body camera footage, this included mobile phone footage, security camera footage, phone calls made by Lorincz, and detective interrogations.View image in fullscreen‘A real lack of remorse’ … video provided by the Marion County Sheriff’s Office of Susan Lorincz’s arrest.Photograph: APAs Gandbhir and her team assessed these files, their immense potential slowly dawned on them. “It was a mess when it came to us,” Gandbhir says. “But I’m a film-maker – it’s my only skill in life. We managed to get through it all. And I realised we could do more with it.” This, she thought, was more than a collection of raw clips – it was a comprehensive, unvarnished archive that could form the basis of a feature-length documentary.Gandbhir approached Dias and suggested creating a film that would not only honour her daughter’s memory and seek justice, but could also be licensed or sold to provide financial support for the family, and have a broader societal impact. Dias gave her blessing, providing the moral mandate for the project to proceed.Gandbhir began her career in scripted film, working with directors including Spike Lee and Robert Altman, before switching to documentaries. Her decision to base it almost exclusively on official footage is the defining feature of The Perfect Neighbor, which deliberately eschews traditional elements such as narration, expert interviews and talking heads. The result is immersive and propulsive.“The key to the best storytelling,” Gandbhir says, “and what you see often in narrative films and scripted films and in the best verité documentaries, is show and don’t tell. If you tell an audience what’s happening, they might question you: who are you and how do you know? Talking heads are a wonderful tool but if you have the ability to show an audience, they will trust you. They will go on the ride with you. We believe audiences are smart and empathetic and can come to their own conclusions. We wanted to embed them in this world.”View image in fullscreenA patched bullet hole on the door through which Owens was shot.Photograph: John Raoux/APThe body camera footage certainly puts viewers right among the action. We watch a group of children, one on a bike, as an officer asks if they’ve been “messing with this lady”. We are with the police as they knock on Lorincz’s door to investigate complaints. We are thrown into chaos on the night Owens dies as her children grieve and emergency services try to revive her.“It’s institutional footage,” Gandbhir says. “I felt the public would never doubt its authenticity. There was no reporter on the ground with bias. Right now, there is a lot of doubt about the authenticity of things. I believed that people would trust what they were seeing as it unfolded.“Also, police body camera footage for people of colour like myself, for black and brown folks, oftentimes is seen as a violent tool. The police come into our communities and, afterwards, they use body camera footage to criminalise and dehumanise us, to justify violence they may perpetrate against the community. I wanted to take this footage and flip it on its head.”The footage includes previous incidents involving Lorincz and her neighbours over two years. “You see the community as they were before the crime, this beautiful little community living together, taking care of each other. You see the children playing in the street and the parents all looking out. There’s a father who comes out and says, ‘I look out for all of them as if they’re mine.’ There’s a neighbour who says, ‘All these kids are mine’ to the cops. The children themselves are confident and precocious and unafraid of the police. They are loved and secure. They have multiple guardians. I wanted to show how one outlier with access to a gun – one dangerous person – could change all of that.”She believed she was going to get away with it until the very last minuteThe police fundamentally failed the community, Gandbhir says. They consistently viewed Lorincz as a “nuisance” rather than a threat, even as her behaviour escalated. She used hate speech and racial slurs, waved a gun and terrorised the children – while repeatedly calling the police. In depicting Lorincz, the film relies on police interrogation footage that reveals a calculated pattern of behaviour, in which she would alternate between two personalities: one aggressive, another positioning herself as the perpetual victim.Under the pressure of questioning, says Gandbhir, “the case she had built for herself in her mind crumbled”. But rather than labelling Lorincz, the film simply presents her own words and actions. “Most fascinating,” Gandbhir says, “was how she believed she was going to get away with it until the very last minute. There was a real lack of remorse. Her only concern was herself.”The Perfect Neighbor also shines a light on “stand your ground” laws that, in more than half of US states, remove a person’s legal duty to retreat from a perceived threat before using deadly force. Florida’s version allows individuals to use deadly force if they believe their life is in danger, even if a safe retreat is possible. This led to the2013 acquittal of George Zimmerman, who shot unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Miami Gardens, Florida. Research shows that homicides with white aggressors and black victims are five times more likely to be ruled justifiable.During her police interrogation, Lorincz admits to having researched the “stand your ground” laws, thereby revealing that her actions were not the spontaneous result of fear but a calculated strategy. “These laws,” Gandbhir says, “are often weaponised by people. You just have to prove that you had a well-founded fear that your life was in danger. This is incredibly dangerous for people of colour, who are often criminalised and seen as a threat.”View image in fullscreen‘A violent tool’ … police bodycam footage in The Perfect Neighbor.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixThe story of Owens and Lorincz is also the story of America today, in all its seething rage and fear; a place of racial division and gun violence. But Gandbhir found grounds for hope. “This film holds a mirror up to society. You see it in Susan’s behaviour, in her weaponising the police and dehumanising the community and her neighbours. She choses to ‘adultify’ and criminalise the children, most of them under 12, playing in a yard near her house that they had permission to be in.“There are many Susans – but there are also many people like the neighbours. This shows you the best of America because it shows you a diverse, multiracial community living together, loving each other, taking care of each other’s kids.“The night that Ajike was killed, you see obviously the horror, but you also see that community spring into action. They put their lives in danger. They went out on to the lawn and surrounded Ajike. Susan was still in the house with a gun. They didn’t know how trigger-happy she was. They didn’t know what she was going to do. They went and immediately took the children and held them.“That is the best of America. That is what I believe in and what we hope people walk away with – realising that communities like that need to be protected. We must protect them from the Susans of the world.”The Perfect Neighbor opens in UK cinemas on 10 October and streams on Netflix from 17 OctoberExplore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsUS crimeFloridaRacefeaturesShareReuse this content"

He’s like, ‘I’mKevin McKay.’ I said, ‘You’d better be good!’”The pair were setting off on a terrifying, five-hour journey with nearly two dozen elementary school students as theCamp fireengulfed Paradise,California, in 2018. It was the start of a beautiful friendship.“That day I met a stranger and put my complete trust in that stranger and today we’re very close, lifelong friends,” Ludwig adds.Their story is told in the filmThe Lost Bus, directed by Paul Greengrass and now streaming onApple TV+.Matthew McConaugheyplays McKay while America Ferrera co-stars as Ludwig, who went along for the ride expecting a straightforward drop-off at a nearby school only to be caught in an inferno.The Lost Bus review – Paul Greengrass wildfire movie is as stressful as you’d expectRead moreGreengrass – known for Bloody Sunday,United 93, Captain Phillips and the Jason Bourne franchise – says in production notes: “It’s a world far removed from Los Angeles, blue-collar, with its own culture and rhythm. From the first moment you see him [McConaughey] as Kevin, you believe he’s that bus driver whose life hasn’t gone as he hoped, and who finds in this crisis a chance for redemption.”Back then McKay could feel the American dream slipping away. His divorce had led to a custody battle. He had recently lost his father to cancer and moved his mother, who had stage 4 melanoma and was barely able to walk,into his home. In April he had quit his job running a Walgreens pharmacy store so he could put himself back through college and took a job as a bus driver to make ends meet.One night in November he had to get a vet to put down his pet dog, a procedure that became complicated and deprived him of sleep. The next morning, his son Shaun was home sick with stomach flu. It was also that day that a faulty power line would spark the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history, raging for more than two weeks, claiming 85 lives and virtuallyburning the town of Paradiseoff the map.Ludwig knew something was wrong that morning even before she got to work at Ponderosa elementary school. The 57-year-old says from Chico, California: “I headed out to the car and stopped in my driveway because I have asthma and I was physically reacting to what was going on but visually it didn’t make sense.“I got out of my car and looked at the sky and I’m like, it looks like it’s going to rain. My brain was telling me something different from what my body’s telling me. I went back in the house and got my dad’s handkerchief. I used that handkerchief on the bus that day.“I drove up the street, but when you drive up along Pentz Road, the great pine trees mask the canyon, so my eyes were burning, my chest was tight but you don’t see anything. I was about five minutes late to work and some of my students were tearing into the classroom saying there’s logs falling from the sky like embers.”Still relatively new to the job, McKay typically drove his bus on a route that did not include Ponderosa elementary. But as the fire took hold, a dispatcher asked if any drivers were available to evacuate the school. McKay, who had been hoping to make a quick stop at home to check on his mother and son, instinctively volunteered.He soon arrived at Ponderosa elementary and picked up Ludwig and another teacher named Abbie Davis (they are combined in one character for the screen version) along with 22 students. Ludwig confesses: “I was a little bit terrified in the fact that I didn’t know him and here I was going to be evacuated.“We had embers landing in our hair. When you walked out towards the bus, it was dark. It looked like midnight so you’re like, OK, who is this guy? But I had no control. All I could do was trust him and feel very blessed that he was there with me and driving us.”What followed is the propulsive engine of Greengrass’s movie, a white-knuckle ride through one of the worst US wildfires with the lives of children at stake. Setting off on the bus, McKay and Ludwig saw their first fire within minutes. Two trees had been destroyed in a yard supposedly made fire safe.McKay, 48, recounts from Chico: “My idea of a fire is ‘Hey, there’s a bear in the canyon, it’s heading towards town, so we should probably not be on that side of town.’ You move west instead of east and you’ll be fine. But what that made me realize was that those embers that were burning our heads were starting thousands of fires all over town.”“The explosions I thought were like propane tanks exploding. Later, some of my Cal Fire [California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection] friends explained to me, when a house goes up in flames, there’s a pressure that builds up inside the house and that’ll generally explode through the windows.”View image in fullscreenA home burns as the Camp fire rages through Paradise, California.Photograph: Noah Berger/APAs they converse on Zoom and the memories flow, McKay and Ludwig at times find themselves on the brink of tears. She chimes in:“It was a lot of red taillights in the beginning, cars jam-packed. We saw pocket fires but the sounds of explosions were extremely strong, especially towards the end. Utter darkness and embers.“The film truly captured the visual intensity and quiet fear that we all felt that day. That’s the feeling that I feel in my heart. There were segments of tons of noise and segments of silence. It was very intense.”McKay admits she has given him the chills: “The quiet silence that we would have for a few minutes and then you hear maybe some horns or feel the heat on the windows of the bus. Without being silly, I don’t want to say like a horror movie, but it very much had a personality of silence and eeriness.“Traffic would start moving and we would move and it’s like turning the page in a book. We’d move into a time of chaos. Somebody’s banging on the window of the bus and freaking out and screaming and there was a moment where a car hit the side of the bus.”‘I don’t want to stop believing in humanity’: Matthew McConaughey on faith, fame and the shocking incident that defined himRead moreHe adds: “Mary and I had to internalise all of that because as soon as we start freaking out we’re going to take the kids from a five to a 10 and the kids are going to be literally in a horror movie if they realise what’s happening.”With smoke seeping in through the windows, McKay took off his shirt, which was torn into pieces and doused with water so the children could hold damp shreds to their mouths and breathe more easily. Ludwig offered McKay a bottle of water but he refused, saying the kids should take priority. She slammed the bottle on McKay’s shoulder and refused to take no for an answer.He recalls: “She said, ‘Listen, tough guy, we need you to keep doing what you’re doing, drink that bottle.’ Oh my gosh, holy smokes, that was the best drink of water I have ever had! She ended up taking one of the pieces of my shirt that she had in her hand and poured some water on it and rubbed it on my forehead.“The sensory overload I had in those moments filled me with something. It was overwhelming, the feeling of the water and the cool towel on my face. I had been so in the ‘fight or flight’ mechanism all day for hours that I had no idea. That stimulus of the cold rag on my forehead and then tasting the water brought my wits back to me for a little bit.“That was before the craziest time that we experienced, driving past houses that are totally engulfed in flames. People all over the street screaming and yelling, cars running into each other. That was such an intense mile for us that honestly I hardly remember it because it was pure adrenaline. Hey, either way, I’m hitting the gas, we’re out of here.”Ludwig was worried about her own son at home but drew inspiration from the memory of her father, a second world war veteran. She says: “There were difficult moments and I did my best to normalise. There was a moment where I caught myself. I was emotional. I was trying to get my son to wake up and get him out of the house. I looked to God, I looked to my parents, I looked to my dad and felt the strength. I put on that soldier mask.”View image in fullscreenAmerica Ferrera in The Lost Bus.Photograph: Apple TV+/PAMcKay, Ludwig and Davis had quiet conversations to plan for what would happen if they had to abandon the bus and continue on foot. They would pair older students with younger and split into three groups, each with a copy of the roll sheet in case the others did not make it. Fortunately, this did not prove necessary.Through it all, the children displayed a stoicism beyond their years. Ludwig reflects: “The kids were so brave and so strong. We all tried to make it feel like we were on a field trip. We were trying to make it that we were going to this destination and we were going to get there. Some of the kids were playing rock, paper, scissors.“We used some humour: the moment we tore up Kevin’s shirt, I told the kids, ‘Well, look who got the armpit.’ We saw the Black Bear Diner, and Kevin and I asked, ‘Who loves pancakes?’ We tried to make them giggle. We tried to do whatever we could to let them feel safe and let them know that everything was going to be OK.I feel like the kids were rock stars. I am proud of those children.”When after 30 miles (48km) the bus finally reached safety, the bone-deep anxiety of waiting parents turned into relief and euphoria. Ludwig, who was on set to watch the scene dramatised, says: “We stayed till every last parent picked up their child and it was very emotional. I cried, Kevin cried; there were many tears. But it was beautiful to see that reunification.”Both McKay, who fulfilled his dream of becoming a high school teacher, and Ludwig praise The Lost Bus for capturing the emotional truth of that day. Written by Greengrass and Brad Ingelsby, the movie is based on journalist Lizzie Johnson’s bookParadise: One Town’s Struggle to Survive an American Wildfire, which recounted true stories from a catastrophe thatkeeps replayingin California.Now theUkraine correspondentof the Washington Post newspaper, Johnson says by phone from Kyiv: “I hope by reading the book and seeing the film people will realize this affects all of us. We’ve built ourselves into this crisis by putting homes where they shouldn’t be. These fires are going to get worse before they get better. To pretend they’re going away is like sticking your head in the sand.”The Lost Bus is out on Apple TV+ nowExplore more on these topicsPaul GreengrassCalifornia wildfiresMatthew McConaugheyWildfiresDrama filmsCaliforniaAction and adventure filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If something is troubling her then it invariably finds its way out in the open and into her work. Her early theatre shows, includingSex Idiotand7 Day Drunk, took audiences on a freewheeling tour through the perils of early adulthood. Love, desire and STIs. Anxiety, alcohol and the drive to create good work. They were whirlwind one-woman shows, brimming with creativity, rammed with zany props and mad detours, and – despite all the doubts and fears contained within them – glowing with a childlike sort of optimism.Later shows would see Kimmings pull other people and their concerns on to the stage. InCredible Likeable Superstar Role Model, Kimmings and her nine-year-old niece created and performed a powerful critique of the hyper-sexualisation of tween culture. She and her then partner Tim Grayburn explored the devastating impact of depression inFake It ’Til You Make It. As her profile grew, there followed an ambitious musical about cancer at the National Theatre (A Pacifist’s Guide to the War on Cancer) andI’m a Phoenix, Bitch, a ragingly powerful solo show about postnatal depression and the breakdown of Kimmings’s relationship and mental health.Now the 44-year-old artist is deeply worried about the climate crisis – and she’s not just creating a show about it. She’s upending her life. Three years ago, after getting together with projection artist and self-taught ecologist Will Duke, Kimmings left Brighton with her young son Frank and moved to rural East Sussex. The family is surrounded by farmland. They have huge polytunnels and water butts, 25 fruit and nut trees and their own chicks and ducks. Within the next two years, they fully intend to get a farming co-op off the ground (it normally takes around 10 years, but Kimmings isn’t one to hang around).View image in fullscreenRaging … Bryony Kimmings in I’m a Phoenix, Bitch in 2018.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianAs we talk over video call, Kimmings is just as personable on screen as she is on stage and quick to develop an intimate rapport with her audience of one. Her sentences splinter as her mind races off in different directions. There’s always another book to reference, an anecdote or silly impression to squeeze in; a different part of herself to reveal, laugh at and offer up for inspection.When we moved here, we were quite worthy. If you don’t have a solar panel then who are you? I’m glad we didn’t make the show thenBog Witch is Kimmings’s first devised theatre show in five years. Part of that is down to logistics. The show was a commission from Soho theatre – a long-time champion of Kimmings – which wanted her to headline the opening of theirnew 960-seat theatre in Walthamstow, east London. Only the building work kept getting delayed. Before all those delays, the show was going to be called Soil and Water. Kimmings laughs ruefully about this rather earnest starting point: “Luckily, we had more time to think about it. When we first moved out here, we were quite worthy. If you don’t have a solar panel then who are you? I’m glad we didn’t make the show then.”Some way into the devising process, Kimmings and her long-term collaborators decided to change the title and position it firmly as a mainstream comedy: “It had to be a standup show because I feel like that’s where it’s the most populist. That’s where we’ll get the most bums on seats.” And the butt of the joke? Kimmings. Always Kimmings. “In all my shows, I will always try to be the stupidest person in the room. Because that’s the clown way of doing things. Nobody in here is going to make a mistake as big as my mistake. I’m the clown. Laugh at me. Because then everyone feels less bad about themselves.”View image in fullscreen‘I always try to be the stupidest person in the room’ …Kimmings with her niece Taylor in Credible Likeable Superstar Role Model.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianGradually, Bog Witch evolved into a comedy aboutBryony Kimmings, the most reluctant and unlikely ecowarrior you’ve ever encountered: “It’s the story of being a terrible climate activist. Of not wanting to move to the countryside. Of wanting to try to find something to fill the void. The hole in my soul that wouldn’t go away. It’s about asking the audience: do you feel like there’s something wrong too?”It’s all part of Kimmings’s resolve, which started in earnest during the pandemic, to only make work about the climate crisis. On top of her work in theatre, Kimmings is also developing an eco horror movie called Little Red Hen. “It’s set in an eco homestead that is the only place in a rural community that is equipped to survive eco collapse. So all the other villagers, who have never helped this place before, descend on it during the emergency. It’s a slasher movie, too. When the end comes, who do you want to bring into the new dawn?”She’s hoping the film will be “camp” and “gory” and, most importantly, a bit of a laugh: “I’m desperate to make climate stories that are really funny. Engaging. Solution-based programmes and pieces of theatre.” She’s also got a primetime BBC drama in the works,The Rapture, which started filming this summer. Based on Liz Jensen’s bestselling novel and starring Ruth Madeley, the show follows a juvenile inmate in a mental health institution and her newly disabled psychotherapist, who have to figure out a climate conspiracy together.View image in fullscreenFreewheeling … Kimmings in 7 Day Drunk in 2011.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianAll of Kimmings’s latest work aims to cultivate hope rather than despair: “It’s a tough sell. Nobody wants to know about climate change for lots of reasons and some of that is because it’s just not fun. It’s bleak. And what I’ve realised from hanging around with all these farmers and permaculturalists is that there’s so much good stuff happening. There’s so much good going on out there. All of this is not a sealed deal.”In the past, Kimmings’s shows were often created with the intention of spurring the audience into action. With Bog Witch, she says: “I want to create a fucking great night out and equip the audience with some tools and coping mechanisms. But we’re not being too bold with this one. All we will say is that seeing Bog Witch might make you want to engage with the climate crisis. Dipping your toe in isn’t going to kill you.”Optimism runs through our conversation, although she struggles to feel hopeful about the theatre industry as a whole. “I love the world of performance art. I love the creativity and experimentalism. But there’s not much going on right now and that’s not because there aren’t brilliant artists. It’s because the courses have closed and the festivals have closed. An entire movement of art is scrabbling around trying to find opportunity and I find that very sad.”Kimmings believes it’s harder than ever to make a living in theatre. “It doesn’t pay enough. There isn’t enough work, especially for people like me. The funding is going down. It isn’t sustainable for family life. It doesn’t have social hours. Looking at this year on the spreadsheet of earnings, and then looking at TV, it’s a no-brainer that I work in TV.”Yet something keeps pulling Kimmings back to the stage. “Theatre is my love.” She’s not sure she likes straight plays – too fake, too staged – but on those rare and special times when theatre really works? “When that happens and you’re in a room with other bodies, there’s nothing like it. It’s like church. The awe. The connection.” For Kimmings, that’s what drives her stage work. “It’s always about that exchange. It’s never aboutmyfeelings. I’m a mirror foryourfeelings. As far as I’m concerned, you go to the theatre to see yourself.”Bog Witch is atSoho Theatre Walthamstow, London, 9-25 OctoberExplore more on these topicsBryony KimmingsTheatreSoho theatreComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Climate crisisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Until that day comes, here’s Carmen Emmi’s drama about a cop in early 90s New York who is part of an entrapment team at a suburban shopping mall prosecuting gay men who cruise the bathrooms (a type of police work that you might think went out in the era of Alan Turing).Tom Blyth plays Lucas, an undercover officer suffering from depression after the death of his dad and breakup with his girlfriend to whom he confessed having feelings for men; his nervous unease is not made any easier by a loudmouthed homophobic uncle at family gatherings. The movie is interspersed with Lucas’s anxiety-flash glimpses of his own life, significantly shot in the same dull, flat analogue video that the cops use to record incriminating evidence of their suspects in the toilets from a concealed camera. Video is endowed with the texture of shame and this is how Lucas subconsciously sees the dangerous truth about himself. In the course of his work, he falls for a gentle, intelligent older guy called Andrew, played by Russell Tovey, that he is supposed to be arresting. But just as poor Lucas realises that he is in love, he realises also that for Andrew he is just another ephemeral encounter.Plainclothes is heartfelt in many ways, but burdened with a colossally melodramatic ending connected with a very elaborate plot twist around a misunderstanding, like something from a 19th-century novel, concerning a lost or indeed purloined letter, the existence of which is not entirely plausible, considering that its author is supposedly anxious not to maintain contact with Lucas. An interesting, but flawed work.Plainclothes is in UK cinemas from 10 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsUS policingLGBTQ+ rightsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Now, having finally quit heroin, he’s back with a new album, a memoir – and no regretsMon 6 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTShareEvan Dando rolls up a sleeve and points to a line of small dents running down his forearm, faint scars from decades of heroin abuse. “It takes so long to get decent track marks,” he says. “You do it for years and you think: I can’t stop yet. Maybe my skin is particularly tough, but you can barely see it now. What was it all for, eh?” He grins and lets out a raspy laugh. “Just kidding!”Dando, one-time indie pin-up and leading light of 90s alt-rock band the Lemonheads, looks in reasonable nick for a man who has taken every drug going from the age of 14. The songwriter behind such exalted tracks as It’s a Shame About Ray and My Drug Buddy, Dando is also known as rock’s most notorious burn-out, a star who seemingly had it all and threw it away. He is warm, goofily charismatic and completely unfiltered. We meet at lunchtime at his publishers’ offices in Clerkenwell, central London, where he wonders if we should move our chat to the pub. In the end, he sends out for two pints of cider, which he then forgets to drink. Often losing his train of thought, he is apt to go off on wild tangents. No wonder he has given up owning a smartphone: “I can’t deal with the internet, man. My mind is too all over the place. I just want to read everything at once.”He and his wife Antonia Teixeira, whom he married last year, have flown in from São Paulo, Brazil, where they live and where Dando now has three adult stepchildren. “I’m trying to be the backbone of this new family. I didn’t embrace [family] much in my life, but I’m ready to try. I’m doing pretty good so far.” Now 58, he says he is clean, though this turns out to be a loose concept: “I’ll take acid occasionally, maybe mushrooms and I’ll smoke pot.”View image in fullscreenJust like Evan … Dando performing at the Newport Folk festival in July 2025.Photograph: Douglas Mason/Getty ImagesClean to him means not doing heroin, which he hasn’t touched in nearly three years. He decided it was time to give up after a catastrophic gig at Hollywood Forever Cemetery in 2021 where he could barely play a note. “I thought: ‘This is not good. The legacy will not bear this type of behaviour.’”He credits Teixeira for helping him to stop, though he has no regrets about using. “I think some people were supposed to take drugs and one of them was me.”One advantage of his (relative) sobriety is that it has made him productive. “When you’re on smack, you’re all: ‘Oh fuck that, and that, and that,” he says. But now he is about to release Love Chant, his first album of original Lemonheads music in almost 20 years, which containsflashes of the lyricism and melodic smarts that propelled them to the indie big league. “I’ve never really heard of this sort of dormancy period [between albums],” he says. “This is some Rip Van Winkle shit. I do have integrity about what I put out. I wasn’t ready to do anything new until I was ready, and [now] I am.”Dando is also publishing his first memoir, named Rumours of My Demise; the title is a nod to the stories that fitfully circulated in the 90s about his premature death. It’s a wry, heady, fitfully eye-watering account of his adventures as a musician and addict. “I wrote the first four chapters. That’s me,” he says. For the rest, he collaborated with ghostwriter Jim Ruland, whom you imagine had his work cut out given Dando’s haphazard conversational style. The writing process, he says, was “difficult, but I was psyched to get a good [publisher]. And it gets me out there as someone who has written a book, and that’s all I wanted to do since I was a kid. At school I was obsessed with James Joyce, Dylan Thomas and Flaubert.”View image in fullscreenPower couple … Dando with Kate Moss in 1998.Photograph: Kevin.Mazur/WireImageDando – the youngest child of an attorney and a former fashion model – talks fondly about school, perhaps because it represents a time before life got complicated by drugs and fame. He went to Boston’s prestigious Commonwealth school, a liberal institution that, he says now, “was the best. There were no rules except no rollerskating in the hallways. In other words, don’t be an asshole.”It was there, in bible class, that he met Ben Deily and Jesse Peretz and formed a band in 1986.The Lemonheadsbegan life as a punk outfit, in thrall to the Minutemen, Dead Kennedys and Ramones; they signed to the Boston label Taang!, with whom they put out three albums. After Deily and Peretz left, the Lemonheads effectively became a one-man show, Dando hiring and firing musicians at his discretion.In the early 1990s, the band signed to a major label, Atlantic, and dialled down the squall in favour of a more languid and accessible country-rock sound. This was “because [Nirvana’s] Nevermind came out in ’91 and they had nailed it”, Dando says. “If you listen to our early records – a song like Mad, which was recorded the day after we graduated high school – you can hear we were trying to do [what Nirvana did] but my voice didn’t cut right. But I knew my voice could cut through quieter music.” This new sound, waggishly described by critics as “bubblegrunge”, would take the band into the mainstream. In 1992 they released the LP It’s a Shame About Ray, an impeccable showcase for Dando’s songcraft and his melancholic croon. The title was taken from a newspaper headline in which a priest bemoaned a young man named Ray who had gone off the rails.Ray wasn’t the only one. By this point, Dando was using heroin and had developed a penchant for crack, too. With money in his pocket, he enthusiastically threw himself into the rock star life, becoming friends with Johnny Depp, shooting a video with Angelina Jolie and dating Kate Moss and Milla Jovovich. People magazine anointed him one of the 50 sexiest people alive. Dando good-naturedly rebuffs the idea that My Drug Buddy, in which he sang “I’m too much with myself, I wanna be someone else”, was a plea for help. He was having too much fun.View image in fullscreenGetting shirty … Evan Dando.Photograph: Kate Peters/The GuardianNonetheless, the drug use got out of control. In the book, he delivers a blow-by-blow account of the fateful Glastonbury incident in 1995 when he failed to turn up for the Lemonheads’ allotted slot after two women suggested he come back to their hotel. When he finally did appear, he performed an impromptu acoustic set to a hostile crowd who booed and threw bottles. But this was small beer next to what happened in Australia shortly afterwards. The trip was intended as a break from drugs and touring but, arriving in Sydney, Dando immediately binged on speed, ecstasy and Valium. A breakdown followed, which saw him feeding dollar bills into grates in the gutter convinced it would help him “teleport” back home. He went to the airport planning to get the first plane back to the US but skipped out on his cab fare, leading to his arrest.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

By the time he got to the airport, “I probably looked like a fucking crazy person. And I didn’t pay for my cab, so I ended up wrestling with five cops. But you know what? They were OK because their girlfriends were all fans.”View image in fullscreenExcess baggage … The It’s a Shame About Ray Lemonheads lineup.Photograph: Ebet Roberts/RedfernsRumours of My Demise may find Dando in the literal gutter but there’s no trace of self-pity. Despite the many lows, he says he always had fortune on his side. “I’ve never overdosed, not on anything. Who can say that?” he says, proudly. Most people, I reply, as gently as I can. He has a better example: the time Martin Scorsese picked the Lemonheads’ cover of Simon & Garfunkel’s Mrs Robinson for the soundtrack to 2013’s The Wolf of Wall Street. Dando never liked it, but Atlantic had pressured them into recording it in 1992 and it was a hit. When Scorsese alighted on it, Dando was broke. “Like, how did that happen? I think we got 80 grand. That saved the day. I’m just incredibly lucky sometimes, even when I fuck up.”When I ask about the physical toll after years of drug use, he replies: “The toll is on my teeth,” and flashes newly capped pearly whites plus a trio of gold crowns. “My lungs aren’t great – I have a bit of emphysema. But otherwise, I’m healthy. My heart isn’t enlarged, and I don’t know how I don’t have Aids or hepatitis C.” He illustrates how surprising this is through a particularly grisly story. “I once did this thing, getting all the blood out of all the syringes [used by] me and my girlfriend, and pooling them to see if I could get a hit out of it. Like, eww, that’s disgusting. But nothing happened.I have a very good constitution.”Dando maintains that, bar the Australia meltdown, everything that he has done he has done on purpose, though I’m not sure I believe him. He is, he says, “an entertainer. In my way, I feel like I was always in service to entertain people.” He pauses and grins. “And I’ve enjoyed it. I’ve enjoyed my life incredibly.”Rumours ofMy Demise is published byFaber on 23 October. Love Chant is released onFire Records on 24 October.Explore more on these topicsEvan DandoThe LemonheadsPop and rockinterviewsShareReuse this content"

She explains how the disrupted experience of Black daily life fills her workMon 6 Oct 2025 08.38 EDTShareThe ever-viral hip-hop video platform On the Radar has hosted freestyles from some of the biggest artists in the world. Drake, Central Cee and Ice Spice have each graced the channel with their presence, yet throughout its seven-year history, few acts have gone in quite like Klein. This time last year, the south London artistspiralled througha procession of evocative flexes, rasped through Auto-Tune over a mind-expanding loop of pitch-shifted wailing, then slung a black guitar over her shoulder to shred through a lacerating noise solo with a joyous smile.“People were trying to beat me up!” she says, giggling as she reflects on her appearance. “I was just being myself! Some people liked it, some people didn’t, some people hated it so much they would send me emails. For someone to feel that so viscerally as to send me an email? Low key? Iconic.”Klein’s wildly varied output exists on this polarising axis. For everyCaroline Polachek collaborationorfeatureon aMike record, you can expect afrazzled drone albumrecorded in a single session to be put up for Grammy consideration or the quiet, Bandcamp-only release of one of her “once in a blue moon”rapsongs. For everyunsettling rap videoshe directs or grinningappearance alongside Earl Sweatshirt, she puts out aReal Housewives of Atlanta reviewor a full-blownfeature film, starring kindred spirit composer Mica Levi and cultural theorist Fred Moten as her parents. She once convincedCharlotte Churchto duet with her and last year starred as a vampire missionary in a one-woman play in Los Angeles.On several occasions throughout our long video call, talking animatedly against a hypersaturated virtual beach scene, she encapsulates it best herself: “You couldn’t make it up!”This plurality is testament to Klein’s DIY ethos. Entirely self taught, with “two and a half” GCSEs to her name, she operates on instinct, taking her love of reality TV as seriously as inspiration as she does the work of contemporaries Diamond Stingily and the Turner prize winner Mark Leckey. “Sometimes I feel like a baby, and then sometimes I feel like a 419 [Nigerian financial] scam artist, because I’m still figuring things out,” she says.She opts for privacy when it comes to biography, though she credits growing up in the church and the mosque as influencing her approach to composition, as well as some aspects of her adolescent experiences editing video and working as logger and researcher in television. Yet, despite an impressively extensive body of work, she says her parents still aren’t really aware of her creative output. “They have no idea that Klein exists, they think I’m at uni doing anthropology,” she says, laughing. “My life is really on some Hannah Montana-type beat.”Her latest project, the singularSleep With a Cane, collects 16 avant-classical compositions, slanted ambient folk songs and haunted musique concrète. The sprawling record recasts rap mixtape excess as an eerie meditation on the surveillance state, police brutality and the everyday paranoia and stress of navigating London as a person of colour.View image in fullscreen‘My life is really on some Hannah Montana-type beat’ … Klein.Photograph: Lengua“The titles of my songs are always quite literal,” she says. “Family Employment 2008–2014 is funny, because that was just nonexistent for my family, so I wrote a score to help me understand what was going on around that period.” The prepared guitar composition For 6 Guitar, Damilola collapses classical naming convention into a tribute to Damilola Taylor, the 10-year-old Nigerian schoolboy killed in 2000. Trident, a 16-second flash of a track featuring snatches of vocals from the Manchester luminaries Space Afrika, embodies Klein’s feelings about the titular police unit set up to tackle gun crime in Black communities at the turn of the millennium. “It’s this echoing, interlude break that constantly interrupts the flow of a normal person trying to live a normal life,” she says.That song melts into the unsettling drone drift of Young, Black and Free, featuring contributions from Ecco2K, affiliate of the cult Swedish rap collective Drain Gang. “As we were finishing the track, I realised it was more of a question,” Klein says of its title. “There was a period where I lived in this area that was constantly surveilled,” she continues. “I saw police on horses every single day, to the point that I remember someone said I must have been sampling police noise [in her music]. No! Every sound was from my actual environment.”Sleep With a Cane’s most stunning, challenging composition, Informa, captures this relentless sense of persecution. Opening with a sample of a news broadcast about young people in London swapping “a life of violence” for “creativity and independence”, Klein exposes legacy media platitudes by illuminating the oppression suffered by Black youths. By stretching, looping and recreating the sample, she elongates and amplifies its myopic absurdity. “That in itself sums up how I was seen when I first started making stuff,” she says, “with people using weird dog whistles to allude to the fact that I’m Black, or allude to the fact that I grew up poor, without just saying what it is.”As though channelling this frustration, Informa eventually bursts into a brilliant pearlescent swell, perhaps the most straightforwardly beautiful moment of Klein’s discography so far. And yet, seething just beneath the surface, a sinister coda: “Your life doesn’t flash before your face.” The immediacy of this everyday tension is the animating force of Klein’s work, something few artists have captured so intricately. “I’m like an optimistic nihilist,” she says. “Everything’s going to shit, but there are still things that are magical.”Klein’s consistent efforts to dissolve boundaries between the dizzying variety of genre, media and influences that her work encompasses have led critics and fans to describe her as an experimental virtuoso, or an outsider artist. “What does being completely free look like?” Klein offers in response. “Music that is deemed classical or ambient is reserved for the experimental festivals or academia, but in my head I’m like, oh hell no! This is something for the streets!” While touring in support of her landmark albumHarmattan, released by the highbrow classical label Pentatone, it was the British rapper Jawnino she asked to open for her. “I want to hear harmonica in the strip club!” she continues. “These things shouldn’t be so separate. People do want to hear stuff that is challenging.”Klein’s outsider status, in all its complexity, has always informed her art, both as self-taught practitioner and unwilling object of state and music industry surveillance. “I feel like just existing as a Black woman makes me an outsider artist,” she says. “I’m going to a show and there’s a white man, watching behind me, to see if I’m really playing the guitar. That happens, that’sbeenhappening.“For me, as long as what I do reaches Black people, I’m good, man,” she enthuses. “If there’s one uncle, who works in my favourite Nigerian restaurant, who likes this one guitar song I did, my job is done!”Sleep With a Cane is out now on Parkwuud EntertainmentExplore more on these topicsExperimental musicHip-hopBlack British cultureinterviewsShareReuse this content"

With the scene switching to Briney wearing oversized pink headphones and talking into a microphone, he adds: “You deserve to be loved … And thoroughly ruined.”Fans’ reaction to Briney’s unveiling as the narrator of an audio series on the erotica platform Quinn was feverish. Comments veered from: “I deserve to be WHAT?” and: “My God Jesus help me,” to the more esoteric: “I’M GOING TO BITE DRYWALL,” which, according to industry insiders, is “horny dialect” for: oh, go on then.But as well as being a major coup for a content platform that only launched its app in 2021, Briney’s move confirms erotica’s shift into the mainstream and highlights a seemingly insatiable appetite for romance and “spicy” fiction.‘Time-efficient foreplay’: inside the funny, filthy world of erotic podcastsRead moreLast year there were record book sales for the “romance and sagas” genre, whileEngland’s first romance-only bookshopopened in Notting Hill, west London, in June. In the audio space, Quinn’s revenues have doubled since February and its subscriber base has grown by 168% in 12 months, says its 27-year-old CEO, Caroline Spiegel, who founded the company while she was still at Stanford in 2019. A “cultural shift” is happening, she argues – and it’s being driven by women.“Our content is made for them – with them in mind, with them as the top priority and target customer,” she says. “Adult entertainment hasn’t historically prioritised women’s preferences, mostly because it’s been made by men, for men.”But audio erotica doesn’t just tell the stories women want to hear, it plays with narrative format to place them at the centre of their own fantasies, says romance writer and content creatorHolly June Smith, who wrote the Briney-narrated Hidden Harbor. Instead of traditional dialogue, the narrator speaks directly to the listener in an “immersive storytelling” experience.“Maybe the story is you’ve had a rough day at work, you’ve come home to your husband and he’s going to take care of you and tell you how amazing you are and then fuck you,” she says. “The focus is on you. You can just shut your eyes and imagine it happening. Some of my favourite listener feedback is when people say they’ve answered the narrator out loud with their headphones on in the supermarket.”The genre is still in its infancy, but content creators on Quinn – who earn money based on plays and overall performance, and tips from fans – are already attracting loyal fanbases. A recent “hangout” hosted by creatorsJohn Yorkand AJ was attended by about 100 erotica lovers. “It is such a welcoming and warm community,” says York. “People offer feedback and really helpful criticism. It really is unlike anywhere, unlike any sort of online space I’ve ever seen.While content is aimed at women, who make up 83% of Quinn subscribers, about three-quarters of creators are men, among themRyan Mairs, whose route into the genre was unconventional.A little over two years ago, the 29-year-old from Kent was working in recruitment, building a following on TikTok making comedy sketches and talking about mental health. Then, some keen-eared followers noticed his voice, and started making very specific requests. “It was all very: ‘Say this, say that’ – there were quite some very forward comments indeed,” he says. “It was, and it still is, quite an experience.”Deciding to give it a go, Mairs answered one request, and posted a video which was him simply saying “good girl”. Pandemonium ensued, with the video racking up a million views and sending Mair’s notifications wild. “It was a bit like: ‘Oh shit,’ but it was kind of fun,” he laughs. “It showed me that, wow, there is scope for this as a career, there’s a need in the community.”While there is little question that audio erotica is “spicy”, it is very different to traditional pornography, argues Spiegel. “Porn has become shorthand for graphic tube site content and exploitative practices, unrealistic portrayals of people and sex, lack of inclusivity, fetishisation, and the normalisation of sexual violence,” she says. “Audio erotica is acting, it’s built on consent, and it leaves space for your imagination.”Consent is big in the genre, and not just because platforms like Quinn have mandated its inclusion in all stories. Actually, listeners find consent sexy, says Smith. “In Hidden Harbor, Chris’s character, River, says: ‘Can I kiss you?’,” she says. “And people were going wild because they were like: ‘Oh, my God, that’s the hottest thing ever.’”Explore more on these topicsPodcastsAudio dramaSexWomennewsShareReuse this content"

He even wrote a poem called The Two Voices in which dual versions of himself argued out the pros and cons of suicide. In this illuminating book, Richard Holmes has chosen to focus on the lesser known of the poet’s personae.The year 1850 was pivotal for Tennyson. He published the great poem sequence In Memoriam, over which he had laboured for nearly two decades. He became, as a result, both famous and rich. He got married, after a 14‑year courtship. He had been living in rented homes with his mother and siblings, or dossing down with bachelor friends in London, or lurking alone in a ramshackle cottage on one of his native Lincolnshire’s bleak beaches. Now he took a house where he could receive distinguished visitors. (When Prince Albert came calling, Tennyson was so far from obsequious that he forgot to invite the queen’s consort to sit down, though he did at least offer the poor man a drink.) He was appointed poet laureate. His life as a Great Man began.For Holmes, this settling down – emotional, financial, social and poetical – is the end of the exciting part of Tennyson’s life. The Boundless Deep is not about the bestselling author of the nation’s favourite poem – The Charge of the Light Brigade – or the laureate lord, pacing along the clifftops of the Isle of Wight or posing for Julia Margaret Cameron’s famous photograph (known derisorily in his family as “the dirty monk”). Instead, Holmes gives us “young Tennyson”, the wildly talented youth whose story is far more rich and strange than that of the bearded celebrity.From his teens he was imposing, even glamorous. He was very tall, unkempt but handsomeThe Tennysons, wrote Alfred, were a “black-blooded race”, meaning prone to moods and melancholy. His father, a reluctant clergyman, was angry and very often drunk. There was an incident, the details of which are obscure, that resulted in the family cook being burned to death in the rectory kitchen. One of Alfred’s brothers was confined to a lunatic asylum as a boy and stayed there for life. Another suffered from profound depression and followed his father into alcoholism. A third became addicted to opium. Alfred himself suffered from episodes of paralysing gloom and what he called “weird seizures”. His Maudis narrated by a madman: he must often have wondered whether he was or would become one himself.From his teens he was imposing, even glamorous. He was very tall, unkempt but handsome. Even before he began to wear a black Spanish cloak and sombrero, he could dominate a room. But, having grown up hugger-mugger with his siblings – three brothers to an attic room – as an adult he sought out solitude, retreating into silence when in company, vanishing for solitary walking tours.Holmes, master biographer that he is, vividly conjures up this awkward, compelling figure. What gives his book its exceptional energy, though, is not what is happening on the surface of Tennyson’s life and Holmes’s narrative. It is the powerful undertow of threatened belief and existential anxiety tugging the reader down into the “boundless deep” of the title, where 19th-century thinkers wrestled with terrible thoughts. In 2008, Holmes publishedThe Age of Wonder, a group biography charting the way that Romantic poets responded to the discoveries of their scientific contemporaries such as Humphry Davy, William Herschel and Joseph Banks. That book was full of exuberant hopes. This one, set a generation later, is its darker, sadder sequel.In Tennyson’s lifetime, geologists, astronomers and those “natural philosophers” who were beginning to think with Darwin about the origin of species, were raising appalling questions. If the history of life on Earth had begun millions of years before the appearance of the human race, then how to believe that the world had been made for humanity’s benefit and enjoyment? “It is inconceivable,” wrote Tennyson, “that the whole Universe was merely created for us, who live on a third-rate planet of a third-rate sun.” The new telescopes and microscopes revealed spaces infinitely large and beings infinitesimally small: how to hold to one’s faith, given such evidence, in a God who had made man in his own image? If dinosaurs had become extinct, then might the human race do so too?These conundrums were repressed. It was hard to confront them in public without being accused of blasphemy, or in private without seeming to give way to despair. It is easy, in retrospect, to make fun of those 19th-century creationists who strove to believe that God had hidden the fossils in the rocks for some good, if inscrutable, reason. Holmes doesn’t indulge in such patronising levity. He takes seriously the pain of those living through the crisis of faith, and writes about it with such sympathy that even his most secular-minded modern readers feel the shock of finding oneself alone and unloved in a God-forsaken universe.Holmes binds his narrative together with two recurrent motifs. The first he introduces on his second page – it is the image of the Kraken, the legendary sea monster. Tennyson was a 20-year-old undergraduate when he wrote his poem about it. In Holmes’s view, with its mix of “Norse mythology, 18th-century zoology, 19th-century science fiction and the Book of Revelations”, the 15-line sonnet introduces themes to which Tennyson would keep returning. Its sense of something immense, unspeakable and tragic, submerged beyond reach of human inquiry, prefigures the mood of In Memoriam. It marks Tennyson’s debut as a master of metre and as the creator of images in which awful mystery is compressed into a few dazzlingly suggestive words.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Where the imaginary sea monster epitomises all that is lugubrious about Tennyson, his relationship with a real-life person, Edward FitzGerald, of whom he would write “I had no truer friend”, summons up all that is affectionate and playful in the poet. With him, Holmes introduces us to a side of Tennyson seldom before encountered. A Tennyson who, after intoning some of his grandest lines with “grotesque grimness”, would suddenly roar with laughter at his own solemnity. A Tennyson who, after visiting “dear old Fitz” at home, wrote a thank-you letter in verse describing him in his rose garden with his tame doves sitting all over him, planting their “rosy feet … on shoulder, hand and knee”, and even on his head. It’s an image of pleasure nicely adapted to FitzGerald’s great celebration of hedonism – his version of The Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám. It also summons up the brilliant nonsense of the two poets’ mutual friend Edward Lear. It’s pleasing to be told that Tennyson, the mournful Great Man, was also the inspiration for Lear’s rhyme about the old man with a beard in which “two owls and a hen, four larks and a wren” built their nests.Holmes is not an uncritical fan – he is tart about the pseudo-medieval flim-flam of Idylls of the King – but when he loves a poem, he writes about it with a wonderful capacity for noticing every pulse of metre, every flicker of nuance. This biography is a compelling story of an odd, brilliant, charismatic character, and a reappraisal of a man who had become so very established we could no longer see him. In giving us young Tennyson – gauche, beautiful, veiled in stinking tobacco smoke – Holmes has given the great poet back to us.The Boundless Deep: Young Tennyson, Science and the Crisis of Belief by Richard Holmes is published by HarperCollins (£25).

In August, most other nominees dropped out in protest at Boyne’s gender-critical views – and this year’sprize has now been cancelled.Discussion of trans rights is absent from The Elements, although Boyne touches on plenty of big issues. Homophobia, the impact of traditional and social media, parental neglect and sexual violence are all explored. In Water, a grieving woman named Willow moves to a remote Irish island after her husband is jailed for horrific crimes. In Earth, Evan is a footballer on trial as an accessory to rape. In Fire, the adult Freya juggles revenge with her work as a surgeon. And in Air, a father flies to a funeral with his teenage son, and wonders how much to divulge about his family’s past.Trauma is piled on trauma as wounded survivors seem doomed to bump into each other again and again for eternityConnections abound. We first meet Evan as a boy trying to escape the island of Water. His trial’s jury contains the Freya who reappears in Fire. Aaron, the father from Air, works with Freya and has a child with Willow’s daughter. Supporting characters from one account reappear in cottages, pubs or courtrooms in another.These plot threads may sound tangled, but Boyne knows how to power a narrative – his 2006 Holocaust drama The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas has sold more than 11m copies, and he has been translated into 60 languages. His businesslike prose bristles with thriller-ish hooks: “after all, a doctor in the burns unit should know better than to play with fire”; “the first thing I do when I arrive on the island is change my name”.Characters are sketched in brief, effective lines: the compassionate Nigerian priest, the troubled pub landlord, the daughter at war with her mother. Some scenes ring with sad power or observational humour: a boy is punched by his father after wetting himself at a football match; a narrow-minded island mother and her Dublin-raised neighbour swap barbs over cups of weak tea.Boyne’s knack of carrying you wholeheartedly into each narrative gives the return of a character or plot strand from an earlier story a genuine frisson, for the first few times at least. Yet the cumulative effect of it all is numbing, and at times almost comic: trauma is piled on trauma, coincidence on coincidence in a grim farce in which wounded survivors seem doomed to bump into each other again and again for eternity.If this sounds less like life and more like limbo, that is part of Boyne’s point. These damaged people are weighed down by the crimes they have suffered, caught in patterns of thought and behaviour that churn and spiral and may in turn damage others. Boyne has spoken about the impact of hisown experiences of abuseand he describes with sympathy the way his cast negotiate this perilous landscape, reaching out for remedies – isolation, icy sea dips, reconciliation or bracing honesty – that might let light in.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But while The Elements is a flawed work, it’s also a thoroughly readable, victim-focused epic: a welcome riposte to the usual fixation on investigators and perpetrators. Boyne shows how trauma can run through lives and generations, and how time and tenderness can quieten its echoes.The Elements by John Boyne is published by Doubleday (£20).

So you’d assume the release of this year’s winner would be widely and loudly trumpeted. Not so. Consume Me’sapparently underwhelming early salesand surprisinglack of reviewsspeak more to ongoing issues of discoverability (and busy critics struggling with an autumn glut) than the game itself, which is an absolute delight.Admittedly, it’s easy to make it sound like something youshouldplay rather than something you’d reallywantto. Developed over a decade by Jenny Jiao Hsia (with collaborators AP Thomson, Jie En Lee, Violet W-P, and Ken Snyder), it’s a quasi-autobiographical story about an Asian American high-schooler attempting to lose weight while navigating the stresses and pitfalls of teenage life. It involves efficient management of energy and time. A content notice warns about themes of bullying, fatphobia and disordered eating. It’s also – somehow – one of 2025’s funniest games.View image in fullscreenA pizza date leads to watching her eating for the rest of the week … Consume Me.Photograph: HexecutableConsume Me deftly negotiates this tonal minefield, playfully but incisively satirising the gamification of diet culture. Protagonist Jenny’s mealtimes are abstracted into puzzle form. In a process that reminded me of arranging Leon’s attaché case in Resident Evil 4, you slot foodstuffs shaped like Tetris blocks into a grid representing Jenny’s stomach. L-shaped kale and S-shaped tomatoes will keep you under your daily target (crucially, she’s not counting calories but “bites”) while eggs handily plug those awkward single spaces. Junk foods come in appealingly convenient shapes – but filling up with a cookie means spending your precious free time trying to burn it off, or using up one of your limited cheat days. Leave any gaps and her stomach will rumble, meaning she’s likely to need a snack later.You’ll also need to keep Jenny’s energy and mood above zero or it’s game over. That’s straightforward at first: the tasks that make up your schedule, from chores to studying to applying makeup, comprise simple but fun minigames with the antic energy of Nintendo’s WarioWare series but little of the challenge. Items earned or bought with pocket money make it easier still to keep Jenny happy and healthy. But time is the enemy, and balancing needs and wants becomes steadily trickier. Rely on energy drinks too often, for instance, and a caffeine headache awaits, meaning any activity but bed rest will make you grumpy.View image in fullscreenA sinkside squabble with an overbearing mother … Consume Me.Photograph: HexecutableWhether things are going well or not, it’s beautifully observed. Ominous music accompanies the weekly weigh-in, as you physically drag Jenny’s feet on to the scales. Cleaning the bathroom is followed by a forensic inspection from your overbearing mother, who leans in close to scrutinise your handiwork, pressing her index finger against the sink to ensure it comes away spotless. When Jenny first meets boyfriend Oliver’s well-to-do parents, the simple introduction of an anxiety meter is enough to have your own heart beating a little faster, even before her imagination casts his prying mother as a trenchcoated detective, a spotlight adding to the interrogative vibe. And in the couple’s first attempt at making out, their clumsy limbs crisscross the screen, forcing you to manoeuvre round them to lock lips.Love soon becomes another obligation, and thus a source of tension, shrewdly re-contextualised in each chapter. Jenny can’t miss too many of the potential dates she pencils in her diary, but a trip to a pizza restaurant forces her to be strict with her eating for the rest of the week. When Oliver goes to college, Jenny must invest valuable evening time texting or video-calling him, convinced their long-distance relationship will take “poison damage” every day if she doesn’t. (By night, she presses her face against a glass case, tearfully watching petals fall from the rose inside it, brilliantly evoking the wayeverythingbecomes a melodrama at that age.)This might be a game about routines, but despite some purposeful repetition, Consume Me never fully settles into one of its own; it keeps finding inventive uses (and reuses) of systems to punch home its themes without losing its sense of humour. If you have an uneasy relationship with food and personal fitness, there are moments that will hit close to home – and even if you eat and exercise well, you can surely relate to being too busy with life’s essentials to find room for the things you’d rather be doing.Again, though, I’m wary of making it sound too much like eating your vegetables. This spiky, funny, and bracingly original game consumed a few laughter- and tear-filled evenings, and left memories that will stay with me a good deal longer.Consume Me is available now, £12.79Explore more on these topicsGamesPCreviewsShareReuse this content"

I’ve got you.”Katriona O’Sullivan’s dedication of her bestselling memoir to her younger self is the emotional core ofSonya Kelly’s new stage adaptation. The remarkable story of the author and psychology professor who grew up in poverty in Coventry and Birmingham, her childhood blighted by drug addiction and sexual abuse, is split between the child (Holly Lawlor) and adult (Aisling O’Mara) Katriona, as joint narrators.With Katriona’s parents (Aidan Kelly and Hilda Fay) breaking into song on a car journey, the early scenes in Róisín McBrinn’s production shift uneasily in tone, as if the older Katrina, looking back, is determined to be upbeat and to keep the utter misery of her parents’ circumstances at a distance. The structure – an episodic, linear narrative – creates some distance too, with frequent references to the autobiography’s page numbers adding to the sense that the book is the blueprint for the play, rather than a starting point for Kelly’s dramatisation.View image in fullscreen‘I’ve got you’ … Hollie Lawlor and O’Mara om stage together.Photograph: Ste MurrayMoving on to the years of Katriona’s struggles as a teenage mother – initially homeless, then living on welfare – the staging sparks into life with the ensemble (Ghaliah Conroy, Mary Murray, Keiren Hamilton-Amos and Thommas Kane Byrne) conjuring multiple characters, aided by Aedín Cosgrove’s endlessly malleable set design. When the family move to Dublin, Katriona yearns for a new start, but takes refuge in alcohol. The scenes of her therapy and recovery are affectingly raw.Raised by addicts, abused, neglected, broke: how Katriona O’Sullivan escaped her fateRead moreO’Mara captures Katriona’s ferocious will to survive; her determination to sober up and return to formal education. Lawlor pops up winningly in the guise of the Trinity College access programme director who practically drags Katriona to her exams – one of three key adults in Katriona’s life who believe in her and give her hope. This doubling of the actors playing the younger and older Katriona binds the story: swapping places, the spirited seven-year-old girl is now taking care of the astonishingly courageous young woman, scarred but not broken.AtGate theatre, Dublin, until 2 November, as part ofDublin theatre festival.

The second novel in the series, Rivals, was adapted for Disney+ and released last year.While her novels were often described as “bonkbusters”, to her they were “a bit of everything”, shetold the Guardianin 2016. “But if they want to call it bonkbuster they can – except it ought to be called ‘shagbuster’ now, bonk is out of date.”Cooper was born in Hornchurch, Essex, in 1937, and attended Godolphin School in Salisbury, Wiltshire. She began her writing career in journalism as a cub reporter on the Middlesex Independent in 1956, before moving into PR.In 1961, she married publisher Leo Cooper, who had proposed on their second date. “After an ectopic pregnancy, it became clear I was going to be unable to have babies myself,” Coopertold the Guardianin 2017. “I was in a state of shock. I felt I’d let Leo down. But we were encouraged to adopt. I was 31 when we adopted Felix, and Emily came into our lives three years later.”In the late 60s, she began writing columns for The Sunday Times, before moving to the Mail on Sunday in 1982. Her first book, the nonfiction title How to Stay Married, was published in 1969.Cooper’s debut novel, Emily, was published in 1975, the first of a series of romances based on magazine stories she had published. Bella, Imogen, Prudence, Harriet and Octavia would follow, plus a collection of short stories, Lisa & Co, in 1981.The first of 11 instalments of the Rutshire Chronicles, Riders, was published in 1985, followed by Rivals in 1988. Riders and a later book in the series, The Man Who Made Husbands Jealous, were adapted for television in the 90s.Former prime minister Rishi Sunak,famously a fanof the author’s works, wrote in astatement on X: “Sad to hear of the passing of Dame Jilly Cooper, a storyteller whose wit and love of character brought joy to millions. My thoughts are with her family and fellow readers.”Along with her adult novels, Cooper wrote several books for children about a mongrel, Mabel, and many nonfiction titles including Class, her 1979 book about the English class system.She was given a damehood in the 2024 new year honours list for her services to literature and charity. “I cannot believe I am a DBE, which in my case also stands for ‘delighted, bewildered and ecstatic’,” shesaid at the time.“With a winning combination of glorious storytelling, wicked social commentary and deft, lacerating characterisation, she dissected the behaviour, bad mostly, of the English upper-middle classes with the sharpest of scalpels,” said her publisher Bill Scott-Kerr.“It is no exaggeration to say that Riders, her first Rutshire chronicle, changed the course of popular fiction for ever,” he added. “Ribald, rollicking and the very definition of good fun, it, and the 10 Rutshire novels which followed, were to inspire a generation of women, writers and otherwise, to tell it how it was, whilst giving us a cast of characters who would define a generation and beyond.”While Cooper’s funeral will be a private service, a public event will be held at Southwark Cathedral in the coming months, with details due be announced.Explore more on these topicsJilly CoopernewsShareReuse this content"

The court filing does not set out the specifics of the claim, but it comes after Paddington’s appearance in the latest Spitting Image YouTube show, The Rest Is Bulls*!t.The show contains sketches about Elon Musk, Donald Trump and Keir Starmer. It also satirises ubiquitous podcasts in which hosts talk about achieving success.It is hosted by a typical Spitting Image-style puppet of Prince Harry and a dishevelled-looking Paddington. In the first episode, Paddington begins by proclaiming he does not really talk like Ben Whishaw, the Bafta-winning actor who voices the character in his recent movie outings.View image in fullscreenA dishevelled-looking Paddington appearing alongside ‘Prince Harry’ on the episode.Photograph: Avalon PromotionsHe then switches to a generic South American accent before shouting: “I am from Peru, motherfuckers – I am Paddington Bear from Peru! You most likely remember me from the films Paddington, Paddington 2 and Paddington in Peru. I also had a starring role in the Netflix series Narcos, as Pablo Escobear. It is a joke. Laugh, muchachos.”At the end of the episode, a chaotic Paddington is seen snorting a white powder before apparently passing out.The court action comes three months after Avalon launched The Rest Is Bulls*!t, a poke at the successful stable of podcasts produced byGary Lineker’s company, Goalhanger.The show’s launch on YouTube in July marked a new chapter for Spitting Image, which has a rich history of upsetting its targets – usually politicians, rather than treasured children’s characters.The original series was one of the most-watched programmes in the 1980s and was cancelled only in 1996 after viewing figures waned. It was rebooted in 2020 for the streaming service BritBox,lasting two series before it was cancelled again.Its new incarnation on YouTube has been adapted for the platform. Shows are between 10 and 15 minutes, designed to appeal to viewers who scroll through recommended content.In the first show, viewed more than half a million times, Paddington and Harry interview Musk, and Paddington urges the rightwing billionaire to go to Mars. “You are too much genius for one planet,” he says. “As I say about my cocaine, it is only right to share.”He later says the secret to his personal glow is “100% Peruvian, biodynamic, organic, catastrophic cocaine”.The pair also announce an advert for guns. Paddington says: “Go to Bogotá and ask for Matthias. Tell him Paddington sent you.”The bear begins another segment by observing: “And that’s why I said ‘no’ to Harry Potter. Paddington Bear gets out his wand for no one.”StudioCanal and Avalon declined to comment. A spokesperson for Michael Bond’s estate said they could not comment as the issue was the subject of legal proceedings.Explore more on these topicsPaddingtonMichael BondFilm industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Britt Ekland was cast as an innkeeper’s sexually liberated daughter, who attempts to seduce the God-fearing officer, with Lee as Lord Summerisle, a pagan aristocrat.View image in fullscreenHardy made many edits to Shaffer’s proposed script of Lord Summerisle’s lines in the film’s final scenes.Photograph: SuppliedBut the creative atmosphere was frayed and fractious, the documents show. In a letter to Shaffer, Hardy wrote: “How dare you treat me like this?”Shaffer had already made his name with masterpieces such as Sleuth, but his typed draft of The Wicker Man reveals Hardy’s brutal cuts to his work.Extensive crossings-out include Summerisle’s lines in the final scene, which would have begun: “The child was but the tip of the iceberg – the part that showed. Do not reproach yourself, there was no way you could have known.”Tensions boiled over beyond the writer and director. One of the producers wrote: “Shaffer’s talent has been offset by a self-indulgence that impels him to prove himself too clever by half.”In a letter to the producers, Hardy complained about the film’s editor, Eric Boyd-Perkins: “I don’t think he likes the subject or style of the picture … and feels that he has had enough of it.”In one letter, Lee described the film as “alluring and mysterious”, despite “having to cope with a garrulous producer, an underpaid and harassed writer and an overpaid and hostile director”.An extensive correspondence relating to the film was among six sack-loads of documents forgotten in the attic of the former home of Hardy’s third wife, Caroline. There were also previously unseen scripts, storyboards, on-set photographs and financial accounts, many of which reflect the struggles faced by the film-makers.Hardy’s sons Justin and Dominic, now 60 and 63 respectively, have drawn on the material for a forthcoming book, titled Children of The Wicker Man. It reveals the extreme pressures faced by Hardy during the making of the film – from his heart attack to bankruptcy.Initially, the film was a box office flop and, in the aftermath of its failure, Hardy abandoned his wife and their children, Justin and Bella, for a new life in the US. Legal letters reveal Caroline as the film’s uncredited executive producer and that Hardy owed her up to £1m in today’s money. She was forced to sell the family home and died in 1984, aged 51, suffering from alcoholism, never knowing that her film eventually became a global hit.View image in fullscreenChristopher Lee, who played Summerisle, once said that he had had to cope with a ‘garrulous producer, an underpaid and harassed writer and an overpaid and hostile director’ on the set of the film.Photograph: Album/AlamyJustin, a Bafta-nominated historian film-maker, described The Wicker Man as “the film that messed up my family”.When he was contacted by a woman who had moved into his mother’s old house, asking whether he wanted to collect the sacks of papers, his initial reaction was to suggest burning “the bloody things”.But then he and his stepbrother Dominic opened up the sacks and realised the significance of their contents.Dominic, an art historian, said: “All the big players are in there. We discovered an original script by Shaffer, but with dad’s annotations as director, ‘containing’ Shaffer’s overexuberance. Because he was formerly a barrister, Shaffer did a lot of overexplaining and dad just went ‘cut, cut, cut’. They sort of loved each other and hated each other.”Writing the book has brought some “closure”, Justin said.His family never benefited financially from the film, he added: “The bloody film has gone on to make so much money for other people. It’s beyond a joke. Dad agreed to take five grand. So he never received any of the upside. Christopher Lee never received any money from it either, despite the fact that he did the film for zero, to get out of Hammer [Horror films]. So, in many ways, it’s been a very unkind film.”Children of The Wicker Man by Justin Hardy & Dominic Hardy (The History Press, £20). To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

While he had seen a fewìbejìcarvings in his uncle’s collection of African traditional art, the gift resonated with Adegbola.“I have always been conscious ofìbejìbut I will say my passionate research was definitely a 2022 moment.View image in fullscreenArt dealer Kayode Adegbola has developed a passion for collectingère ìbejì“I’ve been collecting them since then,” says Adegbola, who trained as a lawyer in London. “I buy back from foreign auctions and also whenever I find anybody in Nigeria who has them and wants to give them away or get rid of them, I take from them.”Theère ìbejìare a material embodiment of a unique spiritual, cultural and artistic tradition among Yorùbá people, who haveone of the world’s highest birth rates of twinsand are more than four times more likely to have them than Europeans.The average birthrate of the Yorùbá town of Igbo-Ora in Nigeria’s Oyo state, is45 twins per 1,000 births, compared with a global average of about12 per 1,000.“In Yorùbá culture, twins occupy a position of profound spiritual and social importance,” says Kehinde Adewumi, a researcher at Durban University of Technology who is also a twin.has studiedère ìbejì.“The Yorùbá are reputed to have one of the highest twinning rates in the world, and this phenomenon is interpreted not merely as a biological occurrence but as a sign of divine blessing.“Twins are regarded as bearers of good fortune, prosperity and protection for their families and communities,” he says.View image in fullscreenThe Ìbejì Project involves juxtaposing the traditional carvings with curated contemporary art that focuses on twinship.Photograph: Courtesy of Kayode Adegbola“When a twin passes away, carved wooden figures [ère ìbejì] are created to house the spirit of the departed child, ensuring continued veneration and safeguarding the wellbeing of the living twin and the wider family.”The figures, which are also carved for living twins, were taken care of like real babies: bathed, oiled, breastfed, clothed (in the same dresses as the twins, if alive), adorned with beads, sung and prayed to, and carried on women’s backs.I am drawn to artists who engage with what twinship represents: duality, absence, companionship, continuityKayode AdegbolaThey were carved with stylised features – with bulgy eyes, their cheeks often scarified, and given adult features such as genitalia and breasts. Most importantly, their heads are big and hugely coiffed to symbolise each twin’s spirit, creation and destiny, ororí.This tradition, however, has been almost entirely lost. Theìbejìfigures are scattered in foreign museums all over the world, with the most recent dating from the mid-1950s.So, in February 2023, Adegbola launchedthe Ìbejì Projectto revitalise the lived history of the tradition.“The Ìbejì Project is an educational and advocacy platform that introduces traditional art to new audiences,” he says. “Twinship is universal, but the Yorùbá response – carvingère ìbejìas vessels for spirits – is unique and must be kept alive as a living conversation rather than frozen in museums abroad.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the path to growth is paved with difficult emotions, and we have to experience them honestlyMoya SarnerMon 6 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 6 Oct 2025 06.02 EDTShareIhope you had a good summer: I did not. On the day we were supposed to be going on holiday, I was sitting in A&E with my husband, waiting for him to have urgent but routine surgery, which meant our travel plans had to be cancelled.From this experience I learned something valuable, all over again, about how hard it is for me to feel bad when things go wrong. I’m not talking about life-altering traumas, but the more everyday, quietly devastating disappointments that – unless we can actually feel them – will really weigh us down.When we were supposed to be on holiday but weren’t, I kept feeling a tug towards finding the positive: “I can book a replacement trip”; “At least we have travel insurance”; “This’ll give me something to write about”. But I never felt better, just a bit depressed. And then I would bump up against the reality that this holiday really was gone: my husband’s surgery required frequent agonising dressing changes, and there is a limited time window for an enjoyable break on the Belgian coast. So, no holiday. Just disappointment and frustration, pain and care.I know worse things can happen, it’s only a holiday, what a privileged problem to have – I know because I tried that line too. But what I needed was to be honest with myself. In those moments when I was able to stop fighting off the disappointment and we talked about it instead, it felt like we were going through something together. Instead of feeling depressed and trying to smile, I’ve allowed myself all sorts of unwanted feelings, including but not limited to bitterness and resentment and hatred and rage, which at least felt real. At times, it even became possible to enjoy our time at home together.This reminded me of a wish I sometimes see in my psychotherapy patients, and that I have also seen in myself as a patient in psychoanalysis: that therapy could somehow reverse our unwanted experiences, like clicking “undo”. But that arrow only points backwards. Facing the reality that this is not possible and allowing the grief and rage for things not turning out how we expected, rather than a dishonest kind of “reframing”, can facilitate a change of current: from denial and depression, to growth and possibility. Over time – and, of course, it does take time – this can be life-changing.We think of depression as feeling bad – but to my mind it’s a kind of numbing of all emotions, a pressing down of anger and sadness and disappointment and joy and life force, and all the rest. The alternative to depression is not happiness, but feeling whatever is there, a kind of truthful emotional spontaneity and freedom.I have frequently found myself stuck in this wish to click “undo”, but my toddler is helping me to grow out of it. As a new mother, I was at times overwhelmed by the astonishing demands of my infant. Not only the feeding – sometimes for over an hour at a time, and then again less than an hour after that – and not only the changing, and then the changing again before you’ve even finished the change you were changing. These day-to-day precious tasks among so many others – practicality wrapped up in care – are a comfort and a tremendous privilege. Though they’re also, at moments, relentless and draining. What shocked me the most – aside from the sleep deprivation – were the emotional demands.I had thought my most important job as a mother was to meet my baby’s needs. But I soon came to realise that it was not possible to meet all of my baby’s needs at the time she demanded it. Her hunger could seem unmeetable; my milk could not come fast enough, or it came too fast. And then we needed to change her – but she hated being changed, and cried as if she were falling into a dark vortex of doom. And while sometimes she seemed consoled by the cuddles we gave her, at other times it felt as if she were lost to us, that nothing we had to offer could help.I soon discovered that my most important job as a mother was first to survive, and then to help her digest the overwhelming feelings provoked by the impossibility of my protecting her from all discomfort. As she developed her capacity to take in and digest milk, she also had to develop a capacity to digest her emotions and her suffering when the milk didn’t come, or when she was in pain, or any other difficult and confusing experience – and I had to grow through her (and my) frustration, rage, despair, hatred, disappointment, hunger. My job was not to make things go well, but to help bring meaning to her emotional experience of things not going so well.This was the difference, for her, between being with someone who was trying to give her only good feelings, and instead being helped to grow a capacity to experience all feelings. It was the difference, for me, between wanting to feel great about doing a perfect job as a perfect mother, and instead developing the capacity to tolerate my own far-from-ideal-ness in order to do a good enough job – and understand my daughter’s disappointment and anger with me. The difference between my trying to stop her crying, and understanding when she needed to cry.Now that we have grown through this together, I feel less keenly the wish to hit “undo” and rewrite our story into one where everything goes well. I find hope in my sense of a capacity growing inside me to recognise that this is not possible, and to understand that, when I’m busy trying to rebook a holiday, what I really need is to cry.Moya Sarner is an NHS psychotherapist and the author ofWhen I Grow Up – Conversations With Adults in Search of AdulthoodDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He explains why now was the right time to write itMon 6 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 6 Oct 2025 07.43 EDTShareThere’s a telling moment in Lukas Gage’s new book where he refers to it as a “premature celebrity memoir”. It’s a self-deprecating joke, of course, but it is also true. Gage is not megawatt famous – at least not yet. Chances are, though, if you have seen him then you won’t have forgotten him. In 2020, he went viral after leaking an audition video in which the director – forgetting that he wasn’t on mute –is caught judging his living arrangements(“These poor people live in these tiny apartments,” he says, before Gage intervenes to let him know he can hear every word). The following year, Gage appeared in the first season ofThe White Lotus: in one scene, his character Dillon is caught by a hotel guest standing stark naked in the manager’s office, while said manager performs anilingus on him.“I thought: I don’t have too much to do in the show so I’d better put my mark on itbig,” he says with a smile today. “I wanted to give people something to remember me by – and I did!”Gage specialises in characters whose lives are messy and chaotic – just like his own. That life is all laid on the line in his memoir, which – here comes another self-deprecating joke – is titled I Wrote this Book for Attention. Although comically entertaining, its subject matter is anything but. We start with Gage’s feelings of rejection and abandonment by his father, then move on to drug use, sexual abuse, family dysfunction, addiction, personality disorders, shame, unstable relationships and heartbreak. What we don’t get all that much of is the glitz and glamour of stardom. Gage readily admits he is at the start of his career. He has no great reserves of wisdom to share on success. So what was the purpose of writing a memoir?“I think it’s cathartic for me to share my story,” he says over a video link from New York. “During the [Hollywood writers’] strike I had the free time to really dig in and go deep, so I just said: screw it.”Gage, 30, grew up in San Diego, and from an early age he was aware of his constant need for validation. He recalls a party where he appeared, aged four, wearing high heels and Playboy bunny ears; in particular, he recalls being wounded by his dad’s evident disgust at what he was doing. Their relationship never really recovered – Gage’s dad moved out and became increasingly distant with his sons (Gage has two older brothers) before settling down with a new family.Gage struggled to fit in at school. He was a natural performer, but this meant it was often hard to know who the real Lukas was. “I was constantly trying on different hats and personalities, which I think was quite polarising for people,” he says. It also had its advantages. Gage could effortlessly adopt the persona of a clean-living football player while secretly filling his bag up with booze at the back of the local store. He was sometimes paid by fellow pupils to call up and imitate their parents to get them out of class. “Becoming different people was effortless to me,” he says.The memoir deals with addiction – predominantly his older brother’s struggles with heroin that turn the cool sibling he idolised into a frail zombie, but also his mother’s obsession with casino slot machines. An early jackpot meant the family could afford to make the down payment on a bigger house, but Gage laughs when I ask if she actually made money from gambling. “Ultimately, how much she spent was definitely a lot more than that.”View image in fullscreenLukas Gage as Dillon and Murray Bartlett as Armond in The White Lotus.Photograph: HBOIt is funny, he says. Until she had read the book, his mum hadn’t really reconciled with this side of her personality. “She talked to my other brothers, like, ‘Do you guys feel this way too?’ And they were all like, ‘Of course, we’ve been saying this since we were kids.’”Gage has a lot of love for his mum, who clearly brought her children up in difficult circumstances. But she had a hard time reading it. “She felt as if she failed as a mother and I did not want her to feel that way whatsoever. I feel like even though there’s these chaotic things that happened to me, hard things, I actually loved the way that I grew up.”Gage didn’t begin to locate his true self until he was sent to an acting summer camp as a child, where being loud, flamboyant and attention-seeking was actually encouraged. The experience was life-changing in good ways, but also in a terrible one. One night, he was joined in his tent by a camp counsellor who instructed Gage and a girl camper to kiss, remove their clothes and rub their bodies against each other while he masturbated. For years afterwards, he tried to ignore the guilt and shame it left him with.“As with a lot of people who experience being molested, I felt like there was a willingness on my part because my body just checked out. I knew it was wrong. I knew that the situation should not be happening. But I just ploughed through it.”Gage is hard on himself in the book – and still is. He admits to searching out “dark critiques” of himself on the internet. “I dislike that I don’t always hold my acting and writing in the highest esteem,” he says. “I wish I could have more empathy with that part of myself.”Yet he accepts that this self-criticism drives him forward too. In high school, he appeared in a wart-removal commercial and spent the day on set asking every question possible about mic positioning and the role of grips. Despite his mum’s reservations, he left San Diego for Hollywood at the age of 18, staying in the Alta Cienega Motel where his hero Jim Morrison lived, on and off, between 1968 and 1970 (Tripadvisor reviews – “Stay FAR FAR AWAY from this DUMP!” – suggest it might not have been the most luxurious of lodgings).Gage’s big break should have come when he landed a small role in Mad Men, as Sally Draper’s crush. He told his whole family about it, but during a costume fitting he was forced to reveal the tattoos he’d had inked on his ribs, back and calf. “I had these agents saying to me: how could you ruin this? How could you mess this up? I don’t think that was the greatest thing for a teenager to hear when they’ve just lost something that big.”These days, such markings would be covered up in minutes, but back then he was shown the door and back to square one. The relentless rounds of auditions and rejections were brutal, but at least he had been trained well for them. “If I ever got rejected for a job, I would always think: it’s fine, it’s not as bad as my dad rejecting me for another family and kid,” he says.View image in fullscreenGage with Euphoria co-stars Sydney Sweeney and Hunter Schafer.Photograph: Randy Shropshire/Getty Images for Entertainment WeeklyGage persevered. The story of how he lied, begged and cheated to get an audition forAssassination Nation, which ultimately led to a role in the hit showEuphoria(as Tyler Clarkson, black-eyed and in a neck brace) and then The White Lotus, could take up a book in itself. Gage recalls the strangeness of shooting The White Lotus in 2020, holed up in a luxury Hawaii hotel while the pandemic and the US election raged on. It was actually Gage, along with co-star Murray Bartlett, who pitched the idea that their sex act should be something a bitextra– and show runner Mike White happily agreed. Gage laughs remembering his mum’s reaction. “She wrote me a message, like, ‘Such a cute bum, but maybe next time give me a heads-up that’s going to happen when I’m watching with my friends.’”It was while on set that Gage showed fellow cast members the audition video in which his apartment was slated. Their response – shocked, amused, supportive – convinced him to post it online. He wasn’t prepared for the reaction it got: countless news headlines, outpourings of support from fellow actors and strangers alike, and a crusade against the director in question, none of which Gage had any control over. “I felt like people were much more mad about it than I was, which confused me,” he says. “I didn’t want to take this person down for it. I found it more funny than anything. I don’t think it was anything worth cancelling someone for.”Does he regret posting it?“I think part of me does,” he says. “There was that feeling of, did I just blow up my life? You know, this is my first big thing that I’m known for and it’s not about my acting.”You get a good sense of the precariousness of the business – and the fleeting nature of fame – from Gage’s memoir. The highs of Euphoria andThe White Lotusare swiftly followed by moments of uncertainty and despair. “It’s such a high to be creating stuff for months in an amazing location like Hawaii … then suddenly you’re back in your apartment and figuring out what’s next,” he says. “It’s hard to trust in that moment that you’re going to be OK because we’re taught to believe in the scarcity complex – that there’s not enough jobs out there.”If Gage’s career felt bumpy, then his love life was even bumpier. In his teens, he developed an intense on/off relationship with a fellow wayward teen he calls Kaylee in the book – she was in and out of juvenile detention and often wore a monitoring bracelet on her ankle. Aged 19, however, Gage slept with a man for the first time and realised he was, in fact, queer.View image in fullscreenGage as Tyler Clarkson in Euphoria.Photograph: HBO“There was a part of me that always felt like something was different,” he says, “but I couldn’t articulate what it was. I wish I’d had that clarity earlier on because I think it would have made things a lot less confusing as a kid. I look back, like, wait, dancing as a Playboy bunny as a little kid? Writing a diary while I played Britney Spears? How the hell did nobody have this conversation with me as a kid?!”By the end of the memoir, Gage is seeing a therapist. She starts putting together pieces of his life – the trying out of different personalities, the needy relationships, his fear of abandonment – and arrives at a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder (BPD). Although Gage doesn’t particularly like labels, he accepts that it has been incredibly useful in understanding himself and some of the choices he has made in his life. “Suddenly, all of these things that I felt very confused by made sense,” he says.It was during therapy that Gage ended up speaking about his traumatic summer camp experience. At first, he made light of it, so his therapist forced him to face it. “She said: ‘You’re in your 20s now, would you do that with an 11-year-old?’ It wasn’t until she’d put it that bluntly that I actually had to sit with it.”So is this how the story ends? A facing of his demons, a diagnosis to explain his past and a bright future ahead of him, all tied up neatly with a pretty bow? That wouldn’t be a very Lukas Gage way of doing things. In early 2023, Gage met celebrity hair stylist Chris Appleton. The pair were so infatuated with each other that they were married by April that year. Kim Kardashian (one of Appleton’s clients) officiated the wedding and Shania Twain performed You’re Still the One to the newlyweds. By November, Gage had filed for divorce.“One of the tricky things [with BPD] is that, at first, they throw a bunch of medication at you,” says Gage. Rather than soothe his impulsivity, it exacerbated it. “It made me manic,” he says. These days, his meds have been fine-tuned and, he says, he does now carry an awareness that “you should a) probably get to know someone for four seasons before you settle down with them, and b) also have the clarity to listen to my loved ones when they’re saying, ‘Hey: you need to take a beat.’ I do think I can do that now, and I have done since.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m still a work in progress’Photograph: Maria Spann/The GuardianThe thing is, Gage doesn’t particularly want his book to have a neat ending. “My life is uneven and I wanted it to be honest rather than clean,” he says. “I’m still a work in progress. I’m still gonna make mistakes and mess up and not be the best partner or friend or family member. But I can acknowledge it now and invite this criticism rather than be resistant to it.”Despite knowing there will be rocky patches, he’s excited for the future. Writing interests him – not another book for a while, that took it out of him, but he’s just sold a screenplay that he’s excited to announce soon.I wonder if he has any worries, though, about releasing this memoir while he is still working his way up the fame ladder? Could all of these messy tales put potential employers off hiring him?“There was a part of me that did want to tame it down a little,” he admits. “But I wanted it to be truthful and show people who don’t have it all together, who don’t have this cookie-cutter upbringing, that they can do this too, and that some of the messiness is actually the thing that makes you different.”Besides, he says: “I don’t think I am a liability. I’m good at my job, I’m responsible, I never miss anything, I’m never late for work, I’m never a mean person.”Well, look at that, I say. We began the interview with you saying you didn’t rate your acting and ended it with you conceding that, actually, you’re pretty good at your job.“Yeah, we had an arc,” Gage says with a knowing smile. “There you go. Full of contradictions, once again.”In the UK, theNSPCCoffers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.And it seems that for some of you, it means fringed party skirts and a cheese box through the post. Who are we to judge? Here are the things you loved the most this month.The mask for better sleepView image in fullscreenMyHalos eye mask£14.99 at MyHalos£9.99 at AmazonWhen lifelong insomniac and Filter reviewer Jane Hoskyn tested out some ofthe best (and weirdest) sleep hacks, she didn’t expect a basic sub-£10 eye mask to result in nine hours of shuteye. “The best masks genuinely block out all traces of light without pulling flat or tight across your eyes,” she wrote – and the MyHalos was her “perfect match”.The bargain beauty calendarView image in fullscreenW7 Advent calendar£19.95 at W7£19.95 at AmazonIf you’re surprised to see an Advent calendar top the list of your favourite products in September, the phenomenon ofbeauty Advent calendarsmust have passed you by. People spend hundreds on these selections of beauty products that promise big discounts on the value of the items inside. But your favourite – perhaps not surprisingly – is the “staggeringly cheap” W7 calendar. The products inside “rival some of the best in the business”, according to our reviewer Sarah Matthews (although predictably many of them are minis).The office chair upgradeView image in fullscreenSlouch Task One£289 at SlouchIf you’re still sitting in a dining chair when you work from home, please stop. Often second only to our mattress as our most used piece of furniture, it’s just as important that your work chair be supportive and comfortable.Our reviewer Stuart Andrews works long hours and nights at his desk (plus many hours of gaming), so he was the perfect person to test out thebest office chairs. This Slouch Task One was his overall favourite in testing, giving “everything you’d want from an office chair”.The eco-friendly scourerView image in fullscreenKilo non-scratch scourer£13.47 at eBay£3.75 at AmazonCotton scourers are a great way to cut down on plastic waste in the kitchen. “These things are absolutely brilliant for washing-up,” said Filter reader Maggie inour guide to sustainable swaps. “They don’t get clogged up with food the way a sponge scourer does, but I chuck mine in the wash with the towels every week to keep it fresh.”The stylish rain coverView image in fullscreenWaterproof hooded scarf£39.15 at EtsyIt’s hard to stay looking stylish when it’s raining one minute, sunny the next. But our fashion writer, Charlotte Gornall, has created theultimate guide to looking good in the rain– and your favourite tip has been this waterproof hooded scarf. “If your jacket doesn’t have a hood, why not accessorise with one?” Charlotte wrote. It channels “the late Queen Elizabeth in all the right ways.”The letterbox cheeseboardView image in fullscreenPerfect British cheeseboard£10 at ButlersOf all the gifts that can fit through a letterbox these days, is there anything better than a good-quality cheeseboard? Clearly not, as your favouritefrom our guidehas been this selection of three cheeses (Blacksticks Blue, Button Mill and Sunday Best) with Tracklements fig relish and Peter’s Yard crackers.The best budget hair dryerView image in fullscreenBaByliss Hydro-Fusion£60 at Lookfantastic£31.99 at Amazon“In my years of reviewing beauty tech, it was upgrading my hair dryer that made the biggest difference to my beauty routine,” wrote Sarah Matthews in our guide tothe best hair dryers. “Modern hair dryers have stepped up their game.” Sarah’s favourite budget option, the BaByliss Hydro-Fusion, is “well built and powerful” – and currently reduced to £31.99 at Amazon.The mattress topperView image in fullscreenPanda Bamboo topper, double£139.95 at Panda“A mattress topper is like a slice of cheese in a burger,” writes our reviewer Jane Hoskyn. “Not strictly necessary, but potentially transformative, especially if your bed has all the cosiness of stale bread.” Jane found the Panda Bamboo the most cooling, despite its memory foam construction, in her test of thebest mattress toppers. Many of you were clearly tempted by the idea that “you won’t feel the fidgeting of a restless partner”.The party skirtView image in fullscreenFringe detail mini£50 at M&S“This M&S skirt is a total winner,” wrote Jess Cartner-Morley in herSeptember style essentials. “I mean, look at it. All-over tassels, a great length (short but not too short) and a chic off-white colour.” And clearly many of you agreed, as this party-season skirt was your favourite in the piece.The last-minute clothes steamView image in fullscreenRussell Hobbs Steam Genie£28 at John Lewis“I begin every school year with the resolve to become the kind of woman who irons her clothes,” writes Kate McCusker, inour guide to back-to-the-grind style for all ages. “But as I’m still waiting for this to happen, a quick go-over with a steamer in the morning has saved many an outfit from looking as if I slept in it.” Many Filter readers are clearly still waiting for this to happen, too.The ceramic frying panView image in fullscreenProCook Elite Tri-Ply£48 at ProCookWhile faddy kitchen gadgets come and go, the trusty frying pan remains one of the most used implements in our kitchens. We want one that will last, won’t be a nightmare to clean and, preferably, doesn’t come coated in forever chemicals. Is that really too much to ask? Dale Berning Sawa tested 12 of thebest frying panswith some of the most challenging foods around: salted caramel, sticky marinated pork and – of course – scrambled eggs. Your favourite was this ProCook ceramic-coated frying pan, which stood out “thanks to its pleasing build quality and relatively affordable price” – perhaps because it’s currently reduced.The MP3 player – no, reallyView image in fullscreenSnowsky Echo Mini£66.99 at eBayIf you thought you’d entered a time warp when you saw the Advent calendar above, I can’t imagine how you’re feeling to spot anMP3 player(especially one shaped like a cassette tape). But digital audio players are back, appealing to many who want to disconnect from streaming platforms and take control of their own music. This budget option from FiiO subbrand Snowsky leans “into the charm of retro rather nicely”, wrote Alan Martin in his test of the best, while “providing a far richer soundscape than that offered by any other budget device I tested”.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThe Filter UK newsletterSleepChristmasWorking from homeEthical and green livingCheeseBeautynewslettersShareReuse this content"

That’s not a misnomer if you were using my grandmother’s home-dried chillies, but it would be charitable to say that I’m far less adventurous with chilli, so here I suggest chilli flakes instead. It’s an extraordinarily good marinade for these paneer and potato skewers.Gunpowder paneer and potato skewers with lime-mint dressingYou will need six to eight metal or wooden skewers (if wooden, soak them in water for 10 minutes first).Prep10 minCook30 minServes2400gwaxy potatoes, cut into 4cm chunks225g paneer, cut into 2cm cubes1tsp coriander seeds½tsp fennel seeds1tsp cumin seeds1tsp black peppercorns1tsp chilli flakes1½tsp flaky sea salt,plus extra to serve2garlic cloves, peeled and grated2½cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated40mlneutral oil1 red onion, peeled and cut into eight wedges, then halved crosswaysFor the dressingFinely grated zest and juice of 1 lime10g fresh mint leaves, finely chopped½tsp flaky sea salt100g natural yoghurtBoil the potatoes for nine minutes, then drain them and leave to steam dry for a minute. Meanwhile, put the paneer cubes in a bowl of boiling water for five minutes, then drain and pat dry.Tip the coriander, fennel and cumin seeds into a mortar or spice grinder, add the peppercorns, chilli flakes and sea salt, then pound or blitz to a rough rubble.Tip into a medium-large bowl with the grated garlic and ginger, add the oil, then gently stir in the cubed paneer, cooked potatoes and red onions to coat. Thread the paneer, potatoes and onions on to six to eight metal or soaked wooden skewers, then transfer to a baking sheet and set aside until needed – if you like, you can at this stage cover and refrigerate the skewers.Whisk all the ingredients for the dressing in a medium bowl. Heat the grill to its highest setting, then cook the skewers for five to seven minutes on each side, until the paneer is golden brown and the potatoes are starting to char. (This may take a little more or less time depending on the fierceness of your grill, so keep an eye on them, especially when cooking the first side.)Serve the skewers hot, scattered with a little more sea salt and the dressing alongside for dipping.Explore more on these topicsIndian food and drinkQuick and easySnacksFoodPotatoesCheeseStarterMain courserecipesShareReuse this content"

If you like, make the vegetable curry element in advance and layer everything on the day you want to serve.Prep20 minCook2 hrServes4For the squash and mushroom gravy4 tbsp ghee, or butter1 tsp cumin seeds2 dried bay leaves4 cloves450g white onions, peeled and thinly sliced3 green bird’s eye chillies, slit open lengthways5cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and cut into matchsticks2 tbsp tomato puree¼ tsp mild chilli powder, or kashmiri chilli powder1 tsp ground turmeric2 tsp coriander powder1 heaped tbsp greek yoghurt300g butternut squash flesh, cut into bite-sized pieces300g button mushrooms, cleaned and halved if on the large side400ml vegetable stock, or waterSalt, to taste2 tbsp chopped coriander, to garnishFor the rice200gbasmati rice2 bay leaves4 green cardamom podsA pinch of saltFor the biryani2 tbsp melted ghee1 pinchsaffron threads, soaked in 3 tbsp warm water1¼cm piece freshginger, peeled and cut into matchsticks3 tbsp finely chopped fresh mint leaves1 tsp ground cardamom powder1 tsp garam masalaRaita and salad, to serveFirst make the gravy. Melt the ghee in a large, heavy-based saucepan on a medium heat, add the cumin seeds, bay leaves and cloves, and fry for a few seconds. Stir in the sliced onion and cook, stirring often, for 30-35 minutes, until softened. When the onions start to brown, transfer half of them to a plate and set aside (you’ll use them later during the layering).Add the green chillies and ginger to the remaining onions in the pan, fry for a minute, then stir in the tomato puree, chilli powder, turmeric and coriander powder, and fry for a minute. Turn down to a low heat, stir in the yoghurt and cook for two minutes.Add the squash and mushrooms, stir to coat in the spices, then fry for three minutes. Add the stock or water, and season to taste. Bring to a boil, then turn down the heat, cover and simmer for 18-20 minutes, stirring once halfway to make sure nothing’s stuck to the bottom of the pan. Garnish with coriander, then take off the heat.Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Wash the rice, then put it in a saucepan with a litre of water and the bay leaves, cardamom and salt. Bring to a boil, cook for 10-12 minutes, until three-quarters cooked, then drain.To build the biryani, put a tablespoon of melted ghee in a casserole pot for which you have a tight-fitting lid. Ladle in half the vegetable curry, then top that with half the rice. Add half the saffron water, ginger, mint, ground cardamom and garam masala, then add the reserved fried onions. Top with the remaining vegetable curry, then spoon on the remaining rice. Top with the remaining ghee, saffron water, ginger, mint, ground cardamom and garam masala.Cover with baking paper, cover with the lid, then bake on the middle shelf of the oven for 15-17 minutes, so all the flavours soak into the rice. Take out of the oven, leave to rest, still covered, for 10 minutes, then lift off the lid and serve with raita and salad.Rajasthaniachari kaddu(squash with pickling spices stir-fry)View image in fullscreenMaunika Gowardhan’s Rajasthaniachari kaddu, or squash cooked with pickling spices.The Indian word “achari” refers to flavouring a dish using pickling spices, and the mix includes mustard seeds, fennel, fenugreek, cumin, asafoetida and nigella, but they’re not used only in pickles.

He says that after 40, humans typically lose about acentimetre of heightevery decade. Men lose0.08-0.1%of their body height per year. Women typically lose 0.12-0.14% per year.Some of this is caused by increasingly slumped posture as we get older. People who sit or stand with a curved spine for prolonged periods of time – perhaps at their desk – may find that, over time, their spine assumes that position naturally. Older people sometimes stoop to find a more secure centre of gravity too.We all decrease in height between the start and end of each day as gravity squeezes water out of the intervertebral discsOur change in height also happens at a more granular level. Between 30 and 35, height plateaus as our bone and muscle mass begin to decline. The discs between the vertebrae in our spine lose water and begin to shrink in size. The honeycomb-like centre of the bones in our spine, pelvis and legs becomes less dense. “And as that happens, the bone condenses ever so slightly, and gets shorter,” says Taylor, adding that decreased muscle mass affects our height further still: the way bones maintain their shape and size is by having the force of muscles on them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Maintaining a good posture can also be protective.Taylor adds that getting shorter isn’t a bad thing per se. (In fact, we all decrease in height between the start and end of each day as gravity squeezes water out of the intervertebral discs.) But significant loss of bone and muscle mass as we age is linked to chronic conditions, including heart failure, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and other joint and mobility issues, so it’s worth working to protect it.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleIs it true that …HealthAgeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It crashed on to the terrace where James and his partner, Andrew, had been breakfasting minutes earlier, smashing the table and chairs and crushing the windscreen of their hire car.TheAirbnbcottage in Provence, France, was engulfed by the branches that broke the living room window and damaged the roof. “I was sure the ceiling was going to come in,” says James. “If it had fallen minutes earlier we would have been seriously injured or killed.”It took a day for the host to winch the tree off the cottage and make emergency repairs, but the traumatised couple feared the property may be structurally unsound and decided to book into a hotel for the rest of their week’s holiday.Airbnb was unperturbed. “We understand this may have caused some inconvenience to you,” it wrote in the first of many identical AI-generated messages before closing the unresolved case with a cheery “Keep safe. Stay healthy.”The host was unperturbed too. “All that happened to you was that you heard a loud noise and saw a tree lying on the terrace,” she said in a reply to the couple’s request for a refund. “You have chosen to remember the worry and trauma instead of celebrating a unique memory.”Now the summer season has ended, the holiday horror stories are flooding in to Guardian Money.If it had fallen minutes earlier we would have been seriously injured or killedJames, Airbnb customerUnlucky travellers are reporting being locked in or out of their accommodation – if it existed or left stranded at night in strange cities if it did not. There are tales of filthy bedrooms, unsafe equipment and illegal sublets. One factor unites these ruined holidays: they were booked via online booking platforms, which refused a refund.The growth of sites such as Airbnb and Booking.com has prompted a rise in travellers putting together their own holidays. The companies pour the world’s property portfolio on to a website and promise to sate wanderlust on a budget.Consumer protections have not caught up with their popularity, however.View image in fullscreenThe 100-year-old oak that smashed into the side of the Airbnb property James and Andrew were staying in Provence.Package-deal customers have legal recourse for holiday nightmares under thePackage Travel and Linked Travel Arrangements, but those who book accommodation via third-party platforms will find themselves at the mercy of their host.Some platforms advertise additional protections, but your contract is with the person or company providing the accommodation.James and Andrew had paid £931 for their week in the Provençal cottage and when they felt too unsafe to return ended up forking out twice that for a hotel. They are yet to hear whether they are liable for the damaged hire car. Despite itsAirCover pledgeto refund customers if there is a serious problem with a rental, Airbnb declared it was up to the host to agree a refund; the host claimed the decision was Airbnb’s.After 10 weeks of identikit auto-generated messages in response to James’s complaint, Airbnb declared the case had gone on long enough and summarily closed it. The host concluded that since the repairs had cost her €5,000 (£4,350), she would not be stumping up a refund either. She suggested that instead the couple celebrate their survival and “turn the event into a beautiful story”.Airbnb issued a full refund along with a £500 voucher after we questioned its health and safety policies. A spokesperson says: “We apologise for the original handling of this case, which falls short of our usual high standards. We will be reviewing this internally.”View image in fullscreenTime to see the sights of Barcelona was cut short for one Booking.com customer owing to a broken lock.Photograph: Alejandro García/EPATrappedKim Pocock used Booking.com to book a flat for a two-night stay in Barcelona. She and her daughter were left trapped in the property for most of their only full day in the city after a security lock on the front door malfunctioned.“The host sent out a maintenance man, who was unable to help,” she says. “They eventually dispatched a locksmith who tried for several hours to access the lock from the outside. He had to buy a rope, which he threw up to our window and we hoisted up a wrench and pliers. With us levering the lock from the inside and the locksmith banging it from the outside, we finally managed to remove it. It turned out loose screws had blocked the mechanism. By then it was nearly 4pm.”Pocock requested a full refund to compensate her for the ruined trip and the stress. Booking.com said this was at the discretion of the host. The host not only refused, it withheld her €250 deposit to pay for the replacement lock. The deposit was eventually returned by Booking.com but Pocock felt she was due the €446 rental cost.“We would have been at serious risk if there had been an emergency while we were trapped, yet the host is blaming us for using the lock,” she says.We would have been at serious risk if there had been an emergency while we were trapped, yet the host blamed us for using the lockKim Pocock, Booking.com customerAnother Booking.com customer Philip (surname withheld) was trapped outside the London flat he booked for £70 when, on trying to check in, he found the key safe empty. The owners told him they were abroad and could not help and advised him to find somewhere else for the night. He spent an extra £123 on a hotel room and has spent the intervening four months trying in vain to get this refunded.“Booking.com have basically said that as the owner isn’t responding to them there’s nothing they can do,” he says. “I can’t comprehend how a business is able to operate this way with no accountability. The extra sting in the tail is that the property in question is still being advertised on the platform.”Booking.com refunded both customers after Guardian Money intervened. The platform confirmed the host who had left Philip locked out of his rental had failed to respond to its inquiries. When asked why unscrupulous accommodation providers were not delisted, it said customers should review guest feedback to ensure a property was “the right fit”.Reviews do not always tell the whole story. Areport last year by the consumer group Which?highlighted that Booking.com’s default system was displaying reviews it considered “relevant”. This means that it is easy for users to miss a recent deluge of reviews warning that a listing is a scam or not available.Booking.com countered that customers could easily sort reviews by the most recent or lowest score so as to make their own decision on a property.The same Which? report claimed that listings that had been repeatedly reported as scams were not removed. Booking.com responded that it relied on hosts to abide by its terms and conditions and ensure that availability was up to date.View image in fullscreenBooking.com says customers should read the guest feedback to ensure the property is the ‘right fit’.Photograph: Dado Ruvić/ReutersGrey areaThe problem for travellers who do not get what they paid for is that their contract is with the accommodation provider not the booking platform.Airbnb and Booking.com promise to help find alternative accommodation in an emergency, but getting compensation for a disrupted stay is a tougher battle. Both tend to rely on the owner to do the right thing.The sector needs greater regulation, according to the consumer campaigner and journalist Martyn James. “Because online platforms effectively police themselves, the only course of action if the dispute isn’t resolved is legal action,” James says. “But who against? As the contract is between you and the host you’d have to take legal action in their country.”He adds: “You could argue that the online marketplace failed to investigate your complaint properly and try to pursue them, but this is a grey area, legally. Both firms are registered overseas and have deep pockets.”The Department for Business and Trade (DBT) says the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024, which came into force in April, requires online platforms to “exercise professional diligence” in relation to consumer transactions promoted or made on their platforms.A DBT spokesperson says: “This government is on the side of consumers and we have brought into force tough new financial penalties for breaches of consumer law to protect people’s cash.”They added: “Companies selling services to UK consumers must comply with UK law, and we have bolstered the Competition and Markets Authority’s powers to make sure they face severe penalties if they do not.”Explore more on these topicsConsumer rightsConsumer championsConsumer affairsAirbnbEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Children sit in a rock pool playing mermaids, and in the next room there’s a talking pea in a display case, beside a towering stack of mattresses. It’s the world ofHans Christian Andersen(1805-1875), one of the 19th century’s most beloved writers. I’m in Odense, on the island of Fyn (sometimes anglicised to Funen) in the south of Denmark, to explore Andersen’s enduring legacy in his home town 150 years after his death, and to discover a few fairytales of my own.HC Andersens Husis the city’s museum dedicated to the writer, incorporating his first home. Niels Bjørn Friis fromMuseum Odensesays that in earlier iterations of the museum there was little focus on Andersen’s stories. The writer’s life was explored, but The Ugly Duckling, Thumbelina and The Little Mermaid were nowhere to be found. For visitors who come to Odense seeking storytelling magic, it was a little lacking.A map showing the island of Fyn and its location in relation to CopenhagenThe redesign of Odense city centre, rerouting a major road, provided the opportunity to reimagine how the city’s most famous son could be honoured. A major architecture competition awarded Japanese firm Kengo Kuma and Associates the contract, with the curators’ new approach at the core of the design. The distinctive timber-clad museum with interlinked spiralling spaces opened to great fanfare in 2021. “We’ve tried to create a space where we don’t talk about Andersen, but we talk like Andersen: with humour, irony and perspective,” says Friis. Even the gardens take this approach: “It’s a garden for wanderers and for giants, it’s designed to make you feel small,” he says, a challenge achieved by clever planting, playing with height, scale and many winding paths in a deceptively small space.Andersen wrote two and a half autobiographies and frequently contradicted himself. HC Andersens Hus takes this approach to heart; often the views of his friends or snippets of letters are presented to gently question the author’s own version of events. “Andersen is the guide, but he’s not reliable,” says Friis. The result is a compelling whirlwind tour of Andersen’s life and art, thought processes and best-loved stories. It’s provocative and playful, for adults and children, with a bonus basement make-believe land, Ville Vau, for the youngest visitors.View image in fullscreenThe HC Andersens Hus museum, a space of ‘humour, irony and perspective’.Photograph: Ailsa SheldonBack in the real world, the small city of Odense is charming, with cobbled streets and old wooden houses painted in bright colours. The Andersen legacy is everywhere: the traffic lights feature the writer with his signature top hat, brass footprints provide a freeAndersen walking tour, and there’s a sculpture trail too. Every August this dedication peaks with the annual HC Andersen festival, which celebrates the author’s legacy through art, dance, theatre and music.This year, the week-long festival had 500 shows, most of which were free. As I explore Odense, I meet painted stilt-walkers, ghoulish monsters and an Andersen lookalike telling stories. I hear feminist spoken-word pieces and see an incredible late-night performance featuring acrobatic dancers descending from the town hall and hanging from a crane.Still to comethis year are lectures, family art workshops and, expanding the storytelling legacy beyond Andersen, the city’s annualMagic Days festival.All good fairytale destinations need a castle, and Fyn boasts 123 castles and manor houses across the islandAs in most of Denmark, bikes are the best way to get about in Odense and a “cycling highway” winds through the city centre. FromHotel Odeon, I cycle to the free harbour-side swimming pool, then out of town for a loop around Stige Ø, a small island connected by causeway to the mainland. City residents picnic here after work, or enjoy a quiet hour fishing, paddleboarding or swimming.Back in Odense, I eat atRestaurant Under Lindetræet, where the menu is inspired by Andersen themes and stories. The poem Denmark, My Native Landis featured when I visit, and proprietor Nils Palmqvist reads extracts, translated into English, as he presents each course. It’s an experience repeated often in my days in the city, thefynbo(as residents of Fyn are known) love a yarn and it feels as though storytelling is always on the menu here.View image in fullscreenCycling is the best way to get around Odense and Fyn.Photograph: Daniel VilladsenAll good fairytale destinations need a castle, and Fyn boasts 123 castles and manor houses across the island. Taking day trips from Odense, I visitEgeskov Castle, Europe’s best-preserved Renaissance water castle. While much of it is open to visitors, Egeskov is also the family home of Count Michael Ahlefeldt-Laurvig-Bille and his wife, Princess Alexandra zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg. I wonder if she can feel a pea through a stack of mattresses. The couple are often found in the vast landscaped gardens and play park chatting to visitors.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After a family inheritance dispute that emptied the castle contents, Albinus decided to open her home to visitors and filled it with art, inviting international artists to create site-specific pieces. The juxtaposition of the high cornices and fine wallpapers with Czech artist Jiří Georg Dokoupil’s huge balloon-like sculptures and colourful bubble paintings would no doubt have amused Hans Christian Andersen, who loved to challenge expectations.View image in fullscreenHans Christian AndersenFrom Valdemars Castle, I catch theMS Helge, a wooden ferry built in 1924, which transports passengers around the South Fyn archipelago. This beautiful coastline was last year designated aUnesco Global Geoparkfor its unique “drowned” ice age landscape. I disembark in Svendborg and rent a bike fromSouth Funen Bicycle Rental. I’m cycling today with Mette Mathiasen from Destination Fyn, who is behind the development of the 410-mile (660km) castles route around Fyn. It’s divided into 14 sections, with local operators offering luggage transfer. We’re exploring a 21-mile section, along the coast to the village of Åbyskov and Elsehoved beach. We pass turreted castles, manors and long stretches of quiet coastline, pedalling along country lanes with hedgerows overflowing with blackberries. Unlike most of Denmark, there are some hills in the south of Fyn, but with quiet trails and the option of an ebike, this is gentle, all-abilities cycling.As dusk falls, I pedal across the moat to my last castle of the day and my final destination on Fyn –Broholm Castle. Broholm has 700 years of colourful history and plenty of ghost stories, and was a frequent haunt of Andersen, featuring in his 1837 novel Only a Fiddler. From a childhood of poverty to international acclaim, Andersen’s life was quite the adventure. Following in his footsteps on Fyn has been full of castles and colourful characters, with a few surprises too.The trip was provided by Visit Denmark and Destination Fyn.Hotel Odeonhas doubles from1,100kroner (£128) B&B.Broholm Castlehas doubles from1,695kronerB&BExplore more on these topicsDenmark holidaysEurope holidaysScandinavia holidaysCity breaksShort breaksCultural tripsLiterary tripsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It adds Apple’s new Liquid Glass design, which makes most elements semi-translucent, and adds two new watch faces: a large digital face called Flow that responds to movement and an analogue face called Exactograph, which breaks out hours, minutes and seconds into their own dials.The best new feature is the wrist-flick gesture, where you rapidly twist your wrist away from you and then back to dismiss things and return to the watch face. It works even without raising your wrist to look at the watch, meaning you can dismiss alarms with a satisfying flick of the wrist.Hypertension, sleep and AI workoutsView image in fullscreenHypertension alerts use the same optical sensor on the back of the watch as used for heart rate and blood oxygen measurement, no pressure cuff required.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Apple Watch features the same comprehensive health monitoring suite of tools from previous models but adds a couple of new features and a redesigned workout app.Hypertension alertslook for signs of high blood pressure over a 30-day period, notifying you to get yourself checked out if your heart rate data suggests you may have a hidden problem.The new sleep score metric makes Apple’s sleep tracking easier to interpret, similar to competitors from Google, Samsung and others. Each morning the watch shows a score out of 100 that is broken down into three categories: duration, bedtime and interruptions, which are all self-explanatory and viewable in the Health app on the iPhone, too.View image in fullscreenSleep score makes it easier to understand whether you’re getting good enough sleep at a glance, with more details if you need it.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianWorkout buddy is an AI coach that uses your previous workout data to give you pep talks before and after workouts, such as recognising that you have already run three times this week and the level of effort you put it. It also provides audible heads-up when you reach certain milestones during exercise, such as a particular pace, heart rate, distance, time or other metrics.There is a choice of three voices, which speak to you over Bluetooth headphones connected to your watch for one of 12 activities, including walking, running or cycling. However, it only works if you alsocarry your iPhone 15 Pro or laterwith you, which I found irritating enough that I would forgo the feature to avoid being encumbered with a phone on runs.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe recycled aluminium frame feels high quality, slim and comfortable on your wrist.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianApple says the battery should last more than1,000 full charge cycleswith at least 80% of its original capacity and can be replaced for£95. Repairs costbetween £295 and £389depending on the model.It contains more than 40% recycled material including aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, lithium, rare earth elements, steel, tin, titanium and tungsten. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling for devices, and breaks down the watch’s environmental impactin its report.PriceThe Series 11 comes in two sizes (42 and 46mm), a choice of materials and the option of 5G that requires an eSim and compatible phone plan add-on. It starts at £369 (€449/$399/A$679). The 5G models cost an extra £100 (€120/$100/A$170).For comparison, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 costs£749, the Apple Watch SE 3 costs from£219, the Google Pixel Watch 4 costs from£349and the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 costs from£294.VerdictThe Series 11 hasn’t changed the winning Apple Watch formula but it has added two things that most will appreciate: more scratch-resistant glass and longer battery life.The slim design, fast charging and two-day battery life make the watch easy to live with, particularly for sleep tracking and use as a silent alarm clock. The wrist-flick gesture is so good every watch should have it, while compatibility with straps and charging pucks for all previous Apple Watches is a great bonus for those upgrading. A price cut in the UK is welcome, too.The glass-like design of watchOS 26 may take some getting used to but the software works just the same and introduces some useful features including hypertension alerts, which could be lifesaving. Workout buddy is the most interesting feature. It was a far more positive experience than I was expecting but relies on working out with your phone, too, which is a bit of a drag for runs.Overall, the Series 11 is one of the very best smartwatches available for the iPhone, and if you have an older watch such as aSeries 6, you will see a massive upgrade. However, this year its status as the default Apple Watch to buy has been challenged by the revamped Watch SE 3, which offers better value if not quite as many features or as refined a design.Pros:great always-on screen, slim design, double-tap and wrist-flick gestures, top health tracking, great activity tracking, workout buddy AI trainer, 50-metre water resistance, two-day battery life, optional 5G, long software support, recycled materials, takes older watch straps.Cons:expensive, only works with an iPhone, no third-party watch faces, looks the same as all recent models, undercut by Watch SE.Explore more on these topicsApple WatchAppleSmartwatchesWearable technologyGadgetsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The court ruled that the atrocities, including mass murders and rapes, were part of a government plan to snuff out a rebellion in the western region ofSudan.Ali Muhammad Ali Abd–al-Rahman, also known by the nom de guerre Ali Kushayb showed no emotion as the presiding judge, Joanna Korner, read out 27 guilty verdicts.Darfur war crimes trial opens as army cracks down in SudanRead more“The chamber is convinced that the accused is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes with which he has been charged,” said Korner. She added that sentencing would take place at a later date.Korner detailed harrowing accounts of gang rapes, abuse and mass killing. She said that on one occasion, Abd-al-Rahman loaded about 50 civilians on to trucks, beating some with axes, before making them lie on the ground and ordering his troops to shoot them dead.“The accused was not only giving orders … but was personally involved in the beatings and later was physically present and giving orders for the execution of those detained,” said the ICC judge.Prosecutors had accused Abd-al-Rahman of being a leading member of Sudan’s infamous Janjaweed militia, which participated “enthusiastically” in war crimes.But Abd-al-Rahman, who was born around 1949, has denied all the charges, telling the court they had the wrong man.“I am not Ali Kushayb. I do not know this person … I have nothing to do with the accusations against me,” he told the court at a hearing in December 2024.But Korner said the court was “satisfied that the accused was the person known … as Ali Kushayb”, dismissing defence witnesses who had denied that.Abd-al-Rahmanfled to Central African Republic in February 2020when a new Sudanese government announced its intention to cooperate with the ICC investigation.He said he then handed himself in because he was “desperate” and feared authorities would kill him.Fighting broke out in the Darfur region when non-Arab tribes, complaining of systematic discrimination, took up arms against Khartoum’s Arab-dominated government.The then Sudanese government responded by unleashing the Janjaweed, a force drawn from among the region’s nomadic tribes.The United Nations has said that 300,000 people were killed and that 2.5 million others displaced by the Darfur conflict in the 2000s.During the trial, the ICC chief prosecutor said Abd-al-Rahman and his forces “rampaged across different parts of Darfur”.He “inflicted severe pain and suffering on women, children and men in the villages that he left in his wake”, said Karim Khan, who has since stepped down as he faces allegations of sexual misconduct.Abd-al-Rahman is also thought to be an ally of the deposed Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir, who is wanted by the ICC on genocide charges.Bashir, who ruled Sudan with an iron fist for nearly three decades, was ousted and detained in April 2019 after months of protests in Sudan.He has not, however, been handed over to the ICC, based in The Hague, where he also faces charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity.ICC prosecutors are hoping to issue fresh arrest warrants related to the current crisis in Sudan.Since 2023, tens of thousands have been killed and millions displaced in a war between Sudan’s army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, which grew out of the Janjaweed militia.The conflict, marked by claims of atrocities on all sides, has left the north-east African country on the brink of famine, according to aid agencies.Explore more on these topicsDarfurInternational criminal courtInternational criminal justiceSudanAfricaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The statement did not specify where the deportees were originally from or the reasons given by the US for deporting them.“This group includes three Vietnamese, one Filipino, one Cambodian and four [to] six others,” said Tin Thanh Nguyen, a US lawyer for two of the Vietnamese nationals. Nguyen is also the lawyer for another Vietnamese national and a Laotian national who were deported toEswatiniin July.Eswatini’s correctional services department said in a statement on Monday: “The nationals who arrived today are in good health and undergoing admission processes … HMCS [His Majesty’s Correctional Services]remains committed to the humane treatment of all persons in its custody.”Donald Trump’s administration is attempting to ramp up deportations from the US. This has included striking deals with third countries includingEl Salvador, Rwanda,UgandaandSouth Sudanto remove dozens of people who have no connections to where they are being sent and are not given any opportunity to challenge their removals.At least eight west African men weredeported to their home countries via Ghanain September, despite fearing they would be subject to “torture, persecution or inhumane treatment”.Five men from Cambodia, Cuba, Jamaica, Vietnam and Yemen were deported in July by the US to Eswatini, a country of 1.2 million people landlocked by SouthAfricaand Mozambique, where they were put in a maximum security prison.Orville Etoria, who served 24 years for murder in the US before being released there in 2021, was returned to Jamaica on 21 September. The US hadclaimedthat the five men were so “uniquely barbaric” that their home countries would not take them back, something that Jamaica’s government denied in the case of Etoria.Eswatini’s government, which is appointed by Africa’s last absolute monarch, King Mswati III, said two of the other five men were expected to be repatriated soon.A group of Eswatini NGOs has challenged the deportation deal. The case has been delayed twice – once when the attorney general did not come to court and again when the judge failed to turn up.

On 3 October, Eswatini’s high court granted a local lawyer access to the men. The judgment was stayed, as the government immediately appealed to the supreme court, arguing that “the respondent failed to establish a legally recognised connection with the foreign nationals”.Nguyen said his two clients who had been deported in the summer had been held in Eswatini without charge. “Neither Vietnam nor Laos has refused their repatriation, yet they remain imprisoned in a third country … Even if my clients are successfully repatriated tomorrow, these third-country deportations remain illegal and must be stopped before hundred more people are unjustly subjected to this system,” the lawyer added.The US Department of Homeland Security and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Explore more on these topicsEswatiniIce (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)US immigrationTrump administrationAfricaHuman rightsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

On 11 September, Bolsonaro was convicted and sentenced to 27 years in prison by the supreme court.‘Classic tinpot dictator’: Trump exports his assault on democracy to BrazilRead moreA fortnight later, Trump appeared to extend an olive branch to Lula at the UN general assembly in New York. “He seemed like a very nice man, actually,” Trump said of his leftwing counterpart after a brief backstage encounter during which the US president claimed there had been “excellent chemistry”.On Monday, Trump and Lula held their first extended conversation since the former returned to the White House in January. “It was positive,” Brazil’s finance minister, Fernando Haddad, who also took part in the half-hour call, told reporters after.In a statement, Brazil’s presidency said Trump and Lula had “recalled the good chemistry felt in New York” and “exchanged phone numbers to establish a direct channel of communication”.Writing on his Truth Social platform, Trump celebrated “a very good” exchange, adding: “I enjoyed the call – Our Countries will do very well together!”Lula called the conversation “an opportunity to restore the friendly 201-year relationship between the west’s two biggest democracies” and asked for US tariffs and sanctions against Brazilian officials to be scrapped.Lula also said he hoped to meet Trump in person, possibly at a summit in Malaysia later this month, or by travelling to the US. He reiterated his invitation for the US president to attend November’s Cop30 climate summit in the Amazon city of Belém.Trump said: “We discussed many things, but it was mostly focused on the Economy, and Trade, between our two Countries. We will be having further discussions, and will get together in the not too distant future, both in Brazil and the United States.”Matias Spektor, an international relations professor at Brazil’s Getúlio Vargas Foundation, said it was too early to declare the rift between Brasília and Washington over: “All we know is that Trump is willing to talk and that Lula is willing to talk as well.”It was unclear whether Trump raised Bolsonaro’s plight during the call – but even if he did, Spektor said there was nothing Lula could offer the US president with regards to that. “Lula simply cannot deliver any changes in the way the supreme court treats Bolsonaro … even if he wanted to.”However, Spektor believed one possible area where Brazil could help Trump wasHaiti. Last week the UN security council approved US-backed plans for a thousands-strong “Gang Suppression Force” to tackle the crisis in the Caribbean country.In 2004, during Lula’s first presidential term, Brazil began sending thousands of troops to Haiti to lead the UN stabilisation mission there, which lasted until 2017. Just over two decades later, Spektor wondered whether Brazilian boots might again be seen on the ground in Port-au-Prince.“I may well be very wrong … It could be the case that nobody in the [Lula] administration wants to burn their fingers with this,” Spektor said.“[But] Haiti is one instance in which the demand coming from the White House could be met by Brazil – and it’s something Brazil has done in the past and … that Lula could present as Brazil’s contribution to world order, stability and peace at a time at which things are so messy.“And if this is an area where Lula can do something that Trump will appreciate, this is where you have a bridge between Trump and Lula … The stars could align.”Explore more on these topicsBrazilTrump tariffsHaitiDonald TrumpAmericasLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvaUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

A lifetime’s worth of songs that we had put our cumulative hearts and souls into writing, recording and playing together onstage. And so, after all that has gone down since that last show, Alex and I have done some serious soul searching and come to the decision that we fucking miss it, and that it’s time for a celebration of 50-something years of Rush music.”Lee promises a “vast selection of songs” from the band’s 19 studio albums, and while crediting Peart as “irreplaceable”, announced a “remarkable” new drummer, Anika Nilles. Lee previously praised her in a2023 Guardian interview, saying: “I heard this drummer the other day, I think her name is Anika [Nilles]. She played on the last Jeff Beck tour and I thought was she was terrific.”Rush originally formed in 1968 in Toronto, and 11 of those 19 albums eventually went Top 10 in the US, culminating in 2012’s Clockwork Angels, a No 2 hit.Rush’s last gigs were in a 40th anniversary tour in 2015, with the band members reportedly divided over their future. “I miss playing with Rush. I don’t miss travelling with Rush,” Lee told the Guardianin 2018, and in his 2023 interview he added: “[The 2015 tour] was a lot of fun, but as the tour wound down, the mood started to change and it split into two camps. Neil was getting happier and Alex and I were getting sadder, because we really wanted to bring the tour to fans around the world, but Neil had agreed to do 30 shows. He felt as if he was approaching liberation, so we were quite divided by the end.”Peart died of brain cancer in 2020, having lived for more than three years with the illness, and Lee had previously scotched the idea that Rush would perform again without Peart. “That’s finished, right? That’s over,” he told Rolling Stone later in 2020. “I would never hesitate to play one of those songs in the right context. But at the same time, you have to give respect to what the three of us with Neil did together.”But in 2023 he told the Guardian it was “likely” that he and Lifeson would make new music together.Lee also spoke more about Nilles at a launch event for the tour. “No matter who the drummer is, they all have their own perception of what it’s like to play a Rush song, and they may not line up with the way we play Rush,” he said. “So whoever we were going to choose was going to be difficult, and there was going to be like a translation.“And so we very secretly brought Anika to Canada, and we did it wasn’t an audition, because at that point we weren’t really sure that we were going to tour. It was all an experiment … I’m very happy to say that she is fantastic to play with … A lot of drummers can play Neil’s drum fills, but to combine that with the feel of those songs so that it feels the way you guys want to hear those songs – that’s work, that requires work. So she’s winning.”Lee added that the trio would be augmented by other supporting musicians: “Before we hit the stage, we also hope to add another musician or two to expand our sound a wee bit and free up Alex and I, in order to show off some of our new fancy dance steps.”Explore more on these topicsMusicRushPop and rockCanadaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Ferry services were suspended and flights cancelled at Haikou Meilan airport.Matmo, the 21st typhoon of the year, had sustained wind speeds of 94mph (151km/h) and dumped more than 50mm of rainfall in six hours in Chongzou and Qinzhou. The city of Nanning also had high rainfall totals.The storm prompted China’s highest-level red alert, with disruptions in Zhanjiang, where businesses, transport links and roads were shut. In Hong Kong, 100 flights were affected and 30 cancelled.As Matmo moves inland towards Cao Bang province in Vietnam, it is expected to weaken into a tropical depression with 55mph winds but will continue to bring heavy rainfall. Northern Vietnam could face 130-150mm on Monday, raising the risk of flooding and landslides. The system is expected to move towards Yunnan province in China, where further heavy rainfall is likely.View image in fullscreenRain lashes Mexico City as Hurricane Priscilla looms.Photograph: Jose Luis Torales/NurPhoto/ShutterstockMeanwhile, Hurricane Priscilla formed off Mexico’s Pacific coast on Saturday night, initially as a tropical storm. It prompted a storm watch for south-western regions from Punta San Telmo to Punta Mita on Monday.In the early hours of Sunday, Priscilla was about 305 miles from Cabo Corrientes with sustained winds of 65mph. It intensified into a hurricane in the evening, when sustained winds peaked at 75mph.Though not expected to make landfall, Priscilla is likely to generate hazardous swells and rip currents as it tracks north-west along the coast towards Baja California Sur. Heavy rainfall is forecast on Monday, reaching 100-150mm in Michoacán and western Guerrero, with local totals at about 200mm. Colima and western Jalisco could face 50-100mm.Elsewhere, Cyclone Shakhti has developed as the first post-monsoon cyclonic storm of 2025 in the Arabian Sea, prompting an alert from theIndiaMeteorological Department for Maharashtra. On Sunday, Shakhti was 130 miles south-east of Ras al Hadd, Oman, with maximum sustained winds of 64mph.The storm, which has tracked south-westward and weakened, is forecast to recurve eastward into the Arabian Sea. Rough seas are likely to persist along the Gujarat-North Maharashtra coast and heavy rainfall is expected in coastal districts including Dwarka, Jamnagar and Surat.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentWeather trackerHurricanesMexicoChinaIndiaAmericasAsia PacificanalysisShareReuse this content"

But Chinese authorities, which control the Tibetan Autonomous Region, said heavy snowfall had hit the area on Friday and Saturday night,trapping hundreds of people at campsitesat an elevation of more than 4,900 metres (16,000ft).“It was the most extreme weather I’ve ever faced in all my hiking experiences, without question,” Dong Shuchang, a Chinese trekker, said on Weibo, describing a “violent convective snowstorm on the eastern slope” of Everest.“I looked up in the middle of the night and saw that the snow had nearly covered the top,” said another trekker on Xiaohongshu. “It was the first time I truly felt the fear of being buried alive.”One Chinese trekker said their group had been “too scared to sleep” on Saturday as snow quickly piled up around their tents, forcing them to clear it every 90 minutes. They decided to descend on Sunday as the weather worsened.“On the way, we met our guide’s father, who had come looking for him. That’s when we learned the snow was heavy in the valley, too; villagers, unable to contact their children on the mountain, were extremely worried.”MapThe northern and eastern side of Everest is more accessible than sites on theNepalside of the border, and draws high numbers of visitors for less technical trekking, without summiting the peak.Photos and video posted online showed tents buried in snow, and lines of trekkers walking through waist-high drifts to get down the mountain.“The snow was very deep, and the trail extremely slippery. Trekkers stumbled frequently – some fell, others were bumped by yaks,” said one, who added that all safely descended and were picked up by bus.By Sunday afternoon, about 350 people had reached Qudang, a small town about 30 miles away from the Tibet-side base camp of Everest, “in good health”, state media reported.At least 200 more were still stranded, but had been contacted, the reports said. Jimu News reported that hundreds of rescuers had gone up the mountain to help people and clear snow from blocking the way out.There was little official reporting or updated information about the rescue effort on Monday. It was also not clear if the weather had affected anyone on the northern side of Everest, also in Tibet. The region is tightly controlled by the Chinese government, and journalistic access restricted. The weather also appears to have affected local communications, with calls to local businesses not connecting. Several trekkers said power was out in Qudang when they arrived.October is a peak season for the area, with usually clear and mild weather, but Chen Geshuang, one of 18 members of a trekking group that made it back to Qudang, said that the weather this year was “not normal”.“The guide said he had never encountered such weather in October. And it happened all too suddenly.”The local tourism authority said ticket sales and entry to the Everest Scenic Area were suspended from Saturday.Neighbouring countries were also hit by extreme weather. Heavy rains triggered landslides and flash floods that have blocked roads, washed away bridges and killed at least 47 people since Friday in Nepal.Additional reporting by Lillian Yang, Jason Tzu Kuan Lu, and ReutersExplore more on these topicsMount EverestTibetChinaNepalMountaineeringAsia PacificSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

After returning to their country many said they were subjected to degrading treatment by Israeli authorities.The families of the three New Zealanders told media on Monday they were concerned for the safety and wellbeing of their loved ones.“I’m very worried about Samuel, as he sits in a cell right now, in a cage crammed in with many other people … he has been without water and legal representation,” said Adrian Leason, Samuel’s father.Heba Hamida said her sister Rana had sustained an injury to her shoulder, but the family were unclear yet as to how it happened.“I’m just going to ask the government to react and bring our loved ones home safe and in good health,” Hamida said.Youssef’s sister, Samar Sammour, said her brother had sailed into danger, not because he wanted to but because the government had failed to act.“I urge the New Zealand government to demonstrate principled leadership that defines us as a nation and to finally show the moral courage that people like Youssef, Rana and Samuel have shown in abundance.”New Zealand’s ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement a consular partner in Tel Aviv had met with the New Zealanders and the ministry would provide further support in the coming days.It said it was not aware of any New Zealanders being on the most recent deportation flight.Israel’s foreign ministry has denied accusations that some activists were denied access to their lawyers and said the legal rights of the activists were being “fully upheld”.Adalah, a legal centre in Israel representing the activists, said some of those detained have alleged abuse and physical violence while in Israeli custody. Other accusations of mistreatment include being denied medical treatment and medication, and in one case, a Muslim woman was allegedly forced to remove her hijab and was offered a shirt as a replacement.Asked about the allegations, an Israeli foreign ministry spokesperson accused Adalah of “repeating outright lies”.“All the detainees’ legal rights were fully upheld, and they were all given access to water, food, and restrooms. They were not denied access to legal counsel, and of course, no physical force was used against them,” the spokesperson said.The co-leader of New Zealand’s Green Party, Chlöe Swarbrick, told a press conference the detained New Zealanders were trying to build a world “in which our humanity actually means something”.The party demanded the government make clear its plans for returning the New Zealanders, and called on prime minister Christopher Luxon to sanction Israel.“Our government has a legal obligation to prevent genocide. It is presently washing its hands of that obligation,” Swarbrick said.Speaking to reporters on Monday afternoon, Luxon said officials had conveyed “very strongly to the Israeli government” that the safety of New Zealanders was paramount.Luxon would not condemn Israel’s interception of the flotilla because there were “arguments on both sides”.“You’re going into a war zone … there’s 40 boats and 500 people, you could argue they’re trying to keep people safe.”Meanwhile, in a lengthy post to X, foreign affairs minister Winston Peters accused Swarbrick of “faux moral outrage” and said the members of the flotilla were “headline hunting” and had been told not to go.“Now we have to spend all of our time and taxpayer money to solve their self righteous self inflicted petulant problems,” he said.The Guardian has contacted the Israeli embassy in New Zealand for comment.With ReutersExplore more on these topicsGaza flotillaNew ZealandAsia PacificGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestineIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

The case, which played out in an Australian court earlier this year, attracted global attention.The Mushroom Tapes, written with fellow Australian authors Chloe Hooper and Sarah Krasnostein, will be published by TextPublishingon 11 November in Australia and W&N in the UK on 20 November. The case has already inspired a television special, a forthcoming ABC drama series and several documentaries.Prosecutors alleged that Patterson, a mother and self-described true crime enthusiast, invited her estranged husband’s parents, Gail and Don Patterson, and Gail’s sister and brother-in-law, Heather and Ian Wilkinson, to lunch at her Victoria home in July 2023. Within days, three of the guests were dead and the fourth lay in a coma.Patterson, 51, denied any intent to harm them, claiming she had bought the mushrooms from a grocer and discarded a food dehydrator that later tested positive for deadly toxins only out of panic. After an 11-week trial, a jury found her guilty of three counts of murder and one of attempted murder. She was sentenced in September to life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 33 years.Garner, Hooper and Krasnostein were among the many writers, journalists and documentary teams who attended the trial. According to the publisher, The Mushroom Tapes emerged from their shared experience of “long days immersed in the case’s themes: love, hate, jealousy, revenge, marriage, money, mycology and murder.” The book is described as a “true crime study like no other” and an exploration of both the crime and the public’s obsession with it.Helen Garner’s work has often intertwined literature and the law. Her debut novel, Monkey Grip (1977), became an instant classic, while her later nonfiction – The First Stone, Joe Cinque’s Consolation and This House of Grief – cemented her reputation as a chronicler of Australia’s most fascinating court cases.Explore more on these topicsBooksErin Patterson mushroom trialPublishingnewsShareReuse this content"

She was drugged by her then husband who invited people he had met in online chatrooms to come to their home to abuse her while she was unconscious in her own bed. She became an international feminist hero after she decided to waive her right to anonymity in the trial of 51 men last year.Pelicot watched calmly in the Nîmes appeals court on Monday, sitting with her youngest son, Florian. She told the judges that once again she would waive her right to anonymity in the four-day trial.Arriving at court, she shook hands with supporters outside. A banner saying “Gisèle, women thank you” was hung outside the courthouse. Women applauded as she left court.The presiding judge, Christian Pasta, reminded the court of the facts of the case, describing the abuse to which Pelicot had been subjected by her ex-husband.Dominique Pelicot had filmed the men who raped her and stored the images on a hard drive in a file labelled “abuse”, which was found by police after he was arrested for filming up women’s skirts in a supermarket in the southern town of Carpentras in 2020.View image in fullscreenHusamettin Dogan told the court on Monday: ‘I never knew she was drugged.’Photograph: Alain Robert/SIPA/ShutterstockLast year Dogan was sentenced to nine years in prison for raping Pelicot after a court in Avignon was shown video evidence of him in the Pelicots’ bedroom. Of the 51 men who were found guilty in the trial last year, he is the only one to appeal against his conviction.Dogan arrived at the court walking with a crutch and covering his face with sunglasses and a Covid mask. He told the judges he currently had no profession.Dogan’s first trial heard he had made contact with Dominique Pelicot in a chatroom and had driven to the couple’s home the same night in June 2019, telling his wife he was going out. He was convicted of raping Gisèle Pelicot while she was unconscious.Dogan told the first trial he had thought it was just a game. “I’m not a rapist, that’s too heavy for me to bear,” he said.The presiding judge told the appeals court in Nîmes that toxicology experts agreed that in the video showing Gisèle Pelicot with Dogan, she was clearly unconscious and almost in a foetal position. The judge said that at one point Dominique Pelicot held her head to avoid it rolling to the side.Dogan was born in Turkey and at the age of five or six moved toFrancewhere his father worked as a concierge in a building, the court heard. After a fire when he was a child, the family were moved to emergency accommodation on a housing estate where Dogan later began dealing drugs, and he received a conviction aged 17 before serving a prison sentence at 20.He had a violent father and an unstable working life, with short-term building contacts and periods of homelessness from the age of 17, the court heard. He had smoked cannabis from the age of 10 and at one point was drinking a bottle of whisky a day, but stopped drinking and smoking at the time of the birth of his son, who has Down’s syndrome. He cared for his son for several years while his wife worked in a school canteen, the court heard.Psychiatric experts who interviewed Dogan told the court that he described having a satisfactory sex life with his wife while hiding from her that he was arranging with men in online chatrooms to take part in occasional threesomes. A court psychologist said he watched pornography and sought paid sex “once a year on his birthday”.Dominique Pelicot, one of the worst sex offenders in modern French history, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for drugging his then wife and inviting dozens of men to rape her in her home in the south of France.Now serving a prison sentence in solitary confinement, he will appear as a witness at the appeal court trial on Tuesday afternoon. He is expected to repeat what he said at the first trial: “I am a rapist and all the accused men in this room are rapists.”Nine jurors – five men and four women – are hearing the case along with three judges. A verdict is expected on Thursday.Explore more on these topicsGisèle Pelicot rape trialGisèle PelicotFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

According to local press reports, the case concerned a property dispute.Albania’s prime minister, Edi Rama, said it was a “tragic event” and called for tougher sentencing for gun-related crimes. He said such crimes warranted “the most extreme legal response against the aggressor”.The country’s president, Bajram Begaj, condemned the shooting in a statement, describing it as “a terrible attack against the entire justice system”.According to data from theSouth Eastern and Eastern Europe Clearinghouse for the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons, there were 213 firearm incidents in Albania between January and June this year.Explore more on these topicsAlbaniaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Anyone who failed to keep their eyes down was punished with a hit to the head.”Israeli forces intercepted all the boats of the Global Sumud flotilla (GSF), carrying more than 400 people including parliamentarians and the environmental campaignerGreta Thunberg, last week. Most of the people were held at Ketziot, a high-security prison in the Negev desert used primarily to detain Palestinians whom Israel accuses of involvement in terrorist activities.Israel’s foreign ministry has dismissed all claims of mistreatment of members of the flotilla as “brazen lies”, posting on X: “All the detainees’ legal rights are fully upheld.”The national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has said he was “proud” of the way staff behaved at Ketziot. He said in a statement on the activists: “They should get a good feel for the conditions in Ketziot prison and think twice before they approach Israel again.”Rafael Borrego, a Spanish activist and lawyer, told Reuters: “At any time that any of us called a police officer, we risked that seven or more fully armed people entered to our cell, as they did on mine, pointing us with weapons at our heads, with dogs ready to attack us, and being dragged to the floor. This happened on a daily basis.”The Australia and New Zealand branch of the Global Movement toGaza, part of the flotilla, said the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) had notified the family of one participant that he had reported being assaulted during the interception of his vessel, receiving injuries to his shoulder and ribs.It said the DFAT had been told the man was later attacked while in prison, slapped in the face, mocked and verbally abused, denied clean water and kept awake as guards shouted at him throughout the night.1:27'Our systems are betraying Palestinians,' says Greta Thunberg after Israel deportation – videoAda Colau, the leftwing former mayor of Barcelona, said on her return toSpainon Sunday night that the prison yard by her cell had been decorated with a huge photograph of a bombed-out Gaza, with a caption in Arabic that read: “Welcome to the new Gaza.”She said it showed that the jail was “the prison of a fascist state”. She said that when “we asked for a doctor, we were told that that was for humans”.Lorenzo D’Agostino, an Italian journalist, told the Guardian there were crew members who had urgently needed medication. “The Israelis ignored them,” he said. “When we all protested, they came in wearing riot gear, set dogs on us and aimed the laser sights of their automatic rifles at our heads.”He added: “When they stripped us of our shirts and of Palestinian symbols like the keffiyeh, they stamped on them forcefully.”D’Agostino and several other members of the flotilla said Israeli forces appeared to single out Thunberg for harsher treatment than the others. “I saw with my own eyes that they draped an Israeli flag over her while soldiers took selfies with her. Greta is a strong and courageous woman, but during detention she looked deeply shaken,” D’Agostino said.An email sent by the Swedish foreign ministry and seen by the Guardian confirmed that the activist had been forced “to hold flags” and had been “detained in a cell infested with bedbugs, with too little food and water”.The Israeli foreign ministry statement said Thunberg “did not complain to the Israeli authorities about any of these ludicrous and baseless allegations – because they never occurred”.At the White House, Donald Trump said Thunberg was “just a troublemaker”.“She has an anger management problem. I think she should see a doctor,” the US president told reporters. “She’s angry – if you ever watch her, she’s a young person, she’s so angry.”Thunberg arrived on a flight toGreeceon Monday, among 171 people Israel said it had deported. Speaking to the media, she said: “Let me be very clear: there is a genocide going on in front of our very eyes, a live-streamed genocide on all of our phones.”When journalists asked her about the alleged abuses, Thunberg chose instead to speak about the plight of the Palestinian people.“I could talk for a very, very long time about our mistreatment and abuses in our imprisonment, trust me,” the campaigner said. “But that is not the story. What happened here was Israel … continuing to worsen and escalate their genocide and mass destruction with genocidal intent, attempting to erase an entire population in front of our very eyes.”Monday’s expulsions brought the total number deported to 341, from 479 detained.The first of four Scottish people on the flotilla returned home to Glasgow on Monday. Margaret Pacetta, 72, described the detention in Israel as “absolute hell”.Pacetta, who has a broken leg, said the Israeli authorities took everything off her and made her remove her clothes in front of a man.She told a crowd who had gathered at the station to greet her: “They took all my meds … my inhalers and my nebuliser, they eventually gave the nebuliser back but threw the medicine for it away. They took my glasses off me and my hearing aids. They ripped my necklace off my neck and my watch.“They took everything. They took my T-shirt off me, they stripped me and opened the door and there’s a guy standing staring in.”Twenty-seven Greek nationals including a leftwing MP, Peti Perka, were also returning home on Monday after Athens’ foreign ministry announced it would dispatch a specially chartered plane to southern Israel’s Eilat-Ramon international airport.Greece’s centre-right government has faced mounting criticism over its hesitation to criticise Israel, with opposition parties and relatives of the activists accusing the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, of prioritising the two countries’ “strategic alliance”.The Greek foreign ministry lodged “a strong written protest” on Friday in which it called on Israel “to promptly complete the required procedures [of repatriation] and to respect the rights of the citizens involved”, but opponents noted it was only issued after complaints of official indifference by the activists’ relatives.Stopping short of naming Ben-Gvir, who was filmed taunting the activists as they came ashore, the ministry criticised “the unacceptable and inappropriate behaviour of an Israeli minister directed against Greek citizens”.Meanwhile, a new flotilla that set sail from Turkey is making its way toward Gaza and is about 200 nautical miles from the territory. It is carrying about 250 people including doctors, nurses and journalists on a ferry converted into a floating hospital.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Not surprisingly, markets were rattled by the news on Monday.France’s travails are particularly acute, but the president is far from alone in 2025 in trying to grapple with a mismatch between overstretched public finances and a weary electorate with little appetite for budget cuts.View image in fullscreenSébastien Lecornu stood down as the French prime minister after less than a month.Photograph: Stéphane Mahé/EPAGovernment bond yields, essentially the interest rate on a country’s debt, have been creeping up in many major economies in recent weeks and months, amid concerns about tax and spending pressures.Yields on longer-term Japanese debt jumped on Monday, with the likely new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, expected to ramp up spending – despite Tokyo’s 250% of gross domestic product (GDP) debt pile – amid consumer frustration over rising prices.In the UK theputative Labour leadership contender Andy Burnhamwas ridiculed by colleagues last week for suggestingthe government should be less “in hock”to the bond markets, when the Treasury is paying £110bn a year in interest to investors, and yields have repeatedly shifted in response to policy moves – as well as global pressures.Rachel Reeves has repeatedly insisted her fiscal rules, which frustrate some Labour colleagues, are just the consequence of the need to maintain the confidence of the bond markets. In contrast with the French situation, the UK has a stable government with the levers to resolve its fiscal problems – by raising taxes, in the first instance. However, the recent example of Liz Truss, who lasted barely longer than Lecornu in power, is a constant reminder of the risks of throwing caution to the wind.In the US, meanwhile, the market for treasuries – US government bonds – has been more quiescent despite Donald Trump’s massive tax cuts, forecast to add up to $2tn (£1.5tn) to public debt. Ten-year yields climbed to 4.6% in May as anxiety over the president’s tariff plans peaked, but for the moment those concerns have been more than outweighed by the promise of more Federal Reserve rate cuts and the hype around the AI investment boom.However, analysts believe the budget pressures in the US are likely to become more acute in the months and years ahead, with the White House offering no plan to tackle the deficit, which was 6% of GDP last year even before the tax cuts. “It looks to me like an accident waiting to happen,” said Russell Jones of the consultancy IndependentEconomics. “It’s not a sustainable situation.”Each country’s domestic political challenges are different but there is a broader picture here. Many governments ran up significant debts during the global financial crisis, and again through the Covid pandemic.These remained manageable during the extended period of low interest rates that followed the crash. But post-pandemic, central banks began raising rates to battle the rise in inflation as global industry reopened after the Covid shutdown, and then the fresh increase in prices that followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That means politicians struggle to get buy-in for cuts. “There’s a sense from the public that we’ve endured some tough times already,” said Neil Shearing, the group chief economist at the consultancy Capital Economics.In itsglobal debt report, published earlier this year, the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said interest costs as a share of GDP among member countries had jumped from the lowest level in 20 years to the highest, between 2021 and 2024.“Governments and companies borrowed $25tn globally from markets in 2024, nearly triple the amount in 2007,” the OECD’s economists said. “This increase is largely the legacy of the 2008 global financial crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic, in response to which large fiscal support packages, mainly funded via debt markets, helped avoid deeper recessions.”At the same time, many governments face upward pressures on long-term spending, including ageing societies, the transition to net zero – and in the case of European nations, the need to ramp up defence as the US leans away from Nato.All of these sovereign borrowers are fishing in the same pool of international investors, and concerns about sustainability in one major economy can spill over into others – as seen when UK yields tracked US borrowing costs upwards earlier in the year, for example, intensifying the pressure on Reeves, who responded with plans for spending cuts.France’s crisis is likely to continue to be the focus for the moment, as Macron weighs up his next steps. But the global borrowing glut has left many governments vulnerable to even minor shifts in yields – and every bout of market jitters exacts a heavy political price.Explore more on these topicsEconomicsBondsGiltsStock marketsGovernment borrowingUS Government borrowingEmmanuel MacronanalysisShareReuse this content"

Government sources told French media that Macron would “assume his responsibilities” if the effort failed. It was not immediately clear what this might entail.On Monday morning Lecornu made what he called a “spontaneous” speech on the steps of the prime minister’s residence in Paris, appearing to blame his resignation on opposition political parties inFrance, who he said had not wanted to compromise.Criticising political “egos”, he said parties continued to behave with “partisan appetites”. He said he had been “ready to compromise, but each political party wanted the other political party to adopt its entire programme”.Speaking in the courtyard of Matignon palace, the prime minister’s headquarters, the 39-year-old former defence minister, the shortest-lived premier in modern French history, said he had worked for weeks to forge a viable path forward.Terms of office of each prime minister during Emmanuel Macron’s presidency graphic“It would not take much for it to work,” added Lecornu, whose cabinet had been announced barely 12 hours previously. “By being more selfless for many, by knowing how to show humility … One must always put one’s country before one’s party.”Lecornu’s decision had left Macron facing a choice between appointing a new prime minister – someone capable of passing a budget for this year – or dissolving the national assembly and calling fresh legislative elections, options that could still be available to him after Wednesday.He has consistently said he is reluctant to hold another vote, which polls suggest would return another divided parliament or possibly usher in a far-right government, and has also said he will not resign until the end of his mandate in 2027.Lecornu had faced furious criticism from opposition politicians as soon as the new government was revealed on Sunday evening to be virtually unchanged since his immediate predecessor, François Bayrou, was forced to quit last month over proposed budget cuts.The proposed new government was dominated by Macron’s allies. Opposition parties said Lecornu had backtracked on the “profound break” with past politics that he had promised when he took over from Bayrou, who wasousted on 9 September.His announcement alarmed markets, with the CAC 40 stock index dropping 2% and the euro 0.7%. France’s debt-to-GDP ratio is the EU’s third-highest and almost twice the ceiling permitted under EU rules, as is its projected budget deficit of nearly 6%.Lecornu’s attempted departure compounded a political crisis that has rocked France since Macron dissolved parliament last summer and called legislative elections that ended in a hung parliament divided into three blocs: the left, the far right and Macron’s own centre-right alliance, with no group coming close to a clear majority.A graphic showing the three main blocs in the national assembly and distribution of seats by party or groupThe far-right National Rally (RN) of Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella called on Monday for the president to dissolve parliament again, while the radical left France Unbowed (LFI) reiterated its longstanding call for the president himself to step down.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Bardella said he expected the legislative elections to take place and added: “The RN will obviously be ready to govern.”Bardella, the RN’s president, said: “There cannot be a return to stability without a return to the ballot box. It was very clearly Emmanuel Macron who decided this government himself. He has understood nothing of the political situation we are in.”Mathilde Panot of LFI said: “The countdown has begun. Macron must go.” David Lisnard, of the conservative Les Républicains (LR) party, which has thus far backed Macron as part of the governing alliance, was also among those who called on the president to leave.LR’s vice-president, François-Xavier Bellamy, said the party was not going to offer Macron and his allies “a final lap”. The party’s leader and outgoing interior minister, Bruno Retailleau, was more cautious, saying the ball was now in Macron’s camp and he must speak soon.Pierre Jouvet, the general secretary of the centre-left Socialist party (PS), said after a party meeting that it was“not calling for dissolution or the departure of the head of state, but for a solution”. That could come in the form of the “appointment of a prime minister from the left, open to compromise”, Jouvet said.Macron’s allies and opponents had denounced the new cabinet lineup, with the return of Bruno Le Maire, a Macron ally and former economy minister, to government as defence minister particularly enraging politicians across the spectrum who saw him as the incarnation of Macron’s economic policies.Le Maire said on Monday evening he was leaving the government in an effort to end the crisis. “Under these conditions, I proposed to the president to withdraw from the government without delay,” he said. “The president has accepted my proposal.”Lecornu’s two immediate predecessors,BayrouandMichel Barnier, were ousted over Macron-approved plans for an austerity budget. Pressure on the president to come up with a solution is mounting fast, with a budget for next year needing to be agreed within weeks.Explore more on these topicsFranceEmmanuel MacronEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

        "Content": "16.31 EDTSummaryDelegations from Hamas and Israel have begun indirect talks in Egypton Donald Trump’s proposal for ending the war in Gaza, with the US expected to also join the negotiations. Both sides have endorsed the overall principles behind the plan, under which fighting would cease, hostages go free and aid pour into Gaza.During this first phase of talks, Egyptian and Qatari mediators are working with both sides to prepare ground conditionsfor the release of the remaining 48 Israeli hostages held in Gaza in exchange for 1,700 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails,and to determine the date of a temporary truce. This round of negotiations is expected to be difficult and complex, and could last for several days, according to reports.Trump, whose envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner are expected in Egypt, has urged negotiators to “move fast” to end the warin Gaza, whereIsraeli strikes continued on Monday,killing at least seven Palestinian people, despite the US president’s order to stop.The White House declined to give a time frame for this first phase of talks that are underway, but saidthe Trump administration wanted to move “very quickly”and to get the hostages released as soon as possible. It hoped a quick hostage release wouldcreate momentum for the implementation of the rest of Trump’s proposal, said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.Trump also spoke on a Gaza deal on Monday afternoon, telling an Oval Office gaggle: “We have a really good chance of making a deal, and it’ll be a lasting deal. We want to have peace. This is beyond Gaza. Gaza is a big deal. But this is, this is really peace in the Middle East.”Greta Thunberg and others arrived in Greece after being deported by Israelfor taking part in the Gaza-bound humanitarian aid flotilla. “We are not even seeing the bare minimum from our governments,” she said in strong remarks accusing states of complicity in Israel’s genocide. She said she will “never comprehend” how humans could be so “evil” to starve the people ofGaza. The global flotilla aimed to “step up when our governments failed to do so”, Thunberg added.International activists, journalists and lawyers who were jailed in Israel for being aboard the flotilla,alleged being subjected to brutal physical and verbal abuse by Israeli forces during their detention. “I was beaten from the moment we entered the port until the very end,” said Saverio Tommasi, an Italian journalist. “Blows to my back, blows to my head – and they [the Israeli soldiers] laughed, laughed at all of it. Anyone who failed to keep their eyes down was punished with a hit to the head.” Margaret Pacetta, 71, said her treatment was “vile” and her experience “absolute hell”. She alleged thatIsraeli forces took everything away from her, including her medication, glasses, hearing aids and clothes. Prisoners were given just small amounts of ant-covered cucumber and stale bread to survive on inside the prison, she added. Yasmin Acar, a member of the flotilla’s steering committee, said the detainees were “treated like animals” and “terrorists”. “We were physically assaulted, we were deprived of sleep,” Acar said. Israel’s foreign ministry has dismissed all claims of mistreatment of members of the flotilla as “brazen lies” and has branded the flotilla an offshoot of Hamas.That’s all from us for today, thank you so much for reading. I hope you’ll join us again tomorrow as we continue to provide live coverage of this crucial moment for the region.ShareUpdated at16.54 EDT"

The three issues constitute the first phase of a 20-point plan presentedby the US president, Donald Trump, last week that aims to end the war.Though key points of the plan still need negotiation, Hamas’s acceptance of a hostage release and to relinquish power in the Gaza Strip has galvanised renewed momentum behind peace talks and Egyptian media reported that the first day of discussions ended “amid a positive atmosphere”.Trump on Sunday described the talks as “very successful and proceeding rapidly” and on Monday said Hamas was agreeing to “very important” issues. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said he expected the talks to last just a few days and that he hoped he could announce the release of all Israeli hostages in the coming days.Despite the optimism, large gaps remain between Hamas and Israel. The Trump plan is large in scope but scant on details, and key points of the plan still need to be discussed.The talks on Monday began with a meeting between Arab mediators and the Palestinian delegation after which mediators would then meet with the Israeli delegation. Egyptian and Qatari mediators would then discuss both sets of talks before meeting the US envoy Steve Witkoff, according to Egyptian media.The first topic of discussion is the mechanism of a hostage release, which under the terms of the Trump plan, should happen within 72 hours of a ceasefire. Hamas officials have already warned they will probably need more time to locate the remains of hostages that are buried under rubble.The logistics of how to coordinate a hostage release have yet to be decided, though the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on Monday offered to help transfer prisoners and hostages as an impartial humanitarian actor. It previously facilitated hostage releases during aceasefire in January.Negotiators have to agree which Palestinian prisoners will be released from Israeli jails. The Palestinian delegation is likely to ask for political figures, such as the Palestinian leader Marwan Barghouthi, who are widely popular in the West Bank andGaza. Rightwing members of Netanyahu’s coalition have put pressure on to ensure such popular figures remain behind bars, Israeli media has reported.Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right public security minister, threatened to quit the government if Hamas still existed after the release of hostages, adding another complication to already fragile peace talks.The US has asked Israel to stop bombing Gaza, with the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, saying on Sunday that a cessation in bombing was necessary to facilitate the release of hostages.Despite this, Israel has continued to strike and fire on Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, killing at least 19 people, including two aid seekers, in the last 24 hours, according to the Gaza ministry of health. Israel on Saturday said it was only carrying out defensive strikes in Gaza.The talks have been hailed by Palestinian, Israeli, western and Arab officials, who have urged both sides to reach a lasting truce on the eve of the war’s second anniversary.Egypt’s president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, welcomed the Trump plan on Monday, which he said could lead to “lasting peace.” “A ceasefire, the return of hostages and detainees, the reconstruction of Gaza, and the start of a peaceful political process leading to the establishment and recognition of a Palestinian state mean that we are on the right path toward lasting peace and solid stability,” Sisi said in an address commemorating the anniversary of the6 October 1973 war with Israel.If implemented, Trump’s plan would result in an immediate end to fighting in Gaza, the release of all 48 hostages held by Hamas – 20 of whom are believed to still be alive – the disarmament of the militant group and the handing over of power from Hamas to an international transitional governing body headed by Trump. Israel in return would gradually withdraw to a buffer zone at the edges of the strip, and return nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.The plan would also send a surge of humanitarian aid to Gaza – parts of which are experiencing famine due to an Israeli aid blockade – and reconstruction funds for the demolished strip.If talks manage to succeed in reaching a consensus on the first phase of the Trump plan, they will then have to grapple with more existential issues concerning the long-term future of Gaza, including Hamas’s arms, long-term withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, the makeup of the transitional governing body and a pathway to a Palestinian state.The EU would like to play a role in the transitional governing body in Gaza, the EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, told reporters on Monday. “Yes we feel that Europe has a great role and we should also be onboard with this,” Kallas said, after being asked if the EU desired to be on what Trump called his “board of peace”.Pressure for an end to the war grew in Israel over the weekend as frustration with the government’s handling of ceasefire efforts intensified. Families of Israeli hostages held in Gaza sent a letter to the Nobel prize committee asking it to award the peace prize to Trump for his efforts to end the war. Trump has longed for aNobel peace prize, a fact he has not been shy about.“We strongly urge you to award President Trump the Nobel peace prize because he has vowed he will not rest and will not stop until every last hostage is back home,” the families said in their letter.In Gaza, exhausted residents prayed for an end to the war. Israel’s campaign in Gaza has killed at least 67,160 Palestinians and wounded about 170,000. Israel launched the war after Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostages on 7 October 2023.Israel stands accused ofcommitting genocide in Gaza by a UN commission of inquiry, the world’s leading association of genocide scholars and several human rights organisations. Israel denies the claim and says it has only acted in self-defence.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warIsraelEgyptPalestineUS foreign policyDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Since then, Amazon has paid more than $2.6m in compensation to roughly 950 workers from multiple countries.But two years later, many migrants are still waiting for their recruiting fees to be repaid – and they are not sure if they will ever get financial redress. Thirty-six of the 67 workers interviewed by the Guardian for this story said they had not received payment fromAmazoneven though they paid stiff fees to get placed at jobs at the company’s Saudi operations.“I want to tell Amazon: If you want to return money, give it to us quickly,” said Rameshwar Sharma, a worker from Nepal who said he has yet to receive compensation. “Don’t make fools of us. We’re not begging. We just want justice.”Revealed: Amazon linked to trafficking of workers in Saudi ArabiaRead moreIn a statement, an Amazon spokesperson, Margaret Callahan, said the company had“worked quickly and diligently to identify individuals who should be reimbursed for recruitment fees they paid to secure jobs with third-party vendors, in violation of our Supply Chain Standards”.She added that “we know we aren’t yet done” and that the company “will continue to issue reimbursements as soon as possible”.A labor rights expert at the human rights group Amnesty International, which investigated Amazon’s labor practices in Saudi Arabia, said the logjam in getting payments to workers was unacceptable.“Far too many are still waiting, and every delay prolongs their suffering,” Amnesty International’s Ella Knight said. “For one of the world’s richest companies, the sums involved are a drop in the ocean – yet for workers, timely justice could be life-changing.”Amazon, she said,“should act swiftly to fully uphold its human rights responsibilities – providing meaningful redress to all affected migrant workers”.Some workers interviewed for this story said the problem goes beyond a matter of delays. They say they have been flatly told they do not qualify for payments even though they shelled out high recruiting fees and worked at Amazon’s Saudi operations.Several said they were told they had been denied payment because their time working at Amazon had ended before October 2023. A staffer at Impactt, a non-profit organization that is serving as a go-between for Amazon in the compensation process, left a phone message for one Nepali worker that the payments had been made only to those who had left work at Amazon in October 2023 or later.“Why do dates matter to them?” another Nepali worker, Mitra Lal Sapkota, said. Impactt informed him, he said, that he wouldn’t get a refund of his recruiting fees because his work at Amazon in Saudi Arabia ended in 2022.“What Amazon is doing feels like a pretense,” he said.Amazon did not answer a question about whether October 2023 had served as a cutoff date for payment qualifications. It also did not answer a question about the criteria it was using to determine who gets paid and who doesn’t.Questions about the treatment of workers who toiled at Amazon’s Saudi warehouses gained wide attention through an investigation published on 10 October 2023 by the Guardian, NBC News, theInternational Consortium of Investigative JournalistsandArab Reporters for Investigative Journalism. The media partnersrevealedthat labor firms had required workers seeking jobs at Amazon’s Saudi warehouses to pay between roughly $830 to $2,300 in recruiting fees – payments that violated United States and United Nations standards as well as Amazon’s ownsupply chain standards.After being informed about the media outlets’ investigation and a separate investigation by Amnesty International, Amazon promised to improve its labor practices and refund recruiting fees to laborers who worked at the company’s Saudi operations.Amazon paid out roughly $1.9m to more than 700 workers by February 2024. But since then, the volume of payments has slowed and many workers have been voicing complaints about being left out. Thirty-three of the 44 current and former Amazon contract workers interviewed for a December 2024 Guardianstorysaid they had not yet received reimbursement from the company. Amazon said at the time that “these are complex processes that take time, and we’re doing our best to expedite reimbursement.”Since that follow-up story ran, Amazon has paid roughly 100 workers more than $330,000 in compensation.Migrant laborers interviewed for this story are from Nepal, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Kenya.MD Foisal Mia, a Bangladeshi laborer, said he paid more than $3,500 to a recruiting firm to get contract work at Amazon’s Saudi operations, taking out a loan to cover those costs. He said he had not heard from Amazon or Impactt about any compensation. He wants Amazon to know that a refund of his recruiting fees would make a big difference for him and his family.“My family is poor. It’s difficult for us to run a household,” said Mia, who now works at a vegetable store in Kuwait. “Return my fees. This money is nothing for you, but it’s a life to me.”Sonu Kumar Mandal, a Nepali laborer, went to work at an Amazon warehouse in 2021 in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, after he paid a recruiting firm $2,100 in fees and other costs – a huge sum for him and his family. To cover that cost, he said, he took out a loan from a village moneylender at a steep annual interest rate of 36%.But he couldn’t pay off his loan as his income went towards supporting his financially struggling family.“I have no money to pay the interest now. I don’t have a job,” he said. “If Amazon gives my money back, I would be able to clear my loan.”Several workers who have not received compensation said Amazon could have informed them about the refund process if it genuinely wanted to compensate them.“Amazon has my phone number, my email, my passport, everything,” said Kishor Kumar Chaudhary, another Nepali worker. “If they wanted to contact me, they could do it easily. But why didn’t they contact me?”Pradip Kumar Mahato, another former Amazon worker from Nepal, filled out an online compensation form and sent voice messages to an Impactt staffer in July. In a voice message sent to Mahato, the staffer replied: “I’ll talk about you at a higher level. If any positive response comes, I’ll contact you … Your chance of getting [money] is very slim … We’re trying, but there is no guarantee.”Callahan, the Amazon spokesperson, said the company has implemented robust grievance mechanisms for workers to report concerns. Amazon maintains awebpagewhere individuals, including former workers, can submit complaints in multiple languages regarding concerns about the company’s labor and environmental practices.Explore more on these topicsAmazonSaudi ArabiaWorkers' rightsE-commerceMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

SinceHamas’s partial acceptanceof his plan to end the nearly two-year war in Gaza on Friday, the US, Israel and Hamas have all said they believe aceasefire is within sight.The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said the Egypt talks were “the closest we’ve come to getting all the hostages released” in an interview with ABC on Sunday. He warned that talks could still falter over logistics, however, and that details of the hostage release needed to be worked out.Rubio said there were long-term challenges in implementing the deal, in particular the creation of a technocratic governing body to overseeGazain place of Hamas. He emphasised that the current priority was the hostages’ release and ensuring Israeli troops withdrew to an agreed upon line in Gaza.Trump’s plan would mean Hamas releasing all hostages within 72 hours, surrendering ruling power to a transnational authority headed by the US president, and laying down its arms. In return, Israel would gradually withdraw its troops from Gaza and return more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. The deal would release a surge of humanitarian aid to Gaza, parts of which are in famine, as well as reconstruction funds.On Saturday night, Trump shared a map of Gaza that delineated the initial withdrawal line of Israeli troops in Gaza, which ranged from 1.2 miles (2km) to 4 miles deep within the territory. He said if Hamas agreed to the withdrawal line, a ceasefire would begin immediately.Israeli forces are meant to completely withdraw to a buffer zone at the edge of Gaza under the terms of the plan, although the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said that regardless of any deal, troops would remain in most of Gaza.Optimism about a potential ceasefire has grown across the world, with western and Arab leaders urging Hamas and Israel to come to a deal. On Sunday, the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, called Netanyahu and expressed support for the Trump plan, describing it as “the best chance for peace”, according to a readout.Israeli officials have also said they hope to announce an end to the war in the coming days.A senior Hamas official told Agence France-Presse the group was “very keen to reach an agreement to end the war and immediately begin the prisoner exchange process in accordance with the field conditions”.Trump threatened Hamas with “complete obliteration” if it did not reach a deal on Gaza in an interview with CNN. He also said Netanyahu was onboard for ending the bombing of Gaza.Despite Trump’s request that Israel stop its assault and despite orders for the military to only conduct “defensive operations”, it has continued bombing the Palestinian territory. At least eight people were killed in separate strikes on Gaza City, while four other people were shot dead while seeking aid in the south of the strip.“While certain bombings have actually stopped inside of the Gaza Strip, there’s no ceasefire in place at this point in time,” said Bedrosian.At least 67,139 people have been killed and about 170,000 injured by Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, according to the Gaza ministry of health, which said roughly half of those were women and children. Israel launched the campaign in retaliation after an attack by Hamas-led militants that killed about 1,200 people and involved 251 others being taken hostage.The UN commission of inquiry, several human rights groups and the world’s leading association of genocide scholars have concluded thatIsrael has committed genocide in Gaza. Israel denies the accusation and says it has only acted in self-defence.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warIsraelPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaEgyptUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

She said her request for more medication was not being met while she was being held in a prison environment she described as “dystopian”.McEwen and Lamont are among seven Australians confirmed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Dfat) to have been detained in Israel. Dfat said on Monday it was providing consular assistance to the Australians including through in-person visits.They are being held in a high-security prison in the Negev desert after being arrested as part ofthe pro-Palestinian flotillacarrying aid to Gaza, and allege that they and fellow inmates were offered water that was undrinkable due to a strong chemical taste.2:21How the Israeli navy intercepted the Global Sumud flotilla – videoOn Monday, Israel deported 171 of the activists they detained on the flotilla but it was believed the Australians were not among them.

They were part of the Global Sumud Flotilla of 42 vessels carrying more than 450 people, among them parliamentarians, lawyers and activists – including theSwedish climate campaigner Greta Thunberg– all of whom were arrested.Dfat officials visited the detained Australians on Friday. McEwen told them of “degrading and humiliating treatment” after he was taken to the port of Ashdod, according to a report seen by Guardian Australia.“He said his morale was low due to the degrading and humiliating treatment he had been enduring from Israeli prison guards and soldiers, including sleep deprivation techniques and physical intimidation,” the Dfat report read.His mother, Jacinta McEwen, a former nurse, said she had been calling Dfat for daily updates and was concerned by the “full-on” conditions under which her son was being held.“If he’s got a dislocated shoulder and he’s had a head injury and he hasn’t received any medical aid, I’m worried about that,” she said.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailMcEwen said she believed her son’s deportation was being held up by his refusal to sign a form that would acknowledge that he had entered Israel illegally – the flotilla maintains it was illegally intercepted by the Israeli navy in international waters.McEwen told Dfat officials that Israeli soldiers had torn up pages of his passport in front of him because his passport was microchipped. Both McEwen and Lamont threw their phones into the sea before their capture.While McEwen said his arrest on board the Mia Mia had been executed with minimal force, Lamont – travelling on a different ship – said she had “humiliating” experience.Lamont claimed her hands were zip-tied behind her back, she was sprayed with a water cannon and was left to sit in an unventilated area with her hands tied and clothes soaked for seven hours – a time during which she said her head was repeatedly shoved down by Israeli forces.Both are being held in the Ketziot prison used primarily to detain Palestinian prisoners, many of whom Israel accuses of involvement in militant or terrorist activities.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last month, the Labour government changed the rules so that new guidelines to courts must be signed off by the justice secretary and the lady chief justice.Dominic Grieve, a former attorney general, said: “This is bonkers. Sentences have been rising in recent years and there is no prison capacity left. TheSentencingCouncil has done good work in providing consistency even if it may not be perfect. The [Jenrick] proposal is the cheapest form of politics as he must know it is unimplementable.”Bob Neill, a Conservative former chair of the Commons’ justice select committee , said the policy was “very unwise and potentially dangerous”.Another former Tory minister said: “This a policy that has not been thought through. It fails to understand the role the Sentencing Council performs, and is in response to a proposal that has been withdrawn.“The consequence might be longer sentences but there isn’t the prison space for more prisoners.”The Sentencing Council was set up by Gordon Brown’s government in 2010 to avoid politicising the guidelines and to allow for considered, expert judgment on the appropriate range of sentences.Made up of eight members of the judiciary and six laypeople, they produce guidelines on sentencing, which are not binding but aim to increase the consistency of sentencing within the parameters set down by parliament.Jenrick is expected to tell the conference in Manchester: “The public are sick of voting for tougher sentences and getting the opposite. So in future the justice secretary, accountable to parliament, will be responsible for setting sentencing policy. No longer will an unaccountable quango be able to subvert the will of the British people for criminals to be properly punished.”Jenrick will claim that the council’s guidelines have watered down sentences outlined by parliament for serious crimes.Under the guidelines, domestic burglary carries a sentence range from zero to six years despite parliament allowing a 14-year maximum, he will add.The new policy comes after a public dispute in March between the council and the government over pre-sentence reports for offenders from certain minority groups.The council was forced to back down after issuing guidelines that would have required magistrates and judges to consult a pre-sentence report before deciding whether to imprison someone of an ethnic or religious minority, or a young adult, abuse survivor or pregnant woman.Nazir Afzal, a former chief crown prosecutor in north-westEngland, said: “Judges are bound by legal reasoning, precedent and principles thereby ensuring decisions are rooted in law. Politicians chase headlines while judges try to uphold fairness. If you want to guarantee a two-tier justice system you let politicians determine the sentencing.”Andy Slaughter, the Labour chair of the justice select committee, said: “This is a chaotic, unnecessary and publicity-seeking proposal. The sentencing bill already proposes an override that the lord chancellor and lady chief justice can exercise. We don’t need any further political intervention, and certainly not a wholesale removal of the Sentencing Council.”A Labour spokesperson added: “TheConservativesbacked the proposed changes to pre-sentencing reports when they were announced and did nothing to stop them when they were in government. Labour took action the moment we uncovered their mistake.“This is just another cynical gimmick from Jenrick, a man who constantly undermines the independence of the judiciary just to further his own career.”Explore more on these topicsSentencingRobert JenrickConservativesUK criminal justiceEnglandWalesConservative conferencenewsShareReuse this content"

He said it was “unbelievable” that one in three people in London had been a victim of phone theft – drawing on a fintech survey of 1,000 people, rather than the police-reported figures which suggested that far fewer had been affected.On Monday, the Met promoted its operation against phone theft as part of a drive to step up the targeting of so-called volume crime – such as shoplifting, phone theft and burglary.After an investigation lasting nearly a year, the force said it had taken down a criminal network suspected to have smuggled up to 40,000 stolen phones from the UK to China over the past 12 months – up to 40% of all phones stolen in London.The Met said it believed it had “significantly disrupted” London’s stolen phone market in an operation known as “Echosteep”, which started last December when a box containing about 1,000 iPhones being shipped to Hong Kong was found at a Heathrow warehouse.Specialist detectives who would ordinarily investigate armed robberies and drug smuggling were brought in, leading to the interception of further shipments and the use of forensics to track down suspects. Two men in their 30s, who were arrested last month in north-east London on suspicion of handling stolen goods, were charged and remanded in custody.A further 15 people were arrested in relation to street-level offending such as robberies and pickpocketing.However, the force expressed frustration at phone companies includingApple, whose iPhones account for 80% of stolen phones in London. Apple had the ability to effectively render phone theft a crime of the past, Featherstone said.“We do have a frustration with this. We believe that Apple’s phones have the ability to use certain software and technology which prevents from being recycled,” he said.“The biggest problem is that while a phone would not necessarily be recycled in the UK – the network providers would not allow it – that isn’t the case if it leaves the country.”Featherstone said the Met “knows the technology” is there because Apple have no trouble blocking phones stolen from their stores.The group investigated had specifically targeted Apple products because of their profitability overseas, according to DI Mark Gavin, the senior investigating officer for Operation Echosteep.“We discovered street thieves were being paid up to £300 per handset and uncovered evidence of devices being sold for up to $5,000 in China,” he said.Explore more on these topicsLondonCrimeMetropolitan policeEnglandPoliceSmartphonesApplenewsShareReuse this content"

An investigation is ongoing, and we urge anyone with information to contact us as soon as possible. Any information, no matter how small, may be relevant to the investigation.”A museum spokesperson added: “We are saddened by the events in what was a targeted attack on St Fagans National Museum of History in Cardiff. The objects presumed stolen are examples of bronze age gold jewellery and were on display in the ‘Wales is …’ gallery.“We would like to thank south Wales police for their cooperation in this investigation and their prompt response when they were alerted in the early hours. We are also very grateful to the staff members who were on duty overnight, followed protocol and who were thankfully uninjured during the incident.”The museum stands in the grounds of St Fagans Castle and gardens, a late 16th-century manor house donated to the people of Wales in 1948. More than 50 historic buildings from all over Wales have been recreated at the museum including a Victorian school, a medieval church and a workmen’s institute.Last year a Cardiff pub, the Vulcan Hotel,opened at St Fagansafter being moved brick by brick from its location in the city.Upcoming events include a family day celebrating Somali heritage and Christmas carols in the chapel. A statement on the museum’s website on Monday said it had closed due to storm damage.The St Fagans burglary comes after a haul of antique pocket watches dating from the late 18th century and an early 19th century blunderbuss were stolen from the Royal Albert Memorial Museum and Art Gallery in Exeter.Two suspects are believed to have forced entry into the museum on Queen Street in September and stolen 17 watches and the gun, which is likely to have been used to defend mail coaches.Some of the watches were made by Charles Frodsham, a renowned 19th-century clockmaker.Devon and Cornwall police said the suspects – believed to be men – were dressed in black and riding bicycles, and spoke with Liverpudlian accents.The watches taken ranged in date from 1775-1907. One was made close to Exeter in Tiverton, while others, including a musical repeating watch, came from as far afield as Switzerland.Three were by London-based Charles Frodsham & Co. By the mid-1850s Frodsham had established himself as one of the period’s most eminent horologists – maker of clocks and watches – renowned for producing high-quality precision timekeeping instruments. One has a lunar disc that shows phases of the moon with a calendar on the reverse.Explore more on these topicsMuseumsCardiffWalesHeritagenewsShareReuse this content"

The 47-year-old 2003 World Cup winner admitted he was having trouble accepting what his diagnosis means for the future but that he intends to stay positive.Among the most decorated forwards to play for England, he earned 71 caps and led his country at the 2011 World Cup in New Zealand, earning the nickname “Mad Dog” as an all-action, hard-hitting flanker.There are good guys and then there is Lewis Moody – MND has cruelly singled out the bravest of men | Robert KitsonRead moreSince revealing his diagnosis, tributes have poured in from a host of teammates, the Rugby Football Union and the British & Irish Lions. His former Leicester teammates Geordan Murphy and Leon Lloyd have set up aGoFundMe pagefor Moody’s family and associated causes. By lunchtime on Monday, more than £30,000 had been donated.Moody is the latest high-profile rugby player to be diagnosed with the terminal disease.The former Scotland and Lions forward Doddie Weir,the England rugby league player Rob Burrowandthe South Africa scrum-half Joost van der Westhuizenhave all died as a result of MND in the last decade.“This has been incredibly hard to process and a huge shock to me and my family,” Moody said in a statement. “I feel fit and well in myself and I’m focused on staying positive, living life and dealing with the changes I will experience as they come.”In an interview with the BBC, with his wife Annie alongside him, Moody explained that his symptoms are currently “very minor”, revealing some muscle wasting in the hand and shoulder but saying: “I’m still capable of doing anything and everything. And hopefully that will continue for as long as is possible.”An emotional Moody added: “There’s something about looking the future in the face and not wanting to really process that at the minute. It’s not that I don’t understand where it’s going. We understand that. But there is absolutely a reluctance to look the future in the face for now.“I don’t want to get stuck in the negativity or doom and gloom. We know the reality, I want to stay positive, I want to stay in the moment, I want to learn and understand what it is, speak to more people and see where we can help.”MND can prove fatal within 12 to 18 months of diagnosis, with people in Britain believed to have a one in 300 risk of developing the neurological condition. About one in five cases are believed to be related to genetics and it was announced last year that relatives of people with the condition were to beoffered genetic testingthat would tell them if they were also likely to develop it.View image in fullscreenLewis Moody in action for England against New Zealand in 2006.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianWhile a number of studies have suggested that professional rugby players are more likely to develop MND, at present there is no link proving causation. Rugby – and in particular Kevin Sinfield, the friend and former Leeds Rhinos teammate of Burrow – has been instrumental in terms of fundraising to promote research into finding a cure.Sinfield, currently a coach with the England rugby union team, said: “I’m obviously very saddened by the news. I’d like to wish Lewis, and all his family and friends, the very best. I’ll support in any way I can. We have to keep fighting MND together.” Ed Slater, the former Gloucester and fellow Leicester player who has been diagnosed with the disease,posted on Xthat he was “absolutely devastated” for Moody and his family. “We will be here for you as and when you need.”Everyone wants answers for former rugby players like Lewis Moody but they are hard to come by | Andy BullRead moreMoody spent 14 years at Leicester and was a huge part of the club’s golden era, helping the Tigers to seven Premiership titles and two European cups. With England, he was part of the 2003 squad who won the World Cup in Australia, and won the lineout that led to Jonny Wilkinson’s drop goal to seal England’s success in the final. In 2004 he was awarded an MBE for services to rugby.“We are all deeply saddened and distressed to learn that Lewis Moody has been diagnosed with motor neurone disease,” said the Rugby Football Union chief executive, Bill Sweeney. “Lewis represented England, the British & Irish Lions and his clubs Leicester Tigers and Bath with both brilliance and distinction – one of the toughest and most fearless players ever to don a back-row shirt in the game, earning the respect and admiration of teammates, opponents and supporters alike all over the world. His contribution to rugby, both on and off the field, reflects the very best of our sport’s values.”Since his retirement Moody has led an active lifestyle and participated in a number of ultra-endurance challenges. In 2014 he set up the Lewis Moody Foundation to support those affected by brain tumours and said he intends to keep raising money for his charity as well as those associated with MND. Revealing he received his diagnosis two weeks ago, Moody said that had undergone physiotherapy after noticing weakness in his shoulder while in the gym. A series of scans then showed nerves in his brain and spinal cord had been damaged. Moody said that telling his sons, 17-year-old Dylan – a goalkeeper for Southampton – and Ethan, 15, was “heartbreaking”.Moody burst on to the scene at Leicester and in 1996 he became the club’s youngest ever player in a league match. He went on to make 223 appearances for the club before joining Bath for two years in 2010. The Leicester chief executive, Andrea Pinchen, said: “The figures, trophies and awards tell you what an incredible player Lewis was, but that is only half the story. As an individual, his commitment to his club along with his warmth and passion shone through, which endeared him to teammates, staff and supporters alike.”Moody suffered a number of head injuries throughout his career and in retirement he has been a staunch advocate of concussion research and improved regulations around player welfare. He did not jointhe class action lawsuit, which includes former teammates such as the World Cup winning hooker Steve Thompson,who has been diagnosed with early onset dementia, however. Thompson and more than a hundred others are suing the RFU, the Welsh Rugby Union and World Rugby but Moody has said that he has no regrets over his playing career.Explore more on these topicsLewis MoodyRugby unionEngland rugby union teamNeuroscienceMotor neurone diseaseRugby World Cup 2003HealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Paramount is also behindParamount Picturesand US cable channels including MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon.Before the merger, Paramountagreedto payDonald Trump$16m to settle a lawsuit over a 60 Minutes segment that aired during the 2024 presidential election. Shortly after, CBS announced it wascancellingThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert, which frequently criticizes Trump and his administration.As editor-in-chief of CBS News, Weiss will report directly to David Ellison, now the chief executive of Paramount Skydance. Tom Cibrowski, a well-liked industry veteran, will remain president of CBS News.In a memo to CBS employees on Monday, Ellison hailed the Free Press as “one of the most dynamic news organizations in the country. Weiss would bring “a passion for reaching broad audiences through rigorous, fact-based reporting and a relentless commitment to amplifying voices from all corners of the spectrum” to the network, he said.“This, combined with her restless desire to build, believe and innovate, makes her a perfect fit for our storied news division,” added Ellison.The publication – which is published on Substack – has 1.5 million readers, including nearly 170,000 who pay, according to Paramount.“My goal in the coming days and weeks is to get to know you,” Weiss wrote to CBS News staffers on Monday. “I want to hear from you about what’s working, what isn’t, and your thoughts on how we can make CBS News the most trusted news organization in America and the world.“I’ll approach it the way any reporter would – with an open mind, a fresh notebook, and an urgent deadline.”Weiss listed a series of “core journalistic values” that she planned to champion as editor-in-chief, including journalism that “reports on the world as it actually is”; “explains things clearly, without pretension or jargon”; and “embraces a wide spectrum of views and voices so that the audience can contend with the best arguments on all sides of a debate”.Since its founding, the Free Press hasgrowninto a company with more than 50 employees, and offices in New York and Los Angeles, producing podcasts and newsletters that cover politics and the media.“We publish investigative stories and provocative commentary about the world as it actually is – with the quality once expected from the legacy press, but the fearlessness of the new,” reads thedescriptionof the publication on its website.The publication is known for criticizing the left and right and has been a home for staunch support of Israel.Weiss’s politics arehard to categorize. In past interviews, she has described herself as a “radical centrist”, “politically independent” and a “classical liberal”.But her appointment is seen by some CBS News journalists as proof that the new owners are taking it in a more conservative – or at least a more opinionated – direction, despite claims by Ellison that he has no desire to “politicize” the vaunted network.The decision to spend a reported $150m to purchase the site, at a time when the network is readying for a massive round of layoffs, has also struck some CBS News employees as hard to swallow.The announcement follows the network’s selection of a major Trump campaign donor, Kenneth R Weinstein, as ombudsman, an appointment that was viewed as a prerequisite for the Federal Communications Commission – and its pro-Trump chair, Brendan Carr – to grantapprovalof Paramount’s merger with Skydance Media.By now, CBS News employees are used to change at the top. The network has churned through several presidents and newsroom managers over the past few years, though it has remained in third place in viewers for the network’s flagship morning and evening news shows.“How many people have led us in just the last five years?” one CBS News employee asked. “Throwing America’s best big tech apologist at the problem isn’t going to fix the ratings.”Catherine Herridge, a former senior investigative correspondent at CBS News, is more optimistic about Weiss’s chances. “Bari has a proven track record and the experience to take CBS News into the future,” she said. “She already has the support of David Ellison, which will make all the difference.“There is no question Bari will have to win over the CBS rank and file, which I believe she is more than capable of doing.”Weiss is not the first television industry newbie to take on a significant role, though networks have generally hired traditional journalists, rather than commentators, as executives. Rebecca Blumenstein, who serves as the president of editorial for NBC News, came directly from the New York Times. And the journalist and historian Walter Isaacson served as chief executive of CNN in the early 2000s after a lengthy career in magazines.Disgruntled NYT journalist to ‘anti-woke’ power grab: how far can Bari Weiss go?Read more“I think how she does at CBS depends on how they define the role and what areas she chooses to focus on,” said one veteran television executive, who suggested that the network’s flagship Sunday shows – CBS News Sunday Morning and 60 Minutes – should largely be left alone. “If they’re smart and if Bari is smart, she will not try to be a bull in a china shop. The other challenge for her is going to be being a manager, which is not easy anywhere, but it can be particular difficult at CBS News.”It was the Free Press that set off a firestorm inside CBS News when itbroke the newsin early October 2024 that two network leaders had criticized the way that morning show host Tony Dokoupil handled an interview with author Ta-Nehisi Coates. Those leaders, Wendy McMahon and Adrienne Roark, drew pushback from Paramount’s controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, and havesince leftthe company.Now, nearly a year later, it will be Weiss who will be more or less in charge.Explore more on these topicsCBSParamount PicturesUS television industryTelevision industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Prices have soared yet pay remains stagnant. High mortgage rates have made buying a home a dismal prospect. The unemployment rate has been creeping up.Most people haveindicatedthey are delaying major life decisions, including having kids or switching jobs, because of the instability. But for a very small group of people, the last five years couldn’t have been any better.The wealth of the world’s billionaires grew 54% in 2020, at the height of the pandemic. And even amid all the economic instability, the stock market has only continued to grow. This growth has largely benefited just a small number of Americans: 10% of the populationowns93% of stock market wealth.As uneven as this distribution seems, it’s the system working as it is currently designed.Americans putting life on hold amid economic anxiety under Trump, poll showsRead moreIn his new book Burned by Billionaires, inequality researcher Chuck Collins argues that the system that perpetuates wealth inequality is purposely opaque to most Americans.“[The wealthy] have bought their jets, they’ve bought their multiple houses and mansions, but now they’re buying senators and media outlets,” Collins told the Guardian in an interview. “We’re now entering this other chapter of hyper-extraction where the wealthy are preying on the system of inequality.”Collins, a director at the Institute for Policy Studies, is no stranger to wealth. A great-grandson to Oscar F Mayer, the founder of the meat processing brand, he is a member of the Patriotic Millionaires, a non-partisan group of wealthy Americans who advocate for higher taxes for the rich and higher wages.To help others understand what exactly it means to be “wealthy” in the US, Collins borrows a concept from journalist Robert Frank who, in a 2007 book on the rich, imagined the different levels of wealth as “Richistan” villages: Affluent Town, Lower Richistan, Middle Richistan, Upper Richistan and Billionaireville.To modernize the concept, Collins categorizes these “wealth villages” based on income levels. At the lowest tier, Affluent Town, are the 10 million Americans who have a household income of at least $110,000 and an overall wealth of over $1.5m. The villages get more exclusive as wealth goes up: Lower Richistan has 2.6 million households who have wealth between $6m and $13m; Middle Richistan has 1.3 million households who have assets worth an average of $37m; while Upper Richistan, made up of 130,000 Americans (roughly the size of a small city) has between $60m to $1bn in wealth.Altogether, the residents of these villages make up the top 10% of the wealth income distribution, about 14 million Americans altogether, though their experiences vary dramatically.“You could be in Lower Richistan, and you’re still sitting in the coach section of a commercial plane,” Collins said. “Whereas in Upper Richistan, you’re flying in a private jet. That’s a really different cultural experience. You fly private, you have no stakes in the commercial aviation system. You don’t care if the whole system shuts down – you’re set.”The highest hill in “Richistan” is Billionaireville, which is made up of about 800 American billionaires who are some of the world’s wealthiest. The power that this group has far surpasses those who are simply affluent, let alone the average American who doesn’t reside in “Richistan” at all.But Collins thinks the progressive slogan “billionaires shouldn’t exist” or “abolish billionaires” misses the point and has a “whiff of exterminism” to it.“It’s the distinction between individual behaviors and a system of rules and policies,” Collins said. “We should be concerned about an economic system that funnels so much wealth upward to the billionaires.”In other words, it’s not about the billionaires themselves, but about the system that allows them to have an enormous amount of influence and control over society today.To understand how wealth at the billionaire level works, Collins breaks it down into four parts: getting the wealth, defending the wealth, political capture and hyper-extraction.When many Americans think about wealth, they usually think solely about the first step, Collins said. People can create a modest amount of wealth through starting or running a successful business, which could get them residency in Affluent Town.But getting to Billionaireville requires serious investment and strategy in those next three steps. Collins describes what he calls the “wealth defense industry”: the tax layers, accountants and wealth managers who use their expertise to ensure that the super rich are being strategic about their taxes.“Wealth defense professionals use a wide variety of tools such as trusts, offshore bank accounts, anonymous shell companies, charitable foundations and other vehicles to hold assets,” he writes.To further a wealth defense strategy, a family needs political support. Wealth of over $40m translates to political power, Collins says, and can be used to defend wealth and protect its accumulation. He notes that the 2010 landmark supreme court decisionCitizens United v Federal Election Commissionallowed the wealthy to pump a seemingly unlimited amount of money into elections, which has dramatically increased the power the ultra-wealthy have on politics.The last stage is a different kind of wealth accumulation, one that Collins calls “hyper extraction”, to describe how the wealthy have come to touch nearly every single part of an Americans’ everyday life largely through private equity, which allows wealthy individuals to invest in private companies.“Private equity is looking for those corners of the economy where they can squeeze things a little bit harder,” Collins said. “One thing I don’t think people understand is these billionaire private-equity funds are what happens when so much wealth is parked in so few hands, and they can kind of turn around and say, ‘Where else can we squeeze money out of the economy?’ Healthcare? Great. Mobile home parks? These people can’t go anywhere, [so] you can raise their rents.”Collins writes about the Mars family, best known for their dominance in the confectionary market, with M&Ms, Snickers and Skittles, but who have alsocornered the pet industry. Along with being the biggest owner of pet care products in the US, the Mars family owns more than 2,500 pet care facilities across the US.The effects of this inequality go beyond the wealth getting wealthier. It’s about people paying more for their healthcare, rent and vet bills without seeing any meaningful wage increases. And Collins said the pain and frustration of this kind of society can lead to deep discontent.“The most powerful oligarchs understand people are being left behind [and] are economically suffering,” Collins said, adding that Republicans have been good at tapping into a potent “phony populism”.“They can basically project this message that actually, Democrats are elitists. They just care about rich Hollywood executives and woke politics, and the people who care about you are over here. They’re the Donald Trumps of the world. They hear your pain, they feel your pain,” he said.The irony, Collins points out in his book, is that Trump has appointed a string of billionaires to his cabinet. Along withElon Musk, who had abrief but powerful roleas head of the so-called “department of government efficiency”, which oversaw massive cuts to the federal workforce, Trump’s secretaries for commerce, treasury, education and the interior are also all billionaires.His cabinet, along with help from Republicans in Congress, helped him pass his hugetax bill, which will make permanent tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations.While Republican continue to argue that immigration and bad trade agreements are the source of everyone’s economic problems, “the question becomes: Will the Democratic party, which has also been captured by the billionaires and big money, be able to meaningfully address the underlying harms?” Collins said.Democrats, he argues, know what policies are needed to “reverse the updraft of wealth”, including deep changes to the tax system, increasing the minimum wage and strengthening unions.Collins recalled four years ago, when the Democrats were in control of the White House and both chambers of Congress. The Democratsintroducedthe $4.3bn Build Back Better bill, which would have seen deep investments in the climate crisis, Medicaid, housing and childcare, among other things. The bill was going to be partially funded through changes in the tax system, including higher taxes on the ultra-wealthy and closing out tax loopholes.US ‘flying blind’ at critical moment for economy, experts warn, with no jobs data amid shutdownRead moreBut while the bill passed the House in November 2021, it ultimately died in the Senate because two centrist Democrats, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, blocked it. Both Manchin and Sinema have since both left their Senate seats.“It was so, so close, and the bill really did reflect the will of the majority of people who really want lawmakers to solve some of these urgent problems,” Collins said. “Oligarchic power is not about creating so much as blocking. It’s easier to block than it is to make something meaningful happen, but the muscle memory is there. We know what that looks like.”Collins is optimistic that there can be change, but said it would require sustained political momentum.“It may be before we know it that the pendulum swings back, and then it really is about maintaining a sustained really popular movement to make progress on this extreme inequality we’re living in,” he said. “We can fix this. It is fixable.”Explore more on these topicsThe super-richUS politicsUS economyTrump administrationDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Shares of AMD surged more than 30% and added about $80bn to its market capitalization after the announcement.“We view this deal as certainly transformative, not just for AMD, but for the dynamics of the industry,” said Forrest Norrod, AMD’s executive vice-president.The latest deal, among a string of investment commitments, is a testament to OpenAI and the broader AI industry’s voracious appetite for computing power as companies race toward developing AI technology that meets or exceeds human intelligence.Sam Altman, the OpenAI CEO, has said the biggest constraint on his company’s growth is access to computing power, which comes in the form of enormous datacenters filled with advanced semiconductor chips. Last week, Nvidia announced it would invest $100bn in OpenAI, forging a close alliance between two of the leading firms in artificial intelligence.Nvidia to invest $100bn in OpenAI, bringing the two AI firms togetherRead moreMonday’s agreement covers the deployment of hundreds of thousands of AMD’s AI chips, or graphics processing units (GPUs), equivalent to six gigawatts, over several years beginning in the second half of 2026. This is roughly equivalent to the energy needs of 5m US households, or the electricity produced yearly by the Hoover Dam three times over. AMD saidOpenAIwould build a one-gigawatt facility based on its forthcoming MI450 series of chips beginning next year.As part of the arrangement, AMD issued a warrant that gives OpenAI the ability to buy up to 160m shares of AMD for 1 cent each over the course of the chips deal.AMD executives expect the deal to net tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue. Because of the ripple effect of the agreement, AMD said it expected to receive more than $100bn in new revenue over four years from OpenAI and other customers.“Other people are going to come along with it because this is really the pioneer, a pioneer in the industry that has a lot of influence over the broader ecosystem,” Mat Hein, AMD’s strategy chief said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On 11 September, Bolsonaro was convicted and sentenced to 27 years in prison by the supreme court.‘Classic tinpot dictator’: Trump exports his assault on democracy to BrazilRead moreA fortnight later, Trump appeared to extend an olive branch to Lula at the UN general assembly in New York. “He seemed like a very nice man, actually,” Trump said of his leftwing counterpart after a brief backstage encounter during which the US president claimed there had been “excellent chemistry”.On Monday, Trump and Lula held their first extended conversation since the former returned to the White House in January. “It was positive,” Brazil’s finance minister, Fernando Haddad, who also took part in the half-hour call, told reporters after.In a statement, Brazil’s presidency said Trump and Lula had “recalled the good chemistry felt in New York” and “exchanged phone numbers to establish a direct channel of communication”.Writing on his Truth Social platform, Trump celebrated “a very good” exchange, adding: “I enjoyed the call – Our Countries will do very well together!”Lula called the conversation “an opportunity to restore the friendly 201-year relationship between the west’s two biggest democracies” and asked for US tariffs and sanctions against Brazilian officials to be scrapped.Lula also said he hoped to meet Trump in person, possibly at a summit in Malaysia later this month, or by travelling to the US. He reiterated his invitation for the US president to attend November’s Cop30 climate summit in the Amazon city of Belém.Trump said: “We discussed many things, but it was mostly focused on the Economy, and Trade, between our two Countries. We will be having further discussions, and will get together in the not too distant future, both in Brazil and the United States.”Matias Spektor, an international relations professor at Brazil’s Getúlio Vargas Foundation, said it was too early to declare the rift between Brasília and Washington over: “All we know is that Trump is willing to talk and that Lula is willing to talk as well.”It was unclear whether Trump raised Bolsonaro’s plight during the call – but even if he did, Spektor said there was nothing Lula could offer the US president with regards to that. “Lula simply cannot deliver any changes in the way the supreme court treats Bolsonaro … even if he wanted to.”However, Spektor believed one possible area where Brazil could help Trump wasHaiti. Last week the UN security council approved US-backed plans for a thousands-strong “Gang Suppression Force” to tackle the crisis in the Caribbean country.In 2004, during Lula’s first presidential term, Brazil began sending thousands of troops to Haiti to lead the UN stabilisation mission there, which lasted until 2017. Just over two decades later, Spektor wondered whether Brazilian boots might again be seen on the ground in Port-au-Prince.“I may well be very wrong … It could be the case that nobody in the [Lula] administration wants to burn their fingers with this,” Spektor said.“[But] Haiti is one instance in which the demand coming from the White House could be met by Brazil – and it’s something Brazil has done in the past and … that Lula could present as Brazil’s contribution to world order, stability and peace at a time at which things are so messy.“And if this is an area where Lula can do something that Trump will appreciate, this is where you have a bridge between Trump and Lula … The stars could align.”Explore more on these topicsBrazilTrump tariffsHaitiDonald TrumpAmericasLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvaUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

It said that it now expects to make a larger loss than the £110m loss that was the lower end of its profit forecasts.The carmaker hit out at the UK government, telling investors that while it was engaged with officials from both sides of the Atlantic, it had had “positive dialogue” directly with the US administration but sought “more proactive support” from British ministers.Jaguar Land Rover parts makers asked by banks to put up homes as loan security after hackRead moreIt urged UK officials “to protect the interests of small-volume manufacturers, like Aston Martin, who provide thousands of jobs, making an important contribution to local economies and to the wider UK automotive supply chain”.Trump has disrupted the global economy with a trade war this year, causing a shake-up in the car industry with his imposition of a 25% tariff on 3 April on top of an existing 2.5% levy.In May the US president and Keir Starmer agreed a deal to limit tariffs on 100,000 British-made cars a year to 10%. That rate came into force on 30 June, the final day of Aston Martin’s second financial quarter.However, Aston Martin criticised the trade deal, arguing “the introduction of a US tariff quota mechanism adds a further degree of complexity and limits the group’s ability to accurately forecast for this financial year end and, potentially, quarterly from 2026 onwards.”The carmaker also blamed weaker demand partly on “the increased potential for supply chain pressures, particularly following the recent cyber incident at a major UK automotive manufacturer”.The British car industry has been rattled this year by acyber-attack on Jaguar Land Rover, the biggest automotive employer in the country, which prompted it to freeze its production.Shares in Aston Martin, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, fell by more than 11% as trading opened on Monday morning before recovering some ground to be down 7%.The group delivered 1,430 cars in its third quarter of the year, missing previous guidance of being “broadly similar” to the 1,641 vehicles in the equivalent period last year.The wobble in demand comes as Aston Martin prepares to launch its $1m (£743,000) Valhalla, a mid-engine hypercar that it hopes will drive up profits. It expects to start deliveries of the car in the final quarter of its financial year, although it said a forecast of about 150 deliveries in those three months was behind previous expectations, which reflected engineering delays.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We remain the only country to have a tariff rate as low as 10% for cars, protecting thousands of jobs in the sector.“We are working with industry so that they can take advantage of the quota effectively and fairly while ensuring the UK remains a top destination for investment in automotive manufacturing through our plan for change.”Separate figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, a lobby group, showed the market for new cars in the UK grew by 13.7% to reach 312,891 vehicles last month, the best September performance since 2020.It was thebest month to date for battery electric vehicles, with 72,779 registrations in September, accounting for 23.3% of the market.

Which one is letting its fans down the most?Melissa JacobsMon 6 Oct 2025 03.15 EDTLast modified on Mon 6 Oct 2025 10.56 EDTShareWe’re past the quarter mark of theNFLseason, which means we have a good idea of the trajectory of most teams. So let’s celebrate the teams whose good vibes have evaporated after Week 5. Note that these aren’t necessarily the worst teams in the league (the Titans and Browns, for example, are terrible but are largely playing as expected) as much as the ones who have been most disappointing.New York Jets (0-5)The only winless team in the league, the Jets check all the misery boxes. There have been devastating losses, starting with Chris Boswell nailing a 60-yard game-winner for the Steelers in Week 1. And there have been blowouts like Sunday’s 37-22 defeat to the Cowboys, which was not nearly as close as the score suggests. The Jets’ supposed strength, their defense, became the first 0-5 unit with zero takeaways in NFL history. The Jets continue to shoot themselves in the foot with penalties, turnovers, poor offensive line play, lack of fourth-down execution and uninspired coaching. Somehow, they are getting worse by the week. If that wasn’t enough this has been going on for years: their playoff drought of 14 seasons is the longest in the NFL. And with one of the worstowners in the league, it could continue for years to come.Misery rating: 9/10 – How long is Aaron Glenn’s leash?Baltimore Ravens (1-4)Sure, it’s easy to chalk up Baltimore’s loss to Houston on Sunday to Lamar Jackson’s absence. But 44-10 – the worst home loss in team history – is embarrassing and even a talent like Jackson isn’t going to tip the scales if his defense, which in fairness has been blighted by injury, is godawful. Even worse, the Ravens defense hardly put up a fight against the Texans. It was a field day for CJ Stroud, Nick Chubb, and company.Still, Jacksonwill probably return in the next few weeks, they play in a relatively weak division and their remaining schedule is soft, so all hope is not lost. But given how sloppy the Ravens have performed with or without Jackson, the hope-o-meter close to empty.Misery rating: 6/10 - The Steelers probably won’t run away with the division.Cincinnati Bengals (2-3)This one boils down to one moment: Joe Burrow’s season-ending injury in Week 2. Three weeks without Burrow has resulted in three losses. It’s almost painful to watch two of the league’s best receivers, Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins, doing their thing with nothing to show for it. Chase hauled in two huge touchdowns and 110 yards on Sunday in a 37-24 defeat to one of the league’s best teams, the Detroit Lions. But Cincinnati’s offense did most of the damage once the result was beyond doubt. Meanwhile, Burrow’s backup, Jake Browning, while impressive in the fourth quarter against the Lions, has mostly been a disaster. His three interceptions on Sunday doomed the Bengals.No franchise in football hinges on the health of one player like the Bengals do with Burrow. Optimistic fans will point to the fact that they will be a playoff contender when Burrow returns next season, if he can stay fit. But only five weeks into this season, the campaign looks all but over for Cincinnati.Misery rating: 6/10 – Once again, Bengals fans are left to wonder at what could have been.Las Vegas Raiders (1-4)Free Maxx Crosby, who remains one of the only bright spots in a weird new era of Raiders misery. Sunday’s 40-6 blowout loss to the Indianapolis Colts was another demonstration of the disastrous pairing of Geno Smith and Pete Carroll in the desert. Smith has been a turnover machine, leading the league this season with nine interceptions. His two picks in Week 5 resulted in Indianapolis touchdowns. We’re not sure what Plan B is, but Plan A – being all in on Smith – is a very painful watch.Misery rating: 7/10 – OC Chip Kelly needs to change course ASAP.Wildcard alert! Philadelphia Eagles (4-1)Yes, they’re the reigning Super Bowl champions. And yes, they have lost just twice in 22 games. But between AJ Brown and DeVonta Smithbeing disgruntledwith their roles, fan complaints about their sluggish offense and the city’s continued skepticism about head coach Nick Sirianni, you’d think the Eagles were 0-5. Yes, Sunday’s collapse was concerning: the Eagles blew a 14-point lead to Denver in the fourth quarter thanks to five penalties, an offense that faded horribly, and a Vic Fangio defense that was pummeled and outsmarted by Sean Payton. Crazier things have happened. Still, they were on the endof some controversial callsand are tied for the best record in their conference. Where are the smiles?Misery rating: 3/10 - The vibes may be off but the Eagles will reach the postseason again.Honorable mention: Arizona Cardinals (2-3)The Cardinals are mediocre rather than miserable, but their embarrassing 22-21 loss to the previously winless Titans was incompetent.A goalline fumble from Emari Demercado, who celebrated a 72-yard would be touchdown too soon, followed by a fumbled Cardinals interception that ended in a Titans touchdown did Arizona in. You couldn’t concoct this loss if you tried. Given that this, and their previous two losses, were on game-winning field goals, there can’t be much joy in Glendale these days. “I don’t really know what to think about that,” Kyler Murray said after the game. “I don’t even know. I really don’t even know. That’s ‘How to Lose a Game 101.’ I don’t know. It was crazy.”Misery rating: 3/10 – Is Kyler Murray still the future?View image in fullscreenRico Dowdle went close to setting a franchise record on Sunday.Photograph: Jason Walle/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockMVP of the weekRico Dowdle, running back, Carolina Panthers. Dowdle, filling in for the injured Chuba Hubbard, could do with a little more confidence. He told teammates this week he would rush for 180 yards against Miami. Instead, he rushed for 206 yards on 23 carries, tying him for the second-highest rushing total in franchise history. Bruising runs of 53 and 43 yards from Dowdle in the second half fueled Carolina’s 27-24 comeback win over Miami. Dowdle isnow chomping at the bitto face his former team, the Dallas Cowboys, next week. “They got to buckle up. I think they know,” he told reporters.Video of the weekThis was called roughing the passer in the Giants-Saints game.I'm not joking. Awfulpic.twitter.com/yeYvU9R4ed— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate)October 5, 2025Another week, another flurry of controversial calls. Yet this penalty on Saints defensive end Carl Granderson may take the cake for the worst roughing the passer call in NFL history. Roughing the passer has been often discussed since it was retooled in 2018 to protect quarterbacks more fully. Some fouls are legitimate acts of targeting, but defenders are sometimes flagged for simply landing on the quarterback, unable to alter their momentum. This play from Granderson on Giants quarterback Jaxson Dart didn’t even go that far. The errant call did not impact the outcome as the Saints topped the Giants 26-14, but not calling this a clean sack is ridiculous.View image in fullscreenDaniel Jones has been rejuvenated with the Colts.Photograph: Michael Conroy/APStat of the weekFour.That’s the number of wins Daniel Jones has this year with the Colts, the same number he had in his last two years combined with the New York Giants.Indiana Jones, the artist formerly known as Danny Dimes, continues to be one of the great stories of the young season. Through five games, Jones has thrown for 1,290 yards and six touchdowns and has rushed for three more. The Colts offense dominated the Raiders as Jones led a balanced attack en route to a 40-6 rout. It helps to have Jonathan Taylor and a solid offensive line but this is a very different Jones. He’s playing with confidence, his decision-making is sound, and he’staking chances in tight windows. Jones, along with Mac Jones and Sam Darnold, are proof that before we label someone a bust, let’s consider their fit.Elsewhere around the leagueView image in fullscreenDrake Maye and Josh Allen’s on-field rivalry looks like it has just started.Photograph: Gene J Puskar/AP-- The Patriots may have a legitimate quarterback on their hands. Drake Maye led New England against the (then) unbeaten Buffalo Bills on Sunday night and came away with a victory. He was particularly impressive in the final minutes, with the score tied at 20-20 and the Patriots driving for victory.One throw was reminiscent of Patrick Mahomes, as Maye fended off the 320lbs DaQuan Jones and completed a pass as he fell to the turf to Stefon Diggs, who finished with 146 receiving yards on his return to Buffalo. Moments later the Patriots had booted the game-winning field goal and Maye had the finest victory of his professional career. There should be many more to come.Drake Maye what a play!NEvsBUF on NBCStream on@NFLPlus+ Peacockpic.twitter.com/X8fN1vpbqG— NFL (@NFL)October 6, 2025-- Yes, Sunday’s win was over the 0-5 Jets, but Dak Prescott’s MVP bid is real. Over the past two games, without CeeDee Lamb and behind an offensive line filled with backups, Prescott has thrown for 556 yards, seven touchdowns and zero interceptions. Prescott was asked whether he heard M-V-P chants after Dallas’s 37-22 win over New York: “I mean, my ears work,” Prescott said, “so I heard it, but I didn’t hear it. It’s Week 5. I don’t care.”-- It was a triumphant return from injury for Jayden Daniels who did enough to spark the Commanders to an impressive 27-10 road win over the Chargers. Daniels, playing with a knee brace, finished 15-for-26 with 231 yards and touchdown. He added 39 rushing yards on eight carries. The Commanders sacked had five sacks on Justin Herbert, whose offensive line did little to protect him. The Chargers also made some costly mistakes: fumbling when they had a 10-0 lead and looked to be driving for another score, and having a punt return touchdowncalled back for roughing the kicker.-- This week’s How Is This Still Happening Award goes to Cardinals running back Emari Demercado. The mistake proved crucial as the Cardinals lost to the Titans 22-21.AGAIN.#CardinalsRB Emari Demercado just had a 76-yard TD — but he let go of the ball before crossing the goal line, and it’s a touchback.HOW DOES THIS KEEP HAPPENING?!pic.twitter.com/EstLI9R4jW— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate)October 5, 2025-- Tua Tagovailoa had a nice statistical game against Carolina, throwing for 256 yards and three touchdowns, But it’s hard to win football games when you’re beingsacked by your owncenter … not to mention allowing Carolina to erase a 17-point deficit. Yikes.-- It was a fascinating day from Vikings Jordan Addison. Kevin O’Connell benched the wide receiver for the first quarter of Minnesota’s matchup against Cleveland in London for missing the team walkthrough. A couple of hours later it was Addison who hauled in Carson Wentz’s game-winning touchdown pass with 25 seconds left. After the 21-17 win, fellow Vikings receiver Justin Jefferson said he “had words”with Addison and vowed to make sure his teammate’s “head is on straight.”-- The 49ers moved to 4-1 after an upset win 26-23 win over the Rams on Thursday, a testament to Kyle Shanahan’s coaching, given the team’s slew of injuries. Without Nick Bosa, Brock Purdy, George Kittle and so many others, the stagecoach turning into a pumpkin feels right around the corner. But a fairytale season is a real possibility as the rest of the 49ers’ schedule is packed with teams currently under .500.Explore more on these topicsNFLNew York JetsLas Vegas RaidersCincinnati BengalsBaltimore RavensPhiladelphia EaglesArizona CardinalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Those charges were for battery with injury, public intoxication and unlawful entry of a vehicle during the incident early on Saturday morning that left Sanchez, who has worked as a Fox Sports analyst since his retirement from playing, hospitalized with stab wounds.Former NFL star Mark Sanchez charged with battery after being stabbed by 69-year-oldRead moreMonday’s charge is for level-five felony battery involving “serious bodily injury”, which can result in a jail sentence of up to six years and a $10,000 fine.“One of the challenges you have in a case like this is that you are dealing with individuals who are receiving medical care and that’s, obviously, the most important thing, that individuals are treated appropriately,” Marion county prosecutor Ryan Mears said on Monday. “But once we were provided with additional information about the victim’s current medical condition, it became clear to us that additional charges needed to be filed.”Sanchez was stabbed and pepper sprayed by a 69-year-old truck driver during the incident inIndianapolis, where the former New York Jets star was due to cover an NFL game between the Colts and Las Vegas Raiders on Sunday. Sanchez allegedly confronted the driver, known only as “PT” in the police affidavit, at a loading bay outside a hotel. PT says he was picking up used cooking oil from the hotel when Sanchez, who he claims smelled of alcohol, attempted to enter the truck. PT says Sanchez told him the manager of the hotel said he did not want the oil picked up.PT said he believed Sanchez was “trying to kill me” and used pepper spray to protect himself. When the spray did not stop Sanchez advancing on him, PT said he stabbed the former quarterback “two or three times”. Sanchez then allegedly threw PT against a dumpster before “a look of shock” came across his face and he “took off”. Detectives have reviewed video footage of the incident. Witnesses said Sanchez and PT filmed each other with the cellphones during the incident.According to the affidavit, Sanchez told police “all he could remember was grabbing for a window.” He did not remember who stabbed him or where the incident occurred.The incident left Sanchez with stab wounds to his torso while PT suffered deep cuts to his face. On Monday, Mears described PT’s injuries as “very severe”. Sanchez’s injuries were not life-threatening. He was due to appear in court on Tuesday, but the hearing has been moved until 4 November as he is still being treated in hospital, where he is listed as in a stable condition.“We’re literally talking about people fighting over a parking space,” said Mears. He added that a number of witnesses as well as security cameras had given police a clear picture of the incident.It is unclear whether PT faces charges but Mears said that Indiana “has some of the most robust self-defense laws in the nation.”Another former NFL quarterback, Brady Quinn, replaced Sanchez in the Fox booth for Sunday’s game. Fox acknowledged the incident briefly on Sunday’s pregame show,with host Curt Menefee saying: “we are all still trying to wrap our heads around it … our thoughts and prayers are with Mark, his family and all those involved”.Sanchez joined Fox in 2021 and also contributes to FS1 studio programming.Before his broadcasting career, Sanchez played 10 seasons in the NFL with several teams, including theNew York Jets, who took him with the fifth overall pick of the 2009 draft. He later played for the Philadelphia Eagles and Dallas Cowboys. He retired in July 2019 and soon after began working with ESPN’s college football coverage before transitioning to Fox.Explore more on these topicsNFLIndianapolisUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

To find yourself submerged in a vast rolling wave of information in the course ofonly seven rounds of Premier League games.As English football entersits latest international breakit is a little startling to think we have had only 70 Premier League matches to this point, with 310 more still to go through the slog of autumn into spring. Seven rounds of games? Really? Is that all?If it feels like more, this is to some extent a function of the Bald Fraudification of English football, the acceleration of the narrative arc. Careers must now rise and fall at alarming speed. The dominance of social media has created this relentlessly overstimulated hive-mind, a networked conversation that must always happen, that rewards and promotes the loudest and most scandalised voice.As an example – and in fact the source of the original term – it is now axiomatic that there must always be at least two Bald Frauds operating in the Premier League at any given time, a non-negotiable that created its own lovely moment of synergyat Stamford Bridge on Saturdayas Enzo Maresca literally passed the Bald Fraud Baton – an actual baton – to Arne Slot in the course of their post-match handshake.View image in fullscreenEnzo Maresca (left) shakes hands with Arne Slot at Stamford Bridge (Bald Fraud Baton out of shot).Photograph: Liverpool FC/Getty ImagesOne obvious consequence is that nobody seems to like an international break much these days. This is logical. The product is designed to be consumed in constant rotation, an addiction fed to a strict schedule. But it is still a timely moment of cold turkey, with the league frozen at an unusually interesting point. Liverpool are off the top, having dominated since last September. Bournemouth, Crystal Palace, Everton, Sunderland and Tottenham are among the top nine.So what is the story of the season so far? At this early stage it is perhaps more useful to identify what isn’t. Some narrative-busting first (disclaimer: narrative may turn out to be true; short-term crisis meter can go up as well as down).Most notably Manchester United are in a terminal state of freefall. Ruben Amorim is no more than a pair of trainers and a spiffy zip-up jacket that has somehow worked out how to do a sexy cackle.Or … Manchester United are also six points off the top. They fielded an actual reliable goalkeeper on Saturday and kept a first clean sheet. Benjamin Sesko has two in two. Exiting the Carabao Cup plus no European games may turn out to be quite handy from here.View image in fullscreenSenne Lammens, the Manchester United goalkeeper, takes the plaudits after making a save against Sunderland.Photograph: Phil Oldham/ShutterstockOther myths that may or may not be myths. Ange Postecoglou is the victim of a media narrative. Reality: Postecoglou is the victim of numbers, mainly losing 30 of his past 49 league games. Bournemouth are doomed‑adjacent, but actually not doomed at all. Brentford were doomed then became not doomed, then may be doomed again, a fitting state of paradox for a club coached by a man with the brow, the curls and the limpid blue eyes of a romantically doomed Celtic poet but who is still called Keith Andrews, rather than, say, Kavan Bismarckius De La Gallway.The main takeaway, and an object of genuine interest, is the prominence of set pieces, not just as a source of goals but as a dominant tactical note. This has become fixed as a story of the season so far, the idea that after several years of ground-level possession fixation the English top tier is embracing the potential of airborne set plays.There was a good discussion about this on the Second Captains podcast recently involving the tactical writer Jamie Hamilton, a high priest of “relational” football as the opposing pole of “positionism”. For those not already engaged with this debate, relationism is the idea of creative, inventive attacking play, a licensed freedom. Positionism is control, strict patterns, eliminating variables in player movements. It’s Miles Davis using musical scales as a platform to noodle versus unsmiling men with quiffs fiddling with synthesisers.There is a theory the prevalence of set-piece moves derives firstly from the increased volume of matches, and a lack of time to implement more complex patterns. And another that it comes from the death throes of Pep-derived positionism, the fact there is simply not much left to control, just some last remaining apples on the tree to dice and slice into orderly shapes. We’ve done 60% possession, which seems to be the human ceiling. What have we got left? Corners and throws? Chuck ’em in the hay bale machine.Is this actually true? Do we really have not just more goals from set pieces, but set-piece-centred patterns in the average game? There are some false notes in this. The touch-finder kick-off routine is surely a gimmick, one that makes very little difference under the eye test. Brentford have been held up as a key driver of this tactical shift. Brentford have also scored one goal from set pieces all season. Manchester City have scored none.But there are obvious shifts. Goals from set pieces have increased overall, according to stats from WhoScored. So far they account for 45 of 182 scored, or 26%, up from 18% last season and 19% the season before. Goals from corners, Opta stats show, are up to 0.49 per game, from 0.36 last season and about 0.41 on average across the three seasons before that.View image in fullscreenAll eyes are on the ball as a Brentford long throw is launched into the Manchester United penalty area.Photograph: Javier García/ShutterstockThrow-ins are the big growth area. Last season total goals from throws more than doubled on the recent norm, up to 20 from a flat eight or nine. So far this season eight have been scored, on target to hit a giddy 32 if that rate is maintained.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Long throws direct into the opposition penalty area are running at two and a half times as many per game compared with the previous four seasons. Will people stop being surprised and work out how to defend them? Probably. Will arms get tired, distances drop, fast bowler-style back injuries become a new problem?Is this even surprising or significant if people are simply throwing the ball into the box more in any case? Is the uplift in goals scored this way really meaningful, given the amount of additional time spent coaching it? Would you just score more in breakaways if you coached that instead?As ever, lumping all 20 teams into the same trend is simplistic. There is variation within any group. And here the overall number is boosted by a few outliers. Of possession‑based teams only Arsenal and Chelsea (seven and five) have really scored a lot of set‑piece goals this season. Had Arsenal and Chelsea scored set pieces at their usual rate the league would be running at 20% of all goals, its usual ratio. These two are, so far, skewing the headline number.But two things do stand out from those seven rounds of games, and the blizzard of maybe-yes-not-sure numbers. The more powerful, top‑of-the-table teams are using this tactic more, which also explains why Thomas Tuchel is so attuned to it. These are the games he watches more, and with which he wishes to associate his England team.More broadly, and the second point here, is that the bigger, more possession-based teams are going long more often. Overall long balls are up after a brief lull, although the combined per-game total of the 20 clubs is 997 compared with 969 last season. City, Arsenal, Chelsea, Spurs and Liverpool are playing on average a combined 226 long balls per game, compared with 203 last season.Anecdotally, on the neck-crick test, less time is being spent staring at the penalty area of the dominant team while a goalkeeper does Cruyff turns, or watching centre‑backs act as playmakers. There is more willingness to go forward quicker, to attempt to score from two or three passes.This is something Brentford really have excelled at, transforming a phase of open play into a set piece in itself, the moment their opponents push on to them the trigger for a sudden long pass in search of quick‑breaking forwards. Erling Haaland is still scoring most of Manchester City’s goals, but doing so from different angles, breakaways, goal-bound charges with the ball at his feet.View image in fullscreenErling Haaland holds off the challenge of Nathan Collins to score the only goal of the game in Manchester City’s victory at Brentford.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe addition of more direct transitions is a fun note of variation. It also reflects other elements at the top of the league. The signing of Florian Wirtz has raised some tremors, an apparently ill-fitting player in the current structure. But this is deliberate, as Arne Slot has pointed out, an attempt to find new angles and patterns as the league evolves.So there you have it: what may or may not be happening, a series of maybe-stats and vibe-based hunches on the outline numbers. It remains a key part of the game’s indissoluble appeal that it remains so hard to read, a set of endlessly complex variables that will no doubt have shifted again by the time the next international break swings around. But England’s manager is right in one obvious sense. Even getting it launched seems to have found a fresh angle in the mini-age of the throw-in, the intrusion of the hand, now, into the game of feet.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

He went on to take the place and finished third in front of Piastri in fourth.The Australian was furious at the time, telling the team in no uncertain terms he believed it had been unfair and counter to McLaren’s single most important rule that the teammates should not clash with one another as part of the approach to letting them race.Norris hit back afterwards, however, saying: “If you fault me for just going on the inside of a big gap then you should not be inFormula One. There was nothing wrong with what I did.”McLaren did not switch their driver’s places, having assessed at the time that Norris had not been at fault as he had been jolted into Piastri as a result of having tagged Verstappen. Stella confirmed this was the case afterwards but said they would carefully appraise the decision with both drivers.“The review needs to be very detailed, very analytical, and it needs to take into account the point of view of our two drivers,” he said. “We will form a common opinion and we will see whether it confirms our initial interpretation, or if there is something else that we should compute.“We need to be accurate because there is a lot at stake, not only the championship points but the trust of our drivers and the way we operate as a team.”Norris closed the gap to his teammate by three points in Singapore and is now 22 in arrears with six meetings remaining in what is likely to be an increasingly tense title run-in, during which how McLaren manage their drivers may prove a complex process.View image in fullscreenThe McLaren team principal, Andrea Stella (centre), acknowledges it will be difficult to be fair to both drivers during a tense final six races of the season.Photograph: Florent Gooden/DPPI/ShutterstockPiastri acceded to a request to move over for Norris at Monza when the British driver lost a place to his teammate after a slow pit stop, which was the most recent case of the team attempting to pursue their principles of fairness scrupulously to both drivers while allowing them to race. It is, however, proving progressively more complex to deal with each time they are forced to adapt to a new situation, an issue that was acknowledged by Stella.“When you are racing as a team, you cannot have exactly the same interests for the two drivers because they want to pursue their aspirations,” he said. “We want to protect this ‘let them race’ concept and we know as soon as you adopt this concept you face difficulties.”Explore more on these topicsFormula OneLando NorrisOscar PiastriMcLarenMotor sportAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

It was 33 degrees out there, they had been playing 33 minutes and they had scored one againstBarcelona, which wasn’t enough. The champions were there to be finished, Sevilla’s manager said. He had shown them how, now it was up to them. There was applause, towels taken from shoulders, bottles handed back, and 179 seconds later it was two. It could have been four already; by the time the clock headed beyond 100 minutes it actually was, the men standing before his bench now swirling their shirts above their heads, eager to be released for one last run, over the turf and towards their teammates.Towards another time too. “They told me it’s been 10 years,” Sevilla’s new striker Alexis Sánchez said. This weekend, the season’s eighth, the most impressive team in Spain lost for the first time and so did Barcelona. But it wasn’t just that Hansi Flick’s side fell immediately after Elche were defeated at Alavés, La Liga’s last two unbeaten records gone in a single Sunday afternoon; it was how it happened and what it meant. For Barcelona,who were taken apart 4-1, and for Sevilla especially, the Sánchez-Pizjuán reminded of the way things used to be, back when they were good. They hadn’t defeated the Catalan side in a decade and hadn’t defeated anyone there all season. “A load of negative things were broken today,” Almeyda said.Uefa gives ‘reluctant’ approval for domestic games to be played abroad this seasonRead moreBroken? They were smashed to bits. “We didn’t know what to do,” Pedri admitted. Sevilla, on the other hand, did. Their coach couldn’t be clearer. “98% of teams that wait for Barcelona lose,” Almeyda said before kick-off, so his players went for them instead. Five at the back became four, man-to-man in the middle: “We didn’t let the three brains think,” the manager insisted. The Flick Line, asRayo Vallecano’s coach Iñigo Pérezcalled it, was breached with virtually every ball. White shirts were everywhere, but never just standing there. And when the players came to the touchline for a drink, Sevilla led 1-0. Which, for Barcelona, was just about the best thing about it. But if they thought this was a break, it wasn’t.Sánchez had given Sevilla the lead with a penalty. Gerard Martin had been booked, the manager reminded them, Barcelona’s full-back exposed and there to be got at like the rest of them. “You know what we planned,” Almeyda told his players. “Touch, return, go. Don’t let them think.”Isaac Romerohad had three chances in nine minutes, each easier than the last, and not taken any; now, less than three minutes after heading back out, he did. And although Marcus Rashford scored a superb volley before half-time, while Robert Lewandowski missed a penalty at 2-1 that might have changed everything, and Sevilla had to wait, they did finish it.On 90 minutes, José Ángel Carmona went through and struck a low shot past Wojciech Szczesny. “I hit it with what little I had left, all my soul,” he said after. Seven minutes later, Akor Adams scored the fourth. In the corner, he tore of his shirt and threw it into the air, high as he could. On the touchline, staff tried to get players to sit down, step back, but there was no chance now. So they stood and bounced around the technical area like these were the final moments of a final they knew they were going to win, towels, bibs and shirts twirling as they waited for the whistle to tell them they could invade the pitch in celebration.Soon they were in a line, arms round each other’s shoulders in front of the Biris’ end, bouncing off each other and going bananas. “This is one of the happiest days of my life,” Carmona said after. In the stands, there were actually tears. At the dressing room door, a committee formed welcoming the players back with bear hugs and beatings, a gauntlet to get through. “Delirium”, Diario deSevillacalled it: “ecstasy”, “joy”. All of which might have sounded a bit much but there hadn’t been a lot of that lately. “A weight has been lifted,” César Azpilicueta said.View image in fullscreenSevilla celebrate José Ángel Carmona’s late strike.Photograph: Joaquin Corchero/AFP7/ShutterstockThe last time Sevilla defeated Barcelona was October 2015. That year, they won their third consecutive Europa League. In 2020 they won another. But the club who had missed out on Europe just once in two decades, who had finished fourth three years in a row not so long ago, had fallen away. They sacked Julen Lopetegui,went through seven managers in three yearsand finished 12th, 14th, and 17th, closer to relegation by the season, the threat of the second division increasingly real. Even another,implausible Europa League win in 2023couldn’t hide reality,José Luis Mendilibar rescuing them in the league,lifting the trophyand getting fired eight games later. Diego Alonso came, went, and didn’t win a game. Quique Sánchez Flores lasted six months and couldn’t take any more. You knew García Pimienta was going to be sacked the day they extended his contract – a month after he had been signed. Calling on Joaquín Caparrós was an act of desperation and self preservation from a failing president under pressure.José María del Nido senior, the former president, was at war with José María del Nido junior, the current president. And, yes, they are father and son, busy abusing each other and fighting for control of the club. All the while, everything was falling apart. Last season their salary limit, as set by the league, was €684,000. It was the lowest inLa Liga, acrossbothdivisions. And if this year it is back up to €22m, that is still less than anyone else, and 15 times less than Barcelona. A total of €55m worth of players were sold and they were the only team inprimeranot to pay for a signing, total outgoings amounting to a €250,000 loan fee. A new sporting director, Antonio Cordón, came in, charged with cutting 40% from the wage bill.There was a new coach too. Matías Almeyda wasn’t the first they interviewed but while the former Real Sociedad managerImanol Alguacilwas unconvinced – how could be not be? – the Argentinian said he would walk to Seville. Where, somehow, he and Cordón started building something.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Someone from your family says ‘would you like your grandad’s trousers?’ ‘Yes please, I could use them.’ ‘Would you like your cousin’s T-shirt?’ ‘Sure, give it to me,’” the manager said. Gabriel Suazo came, and Odysseas Vlachodimos and Batista Mendy. Sánchez and Azpilicueta are 36. “They could have gone somewhere else easily, but they came to play for us, when it’s not easy,” Almeyda said; they also arrived with an enthusiasm that’s “contagious”, the coach insisted, a love for their profession.“Pure football,” he called the Chilean, someone you would see sitting at the table, young players all around him, talking about the game, not a phone in sight. He described Azpilicueta as a silent leader, “and those are the best kind because they’re not ‘selling’ you anything”.Barbecues were held – “well I couldn’t do a paella; they would kill me,” Almeyda said – and that’s not just about food. Instead it was about people, about “thinking about others”, the coach said, “about sharing, talking, joking, singing, enjoying life”. A team was forming, a group. When he arrived, Almeyda spoke eloquently about the depression he had suffered at the end of his playing career. In truth, he admitted, he had partly become a coach for “ugly reasons”, driven by the emotional need to be back in the game after the phone had stopped ringing, but that gave him something. “Since I became a coach I became almost a psychologist,” he said. “And my priority is that they love football.”Quick GuideLa Liga resultsShowOsasuna 2-1 Getafe, Real Madrid 3-1 Villarreal, Athletic Bilbao 2-1 Mallorca, Girona 2-1 Valencia, Oviedo 0-2 Levante, Celta Vigo 1-1 Atlético Madrid, Espanyol 1-2 Real Betis, Real Sociedad 0-1 Rayo Vallecano, Sevilla 4-1 Barcelona, Alavés 3-1 ElcheWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.On Sunday, they did. They all did, and all the more so for where they came from. The tension around the club had been such that at the start of the season Sevilla had been a handful of bad results from the whole thing going up in flames. Instead, there was celebration, joy. A “relief”, Romero called it, released at last. “You have to believe; in football you can do anything,” Sánchez said. For the first time in 10 years, they had beaten Barcelona; for the first time since May, they had beaten anyone here. For the first time in 18 months, Sevilla had won two games in a row. Briefly, they moved into a Champions League place. Above all, they moved into a happy place too, players and staff standing there singing with the Pizjuán. “It’s an incredible day; it’s lovely to see them so happy,” Carmona said. “We did it together.”“No one thought we could beat Barcelona they way we did,” Almeyda said. “We have to enjoy the journey and know how to walk this path. If we stop here, it’s worth nothing but today it’s everything. We have to believe we can, to get used to winning. The fans want to see players who give their heart and soul, and it made me emotional watching it. There was energy, fight, self-esteem. What I take with me most is the happiness we made.

Netanyahu said: “Great job to Sylvan and Israel’s cycling team for not giving in to hatred and intimidation. You make Israel proud!”Thedisruptions throughout the three-week raceaffected multiple stages and led to the cancellation of planned stage finishes and the shortening of the race distance. There were isolated protests during the sport’s other two grand tours, the Giro d’Italia and Tour de France.Israel-Premier Tech announced On Monday that it would be rebranding the team, adding that Adams would be relinquishing his current duties. “With steadfast commitment to our riders, staff, and valued partners, the decision has been made to rename and rebrand the team, moving away from its current Israeli identity,” the team said in a statement.“In sport, progress often requires sacrifice, and this step is essential to securing the future of the team. Looking ahead to the 2026 season, Sylvan Adams has chosen to step back from his day-to-day involvement and will no longer speak on behalf of the team, instead focusing on his role as president of the World Jewish Congress, Israel.”One of the team’s sponsors, the UK‑based Factor Bikes, had said its support was conditional on disassociating from Israel. Another sponsor, the Canadian-based manufacturer and horticulture firm Premier Tech, had taken a similar stance, saying it expected that Israel-Premier Tech would “evolve to a new name excluding the term Israel, and that it will adopt a new identity and a new brand image”.Although the scrappy end to the Vuelta in Madrid was criticised by rightwing Spanish politicians, the country’s socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez,praised those who had protested peacefully.Sánchez said he had “a deep admiration and respect” for the cyclists in the Vuelta and for “a Spanish society that mobilises against injustice and defends its ideas in a peaceful manner”.Agence France-Presse and Reuters contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsCyclingVuelta a EspañaIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

Milan have also been permitted to play Como in Perth, Australia, in February.Uefa, though, claims its go-ahead will not herald a torrent of similar relocations, saying its hands have been tied by gaps in football’s regulations.In a statement Uefa said it had “reiterated its clear opposition to domestic league matches being played outside their home country”, adding: “However, given that the relevant Fifa regulatory framework – currently under review – is not clear and detailed enough, the Uefa executive committee has reluctantly taken the decision to approve, on an exceptional basis, the two requests referred to it.”Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.It is the latest contentious step in a saga that has inflamed passions across the sport. Uefa’s executive committee was due to vote on the proposals last month and the Guardian understands it was invited to give its approval. But, amid a backlash from supporters’ groups and criticism from within the European Commission, it opted to engage in a “round of consultation” before reaching a final decision.The Uefa president, Aleksander Ceferin, sought to allay concerns that the dam has been burst by a move that could change the face of football. “League matches should be played on home soil; anything else would disenfranchise loyal match-going fans and potentially introduce distortive elements in competitions,” he said. “Our consultation confirmed the breadth of these concerns.“While it is regrettable to have to let these two games go ahead, this decision is exceptional and shall not be seen as setting a precedent. Our commitment is clear: to protect the integrity of national leagues and ensure that football remains anchored in its home environment.”View image in fullscreenThe Optus Stadium in Perth is likely to host Milan v Como in February.Photograph: Michael O’Brien/AAPSenior figures in Uefa believe there was no choice but to take a stance that they believe is pragmatic. High among the considerations was that a legal standoff with the plan’s proponents could have resulted and, should that have been lost, the floodgates could have opened.Uefasaid its national associations had agreed to engage with it before submitting any future requests but the sport still looks highly vulnerable to similar scenarios unfolding unless all stakeholders show sufficient appetite to bolt the door.That was first prised open last year when the US-based promoter Relevent Sports agreed a settlement with Fifa, dismissing the global governing body from a lawsuit contesting its policy banning league games from taking place overseas. Fifa had previously blocked a request from Relevent in 2018 to stage a match between Barcelona and Girona in Miami, although no substantive moves to close any regulatory loopholes appear to have been made in the intervening years. A working group established in 2024 to examine the rules has yet to form any conclusions. This year Relevent was awarded the global commercial rights to Uefa’s club competitions for the 2027-2033 cycle.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Whether a friendly or World Cup qualifier, the “Dos A Cero” rivalry attracts the largest crowds to mytia’s watch parties, about an hour south of San Francisco.Each clash feels like the fractured embodiment of being Mexican American: the cheering and moaning of Mexican immigrant parents and their Americanized children alike, rife with intergenerational discord. The stakes are always high, especially since most of my relatives grew up with the sport – and aren’t shy about sharing their tactical opinions midgame. Many of them played pro, semi-pro, collegiately and, of course, at the neighborhood parks.The biggest name at our gatherings? US men’s national team rising star Diego Luna.Diego was one of the few members of our family who cheered for the US over Mexico. That’s perhaps understandable: he is an American Gen Z-er who, understandably, grew up further removed from the migratory realities of the elder generations.Now, the little kid who used to run around my tia’s house has transformed into a key member of the US team – a fan favorite, a fiery sparkplug and a regular amid a sometimes-agonizing rebuild under Mauricio Pochettino. Diego has appeared in a team-high 13 of the 14 US games in 2025, and he’s in the squad again for the team’s upcoming friendlies against Ecuador and Australia.The 22-year-old’s rapid ascendance (witha broken noseincurred in a match against Costa Rica, at that) may have caught soccer pundits off guard, butthere has never been any doubt which side Diego represents – blood-stained jersey and all.View image in fullscreenDiego Luna featured prominently for the US U-20 national team.Photograph: ISI Photos/Getty ImagesHis journey in soccer began long before he could dribble a ball.Beto Luna – Diego’s dad, who married into our family – first had his own unlikely ascendance into professional soccer when he was scouted to play for the San Diego Sockers indoor team in 1985, despite having no pro experience as a student at Foothill college. Beto had only just arrived in the Bay Area and was unable to stay with the Sockers full time, but he stuck around long enough tofinish off an assistfrom now-Seattle Sounders head coach Brian Schmetzer, parlaying that brief stint into a run with the Milwaukee Wave and the San Jose Earthquakes (during their existence in one of the many predecessor leagues to MLS).An intrepid opportunist, the elder Luna didn’t come to this country to become afutbolero. But by the grace of the soccer gods, he became one, and he is nowa respected coach in the Bay Area.“The passion that we all have for the sport comes from my dad,” says Armando Luna, Diego’s eldest brother – a player himself, until a back injury forced him into coaching. “The way he threw himself into the sport, starting from a later age and working hard to develop his drive and love for soccer in a new country, inspired us.”Armando grew up especially close to his dad, but later became a role model and mentor for the much younger Diego.The youngest Luna’s trajectory has been anything but conventional, circumventing the NCAA and MLS systems in favor of the Barcelona residency academy in Arizona, followed by his successful stint in the second-tier USL with El Paso Locomotive FC. It all started within the family, though. With three older siblings and a father who all played and coached, Diego was perpetually bouncing from field to field as both a player and observer since infancy.“He was coached by us all his whole life,” Armando says. “If he had a training session at 5.30pm, he would get dropped off at three in the afternoon because the rest of us had to set up for other practices and our own games. Since he was always early, he would just practice and hang around the older players and work on his skills. Then, he’d have to stay later until our other games finished in the night. So he was on the field 24/7. That was the reality every single day. You would think we were hard on him, but that wasn’t really the case. He loved being around the game.”This conception that you only develop the kind of skills he has as a Latino is by playing on the streets, that’s bullshit. It was all by design.Armando Luna, Diego’s brotherDiego joined the Palo Alto Soccer Club at age five, a program where his father and older brother coached and directed for years to develop a regional powerhouse. At the time, Diego was playing with much older kids, nearly twice his age. Being physically overmatched forced Diego to develop a certain field awareness and technical mastery to compete.“They talk about [Diego] like he’s a street baller. But he never played on the streets. This conception that you only develop the kind of skills he has as a Latino is by playing on the streets, that’s bullshit,” says Armando. “It was all by design. From training. From encouraging his creativity on the field, from discipline. He had to learn the mental aspect of the game quickly. We never criticized him for trying new things. That translates to his game now.”Eventually, the family decided that Diego had outgrown the parochial circuit, so he joined the San Jose Earthquakes academy in 2015 at age 13. The inconvenience of constant rush hour travel and scheduling that didn’t coincide with Luna’s schooling presented challenges for a working family that was already stretched thin with soccer commitments all over the Bay Area. In 2018, they looked elsewhere. Luna himself decided on moving to Arizona to play at the Barcelona academy, where he trained and lived for three years. That propelled him towards his first professional singing with El Paso in 2021.El Paso couldn’t have been a more appropriate home for Diego – a Mexican-American borderland city that is culturally, and sociologically, caught between neighboring worlds in Mexico and the US.In retelling his brother’s soccer quest, Armando recites a quote to me from the 1997 film Selena: “Being a Mexican American is tough … we gotta prove to the Mexicans how Mexican we are, and we gotta prove to the Americans how American we are. We gotta be more Mexican than the Mexicans and more American than the Americans. It’s exhausting.”In the biopic, Jennifer Lopez plays the famous Tejana pop star from a border town who notoriously learned how to sing in Spanish as a Mexican American to validate her dual identity. It’s a familiar story for anyone who has known both sides of the border: a road which inevitably forks in separate directions the older one becomes. Go left for the US or go right for Mexico. And be damned regardless.View image in fullscreenLuna has become a mainstay with the US under Mauricio Pochettino.Photograph: Ashley Landis/APLike many children of immigrants, Diego never had to confront the challenges of his parents’ crossing and hasn’t known life on the other side of the border. He grew up with soccer in a relatively comfortable environment in California. Why would someone in his position give that up for something they have no connection to?“We never heard anything from the Mexican federation. No communication. No interest. No real anything,” Armando says. “Even for US Soccer, it wasn’t like there was a ton of interest from their side, either.”But when that US offer arrived, accepting it was easy, even if the reaction wasn’t. Fans in Mexico grew increasingly vocal against Luna and his choice to represent the US, which invoked betrayal in their eyes. Other Mexican-American prospects like Julián Araujo (Bournemouth) and Da’Vian Kimbrough (Sacramento Republic) have gained praise for their decision to represent El Tri on the international stage, yet online trolls have lambasted Diego for his supposed inability to speak Spanish (he can but it’s his second language, and he prefers to answer most media questions in English).Still, Armando tells me how fans from Costa Rica, Guatemala and especially Mexico have enthusiastically approached Diego after his international caps asking for photos and autographs. A US citizen, he remains grateful to represent his nation, and any antagonism that has come as a result of his choice has only helped to forge Diego’s fortitude.“When he was young, when the Mexican team would win, [Diego] would have a fit,” Armando recalls. “He always wanted the US team to win. He grew up here. He doesn’t know anything else.”Explore more on these topicsUSAUS sportsReal Salt LakefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s true that the two league games in that run were both lost via last-minute winners, and that in isolation these three games could be explained away relatively easily. But context matters, and the truth is that while Liverpool won their first five league games of the season, they did not play well in them.New players are struggling to settle and Arne Slot’s rejig of the formation has not really worked, while a number of regulars look out of sorts. Last seasonLiverpoolwon the league playing extremely controlled soccer, making 2-0 almost a trademark scoreline, establishing their lead and then running the clock down. This season there has been none of that, no sense of playing within themselves. They’ve been extremely open through midfield and most of their wins have come through late goals. There’s been an unexpected wildness to them, almost as though Slot is going through his transition a season late.Introducing any new player to a side is fraught with potential issues. The player has to learn their environment and their teammates have to get used to them. Even in the best cases, dropping a new player into a functioning side will lead to a slight short-term drop-off. Liverpool avoided that last summer by signing only Federico Chiesa. Adding five new players, as they did this offseason, means a lot of disruption. And, of course, this is a squad dealing withthe tragic loss of Diogo Jota. Mohamed Salah’s on-pitch tears after the final whistle of the opening game of the season were a reminder that this is a club in mourning. Soccer keeps going, as it must, but the impact of Jota’s death is unpredictable and may be felt for a long time yet.At first it seemed the biggest tactical problem was the switch from 4-3-3 to 4-2-3-1to accommodate Florian Wirtzas a central creator. The balance given by a central trio of Ryan Gravenberch, Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai was gone, not helped by the fact that Mac Allister still doesn’t quite seem back to his best after a muscle injury, while Wirtz is yet to settle. But in recent games, Slot has returned to last season’s trio, switching back to 4-3-3, and many of the same problems have remained. Liverpool’s centre-backs keep being isolated, a situation exacerbated by Ibrahima Konaté’s loss of form.So what has changed? Why isn’t the centre-back pairing and midfield three that were so effective last season suddenly functioning? The answer is twofold. First, Liverpool’s press has stopped working as it once did. The 2020-21 season, in which Liverpool finished a distant third to Manchester City, offers a warning of what happens when that misfires. Second, and more intriguingly, new full-backs Miloš Kerkez and Jeremie Frimpong are very different from Andy Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As a youth player he had been a midfielder and his gifts were those of somebody who would usually play in midfield. He is arguably the best passer of a ball currently playing for England, which is what led many to argue that he was wasted at full-back, and that he should be used in midfield. Attempts to play him there, though, were unconvincing, as though his years on the right of a back four had somehow rendered him unsuitable for a more central role.And yet he wasn’t a particularly good defender, at least if that is defined in the traditional way. He wasn’t great at marking, and he was, by the standards of top-level full-backs, relatively easy to dribble past. He issui generis, which is one of the reasons he has never really looked convincing while playing for England. International soccer, given the lack of time available to coaches, prefers plug-in-and-play footballers, right-backs who play like right-backs.But Alexander-Arnold has two attributes that Liverpool are severely missing at the moment. His rapid and accurate 30- and 40-yard passes were often what released Salah, but his passing generally was central to Liverpool’s buildup play. Probably even more important, though, was his capacity to invert into midfield, to become an additional holding player alongside Gravenberch. Frimpong, who was a wing-back at Bayer Leverkusen, is a very different sort of full-back. He runs with the ball rather than passing it, and his natural inclination is to go on the outside not the inside. Given Salah wants to cut inside, that may work eventually. But for now, Liverpool are missing both the balance Alexander-Arnold brought and his capacity to unleash Salah, who has had a very quiet start to the season and is yet to forge a relationship with any of the new forwards.Any side making as many changes as Liverpool will inevitably have teething problems, but what is notable at the moment is that the issue is less the players who are there than one who has left. Alexander-Arnold’s unique range of abilities will not easily be replaced.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

If there was a conversation about extending then we will see, but I have still got this season and another season. It is not like I am in my last year, it is not like there is any panic. I am calm, I love the manager at Bayern and as long we are improving and I am improving then I am happy to see what we can achieve.”Kane has made a sensational start to the season, scoring 19 goals for club and country. But he knows that being crowned the best player in the world will require winning the Champions League with Bayern or the World Cup with England next summer.“I would love to win the Ballon d’Or,” Kane said. “Essentially it is a team trophy that the best individual from that team wins, so it is going to be a Champions League winner or a World Cup winner … It would be an accumulation of doing something great individually and as a team. It would be almost the perfect season.”View image in fullscreenHarry Kane is preparing for England’s matches against Wales and Latvia.Photograph: George Wass/PPAUK/ShutterstockKane considered whether he has become a better player at Bayern. His analysis was that he is “seeing the game at the highest level I’ve ever had”. It was interesting to note that Vincent Kompany, Bayern’s manager, talked about Kane’s work out of possession after he scored twice against Chelsea last month.“When you win a title maybe it could be easy to go the other way and be like: ‘OK I’ve done what I wanted to achieve,’” Kane said. “But it’s given me motivation to do more. My numbers are 11km a game, a lot of high‑speed running. Sometimes when I’m watching the games back, I’m more looking forward to watching tackles or one of my defensive actions than watching my goals back. I don’t know if that means I’m getting a little bit bored of my goals or like the tackling part as well but it’s been enjoyable.“I was interested in how I would feel after winning a trophy. It could have been easy to be a bit more relaxed. I pushed myself the other way, being even better, eating even cleaner, doing more gym.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s just whether the cheat meals after games are not so much, or when you’re out with the family not having as much ice cream. Small details, but at the highest level those make a big difference.”Kane is preparing for England’s friendly against Wales on Thursday and World Cup qualifier against Latvia next Tuesday. The focus has been on Thomas Tuchel leaving Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden out of his squad. Tuchel has said he wanted to reward the players who excelled in training and against Serbia last month.“There are a lot of players who are different from past tournament squads,” Kane said. “But I think the boss has made it pretty clear that those players, it’s not like they’re out of the squad for sure. A lot of them are maybe just coming back into form. Some of them, Jude especially, he’s not been fit, and just played one or two games. It is a big change, but that’s not my decision. That’s the boss – he will feel the feeling amongst the players.”Kane urged England to maintain the standards set during the 5-0 win over Serbia. “The energy around the place was in a really good place,” he said. “Probably the best camp since Gareth [Southgate] left I would say was the September camp but now that is the standard.”England have added Manchester City’s Nico O’Reilly to the squad after the Chelsea right-back Reece James withdrew with a minor injury.

So hot that whoever was manning it had to wear asbestos gloves as they sifted through comments left by supporters of one particular Glasgow team, who felt compelled to rant about “the turgid, unwatchable garbage” (Sean in Cumbernauld) they’d just been forced to sit though by “players not good enough or not performing at a level anywhere good enough” (Kenny in Moffat), who “don’t seem to know what they’re doing” (John in location unspecified). Rather remarkably, these appraisals were among the more printable posted by a selection of furiousCelticfans, who had just seen their team win at home to Motherwell.While there was no shortage of Rangers fans on the forum getting their radge on, those who travelled to Falkirk to see a fifth league draw in seven gamestook a far more hands-on approachto voicing their displeasure. Having booed their team off the pitch, several made for the stadium car park to stage an intimidating sit-down protest in front of the team bus. What happened in Falkirk ought to stay in Falkirk, seemed to be the prevailing view, even if the main target of their ire sneaked out of a side door and received an escort from mounted police to a waiting car. “I didn’t like what I saw because it looked a bit like mob rule to me and we’ve not got a place for that,” reasoned Rangers legend turned broadcaster Ally McCoist on the wireless, of the toxic and unseemly post-match scenes prompted by furious supporters. “But where I will stand up is to say the fans have every right to protest, have every right to voice their opinion. I do expect that.”Having made his getaway aided and abetted by the constabulary, it later emerged that Russell Martin had been sacked as Rangers head coach by the brains trust who made the quite baffling decision to appoint him in the first place. A hire so unpopular that even serial Rangers-baiter Chris Sutton would have received a warmer welcome, Martin immediately found himself on the receiving end of abuse from his own fans that only increased in volume during pre-season friendlies, the club’s 6-0 Bigger Cup shellacking by Club Brugge and a league campaign that has been little short of disastrous. Martin leaves as the shortest-serving manager in Rangers’ 153-year history (briefer histories are available), having lasted even less time thanthat Portuguese fellawho famously apologised through a fence to angry fans while standing in a hedge in Luxembourg.Of course, sorry always seemed to be the hardest word for Martin, who invariably came across as aloof and supercilious when publicly throwing his players under the bus he chose not to board after Sunday’s match or answering valid questions about their and his own myriad shortcomings. A man who always conveyed the impression he felt that all at Ibrox ought to be delighted a coach of his talents had deigned to join them, he leaves with what one presumes is a handsome payoff for his dismal failure. And while his appointment may have been the most predictably disastrous of the off-season, it was not necessarily the most expensive. A summer recruitment drive involved the club’s new 49ers owners spaffing the thick end of £30m on eight new players, the vast majority of whom are so bobbins they can’t even get into aRangersteam that currently sits eighth in the Scottish Premiership with a negative goal difference.Having been appointed chief executive last November after 18 years in a lesser role at Manchester United, Patrick Stewart has now become the notable exception to the prevailing rule that everyone who leaves Old Trafford goes on to thrive in their new surroundings. Already the subject of several less than flattering diatribes on the Daily Record Hotline, he desperately needs to comes up with a cunning Martin succession plan or he’ll be next out the door, so Glaswegians can expect to see the Dyche-Signal light up the sky over Ibrox any night now.QUOTE OF THE DAY“I see it as an exciting opportunity. You have to be up for the fight and the struggle. I’d be silly to be sitting here at the age of 60 if I lacked self-belief or fight.

Lazio were losing at home toTorino, who had been outscored by their previous five league opponents by a combined 10 goals to two. Ultras from the Curva Nord were wrapping up the latest protest in their never-ending feud with the club’s owner, Claudio Lotito.Was Lazio’s season coming unstitched, or had there never been a thread holding it together in the first place? They reappointed Maurizio Sarri as manager this summer, only for him to later acknowledge that the club had not mentioned the transfer ban they were about to receive for financial irregularities. Rumours that he might quit were unfounded, but he did say Lotito had “swindled” him.Brooke Norton-Cuffy: ‘Vieira was great as a player and he’s a great manager now’Read moreTheBiancocelestibecame as messy on the pitch as they were off it, beating Verona 4-0 and Genoa 3-0 but losing the rest of their first five games,including the Rome derby. At any given moment, it has been hard to tell if they are improving or imploding.At least one man kept smiling through it. Matteo Cancellieri was not even supposed to be at Lazio this season. He spent the last one on loan at Parma and, early this summer, his parent club were pushing for him to stay there a while longer. The transfer ban forced a rethink. Lazio could not afford to thin their squad without replacements.He joined in the first place during Sarri’s previous tenure, then a 20-year-old graduate of Verona’s academy. He made 20 league appearances for Lazio in 2022-23, all but one of those as a substitute. The club’s longtime sporting director, Igli Tare, who left at the end of that season, would later accuse Sarri of “telling everyone Cancellieri would be a star then never playing him”.Perhaps the manager was still trying to work out the nature of the player’s talent. Billed as a wide forward on arrival, Cancellieri nevertheless spent much of that season as an ineffective backup to Ciro Immobile at No 9. In 63 appearances on loan at Empoli and Parma over the last two seasons, he scored seven times. Shoehorning him into a poacher’s role was always going to be a poor fit.Quick GuideSerie A resultsShowVerona 0-1 Sassuolo, Atalanta 1-1 Como, Inter 4-1 Cremonese, Lazio 3-3 Torino, Parma 0-1 Lecce, Juventus 0-0 Milan, Napoli 2-1 Genoa, Bologna 4-0 Pisa, Fiorentina 1-2 Roma, Udinese 1-1 CagliariWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Or maybe it was just a question of timing. If the transfer ban ensured Cancellieri’s place in Lazio’s squad, then it was a lengthy layoff for the Denmark international Gustav Isaksen, who contracted glandular fever during the summer, that gave the Italian a chance to claim a spot in the starting XI during pre-season.He did exactly that, delivering a string of impressive friendly performances. Left-footed and playing as an inverted winger on the right of a 4-3-3, his manner of cutting in from the flank to shoot had commentators remembering why he was billed by more optimistic observers as a “next Arjen Robben” when he joined the club in 2022.To call that a premature comparison would be to pretend there is a comparison at all. We don’t know yet if Cancellieri is an unpolished diamond or simply having a purple patch, but he has carried that pre-season form into the start of this campaign. He was a lone bright light for Lazio in their opening defeat by Como and did well again in the thrashing of Verona.View image in fullscreenCancellieri battling for the ball with Torino’s Ché Adams.Photograph: Giuseppe Maffia/NurPhoto/ShutterstockLeft out ofthe derby defeat, Cancellieri marked his return with a fourth-minute goal and a man-of-the-match performance in the win over Genoa. And then came this weekend against Torino. The saying goes that a person who smiles in a crisis is the one who worked out who to blame, but sometimes the secret is simpler. A ball, a pitch, an opponent to run at. Cancellieri is just delighted to be back in Rome, the city of his birth, and starting regularly.Lazio looked ripe to fall apart on Saturday, not just because they fell behind early but because they were outplayed during the opening exchanges by a Torino side coached by their former manager, Marco Baroni. Then Valentín Castellanos released Cancellieri with an angled ball to dissect Torino’s centre-backs from inside his own half. Realising he didn’t have the legs to get away from them, Cancellieri instead gave people cause to think once again of a certain Dutchman, wrongfooting his pursuers with a touch to the left before smashing his shot into the top corner.He wasn’t the only one grinning now as he jogged back to halfway, stopping to give a little butt-wiggle. What to do for an encore? Perhaps the same thing? The ball forward this time came from Toma Basic and Cancellieri received it running into the corner of the penalty box, much closer to the goal. But the meat was the same: drive the defender off-balance, cut back inside and stick the ball into the (this time bottom) corner.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A better team might have capitalised on their momentum against fragile Torino. But Lazio are not that team. The game stabilised until Ché Adams popped up with a 73rd-minute equaliser. Lazio’s defenders lost track of him completely as he attacked Niels Nkounkou’s cross.Torino thought they had claimed a precious win when Saúl Coco headed in from a corner at the start of injury time. But the same player would subsequently give away a penalty at the other end with a hip check on Tijjani Noslin. The Dutch forward was initially judged to have dived, but that decision was reversed after a lengthy VAR review and a scuffle between the two teams. Danilo Cataldi smashed home his penalty in the 103rd minute.View image in fullscreenMaurizio Sarri witnessed another wildly inconsistent performance from his side on Saturday.Photograph: Federico Proietti/DPPI/ShutterstockBy the end it was hard to know what conclusions to draw beyond the fact that these two flawed teams had served up an entertaining spectacle, and that Cancellieri is one of the players to keep an eye on inSerie Aat the moment. Perhaps this is a flash in the pan, or maybe something more.A nation that has spent so many years lamenting its shortage of high-quality forwards is itching to see one of the current flock of prospects flourish into a genuine star, from Pio Esposito at Inter to Francesco Camarda at Lecce. Cancellieri is a few years ahead of those two, but a breakthrough season at 23 would hardly make him a late bloomer.A dig into his underlying numbers gives more reasons for hope. Besides now being Lazio’s top scorer this season, Cancellieri has also won more tackles than any teammate, is joint-first in passes intercepted and second for headers. He certainly puts himself about, in other words. Sarri has hailed him for returning from his loans “more mature” than when they last worked together.“Going away on loan did me good,” agreed Cancellieri. “I’ve grown up, in lots of ways.”PosTeamPGDPts1Napoli66152Roma65153AC Milan66134Inter Milan69125Juventus64126Atalanta66107Bologna64108Como6299Sassuolo60910Cremonese6-1911Cagliari60812Udinese6-3813Lazio63714Parma6-4515Lecce6-5516Torino6-8517Fiorentina6-4318Verona6-7319Genoa6-6220Pisa6-72Explore more on these topicsSerie AEuropean club footballLazioTorinofeaturesShareReuse this content"

Those three words reflect the monopoly that PSG have held in the capital in recent decades. PSG is Paris; Paris is PSG. But for how much longer?There is no such slogan pasted atop the Stade Jean-Bouin, Paris FC’s new home, where they swatted aside Lorient 2-0 on Friday, a result that has taken them up to eighth in Ligue 1. They are just six points behind their closest of close rivals, not that challenging PSG is their current reality. What is taking hold atParis FCis less of a Great Leap Forward and more of a Cultural Revolution as the Arnault family, who bought the club at the end of last year, place their pawns and mould the club in their image.Despite their newfound wealth, change will be incremental at Paris FC. The cart is not being put before the horse, as it was by Saint-Étienne last year. They also made the step up from Ligue 2 with money to spend. The signings of Lucas Stassin and Zuriko Davitashvili were bold statements of intent but both players lackedLigue 1experience. The result was an immediate relegation back to Ligue 2.“We have to be careful during the next few years,” says Paris FC president Pierre Ferracci, who remains in his post after the takeover. “We need to establish ourselves in Ligue 1 and avoid any false steps; that is why we are going to recruit experienced players.”That isn’t the long-term plan for Paris FC, who have been “inspired” by Barcelona’s academy system and wish to replicate it, with the help of minority shareholders Red Bull, in the famously rich talent-pool that is the Île-de-France region. The seeds of their long-term planning are now being planted. Marco Neppe, the former Bayern Munich technical director, has come in as the new sporting director, replacing Pierre Ferracci’s own son, Francois Ferracci. “We wanted to give the sporting management of the club an experienced head,” said Arnault.Pierre Ferracci added that Neppe’s “qualities would be precious” in what was a “transitional phase” for the club, before going on to thank his son in a communique that lacked any kind of familial warmth. “Francois Ferracci has played a crucial role in recent years. I want to sincerely thank him for his commitment,” said the Paris FC president. The Ferracci dynasty is crumbling; Pierre will probably follow Francois out the door when his presidency expires in 2027.View image in fullscreenPSG and Paris FC could not be closer neighbours.Photograph: Robbert Frank Hagens/AlamyWith Jean-Marc Gallot, who is close to Antoine Arnault, being nominated as the club’s new CEO last week, there can be no illusion that the Arnault family are now at the wheel, even if Ferracci remains the face of the club. And, despite the arrival of new faces both on and off the pitch, it is the familiar ones who continue to impress for Paris FC.It was the Jean-Philippe Krasso and Ilan Kebbal show on Friday night. Both scored in the 2-0 win. Kebbal, a technical, elusive playmaker, has gone from strength to strength since joining in 2023. Repeatedly told he would never get a professional contract because of his diminutive size, Kebbal continues to prove doubters wrong, and it is a wonder that, at 27, he has not been picked up by a “big club”. He already has four goals this season; only Joaquín Panichelli and Ansu Fati have scored more in Ligue 1.Krasso, who joined in 2024, finished last season as the second-highest scorer in Ligue 2. It looked as if he would lose his spot when the club signed Willem Geubbels in the summer but, having also scored againstNicelast weekend, he looks to have regained his place.‘Unbeatable unity’: the Holmesdale Fanatics on art and activism at Crystal PalaceRead moreSlightly further back, it is Maxime Lopez who continues to shine more than Pierre Lees-Melou, signed from Brest; and Obed Nkambadio is ensuring that former PSG goalkeeper Kevin Trapp’s prospects are limited. That isn’t to say that the new recruits are misfiring. Moses Simon, a Ligue 1 stalwart, contributed two goals and two assists since joining from Nantes, and Hamari Traoré is clearly a canny signing who brings a wealth of experience.The business done has been intelligent and tailored towards the short-term goal of keeping Paris FC in the top flight. It is a degree of continuity, on the pitch and in the dugout at least, that will also contribute to that objective being met.It is also a speed of evolution that means that PSG’s dominance will not be challenged just yet but, with the Stade Jean-Bouin attracting a sell-out crowd on Friday, PSG’s claim to the city of Paris could be challenged by their noisy neighbours. “Paris est Magique”, “Ici c’est Paris” – PSG’s signature chants may need to introduce a level of distinction to reflect that they may no longer be in a one-club city.Quick GuideLigue 1 resultsShowLyon 1-2 ToulouseLe Havre 2-2 RennesMonaco 2-2 NiceStrasbourg 5-0 AngersLille 1-1 PSGMetz 0-3 MarseilleBrest 0-0 NantesAuxerre 1-2 LensParis FC 2-0 LorientWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Talking pointsPSG dropped points for the second time this season. There were four teenagers in Luis Enrique’s starting XI as he tried to “prioritise the health of the players” aftertheir 2-1 win in Barcelona last week. As well as the absences of Ousmane Dembélé, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Désiré Doué, Marquinhos, João Neves and Fabián Ruiz, the manager also opted to bench Achraf Hakimi, Nuno Mendes and Vitinha. It offered more than a glimmer of hope to Lille, who have an excellent home record. The European champions lacked their usual control and Lille had a few chances to take the lead in the first half. When Nuno Mendes came off the bench to score a long-range free-kick, the game seemed to be going PSG’s way before the late, inevitable, twist: Ethan Mbappé scoring against his former club in front of the onlooking Kylian Mbappé. The elder Mbappé, who has beenengaged in a legal dispute with PSG since his departure to Real Madrid, made no attempt to mask his joy.View image in fullscreenEthan Mbappé celebrates after scoring Lille’s equaliser in their 1-1 draw against PSG.Photograph: Matthieu Mirville/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockMonaco and Nice saw out a 2-2 draw that suited neither side.Monaco’s draw against Manchester City last weeksomewhat papered over the cracks during a streak of poor performances; meanwhile Nice went into the derby having won just two of their 10 games this season. The Nice ultras’ boycott of the game – a decision linked to the authorities’ handling of the fixture – meant this was a derby lacking in colour, but there was no shortage of talking points on the pitch. There were four goals, three penalties and one red card. Nice took a 2-0 lead before letting the game slip, Ali Al-Abdi’s dismissal proving costly. Sofiane Diop’s two goals were cancelled out by two for Ansu Fati, who continued his excellent start at Monaco. “We’ll take it under the circumstances,” said Nice manager Franck Haise. It is a result that won’t kickstart either side’s faltering campaign, and one that could cost Adi Hutter his job.This is an article byGet French Football NewsExplore more on these topicsLigue 1Guardian Sport NetworkEuropean club footballParis FCParis Saint-GermainMonacoNiceLillefeaturesShareReuse this content"

This framed what had happened further north immediately before even more succinctly.Even if Borussia Dortmund’s meeting with RB Leipzig had the statute of a defining match of the early part of the Bundesliga season, with second facing third, on the ground expectations were more modest in North Rhine-Westphalia. Whether it was Dortmund’s Niko Kovac quoting his fellow former Bayern manager Giovanni Trapattoni (“if you can’t win, you can’t lose,” he reflected at full time) or his opposite number Ole Werner talking of his “still developing” side, it felt as if a 1-1 draw was just, leaving both parties partially sated, partially frustrated.European football: Harry Kane sets latest record in Bayern’s Frankfurt winRead moreThis is a game, to remind, that matters, and has always mattered since Leipzig’s 2016 promotion. These two clubs are chalk and cheese in outlook and what they feel they represent. If theBundesligais by now used to Leipzig – rather than having fully accepted the club conceptually – there is a special level of hostility that meets the club when they arrive at Signal Iduna Park. Now, settled and established in the top flight, Leipzig feel able to clap back.On Friday morning large displays on billboards in Dortmund city centre pictured two portions of fries, one plain and one with ketchup and mayo (for the red and white of RB), annotated with the legend: “Yellow alone doesn’t make you happy,” with the pun ofgelb(yellow) rather thangeld(money) making light of the image of Leipzig as a purely corporate project. The notices were signed: “With sporting greetings,Die Roten Bullen.” After all these years RB know they will never be considered as legitimate by swathes of Bundesliga supporters, so have taken the decision to archly lean into the villain arc; a similar advertising campaign was employed in Munich ahead of their opening-day visit there, joking of “finally a simple red and white jersey” being in town after some Bayern fans’ complaints about the champions’ latest kit.That Dortmund and Leipzig are aiming at the same sort of level only adds to the needle, even if it is not the motivation behind it. Bayern’s early season fettle has only accentuated this feeling, and seeing Luis Díaz outshine even Harry Kane this weekend, with Serge Gnabry’s resurgent form making light of the continued absence of Jamal Musiala, this weekend has been a reminder of the reality of where everyone is. Leipzig started brightly and caught BVB cold with a rehearsed dead-ball routine, finished by Christoph Baumgartner but designed by set-piece coach Jan Zimmermann, fired from his role with Dortmund’s under-23s in spring. Looking a bit leggy from their midweek Champions League exertions against Athletic Bilbao, the home side equalised through an aesthetically pleasing goal of their own, with Yan Couto putting the finishing touch to the move and though “it could have gone either way” in Baumgartner’s words, the draw felt about right.View image in fullscreenFelix Nmecha and David Raum battle it out during the 1-1 draw in Dortmund.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockIf there was a statement waiting to be made here, there was nobody with a loud enough voice to quite make it. Ridle Baku spoke of his team’s progress under Werner, arguing that his side had dug in and “played like real men, which we lacked a bit last year”, but it all felt like little steps in the right direction rather than laying down any sort of gauntlet. “We’re one of the best teams in the league,” Baku continued and there is little disputing that as stands, but there is also the feeling that it won’t quite be enough this year in terms of creating a genuine battle at the top.This game perhaps underlined just why BVB are so improved under the tutelage of Kovac, but also why there may be absolute limits to what they can achieve with him at the helm. They rode out their weariness and Leipzig’s strong spells and, in the latter stages of the game, hinted that they could be ready to step forth and win the game, particularly with the timely introductions of Pascal Gross and Jobe Bellingham. But was the belief to make an increase a tempo into a victory, or just a hope that it would? Kovac’s Dortmund can be competitive, but there is a question over whether than can really be winners. As goalkeeper Gregor Kobel suggested, the trip to Bayern after the international break will tell us plenty.Whether they, or Leipzig, should be winners is a different question. After several years of on- and off-field turbulence, maybe BVB could do with a year of simple competence, of controlling a process of steady growth; the latter aim also being that of Leipzig. For teams and clubs that regard themselves as polar opposites, they spent this weekend doing a very good impression of being in the same boat.Quick GuideBundesliga resultsShowHoffenheim 0-1 Cologne, Eintracht Frankfurt 0-3 Bayern Munich, Augsburg 3-1 Wolfsburg, Borussia Dortmund 1-1 RB Leipzig, Bayer Leverkusen 2-0 Union Berlin, Werder Bremen 1-0 St Pauli, Borussia Mönchengladbach 0-0 Freiburg, Hamburg 4-0 Mainz, Stuttgart 1-0 HeidenheimWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Talking pointsIn terms of the title race it all seemed a little academic in the light of what came next in Frankfurt, where Bayern were dazzling. Eintracht had little luck, not least in the highly debatable decision by referee Daniel Siebert and his team to disallow a potential equaliser by Jean-Mattéo Bahoya, but they didn’t help themselves either, with Robin Koch’s error paving the way for Díaz to give Bayern the lead after 15 seconds. Coming days after the 5-1 thrashing at Atlético, it capped a week that has made clear just what the standards are now. “We need a different edge to us,” said sporting director Markus Krösche, “or we will be punished mercilessly.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not just goals for Ernest Poku and teenager Christian Kofane (following a first Champions League goal with a first in the Bundesliga) but in the team’s collective work out of possession, vital against a team like Union and personified by Malik Tillman.View image in fullscreenChristian Kofane gives the Bayer Leverkusen faithful room to breathe after scoring the second against Union Berlin.Photograph: Rolf Vennenbernd/APUp the road and just a point behind are Köln, given another single goal away win, this time at Hoffenheim, by a fine goal by their teenage star Said El Mala on his first start. “Said is a good boy,” said coach Lukas Kwasniok, “a street footballer who simply has God-given gifts, pace and dribbling,” while urging caution given all the excitement surrounding him. Good luck to him with dampening the hype. Köln’s 10 points so far, good enough for sixth, represents the best start by a promoted side in eight years.Fellow promoted side Hamburg also had a huge result, surprisingly hammering Mainz 4-0 after a week in which they lost standouts Warmed Omari and Fábio Vieira to injury, while young forwards also shone in Augsburg, with 18-year-old American Noahkai Banks and 20-year-old Mert Kömür both on the mark in their much-needed 3-1 win over Wolfsburg, ending a run of four straight losses for Sandro Wagner’s team. “This must continue to be our way,” said Wagner after the game. “It was great fun.

That becomes back-to-back world champions – a historic first for England on the world stage.“That inspires 3 million passionate Red Roses fans who are united in pride and purpose. And that generates over £60m in revenue – powering a future where meaningful profits are fuelling the growth of the community game.”Teasdale said that women’s rugby had made huge strides from when she started at the RFU in 2011, when there were just 12,500 registered players, “and in some clubs whilst women weren’t stopped from playing, they certainly weren’t welcomed either”. But she insisted that, despite the progress since, there was still more to be done to boost the game, even during a cost of living crisis.“Last weekend we witnessed an extraordinary milestone as 82,000 fans flooded through the gates at Allianz Stadium to see our Red Roses claim the 2025 Rugby World Cup,” she said. “And looking ahead to 2030, we want to keep this momentum going.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 47-year-old 2003 World Cup winner admitted he was having trouble accepting what his diagnosis means for the future but that he intends to stay positive.Among the most decorated forwards to play for England, he earned 71 caps and led his country at the 2011 World Cup in New Zealand, earning the nickname “Mad Dog” as an all-action, hard-hitting flanker.There are good guys and then there is Lewis Moody – MND has cruelly singled out the bravest of men | Robert KitsonRead moreSince revealing his diagnosis, tributes have poured in from a host of teammates, the Rugby Football Union and the British & Irish Lions. His former Leicester teammates Geordan Murphy and Leon Lloyd have set up aGoFundMe pagefor Moody’s family and associated causes. By lunchtime on Monday, more than £30,000 had been donated.Moody is the latest high-profile rugby player to be diagnosed with the terminal disease.The former Scotland and Lions forward Doddie Weir,the England rugby league player Rob Burrowandthe South Africa scrum-half Joost van der Westhuizenhave all died as a result of MND in the last decade.“This has been incredibly hard to process and a huge shock to me and my family,” Moody said in a statement. “I feel fit and well in myself and I’m focused on staying positive, living life and dealing with the changes I will experience as they come.”In an interview with the BBC, with his wife Annie alongside him, Moody explained that his symptoms are currently “very minor”, revealing some muscle wasting in the hand and shoulder but saying: “I’m still capable of doing anything and everything. And hopefully that will continue for as long as is possible.”An emotional Moody added: “There’s something about looking the future in the face and not wanting to really process that at the minute. It’s not that I don’t understand where it’s going. We understand that. But there is absolutely a reluctance to look the future in the face for now.“I don’t want to get stuck in the negativity or doom and gloom. We know the reality, I want to stay positive, I want to stay in the moment, I want to learn and understand what it is, speak to more people and see where we can help.”MND can prove fatal within 12 to 18 months of diagnosis, with people in Britain believed to have a one in 300 risk of developing the neurological condition. About one in five cases are believed to be related to genetics and it was announced last year that relatives of people with the condition were to beoffered genetic testingthat would tell them if they were also likely to develop it.View image in fullscreenLewis Moody in action for England against New Zealand in 2006.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianWhile a number of studies have suggested that professional rugby players are more likely to develop MND, at present there is no link proving causation. Rugby – and in particular Kevin Sinfield, the friend and former Leeds Rhinos teammate of Burrow – has been instrumental in terms of fundraising to promote research into finding a cure.Sinfield, currently a coach with the England rugby union team, said: “I’m obviously very saddened by the news. I’d like to wish Lewis, and all his family and friends, the very best. I’ll support in any way I can. We have to keep fighting MND together.” Ed Slater, the former Gloucester and fellow Leicester player who has been diagnosed with the disease,posted on Xthat he was “absolutely devastated” for Moody and his family. “We will be here for you as and when you need.”Everyone wants answers for former rugby players like Lewis Moody but they are hard to come by | Andy BullRead moreMoody spent 14 years at Leicester and was a huge part of the club’s golden era, helping the Tigers to seven Premiership titles and two European cups. With England, he was part of the 2003 squad who won the World Cup in Australia, and won the lineout that led to Jonny Wilkinson’s drop goal to seal England’s success in the final. In 2004 he was awarded an MBE for services to rugby.“We are all deeply saddened and distressed to learn that Lewis Moody has been diagnosed with motor neurone disease,” said the Rugby Football Union chief executive, Bill Sweeney. “Lewis represented England, the British & Irish Lions and his clubs Leicester Tigers and Bath with both brilliance and distinction – one of the toughest and most fearless players ever to don a back-row shirt in the game, earning the respect and admiration of teammates, opponents and supporters alike all over the world. His contribution to rugby, both on and off the field, reflects the very best of our sport’s values.”Since his retirement Moody has led an active lifestyle and participated in a number of ultra-endurance challenges. In 2014 he set up the Lewis Moody Foundation to support those affected by brain tumours and said he intends to keep raising money for his charity as well as those associated with MND. Revealing he received his diagnosis two weeks ago, Moody said that had undergone physiotherapy after noticing weakness in his shoulder while in the gym. A series of scans then showed nerves in his brain and spinal cord had been damaged. Moody said that telling his sons, 17-year-old Dylan – a goalkeeper for Southampton – and Ethan, 15, was “heartbreaking”.Moody burst on to the scene at Leicester and in 1996 he became the club’s youngest ever player in a league match. He went on to make 223 appearances for the club before joining Bath for two years in 2010. The Leicester chief executive, Andrea Pinchen, said: “The figures, trophies and awards tell you what an incredible player Lewis was, but that is only half the story. As an individual, his commitment to his club along with his warmth and passion shone through, which endeared him to teammates, staff and supporters alike.”Moody suffered a number of head injuries throughout his career and in retirement he has been a staunch advocate of concussion research and improved regulations around player welfare. He did not jointhe class action lawsuit, which includes former teammates such as the World Cup winning hooker Steve Thompson,who has been diagnosed with early onset dementia, however. Thompson and more than a hundred others are suing the RFU, the Welsh Rugby Union and World Rugby but Moody has said that he has no regrets over his playing career.Explore more on these topicsLewis MoodyRugby unionEngland rugby union teamNeuroscienceMotor neurone diseaseRugby World Cup 2003HealthnewsShareReuse this content"

If you were a boxing promoter you wouldn’t put us together – it wouldn’t be allowed.“That’s rough – but are our players undervalued or their players overvalued? There’s a context to that as well. We don’t go off values, but the simple fact is they don’t just have one team. They have two, three, four and France and others have the same.“They have a player who cost £100m in midfield [Declan Rice], players worth £60m, £80m.

I need a break. A break from the monotonous daily grind of life on the tour, the suitcases, the results, the pressure, the same faces (sorry, girls), everything that comes with this life.“There’s only so much I can deal with and take as an individual women, all whilst competing with the best female athletes in the world.”“If this makes me weak, then so be it, I’m weak. However, I know I am strong and will get stronger by being away, recharging, regrouping and reenergising. It’s time I listened to myself for a change, my mind, my heart and my body.”Kasatkina opted to switch nationality after leaving Russia fearing for her safety having criticised their anti-LGBTQ+ laws and the war on Ukraine. Initially living in Dubai she moved to Melbourne and became a permanent Australian resident in March.She subsequently became engaged to longtime girlfriend Natalia Zabiiako, a former Olympic figure skater, who won a silver medal for Russia at the 2018 Winter Olympics having earlier competed for her native Estonia.Kasatkina said she had not been able to see her father, who remains in Russia, for four years.A French Open semi-finalist in 2022, Kasatkina has finished the last four calendar years ranked in the top 10 but is currently 19th after a modest season in which she won 19 and lost 21 matches. She will almost certainly be out of the top 20 by the time the Australian Open comes around.The 28-year-old said she will be back in 2026, “energised and ready to rock”, and the build-up to her home grand slam is presumably a return target.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAustralia SportFree newsletterGet a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports deskEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The AFL grand final nine days ago averaged 4.18 million, also with a “reach” of 6.4 million.Swaggering Reece Walsh reaches NRL summit with ascendant grand final display | Jack SnapeRead moreNine’s managing director for streaming and broadcast, Amanda Laing, said the “phenomenal ratings” showed the network’s “unwavering commitment” to the code.“We believe the greatest game of all should be accessible to everyone, and by providing that universal, free-to-air access, we are helping to grow the sport’s fan base in every corner of the country,” she said. “To see that commitment reflected in record-breaking audience numbers is incredibly rewarding.”The NRL audience was helped by a competitive contest, given the result was not certain until the final minute and meaning more fans tuned in for longer. On the other hand, Brisbane’s defeat of Geelong in the AFL decider looked likely early in the final term.Thebreakthrough is timely for the NRLas it continues negotiations on a new broadcast deal commencing in 2028. Nine is expected to bid to show matches across free-to-air and its streaming platform Stan.Others, such as Seven – which recently won the rights to next year’s Rugby League World Cup – and pay-TV incumbent Foxtel/Kayo are likely to take part in negotiations, and the NRL hopes new streaming players can inflate the value of rights beyond what the AFL receives for its seven-year, $4.5bn deal with Seven and Foxtel that began this year.Line graph showing the grand final television audiences for AFL and NRL over the yearsThe last time an NRL grand final attracted a larger television audience than the AFL was in 2015, when the Broncos went down to the Cowboys thanks to a late Johnathan Thurston field goal. Hawthorn defeated West Coast in that year’s AFL decider in a one-sided affair marking the Hawks’ third flag in a row.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAustralia SportFree newsletterGet a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports deskEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They also argue that AI performers do not get ill, do not need to have days off, do not get exhausted at the end of a shift, or feel humiliated by the demands made by clients.“Do you prefer your porn with a lot of abuse and human trafficking, or would you rather talk to an AI?” Steve Jones, who runs an AI porn site, asked. “We hear about human trafficking, girls being forced to be on camera 10 hours a day. You’ll never have a human trafficked AI girl. You’ll never have a girl who is forced or coerced into a sex scene that she’s so humiliated by, that she ends up killing herself. AI doesn’t get humiliated, it’s not going to kill itself.”View image in fullscreen‘Do you prefer your porn with a lot of abuse and human trafficking, or would you rather talk to an AI?’ says Steve Jones of porn.ai.Photograph: Bjoern Steinz/Panos PicturesMost sites provide users with a selection of ready-made girlfriend options on their homepages – predominantly smiling, white women in their early 20s – but also offer subscribers the chance to create their own fantasy online companion. The options provide insights into the website developers’ views on optimal female prototypes. On one site, available professions range from film star, yoga teacher and florist to lawyer and gynaecologist. Possible personality options include “submissive: obedient, yielding and happy to follow”, “innocent: optimistic, naive, and sees world with wonder”, and “caregiver: nurturing, protective and always there to offer comfort”. Users can dictate age, opting for teen models if they want them, and specify hair, eye and skin colours and breast sizes.Online brothels, sex robots, simulated rape: AI is ushering in a new age of violence against women | Laura BatesRead moreThe rising popularity of AI girlfriends has prompted unease among campaigners for women’s rights, who note that they embed unhelpful stereotypes. In her book The New Age of Sexism,Laura Batesobserves that AI companions are “programmed to be nice and pliant and subservient and tell you what you want to hear”.Amidrising concernabout AI-generated child sexual abuse imagery, developers at the Prague conference discussed ways that built-in moderation systems might prevent users from attempting to create illegal material, using key words and phrases such as “kid” or “little sister” to trigger alarms. But many sites allow users to choose to dress their AI girlfriend in school uniforms.View image in fullscreenMerchandise at the TES conference in Prague.Photograph: Bjoern Steinz/Panos PicturesAn employee of Candy.ai, one of the new AI dating sites exhibiting at the conference, said the site’s AI girlfriends offered a range of services. “If you want more adult-type relationships, like porn, we have this content. Or if you prefer to have deep conversations, that’s there as well. It really depends on what the user needs,” he said, while asking for his name not to be printed. Most users are heterosexual men, although AI boyfriends are also available. Some of the ready-made AI girlfriends are programmed to be willing to remove their clothes immediately. “Others will say: ‘No, I don’t know you.’ So you need to evolve the relationship with them in order to ask for something like this. It’s like a game, and the goal is to develop that full relationship,” the employee said.The development of AI girlfriend sites has been made possible by advances inlarge language modelsthat allow for more realistic conversations with chatbots, and rapid developments in AI image-making. Most sites still largely operate with text and images, although short AI-generated videos are becoming more widespread. The demand is highest in the 18-24 age group, among users who have grown up playing video games and creating avatars.There has been a rush of new businesses joining the sector in the past year. “AI products are appearing like mushrooms. It’s super dynamic right now – they appear, they burn out and they’re replaced by another 10,” Alina Mitt, of Joi AI, a site specialising in “ai-lationships”, said. “You need to be brave and strong to stay in this market. It’s like a bloody war.”Developers gave presentations highlighting the rapid improvements in the realism of AI-generated pornographic images and progress in moving towards convincing-looking AI video clips. Daniel Keating, the chief executive of a company that offers users the chance to talk to and watch AI girlfriends, gave a presentation aiming to show delegates the difference between mediocre AI-generated women and higher-quality AI girlfriends. His site offers users a selection of dozens of AI-generated women in their underwear; he highlighted how poor-quality AI gives women’s skin “an overly polished, plastic smoothness, shiny in the wrong places”, while a good-quality AI girlfriend incorporates “natural skin textures, bumps, imperfections, moles, freckles, slight asymmetries that appear much more natural”.View image in fullscreenThe UK regulator Ofcom highlights updates to Britain’s Online Safety Act at TES Prague.Photograph: Bjoern Steinz/Panos PicturesHis company was licensing images of established adult performers to create AI twins, allowing them to generate non-stop income. “It’s a win. Costs are lower. Creators love this because they don’t have to get dressed up and shoot the content,” he said.An advertising executive withAshley Madison, a dating website for people who may be married and are seeking to have discreet relationships, said she was concerned by the rapid growth of sites promoting AI relationships. “AI dating is very new for us. How do we deal with competitors which allow you to build your own fantasy rather than having a real connection with a woman?” she asked, also requesting not to be named. “Some people opt out of having real connections because they want to build whatever they want in their head. In the end when you want to actually meet someone, no one’s going to fulfil that expectation.”“It’s not replacing going out on a date and getting a girlfriend or having a lover, wife or a relationship. AI is a good place to let younger people practice their social skills,” Jones said, adding that AI allowed people to behave badly without consequences. “People will say things to an AI that would be abusive if they said them to a real person. Like: ‘Hey stupid slut, what’s up?’ In a fantasy roleplaying game, people like to be different than how they are in the real world.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)PornographySex workSexDatingnewsShareReuse this content"

Shares of AMD surged more than 30% and added about $80bn to its market capitalization after the announcement.“We view this deal as certainly transformative, not just for AMD, but for the dynamics of the industry,” said Forrest Norrod, AMD’s executive vice-president.The latest deal, among a string of investment commitments, is a testament to OpenAI and the broader AI industry’s voracious appetite for computing power as companies race toward developing AI technology that meets or exceeds human intelligence.Sam Altman, the OpenAI CEO, has said the biggest constraint on his company’s growth is access to computing power, which comes in the form of enormous datacenters filled with advanced semiconductor chips. Last week, Nvidia announced it would invest $100bn in OpenAI, forging a close alliance between two of the leading firms in artificial intelligence.Nvidia to invest $100bn in OpenAI, bringing the two AI firms togetherRead moreMonday’s agreement covers the deployment of hundreds of thousands of AMD’s AI chips, or graphics processing units (GPUs), equivalent to six gigawatts, over several years beginning in the second half of 2026. This is roughly equivalent to the energy needs of 5m US households, or the electricity produced yearly by the Hoover Dam three times over. AMD saidOpenAIwould build a one-gigawatt facility based on its forthcoming MI450 series of chips beginning next year.As part of the arrangement, AMD issued a warrant that gives OpenAI the ability to buy up to 160m shares of AMD for 1 cent each over the course of the chips deal.AMD executives expect the deal to net tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue. Because of the ripple effect of the agreement, AMD said it expected to receive more than $100bn in new revenue over four years from OpenAI and other customers.“Other people are going to come along with it because this is really the pioneer, a pioneer in the industry that has a lot of influence over the broader ecosystem,” Mat Hein, AMD’s strategy chief said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Otherwise the new model is a direct replacement for theSeries 10, matching it in design, dimensions and features, with most of its upgrades coming from software. That makes it one of the very best smartwatches available, even if it hasn’t changed much.The Series 11 is also £30 cheaper in the UK, costing from £369 (€449/$399/A$679), and sits above the newly revamped £219 Watch SE at the low end and the £749 Ultra 3 at the high end.View image in fullscreenThe Series 11 comes in space grey, which was a colour first introduced with theiPhone 5s in 2013. Everything that is old is new again.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianLike last year’s Series 10, the new model is only 9.7mm thick, which makes it a slim fit to the wrist, easy to sneak under cuffs and more comfortable at night. It is light, slim and easy to live with.The 2,000nit OLED screen is plenty bright for seeing indoors and out, remaining clear to read off-angle, which makes glancing down at the time or notifications easy. It is covered by glass thatApplesays is twice as scratch resistant as before, although not as hard as sapphire, which is reserved for the more expensive titanium models.The new watch has the same S10 chip as last year’s model but now supports optional 5G and stronger reception for those times when you’re in the wilderness. The batteries have increased in capacity by 9% and 11% for the 42mm and 46mm watches respectively.The 46mm lasted a good two days in testing with sleep tracking but without exercise. Most people will just about be able to track two days and two nights before needing a charge, which takes 66 minutes using a 20W or greater power adaptor (not included), hitting about 70% in 30 minutes. If you do go out for a run, it will last about eight hours of tracking, which is long enough for a marathon or two.SpecificationsCase size:42 or 46mmCase thickness:9.7mmWeight:about 30g or 37gProcessor:S10Storage:64GBOperating system:watchOS 26Water resistance:50 metres (5ATM)Sensors:HR, ECG, spO2, temp, depth, mic, speaker, NFC, GNSS, compass, altimeterConnectivity:Bluetooth 5.3, wifi 4, NFC, UWB, optional 5GwatchOS 26View image in fullscreenThe Flow watch face is fun but I struggle to read the time at a glance.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Series 11 ships withwatchOS 26, which runs on all models from2020’s Series 6and newer. It adds Apple’s new Liquid Glass design, which makes most elements semi-translucent, and adds two new watch faces: a large digital face called Flow that responds to movement and an analogue face called Exactograph, which breaks out hours, minutes and seconds into their own dials.The best new feature is the wrist-flick gesture, where you rapidly twist your wrist away from you and then back to dismiss things and return to the watch face. It works even without raising your wrist to look at the watch, meaning you can dismiss alarms with a satisfying flick of the wrist.Hypertension, sleep and AI workoutsView image in fullscreenHypertension alerts use the same optical sensor on the back of the watch as used for heart rate and blood oxygen measurement, no pressure cuff required.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Apple Watch features the same comprehensive health monitoring suite of tools from previous models but adds a couple of new features and a redesigned workout app.Hypertension alertslook for signs of high blood pressure over a 30-day period, notifying you to get yourself checked out if your heart rate data suggests you may have a hidden problem.The new sleep score metric makes Apple’s sleep tracking easier to interpret, similar to competitors from Google, Samsung and others. Each morning the watch shows a score out of 100 that is broken down into three categories: duration, bedtime and interruptions, which are all self-explanatory and viewable in the Health app on the iPhone, too.View image in fullscreenSleep score makes it easier to understand whether you’re getting good enough sleep at a glance, with more details if you need it.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianWorkout buddy is an AI coach that uses your previous workout data to give you pep talks before and after workouts, such as recognising that you have already run three times this week and the level of effort you put it. It also provides audible heads-up when you reach certain milestones during exercise, such as a particular pace, heart rate, distance, time or other metrics.There is a choice of three voices, which speak to you over Bluetooth headphones connected to your watch for one of 12 activities, including walking, running or cycling. However, it only works if you alsocarry your iPhone 15 Pro or laterwith you, which I found irritating enough that I would forgo the feature to avoid being encumbered with a phone on runs.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe recycled aluminium frame feels high quality, slim and comfortable on your wrist.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianApple says the battery should last more than1,000 full charge cycleswith at least 80% of its original capacity and can be replaced for£95. Repairs costbetween £295 and £389depending on the model.It contains more than 40% recycled material including aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, lithium, rare earth elements, steel, tin, titanium and tungsten. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling for devices, and breaks down the watch’s environmental impactin its report.PriceThe Series 11 comes in two sizes (42 and 46mm), a choice of materials and the option of 5G that requires an eSim and compatible phone plan add-on. It starts at £369 (€449/$399/A$679). The 5G models cost an extra £100 (€120/$100/A$170).For comparison, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 costs£749, the Apple Watch SE 3 costs from£219, the Google Pixel Watch 4 costs from£349and the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 costs from£294.VerdictThe Series 11 hasn’t changed the winning Apple Watch formula but it has added two things that most will appreciate: more scratch-resistant glass and longer battery life.The slim design, fast charging and two-day battery life make the watch easy to live with, particularly for sleep tracking and use as a silent alarm clock. The wrist-flick gesture is so good every watch should have it, while compatibility with straps and charging pucks for all previous Apple Watches is a great bonus for those upgrading. A price cut in the UK is welcome, too.The glass-like design of watchOS 26 may take some getting used to but the software works just the same and introduces some useful features including hypertension alerts, which could be lifesaving. Workout buddy is the most interesting feature. It was a far more positive experience than I was expecting but relies on working out with your phone, too, which is a bit of a drag for runs.Overall, the Series 11 is one of the very best smartwatches available for the iPhone, and if you have an older watch such as aSeries 6, you will see a massive upgrade. However, this year its status as the default Apple Watch to buy has been challenged by the revamped Watch SE 3, which offers better value if not quite as many features or as refined a design.Pros:great always-on screen, slim design, double-tap and wrist-flick gestures, top health tracking, great activity tracking, workout buddy AI trainer, 50-metre water resistance, two-day battery life, optional 5G, long software support, recycled materials, takes older watch straps.Cons:expensive, only works with an iPhone, no third-party watch faces, looks the same as all recent models, undercut by Watch SE.Explore more on these topicsApple WatchAppleSmartwatchesWearable technologyGadgetsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Since then, Amazon has paid more than $2.6m in compensation to roughly 950 workers from multiple countries.But two years later, many migrants are still waiting for their recruiting fees to be repaid – and they are not sure if they will ever get financial redress. Thirty-six of the 67 workers interviewed by the Guardian for this story said they had not received payment fromAmazoneven though they paid stiff fees to get placed at jobs at the company’s Saudi operations.“I want to tell Amazon: If you want to return money, give it to us quickly,” said Rameshwar Sharma, a worker from Nepal who said he has yet to receive compensation. “Don’t make fools of us. We’re not begging. We just want justice.”Revealed: Amazon linked to trafficking of workers in Saudi ArabiaRead moreIn a statement, an Amazon spokesperson, Margaret Callahan, said the company had“worked quickly and diligently to identify individuals who should be reimbursed for recruitment fees they paid to secure jobs with third-party vendors, in violation of our Supply Chain Standards”.She added that “we know we aren’t yet done” and that the company “will continue to issue reimbursements as soon as possible”.A labor rights expert at the human rights group Amnesty International, which investigated Amazon’s labor practices in Saudi Arabia, said the logjam in getting payments to workers was unacceptable.“Far too many are still waiting, and every delay prolongs their suffering,” Amnesty International’s Ella Knight said. “For one of the world’s richest companies, the sums involved are a drop in the ocean – yet for workers, timely justice could be life-changing.”Amazon, she said,“should act swiftly to fully uphold its human rights responsibilities – providing meaningful redress to all affected migrant workers”.Some workers interviewed for this story said the problem goes beyond a matter of delays. They say they have been flatly told they do not qualify for payments even though they shelled out high recruiting fees and worked at Amazon’s Saudi operations.Several said they were told they had been denied payment because their time working at Amazon had ended before October 2023. A staffer at Impactt, a non-profit organization that is serving as a go-between for Amazon in the compensation process, left a phone message for one Nepali worker that the payments had been made only to those who had left work at Amazon in October 2023 or later.“Why do dates matter to them?” another Nepali worker, Mitra Lal Sapkota, said. Impactt informed him, he said, that he wouldn’t get a refund of his recruiting fees because his work at Amazon in Saudi Arabia ended in 2022.“What Amazon is doing feels like a pretense,” he said.Amazon did not answer a question about whether October 2023 had served as a cutoff date for payment qualifications. It also did not answer a question about the criteria it was using to determine who gets paid and who doesn’t.Questions about the treatment of workers who toiled at Amazon’s Saudi warehouses gained wide attention through an investigation published on 10 October 2023 by the Guardian, NBC News, theInternational Consortium of Investigative JournalistsandArab Reporters for Investigative Journalism. The media partnersrevealedthat labor firms had required workers seeking jobs at Amazon’s Saudi warehouses to pay between roughly $830 to $2,300 in recruiting fees – payments that violated United States and United Nations standards as well as Amazon’s ownsupply chain standards.After being informed about the media outlets’ investigation and a separate investigation by Amnesty International, Amazon promised to improve its labor practices and refund recruiting fees to laborers who worked at the company’s Saudi operations.Amazon paid out roughly $1.9m to more than 700 workers by February 2024. But since then, the volume of payments has slowed and many workers have been voicing complaints about being left out. Thirty-three of the 44 current and former Amazon contract workers interviewed for a December 2024 Guardianstorysaid they had not yet received reimbursement from the company. Amazon said at the time that “these are complex processes that take time, and we’re doing our best to expedite reimbursement.”Since that follow-up story ran, Amazon has paid roughly 100 workers more than $330,000 in compensation.Migrant laborers interviewed for this story are from Nepal, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Kenya.MD Foisal Mia, a Bangladeshi laborer, said he paid more than $3,500 to a recruiting firm to get contract work at Amazon’s Saudi operations, taking out a loan to cover those costs. He said he had not heard from Amazon or Impactt about any compensation. He wants Amazon to know that a refund of his recruiting fees would make a big difference for him and his family.“My family is poor. It’s difficult for us to run a household,” said Mia, who now works at a vegetable store in Kuwait. “Return my fees. This money is nothing for you, but it’s a life to me.”Sonu Kumar Mandal, a Nepali laborer, went to work at an Amazon warehouse in 2021 in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, after he paid a recruiting firm $2,100 in fees and other costs – a huge sum for him and his family. To cover that cost, he said, he took out a loan from a village moneylender at a steep annual interest rate of 36%.But he couldn’t pay off his loan as his income went towards supporting his financially struggling family.“I have no money to pay the interest now. I don’t have a job,” he said. “If Amazon gives my money back, I would be able to clear my loan.”Several workers who have not received compensation said Amazon could have informed them about the refund process if it genuinely wanted to compensate them.“Amazon has my phone number, my email, my passport, everything,” said Kishor Kumar Chaudhary, another Nepali worker. “If they wanted to contact me, they could do it easily. But why didn’t they contact me?”Pradip Kumar Mahato, another former Amazon worker from Nepal, filled out an online compensation form and sent voice messages to an Impactt staffer in July. In a voice message sent to Mahato, the staffer replied: “I’ll talk about you at a higher level. If any positive response comes, I’ll contact you … Your chance of getting [money] is very slim … We’re trying, but there is no guarantee.”Callahan, the Amazon spokesperson, said the company has implemented robust grievance mechanisms for workers to report concerns. Amazon maintains awebpagewhere individuals, including former workers, can submit complaints in multiple languages regarding concerns about the company’s labor and environmental practices.Explore more on these topicsAmazonSaudi ArabiaWorkers' rightsE-commerceMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The app allows users to generate short videos based on a text prompt. The Guardian’s review of the feed of AI-generated videos last week showed copyrighted characters from shows such as SpongeBob SquarePants, South Park, Pokémon and Rick and Morty.The Wall Street Journalreported last weekthat before OpenAI released Sora 2, the company told talent agencies and studios if they didn’t want their copyrighted material replicated by the video generator, they would have to opt out.OpenAI told the Guardian content owners can flag copyright infringement using a “copyright disputes form”, but that individual artists or studios cannot have a blanket opt-out. Varun Shetty, OpenAI’s head of media partnerships, said: “We’ll work with rights holders to block characters from Sora at their request and respond to takedown requests.”LiveOpenAI Sora 2 generated video 1On Saturday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, said ina blog postthat the company had been “taking feedback” from users, rights holders and other groups, and would make changes as a result.He said rights holders would be given more “granular control” over the generation of characters, similar to how people can opt-in to share their own likeness in the app, but with “additional controls”.“We are hearing from a lot of rightsholders who are very excited for this new kind of ‘interactive fan fiction’ and think this new kind of engagement will accrue a lot of value to them, but want the ability to specify how their characters can be used (including not at all).”Hollywood is in a flap! AI ‘actors’ are ‘trained’ on real actors who will never be paid for it | First Dog on the MoonRead moreAltman said OpenAI would “let rightsholders decide how to proceed” and that there would be some “edge cases of generations” that get through the platform’s guardrails that should not.He said the company would also “have to somehow make money” from video generation, and already the platform was seeing people generating much more than expected per user. He said this could mean payment to rights holders who grant permission for their characters to be generated.“The exact model will take some trial and error to figure out, but we plan to start very soon,” Altman said. “Our hope is that the new kind of engagement is even more valuable than the revenue share, but of course we want both to be valuable.”He said there would be a high rate of change, similar to the early ChatGPT days, and there would be “some good decisions and some missteps”.Explore more on these topicsOpenAIArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

For others, it’s a waterproof hooded scarf to keep your hair dry in style – or a hair dryer to blast it again.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.And it seems that for some of you, it means fringed party skirts and a cheese box through the post. Who are we to judge? Here are the things you loved the most this month.The mask for better sleepView image in fullscreenMyHalos eye mask£14.99 at MyHalos£9.99 at AmazonWhen lifelong insomniac and Filter reviewer Jane Hoskyn tested out some ofthe best (and weirdest) sleep hacks, she didn’t expect a basic sub-£10 eye mask to result in nine hours of shuteye. “The best masks genuinely block out all traces of light without pulling flat or tight across your eyes,” she wrote – and the MyHalos was her “perfect match”.The bargain beauty calendarView image in fullscreenW7 Advent calendar£19.95 at W7£19.95 at AmazonIf you’re surprised to see an Advent calendar top the list of your favourite products in September, the phenomenon ofbeauty Advent calendarsmust have passed you by. People spend hundreds on these selections of beauty products that promise big discounts on the value of the items inside. But your favourite – perhaps not surprisingly – is the “staggeringly cheap” W7 calendar. The products inside “rival some of the best in the business”, according to our reviewer Sarah Matthews (although predictably many of them are minis).The office chair upgradeView image in fullscreenSlouch Task One£289 at SlouchIf you’re still sitting in a dining chair when you work from home, please stop. Often second only to our mattress as our most used piece of furniture, it’s just as important that your work chair be supportive and comfortable.Our reviewer Stuart Andrews works long hours and nights at his desk (plus many hours of gaming), so he was the perfect person to test out thebest office chairs. This Slouch Task One was his overall favourite in testing, giving “everything you’d want from an office chair”.The eco-friendly scourerView image in fullscreenKilo non-scratch scourer£13.47 at eBay£3.75 at AmazonCotton scourers are a great way to cut down on plastic waste in the kitchen. “These things are absolutely brilliant for washing-up,” said Filter reader Maggie inour guide to sustainable swaps. “They don’t get clogged up with food the way a sponge scourer does, but I chuck mine in the wash with the towels every week to keep it fresh.”The stylish rain coverView image in fullscreenWaterproof hooded scarf£39.15 at EtsyIt’s hard to stay looking stylish when it’s raining one minute, sunny the next. But our fashion writer, Charlotte Gornall, has created theultimate guide to looking good in the rain– and your favourite tip has been this waterproof hooded scarf. “If your jacket doesn’t have a hood, why not accessorise with one?” Charlotte wrote. It channels “the late Queen Elizabeth in all the right ways.”The letterbox cheeseboardView image in fullscreenPerfect British cheeseboard£10 at ButlersOf all the gifts that can fit through a letterbox these days, is there anything better than a good-quality cheeseboard? Clearly not, as your favouritefrom our guidehas been this selection of three cheeses (Blacksticks Blue, Button Mill and Sunday Best) with Tracklements fig relish and Peter’s Yard crackers.The best budget hair dryerView image in fullscreenBaByliss Hydro-Fusion£60 at Lookfantastic£31.99 at Amazon“In my years of reviewing beauty tech, it was upgrading my hair dryer that made the biggest difference to my beauty routine,” wrote Sarah Matthews in our guide tothe best hair dryers. “Modern hair dryers have stepped up their game.” Sarah’s favourite budget option, the BaByliss Hydro-Fusion, is “well built and powerful” – and currently reduced to £31.99 at Amazon.The mattress topperView image in fullscreenPanda Bamboo topper, double£139.95 at Panda“A mattress topper is like a slice of cheese in a burger,” writes our reviewer Jane Hoskyn. “Not strictly necessary, but potentially transformative, especially if your bed has all the cosiness of stale bread.” Jane found the Panda Bamboo the most cooling, despite its memory foam construction, in her test of thebest mattress toppers. Many of you were clearly tempted by the idea that “you won’t feel the fidgeting of a restless partner”.The party skirtView image in fullscreenFringe detail mini£50 at M&S“This M&S skirt is a total winner,” wrote Jess Cartner-Morley in herSeptember style essentials. “I mean, look at it. All-over tassels, a great length (short but not too short) and a chic off-white colour.” And clearly many of you agreed, as this party-season skirt was your favourite in the piece.The last-minute clothes steamView image in fullscreenRussell Hobbs Steam Genie£28 at John Lewis“I begin every school year with the resolve to become the kind of woman who irons her clothes,” writes Kate McCusker, inour guide to back-to-the-grind style for all ages. “But as I’m still waiting for this to happen, a quick go-over with a steamer in the morning has saved many an outfit from looking as if I slept in it.” Many Filter readers are clearly still waiting for this to happen, too.The ceramic frying panView image in fullscreenProCook Elite Tri-Ply£48 at ProCookWhile faddy kitchen gadgets come and go, the trusty frying pan remains one of the most used implements in our kitchens. We want one that will last, won’t be a nightmare to clean and, preferably, doesn’t come coated in forever chemicals. Is that really too much to ask? Dale Berning Sawa tested 12 of thebest frying panswith some of the most challenging foods around: salted caramel, sticky marinated pork and – of course – scrambled eggs. Your favourite was this ProCook ceramic-coated frying pan, which stood out “thanks to its pleasing build quality and relatively affordable price” – perhaps because it’s currently reduced.The MP3 player – no, reallyView image in fullscreenSnowsky Echo Mini£66.99 at eBayIf you thought you’d entered a time warp when you saw the Advent calendar above, I can’t imagine how you’re feeling to spot anMP3 player(especially one shaped like a cassette tape). But digital audio players are back, appealing to many who want to disconnect from streaming platforms and take control of their own music. This budget option from FiiO subbrand Snowsky leans “into the charm of retro rather nicely”, wrote Alan Martin in his test of the best, while “providing a far richer soundscape than that offered by any other budget device I tested”.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThe Filter UK newsletterSleepChristmasWorking from homeEthical and green livingCheeseBeautynewslettersShareReuse this content"

It crashed on to the terrace where James and his partner, Andrew, had been breakfasting minutes earlier, smashing the table and chairs and crushing the windscreen of their hire car.TheAirbnbcottage in Provence, France, was engulfed by the branches that broke the living room window and damaged the roof. “I was sure the ceiling was going to come in,” says James. “If it had fallen minutes earlier we would have been seriously injured or killed.”It took a day for the host to winch the tree off the cottage and make emergency repairs, but the traumatised couple feared the property may be structurally unsound and decided to book into a hotel for the rest of their week’s holiday.Airbnb was unperturbed. “We understand this may have caused some inconvenience to you,” it wrote in the first of many identical AI-generated messages before closing the unresolved case with a cheery “Keep safe. Stay healthy.”The host was unperturbed too. “All that happened to you was that you heard a loud noise and saw a tree lying on the terrace,” she said in a reply to the couple’s request for a refund. “You have chosen to remember the worry and trauma instead of celebrating a unique memory.”Now the summer season has ended, the holiday horror stories are flooding in to Guardian Money.If it had fallen minutes earlier we would have been seriously injured or killedJames, Airbnb customerUnlucky travellers are reporting being locked in or out of their accommodation – if it existed or left stranded at night in strange cities if it did not. There are tales of filthy bedrooms, unsafe equipment and illegal sublets. One factor unites these ruined holidays: they were booked via online booking platforms, which refused a refund.The growth of sites such as Airbnb and Booking.com has prompted a rise in travellers putting together their own holidays. The companies pour the world’s property portfolio on to a website and promise to sate wanderlust on a budget.Consumer protections have not caught up with their popularity, however.View image in fullscreenThe 100-year-old oak that smashed into the side of the Airbnb property James and Andrew were staying in Provence.Package-deal customers have legal recourse for holiday nightmares under thePackage Travel and Linked Travel Arrangements, but those who book accommodation via third-party platforms will find themselves at the mercy of their host.Some platforms advertise additional protections, but your contract is with the person or company providing the accommodation.James and Andrew had paid £931 for their week in the Provençal cottage and when they felt too unsafe to return ended up forking out twice that for a hotel. They are yet to hear whether they are liable for the damaged hire car. Despite itsAirCover pledgeto refund customers if there is a serious problem with a rental, Airbnb declared it was up to the host to agree a refund; the host claimed the decision was Airbnb’s.After 10 weeks of identikit auto-generated messages in response to James’s complaint, Airbnb declared the case had gone on long enough and summarily closed it. The host concluded that since the repairs had cost her €5,000 (£4,350), she would not be stumping up a refund either. She suggested that instead the couple celebrate their survival and “turn the event into a beautiful story”.Airbnb issued a full refund along with a £500 voucher after we questioned its health and safety policies. A spokesperson says: “We apologise for the original handling of this case, which falls short of our usual high standards. We will be reviewing this internally.”View image in fullscreenTime to see the sights of Barcelona was cut short for one Booking.com customer owing to a broken lock.Photograph: Alejandro García/EPATrappedKim Pocock used Booking.com to book a flat for a two-night stay in Barcelona. She and her daughter were left trapped in the property for most of their only full day in the city after a security lock on the front door malfunctioned.“The host sent out a maintenance man, who was unable to help,” she says. “They eventually dispatched a locksmith who tried for several hours to access the lock from the outside. He had to buy a rope, which he threw up to our window and we hoisted up a wrench and pliers. With us levering the lock from the inside and the locksmith banging it from the outside, we finally managed to remove it. It turned out loose screws had blocked the mechanism. By then it was nearly 4pm.”Pocock requested a full refund to compensate her for the ruined trip and the stress. Booking.com said this was at the discretion of the host. The host not only refused, it withheld her €250 deposit to pay for the replacement lock. The deposit was eventually returned by Booking.com but Pocock felt she was due the €446 rental cost.“We would have been at serious risk if there had been an emergency while we were trapped, yet the host is blaming us for using the lock,” she says.We would have been at serious risk if there had been an emergency while we were trapped, yet the host blamed us for using the lockKim Pocock, Booking.com customerAnother Booking.com customer Philip (surname withheld) was trapped outside the London flat he booked for £70 when, on trying to check in, he found the key safe empty. The owners told him they were abroad and could not help and advised him to find somewhere else for the night. He spent an extra £123 on a hotel room and has spent the intervening four months trying in vain to get this refunded.“Booking.com have basically said that as the owner isn’t responding to them there’s nothing they can do,” he says. “I can’t comprehend how a business is able to operate this way with no accountability. The extra sting in the tail is that the property in question is still being advertised on the platform.”Booking.com refunded both customers after Guardian Money intervened. The platform confirmed the host who had left Philip locked out of his rental had failed to respond to its inquiries. When asked why unscrupulous accommodation providers were not delisted, it said customers should review guest feedback to ensure a property was “the right fit”.Reviews do not always tell the whole story. Areport last year by the consumer group Which?highlighted that Booking.com’s default system was displaying reviews it considered “relevant”. This means that it is easy for users to miss a recent deluge of reviews warning that a listing is a scam or not available.Booking.com countered that customers could easily sort reviews by the most recent or lowest score so as to make their own decision on a property.The same Which? report claimed that listings that had been repeatedly reported as scams were not removed. Booking.com responded that it relied on hosts to abide by its terms and conditions and ensure that availability was up to date.View image in fullscreenBooking.com says customers should read the guest feedback to ensure the property is the ‘right fit’.Photograph: Dado Ruvić/ReutersGrey areaThe problem for travellers who do not get what they paid for is that their contract is with the accommodation provider not the booking platform.Airbnb and Booking.com promise to help find alternative accommodation in an emergency, but getting compensation for a disrupted stay is a tougher battle. Both tend to rely on the owner to do the right thing.The sector needs greater regulation, according to the consumer campaigner and journalist Martyn James. “Because online platforms effectively police themselves, the only course of action if the dispute isn’t resolved is legal action,” James says. “But who against? As the contract is between you and the host you’d have to take legal action in their country.”He adds: “You could argue that the online marketplace failed to investigate your complaint properly and try to pursue them, but this is a grey area, legally. Both firms are registered overseas and have deep pockets.”The Department for Business and Trade (DBT) says the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024, which came into force in April, requires online platforms to “exercise professional diligence” in relation to consumer transactions promoted or made on their platforms.A DBT spokesperson says: “This government is on the side of consumers and we have brought into force tough new financial penalties for breaches of consumer law to protect people’s cash.”They added: “Companies selling services to UK consumers must comply with UK law, and we have bolstered the Competition and Markets Authority’s powers to make sure they face severe penalties if they do not.”Explore more on these topicsConsumer rightsConsumer championsConsumer affairsAirbnbEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

So you’d assume the release of this year’s winner would be widely and loudly trumpeted. Not so. Consume Me’sapparently underwhelming early salesand surprisinglack of reviewsspeak more to ongoing issues of discoverability (and busy critics struggling with an autumn glut) than the game itself, which is an absolute delight.Admittedly, it’s easy to make it sound like something youshouldplay rather than something you’d reallywantto. Developed over a decade by Jenny Jiao Hsia (with collaborators AP Thomson, Jie En Lee, Violet W-P, and Ken Snyder), it’s a quasi-autobiographical story about an Asian American high-schooler attempting to lose weight while navigating the stresses and pitfalls of teenage life. It involves efficient management of energy and time. A content notice warns about themes of bullying, fatphobia and disordered eating. It’s also – somehow – one of 2025’s funniest games.View image in fullscreenA pizza date leads to watching her eating for the rest of the week … Consume Me.Photograph: HexecutableConsume Me deftly negotiates this tonal minefield, playfully but incisively satirising the gamification of diet culture. Protagonist Jenny’s mealtimes are abstracted into puzzle form. In a process that reminded me of arranging Leon’s attaché case in Resident Evil 4, you slot foodstuffs shaped like Tetris blocks into a grid representing Jenny’s stomach. L-shaped kale and S-shaped tomatoes will keep you under your daily target (crucially, she’s not counting calories but “bites”) while eggs handily plug those awkward single spaces. Junk foods come in appealingly convenient shapes – but filling up with a cookie means spending your precious free time trying to burn it off, or using up one of your limited cheat days. Leave any gaps and her stomach will rumble, meaning she’s likely to need a snack later.You’ll also need to keep Jenny’s energy and mood above zero or it’s game over. That’s straightforward at first: the tasks that make up your schedule, from chores to studying to applying makeup, comprise simple but fun minigames with the antic energy of Nintendo’s WarioWare series but little of the challenge. Items earned or bought with pocket money make it easier still to keep Jenny happy and healthy. But time is the enemy, and balancing needs and wants becomes steadily trickier. Rely on energy drinks too often, for instance, and a caffeine headache awaits, meaning any activity but bed rest will make you grumpy.View image in fullscreenA sinkside squabble with an overbearing mother … Consume Me.Photograph: HexecutableWhether things are going well or not, it’s beautifully observed. Ominous music accompanies the weekly weigh-in, as you physically drag Jenny’s feet on to the scales. Cleaning the bathroom is followed by a forensic inspection from your overbearing mother, who leans in close to scrutinise your handiwork, pressing her index finger against the sink to ensure it comes away spotless. When Jenny first meets boyfriend Oliver’s well-to-do parents, the simple introduction of an anxiety meter is enough to have your own heart beating a little faster, even before her imagination casts his prying mother as a trenchcoated detective, a spotlight adding to the interrogative vibe. And in the couple’s first attempt at making out, their clumsy limbs crisscross the screen, forcing you to manoeuvre round them to lock lips.Love soon becomes another obligation, and thus a source of tension, shrewdly re-contextualised in each chapter. Jenny can’t miss too many of the potential dates she pencils in her diary, but a trip to a pizza restaurant forces her to be strict with her eating for the rest of the week. When Oliver goes to college, Jenny must invest valuable evening time texting or video-calling him, convinced their long-distance relationship will take “poison damage” every day if she doesn’t. (By night, she presses her face against a glass case, tearfully watching petals fall from the rose inside it, brilliantly evoking the wayeverythingbecomes a melodrama at that age.)This might be a game about routines, but despite some purposeful repetition, Consume Me never fully settles into one of its own; it keeps finding inventive uses (and reuses) of systems to punch home its themes without losing its sense of humour. If you have an uneasy relationship with food and personal fitness, there are moments that will hit close to home – and even if you eat and exercise well, you can surely relate to being too busy with life’s essentials to find room for the things you’d rather be doing.Again, though, I’m wary of making it sound too much like eating your vegetables. This spiky, funny, and bracingly original game consumed a few laughter- and tear-filled evenings, and left memories that will stay with me a good deal longer.Consume Me is available now, £12.79Explore more on these topicsGamesPCreviewsShareReuse this content"

But lasting peace cannot be built on the denial of basic rightsMon 6 Oct 2025 13.48 EDTLast modified on Mon 6 Oct 2025 15.39 EDTShareTwo years after the Hamas atrocitiesof 7 October 2023, in which militants killed about 1,200 Israelis, and amid the genocide in Gaza, in which Israel has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians, the need for peace has never been more urgent. Palestinians are desperate for an end to starvation and airstrikes. Israeliswant the war to endfor the sake of remaining hostages and soldiers. Violence has reverberated across the region. Momentum has been growing around Donald Trump’s proposal, with both Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas grudgingly indicating acceptance under US threat.With indirect talks between Israel and Hamas beginning in Egypt on Monday afternoon, there are frail hopes of progress at last. Yet both parties have made it clear that they reject major parts of the20-point US plan, which begins with an immediate ceasefire, the return of all hostages – followed by the release of Palestinian prisoners – and the resumption of full aid.For Netanyahu, perpetual war in Gaza and beyond extends his political survival. His far-right coalition partners want to expel Palestinians and settle Gaza.Hamashas no desire to sign itself out of existence, and handing back the last hostages would remove any leverage it retains. It has seen much of its leadership destroyed, as well as life in Gaza – but has also watched international public opinion shift unprecedentedly towards support for Palestinians, pulling governments in its wake. It can recruit from a huge pool of angry and traumatised young men.The full peace plan is still more contentious. Pledges of broad support from governments in the region and in Europe do not mean that they think it feasible – still less that they want to commit troops to an “international stabilisation force”. But some hope that a more plausible and just way forward might somehow emerge from all this.True, this proposal is less grotesque than the initial Trumpianvisionof a “riviera” built on the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians.Palestinians would remain, but would be sidelined, as they were in drawing up the plan. The “board of peace” overseeing Gaza appears to be acolonial administrationheaded by Mr Trump himself and,disturbinglygiven his history in the region, Tony Blair.The plan pays lip service to eventual self-determination and statehood as a mere “aspiration” – not a right – of the Palestinian people, via a path that could not be more vague, conditional or tentative. It states that Israel will not occupy or annex Gaza. Mr Netanyahu has already said that the military would stay in most of it andwould “forcibly resist”a Palestinian state.Mr Trump has strong-armed the Israeli prime minister at last, but deadly strikes continue and he, like Joe Biden before him, could have halted the slaughter long ago. Telling the two parties to “move fast” now reflects his short attention span as much as the pressing need for peace. He will surely settle for whatever allows him to claim credit. If Israel does stop, it could resume the offensive at any time – just as itbroke the ceasefireearly this year.Any opportunity to end this war of annihilation must be seized. Something better may emerge from this path, if – a huge if – Mr Trump and others apply heavy, sustained pressure to Mr Netanyahu and forge a deal that Arab nations can fully support, ensuring pressure on Hamas. But lasting peace should not and cannot be built upon an abandonment of basic Palestinian rights.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

And no surprise, judges in those countries have repeatedly done what Orbán and Erdoğan want.Donald Trumphas not had the opportunity to pack theUS supreme courtto nearly the same degree. Nor has he, despite his brash, bullying ways, done much to pressure or browbeat the court’s nine justices. Nevertheless, the court’s conservative supermajority has ruled time after time in favor of Trump since he returned to office. The six conservative justices have fallen into line much like Hungary’s and Turkey’s judges, even though the supreme court’s justices have life tenure to insulate them from political pressures.With the court’s new term beginning on Monday, many Americans are dismayed that the conservative justices have been so submissive to Trump, the most authoritarian-minded president in US history. Notwithstanding the US’s celebrated system of checks and balances, the justices have utterly failed to provide the checks on Trump that many legal scholars had expected. In ruling for Trump, the chief justice, John Roberts, and the other conservatives have let himgut the Department of Education, fireFederal Trade CommissionandNational Labor Relations Boardmembers, andstrip temporary protected statusfrom hundreds of thousands of immigrants. The rightwing supermajority has also let Trumphalt $4bn in foreign aid,fire tens of thousands of federal employeesdespite contractual protections anddeport peopletocountrieswhere they have no connection.Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson is trying to warn us about something. Are we listening?Read moreIn these and other cases, the supermajority has ceded huge power to Trump, for instance, by greatly reducing Congress’s constitutional power over spending as it let Trump unilaterally gut agencies andhalt fundingapproved by Congress. What’s more, the court seems eager to snuff out independent, nonpartisan federal agencies byletting Trump fireagency chairs andcommissionerswithout giving any reason, even thoughCongress approved lawsexplicitly saying those officials could only be dismissed for cause. (Pleasing corporate America, the court ordered last Wednesday thatLisa Cook can remainon the Federal Reserve Board, at least temporarily, while litigation proceeds over whether Trump can fire her as part of his effort to end the central bank’s independence.)“The chief justice is presiding overthe end of the rule of law in America,” said J Michael Luttig, a highly regarded conservative former federal appellate judge.The conservative justices have repeatedly done Trump’s bidding even though they don’t begin to face the intense pressures that Hungary’s and Turkey’s judges face. Erdoğan has sometimespurged and blackballed judges seen as insufficiently loyal, while Orbán’s high-ranking allies have beratedless obedient judges as “traitors”.The US supreme court has ruled for Trump in a startlingly high percentage of cases this year. It has issued24 decisions from its emergency docket(often without giving any reasons) and ruled in Trump’s favor about 90% of the time.In doing so, the court has repeatedly vacated injunctions that lower courts had issued after concluding that Trump, with his209 executive orders, had egregiously broken the law. Adam Bonica, a Stanford political science professor, found that in Trump administration cases decided between 1 May and 23 June, federal district courts ruled against Trump94.3% of the time(82 out of 87 cases), often after looking closely at the facts. In contrast, the supreme courtruled 93.7%of the time for Trump (15 out of 16 cases), often without taking a close look at the facts.“The supreme court haspulled the rug outfrom under the lower federal courts, and it has done so deliberately and knowingly,” Luttig said, adding that the court is “acquiescing in and accommodating the president’s lawlessness”.With the court siding so often with Trump, a new Gallup poll found that arecord high 43% of Americans thinkthe court is too conservative, higher than the 36% who think the court is “about right”. Moreover, the court’s overall approval rating hasfallen to its lowest levelsince Gallup began measuring, dropping below 40% for the first time in August (before climbing slightly) – and down from nearly 60% in the early 2000s.Steven Levitsky, a political science professor at Harvard and co-author ofHow Democracies Die, voiced bewilderment that the court has been so obliging toward a president who he says is a clear threat to democracy. According to Levitsky, courts come under the thumb of authoritarian governments in several ways. One way is “ideological agreement”. He said the court’s most rightwing members, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, seem in fundamental agreement with Trump, but he said the other conservatives do not love Trump even if they often rule for him. Levitsky suggested that those justices are so hostile toward liberals and liberal arguments that they gravitate towards Trump’s side in case after case.Court packing is another way courts fall under an authoritarian’s sway. Orbán, Erdoğan and their legislative allies have appointed the overwhelming majority of their countries’ judges, while Trump has appointed three of the nine justices. With life tenure, the justices should in theory feel free from political pressure and able to rule against Trump. In the past, many justices have ruled against the presidents and parties that appointed them.Levitsky sees another phenomenon at work: abdication. Pointing to both Congress and the supreme court, he said: “The major institutions that have the authority and responsibility to stand up and stop an authoritarian have declined to do so.”In his view, the conservative justices may have made a major miscalculation. “They are overconfident about the strength of our institutions,” Levitsky said. “They don’t really think our democracy is in danger. They don’t think it can really happen here. I really think a majority of members of the US establishment are in that camp.”The conservative justices have increasingly embraced the unitary executive theory, a once fringe, four-decade-old notion that the president has sole, unlimited authority over the executive branch and should, for instance, be free to fire members of independent agencies along with hundreds of thousands of federal employees. “If they really believed that Trump was a threat to democracy, they wouldn’t be giving him so much power,” Levitsky said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Roberts and the conservatives are “scared out of their minds that they will have to play chicken with Trump”, Levitsky said. “The worst thing for them is if the government ignores them and they don’t have any authority. They’re just terrified that Trump will trample on them and undermine their authority. Trump is not someone you want to play chicken with. They’re terrified of a big, high-profile fight with Trump.”In other words, the conservative justices are so eager to save face and avoid confrontation that they have often given a green light to what lower courts have seen as Trump’s lawlessness. Meanwhile, the three liberal justices – Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson – have written repeated, often angry dissents that chastise the supermajority for acquiescing to Trump’s lawlessness and steamrolling over parts of the constitution.One theory is that the conservative justices are deliberately giving Trump small victories – vacating lower courts’ injunctions and letting the president’s executive orders proceed and do their damage – as the justices wait for those cases to return to the supreme court, perhaps in a year or two. At that point, those cases would be fully briefed and argued, and the court would issue formal, longer rulings. Legal scholars hope, but are not optimistic, that the thus far compliant court will be more willing to defy Trump when the cases are fully briefed and argued, with the birthright citizenship and tariff cases most often mentioned.“What they’re doing,” Levitsky said, “is giving Trump small victories in an effort to placate him or preserve as much political capital for when the big fights come. It’s appeasement. Appeasement usually doesn’t work when you cede power to an authoritarian executive. It sends signals to society that no one is going to stop the guy. Ceding power to someone like Trump is really dangerous.”After Jair Bolsonaro, a rightwing Trump ally, was elected Brazil’s president in 2019, Alexandre de Moraes, a prominent member of Brazil’s supreme court, feared what he saw as Bolsonaro’s authoritarian tendencies. De Moraes cracked down on Bolsonaro’s efforts to spread disinformation on social media to undermine his opponents. When a mob of Bolsonaro’s allies stormed government buildings in January 2023, pushing for a coup d’etat, de Moraes led efforts to prosecute Bolsonaro. (Last month,Bolsonaro was sentencedto 27 years in prison after being convicted of plotting a coup.)“When Bolsonaro got elected, de Moraes realized that he’s a threat to democracy,” Levitsky said. “He thought that the Brazilian supreme court could be Chamberlain or Churchill.” (Neville Chamberlain, a British prime minister, agreed to let Adolf Hitler take over a German-speaking part of Czechoslovakia in 1938, as part of the Munich agreement, infamously declaring that the agreement would assure “peace for our time”.)“The [US] supreme court hasn’t wanted to be Churchill.” Levitsky said. “John Roberts has been Chamberlain. I think that is incredible destructive behavior.”Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author, focusing on labor and the workplace, as well as economic and legal issuesExplore more on these topicsUS supreme courtOpinionDonald TrumpUS CongressTrump administrationLaw (US)US politicscommentShareReuse this content"

But where will the crackdown on Britain’s democratic freedoms end?Owen JonesIn making dissent a privilege, not a right, Labour is crafting a repressive toolkit. Imagine it in the hands of a Farage governmentMon 6 Oct 2025 13.13 EDTLast modified on Mon 6 Oct 2025 13.22 EDTShareIn Britain, protest is no longer a right. Instead, it is a privilege that is granted – or withheld – at the whim of those in power. This is the implication of new rules that the Labourgovernment is proposing, which would dictate the time and place that protests are permitted to occur, and carry the risk of prison time for those who defy orders. Successive governments had already chipped away at this right: the last Conservative administration granted the police sweeping new powers, which theUnited Nations’ human rights chiefcondemned as “serious and undue restrictions” on democratic freedoms. Taken together, these incremental assaults on freedom have effectively abolished the hard-won right to freedom of protest.The latest assault is justified by last week’s heinous antisemitic attack on a mosque in Manchester. There should be universal agreement that the security of British Jews must be protected. Using this atrocity as a justification to throttle dissent is not only unrelated to that duty, but perverts it. Consider Britain’s history of protest and direct action against racism and fascism, from thebattle of Cable Streetin 1936, to postwar Jewish anti-fascist movements such as the 43 or 62 Group, or the mobilisations against the National Front in the 1970s. Many of these protesters were derided as extremists in their day, even while they were fighting for the rights of minorities.In today’s upside-down world, here’s what is actually going on. Israel – a foreign state – iscommitting genocide. Its war crimes have led the international criminal court to issue arrest warrants against Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defence minister. Public opinion in the west hasturned sharplyagainst Israel’s violence. In Britain, a large majority of peoplebelieve Israelhas likely committed war crimes. Most people wouldback a total banon arms sales to the state, andsupport the arrestof Netanyahu.Having long since lost the argument, Israel’s cheerleaders are now seizing on a vile antisemitic crime to try to silence a mass movement against a moral catastrophe. The British government are included in this. Ministers have failed to impose large-scale sanctions on Israel, and have allowedarms exportsto continue. As the US author Ta-Nehisi Coates recently said of the Democrats, “if you can’t draw the line at genocide, you probably can’t draw the line at democracy”. The same applies to the Labour government.People who are protesting against the erasure of Gaza have been deemed hateful extremists. But there is a reason that there hasn’t been a more extensive crackdown on these protesters before now. The former cabinet minister Penny Mordauntrecently claimedthat demonstrators were calling for “death to Jews”, but the reality is that so few protesters have made hateful (and thus illegal) statements about Jews that the police have had no reason to crack down on them. Meanwhile, Jewish protesters marching for Palestinian lives have been slandered. After one such protester told the BBC that he had joined every protest for the last two years,Ben Houchen, a non-Jewish Tory Lord, called him a “useful idiot”.Collapsing Jewish identity into the actions of the Israeli state is not only cynical, it is dangerous. The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliancedefinition of antisemitism, adopted by the British government and many other institutions, has been rightly challenged forstifling critique of Israel. But there should be no controversy over one of its examples: that “holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel” is antisemitic. Despite this, Israel’s defenders have repeatedly attempted to conflate criticisms of Israel with antisemitic attacks on all Jewish communities, regardless of what many Jewish people make of these actions.This is why we’re now at a point where the Metropolitan police can suggest that protests opposing Israel’s crimes should be called off on the basis that they could “inadvertently or deliberately” endorse antisemitism, and why whyPriti Patel, the Conservative shadow foreign secretary, has declared that Labour’s belated recognition of Palestinian statehood had rendered the party “complicit in the appalling abuse we see across our streets and across Britain’s Jewish community”.On the same day as the synagogue attack, the Israeli army killedat least 57 Palestiniansin Gaza– another hideous tally in two years of daily atrocities that have left tens of thousands dead. British politicians and media outlets have barely concealed the lack of value they attach to Palestinian life. It is among the most brazen expressions of racism of our time. One wonders how history will judge this moment: politicians are accusing people who are protesting against genocide of inciting hatred, while they are supporting those who are committing genocide.Our government has already crossed a dangerous threshold by proscribing Palestine Action, a non-violent, anti-genocide direct action group.More than 2,000 British protesters have been arrested, mostly for holding placards opposing genocide and supporting the banned organisation. Many of them are pensioners; one is a retired priest, another the daughter of a Holocaust survivor. When the state begins calling movements “terrorism” when they are nothing of the sort, it is attacking democracy itself.It’s not hard to see where this all leads. In the US, Democrats helped to demonise pro-Palestinian protests: the former house speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested that some were“connected to Russia”, while Joe Bidencalled such protests antisemitic. In doing so, they only helped to legitimise the authoritarian crackdown on such protests – and on freedom of expression in general – under Donald Trump. If Nigel Farage becomes prime minister, a hard-right government would be granted sweeping powers to control dissent. What do you think a Reform government would do with this repressive toolkit?

It is comical, but also worryingMon 6 Oct 2025 12.03 EDTLast modified on Mon 6 Oct 2025 13.08 EDTShareIf last year’s general election marked the death of the Conservative party,this week’s conference in Manchesteris the wake. Based on the policies unveiled in recent days, one can only assume there’s an open bar.Watching Kemi Badenochkick things off on Sundayby setting out plans to leave the European convention on human rights (EHCR), it was hard to know what to focus on: the unhinged idea or remembering who exactly Badenoch was. Kimmy, is it? I’m trying to place her. Since being elected last November, the former engineer has turned being the leader of the opposition into a part-time job to the extent that you half expected conference to start with a missing person’s appeal.Still, she’s here now! And she’s making up for lost time. Badenoch’s pledge to get rid ofthe landmark Climate Change Actwas dismissed as “catastrophic” by former prime minister Theresa May, business groups, scientists and the Church of England before delegates had even made it up the M40. Not that we should be worried. You can trust Badenoch’s scientific credentials. She thinks she was offered a place to study for a(pre) medical degree.And she’s not stopping at the climate. Badenoch wants you to know she’s up for a bonfire of treaties to curb immigration and protect Britain from “the radical Islamist ideology” and “values hostile to our own”. The Human Rights Act! Legal aid for migrants! Basic decency! Everything must go!Meanwhile, the shadow chancellor, Mel Stride, set out plans tocut social security spending by £23bnby limiting benefits to people with UK citizenship, removing it even from those who have been in the country for decades and have indefinite leave to remain. Asked by the BBC how such people could survive financially, Stride said: “If they’ve come from other parts of the world, they would have an option to return to those other parts.”It all rather has the air of your ex-boyfriend screaming incoherently on the driveway, begging for another chance. Suddenly, it’s very clear why you blocked his number.Badenoch will break convention on Wednesday by making a second leader’s speech at conference, not dissimilar to a supermarket 2 for 1 deal to offload out-of-date meat. With their number of MPs slashed from 365 to 121, two-thirds oflocal council seats wiped out, and Reform dominating in the polls, Tory conference 2025 is not so much a quest for relevance but a cry for help. Few cries were more repulsive than the promise to create a£1.6bn “removals force”based on the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) currentlydragging naked children from their bedsin the US.Britain’s so-called natural party of government and one of the most successful electoral forces in history has been reduced to cosplaying as Donald Trump, pitching a briefcase of divisive and inhumane policies in order to get some attention from the electorate. At the time of writing, part-time employee Badenoch has not got round to explaining what would happen to the 150,000 people she wants to deport. Asshe told the BBC: “I’m tired of us asking all of these irrelevant questions about where should they go?”At least one person at conference seems to be enjoying themselves. Though he denies it,self-avowed non-xenophobeRobert Jenrick is said to be using the time out of office to soft launch his leadership campaign, with allies reportedlycollecting letters of no confidenceready for when the party rules say Badenoch can be challenged next month. Or as one shadow ministerput it ahead of conference: “I’m going there to be loyal. Can I say that about my colleagues? No, but then some of them are twats.”Quite. It tells you something about where the Conservative party now resides that Jenrick’s early leadership rival could beKatie Lam– a woman who has only been an MP for 15 months and mainly talks about migrants and sexual assault. “We already have British sex criminals,” Lam recently tweeted. “We don’t need any more!” Hard to disagree with the logic there.Any progressive would be well within their rights to feel rather smug watching all this. From Brexit to austerity, Windrush to Covid VIP lanes, the Tory vandals of Britain are getting further and further away from the levers of power and no one could deserve obscurity more. And yet it is hard to be celebratory. The electoral decline of the Conservative party being followed by the rise of Reform feels akin to an exterminator finally getting rid of the rats from your basement only to say he’s found a termite infestation rotting the walls. Out with one, in with another.The death of the Tories – if such a thing has not been greatly exaggerated – has not meant the death of its economic and social project. British politics has continued to drag rightwards long after Liz Truss wasousted in a sports hallat 6am, pulled by the tide of global rightwing populism and a conservative press to new darker waters. Indeed, ideas about immigration that would have been seen as fringe even a few years ago are now being applauded from the main stage at the Conservative party conference.“We have listened, we have learned and we have changed,”Badenoch told delegates on Sunday. But the Tories have only listened to Nigel Farage, they have learned nothing, and if they have changed, it is in the same way a crab spider morphs its colour to catch prey. The real question is, what will happen if the party gets a leader with some work ethic and skill? The progressive fight is not over – it’s just begun.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I grumble back, insisting it has nothing to do with my period, I just happen to have lost all motivation and inspiration. “What’s the point anyway,” I add, “when we’re watching the world burn?”Nine times out of 10 my period shows up shortly afterwards and, a few days later, my creativity, motivation and drive all come flooding back. You’d think that growing up with a menstrual educator for a mother – and having a fairly solid knowledge of the cycle myself – I’d remember this each month when feelings of disillusionment and apathy creep in. But deep in the slump it’s hard to convince myself that it’s my hormones playing tricks on me again.While I had a fairly good understanding of the monthly cycle as a kid and teen, I thought I was too cool to have in-depth discussions with Mum about the changing dynamics that come with it. I didn’t want to hear about taking advantage of high energy levels during my follicular and ovulatory phases and I didn’t want to acknowledge that I might need more rest during my luteal and menstrual phases. Pah! Too woo-woo!How understanding the menstrual cycle is breaking new ground for women’s soccerRead moreI simply didn’t believe that each week could be that varied and I was determined to continue living life as society had shaped it: 24-hour day by 24-hour day – perfectly synced with a man’s hormonal cycle.Second-wave feminism had to focus on proving women’s equality in the workplace and public life. While I acknowledge the importance of this, it often meant women were encouraged to downplay or avoid speaking about menstruation. That was probably the only viable approach, and the truth is we can mostly push through our luteal and menstrual phases to do important work.But we’re now entering a different chapter: one in which we must teach society as a whole how the menstrual cycle affects us.It wasn’t until my late 20s, when I was trying to get pregnant, that I really got into cycle tracking – also known as the fertility awareness method. I started taking my temperature every day and noting other changes in my body, including cervical fluid, and I was amazed to see clear patterns emerge.It was thrilling to catch the temperature dip right before ovulation, then watch it rise and stay elevated. Even more exciting was realising I was pregnant when my temperature rose again at the time my period would normally arrive and produce a temperature drop.I can understand hesitation in teaching girls about fertility awarenes. I’d argue though that teaching them to track their cycles is more likely to empower them than lead to unwanted pregnancy.I would love to see cycle tracking added to the high school curriculum – not to be promoted as contraception but as a way to understand the body and gain in-depth knowledge of our fluctuating hormones and what they mean for mood, energy and productivity.Another crucial factor is learning what’s normal and what’s not. Too many girls and women endure painful, irregular or debilitating cycles for decades, assuming it’s just “part of being a woman”. In reality, these can signal such conditions asendometriosisorpolycystic ovary syndrome, and recognising that something isn’t right is the first step to seeking help.As with many aspects of women’s health, our understanding has advanced through sharing our experiences, and social media has been the forum for that. Unsurprisingly, this has also had a downside. Tradwife culture in the US has co-opted cycle tracking as a way to reject birth control, which has led some progressive folks to dismiss it as a conservative practice.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

This is a reminder that knowledge isn’t inherently liberating – context and application matter. Understanding the menstrual cycle should empower choice, not restrict it.While I have far more insight into my cycle now, you’ll still catch me wondering why my loved ones’ chewing noises make me irrationally angry on certain days, or why I suddenly find every man walking down the street strangely attractive (oh, ovulation, you hilarious beast). I am so excited to see more girls and women having menstrual cycle knowledge at their fingertips.I just wish we could avoid getting all our information from social media. Providing menstrual cycle education to girls – and, really, all students – in high school would help advance equality.Far from being woo-woo, learning to understand and work with the body’s monthly rhythms is empowering, fundamental health education. The menstrual cycle is fascinating and deeper knowledge of it can be life-changing.Freya Bennett is a writer based on Dja Dja Wurrung country and is the co-founder and editor of Ramona MagazineExplore more on these topicsMenstruationOpinionWomen's healthWomenHealth (Australia news)Health (Society)Australian educationUS educationcommentShareReuse this content"

How far can he take the party?Mon 6 Oct 2025 08.58 EDTLast modified on Mon 6 Oct 2025 12.21 EDTShareThe Green party members in Bournemouth at the weekend were, largely, exuberant. More than one person I spoke to used the word “joyful”. “The energy is amazing,” said Jean Lambert, the former London MEP. “It’s exceeded my expectations,” said the new leader,Zack Polanski. “Even the most unfriendly journalist can’t find anyone that isn’t fired up and ready to go.”Polanski himself contributed to this feeling. He has a talent for expressing members’ views clearly and without fearing how the rightwing press might respond. The recent boost he’s brought to the party’s profile combines the gnawing anxiety produced by rising Faragism, the experience of watching a genocide in real time, anger at inequality, Keir Starmer’s move to the right and profound climate anxieties, with an overwhelming feeling of relief: “thank God someone’s saying this.”Where once there was a nervousness about defending controversial but internally popular policies such as drug decriminalisation or denouncing Israeli “apartheid”, the party has now abandoned this caution – and members love it. Standing ovations used to be a rarity at Green conferences. Polanski got multiple.He benefited from a surprising consensus about external messaging – his speech focused on ending what he called “rip-off Britain” bynationalising public utilitiesandtaxing wealthto fund public services such as childcare. Prominent members I spoke to from across the party’s spectrum largely agree that this is the right approach.Migration is Britain’s superpower. Our future depends on embracing that truth, not denying it | Zack PolanskiRead moreThe two new deputies – Rachel Millward and Mothin Ali –contributed, too. As Alex Armitage, a councillor with the (independent) Scottish Green party in Shetland, who travelled to Bournemouth for the conference, said, itwas their speecheswhich “emotionally grounded and unified the party”. When Millward reworked the old “first they came for the …” poem to add lines about how people fought back, when Ali talked about telling his son that he thinks he isn’t a good politician, but he hopes he’s a good man, many members were in tears.Part of the reason for this level of emotion is the party’s recent success. It’s grown from 58,000 members in December to86,000 today. Justsix years ago, it was consistently polling at around 2%. Now, that’sabove 10%. The number of Green councillors has gone fromfewer than 200tonearly 900over the same period. The number of MPs has gone from one to four.Partly, it comes from the feeling of moving in the right direction in other ways, too. Many members have long been concerned about the party being overly white. While that’s still true, there were, as party chief executive, Harriet Lamb, said to me, “more global majority Greens at this conference than ever before”. An anti-racism policy, described by another senior official as creating “a toolkit for unpicking the structures of racism”, internally passed overwhelmingly, and Polanski told me that 30% of people on the party’s “pathway to parliament” scheme are from the global majority.What’s also important is that, for many members, the last few annual conferences have been – as more than one person said – “horrible”, marred by transphobic behaviour. Polanski highlighted the difference this year. “When someone’s won 85% of the vote when they are LGBT and explicitly LGBT inclusive,” he says, “I think that is about as strong a mandate as the party can give to say ‘we’ve moved on from those days’, and actually now let’s focus on the cost of living, and inequality and the climate crisis”.Some motions were more contentious – a policy entitled “abolish landlords” (which might have more accurately been called “phase out the need for landlords”) passed. There was some opposition to a motion calling for the Israeli military to be proscribed as a terrorist organisation, but that too passed.But, mostly, the party was focused on steering activist energy into winning new seats: it’s now confident of getting at least one Welsh Senedd member in May, and aiming for two. London’s local elections will be a big focus. And it’s hoping to win mayoralties in Hackney, Norfolk and Suffolk, and Sussex and Brighton – in the latter two, against Reform – in the latter,Millward herself is the candidate.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Our message to the British public was clear: that we offer decency, not decline, and that we’re determined to build a Britain that is better for all.As education secretary, I’ve led this mission from the front: announcing the roll-out offree breakfast clubs, thereturn of maintenance grantsfor low-income students – delivering opportunity for young people, and showing that education is the key to giving them the freedom to choose their own path in life. This year, I’ve been putting our party’s values of solidarity, compassion and social justice into action, delivering on the pledges we made at the last election.But none of this has happened by accident. There’s a reason I’ve been able to givemillions of free breakfaststo our poorest children, that I’ve been able torevive Sure Startfor a new generation, that I’ve secured thebiggest ever expansionof free school meals that will lift 100,000 more children out of poverty.It happened because I had a seat at the table, because I had the power in government to fight for policies that unite our whole movement.But I’m not going to stop there. I want a mandate to do more: on tackling child poverty, our party’s historic mission, and to spread more opportunity for young people, delivering the policies that our members want to see.Make no mistake, change is on the ballot in this deputy leadership election. The choice is what kind of change. Members can choose to push our government to be bolder, to go further and do more with me as their voice at the cabinet table, or they can choose the kind of division and disunity that fills the pages of the rightwing papers and energises our opponents.Choosing that path isn’t risk-free or without consequence. It would be a mandate for more of the disruption we’ve seen in recent weeks, permission to throw more stones, to create more distraction from our crucial mission of giving working people better lives. It would be a vote for instability, a vote to divide our party, to pit regions against each other, and hand our political opponents the upper hand with crucial elections just around the corner. It’s a vote, quite simply, that puts us back on the dark road back to opposition.After 14 years of Tory misery, the last thing our members want, and the last thing our country needs, is to take that path. I want all of us to come together to tell that hopeful story about how our policies are changing the lives of young people.Too often, Labour’s achievements in key policy areas have gone unnoticed because of unforced errors, and strong announcements have been obscured by self-generated noise. It frustrates me, just as it frustrates you.I’m not going to pretend we’ve not made mistakes as a government. I’ve been the first to admit it – that’s why I’ll never shy away from offering challenge where I think we should do better. I know the importance of fighting my corner and airing concerns, but I do so where those concerns belong – in private.And while I’m not going to defend our errors, neither will I shy away from promoting our successes. That is what the deputy leader’s role is all about. Angela Rayner knew this well: it’s why she encouraged us to focus on the 90% of things we got right, rather than the 10% of things we got wrong.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Then a teacher showed me how to use it as a force for goodMarisa BateIn an eye-opening drama class, Miss Smith taught me that rage didn’t only belong to menMon 6 Oct 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 6 Oct 2025 13.12 EDTShareWe always knew it was coming. There were signs we’d learned to read: a change in atmosphere, the sound of the fridge door opening, wine glugging into a glass. And then it would arrive. My stepfather’s anger filled the house, even the rooms he wasn’t in. We breathed it in and out silently, waiting for the storm to pass, waiting to see if we would all make it out OK. As a young girl growing up in that house, I was used to feeling that dark, threatening clouds were constantly looming on the horizon. And I learned that anger – even the smell of it on the air – was terrifying.And then I met Miss Smith*. Miss Smith was my A-level drama teacher at my brilliant secondary school in the home counties. She was full of ideas and passion and, I suspect, had an ambition to open the eyes of her overwhelmingly sheltered pupils. One Wednesday morning, she asked us to work on our improv skills, while exploring the topic of homelessness. She played a TV reporter asking members of a homeless community (us) how we felt. If you can bear the problematic notion of middle-class teens attempting to articulate a reality they knew nothing of, it was a worthwhile exercise, at least because of the extent to which it awakened something in me.I remember the feeling of injustice that arrived like a pressure on my chest. I felt agitated and on edge; hot tears appeared as I felt I had been given permission, in a way I hadn’t before, to feel the full breadth of my emotions. What I was witnessing at home had always felt private, a secret that felt uniquely mine. Homelessness, however, was an issue utterly removed from me and therefore Icouldbecome angry about it. Safely angry. This feeling was a revelation.I left the lesson realising I’d accessed something for the first time – a new way of feeling. This type of anger didn’t cause a freeze response; it was the opposite. It came with an urgency that compelled me to do something. On the final day of sixth form, before leaving for university, I went to the drama studio in search of Miss Smith. I told her I wanted to thank her. She hugged me, then looked at me as if I was in trouble. “Whatever you do,” she said, “stay angry.”Those words cemented a lesson I was learning in real time: there is profound injustice in this world that cannot be ignored – however hard you try, or easy people make it to do so. Moreover, we have a responsibility to do something about it. Miss Smith’s words granted me a permission to be angry because she had helped me reframe it as something useful and positive. And, crucially, her words also gave me an opportunity to reclaim something. Anger didn’t only belong to men who used it to intimidate and control women. Anger could be used by women to change the world. Around this time, I first discovered who Gloria Steinem was, and was religiously listening to Alanis Morissette’s Jagged Little Pill album. Thanks to Bolton roots on my dad’s side, I became interested in the miners’ strikes, particularly the wives and how they organised. I saw women’s anger was powerful and purposeful and could make a difference.I could use anger to help people. I could use it to foster connection. But, mostly, the sense of empowerment was born from the realisation I could take something back. Abusers steal parts of you. Some of those things are irretrievable. The things you can reclaim are extremely meaningful. It was the slightest shift in the scales of power.Like many young people, I went to university armed with a lot of earnest beliefs in changing the world. As I get older, that belief and the anger that drives it has only become more powerful, precisely because it is deliberate, considered and channelled. It shows up every day in my work, writing about women’s rights, equality and male violence against women and girls. It shows up in my personal life; the organisations I donate to, the marches I attend, the women’s groups I’ve helped organise in the past. Male anger still frightens me. I can’t watch aggression in films or on TV; I can’t tolerate the slamming of a door, even by the wind. I have a pathological aversion to confrontation. But I have never forgotten Miss Smith’s advice to stay angry. And just as she once showed me, I found a place for that anger, a safe place.* Name has been changedskip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I was convinced that the party that still won elections despite the chaos and instability of Brexit, not to mention the calamities of austerity, could get away with anything. I even believed that if it lost power, as it did last year, the risk of a Tory restoration was still very high.What I did not foresee was the most successful political party in the democratic world, by some measures, coming so close to extinction this quickly. As the Tory party conference gets under way in Manchester, withrumours aboundingover the weekend about diminished attendance, the pollingincreasingly suggeststhat Britain’s next general election will be a contest between Labour and Reform. That is quite the turnaround for Britain’s “natural party of government”.But (you knew there was going to be a but) it might also be the case that the fundamental judgment I made – that there was always going to be a powerful, difficult-to-dislodge political force on the right – still stands. Because in many ways, the contemporary Conservative party has not died, it has only mutated to its next form.So much of the fertile ground that Reform thrives in now was tilled by the Tories. The pugnaciousness and jingoism that arose in the wake of Brexit normalised politics-by-separatism and a kind of permanent contempt for the people who didn’t vote for you. Long before the then prime minister, Rishi Sunak,threatened to leavethe European convention on human rights – a Reform pledge and, now, in a rush to keep up, a Kemi Badenochone– it was the Conservatives who helped make immigration a permanently vexatious issue that needed to be tackled in ever more cruel and performative ways. Think of David Cameron’s “tens of thousands” pledge or Theresa May’s infamous “go home” vans.It was under the Tories that rhetoric about the supposed failure of multiculturalism became somethinga government minister would say. And it was the Conservatives who went out of their way toplay downthe presence of institutional racism, who launched culture war after culture war aboutnonsensesuch as the content of the BBC Proms, and embraced the politics of government by controversy and spectacle. The result is Nigel Farage and Reform, whose unseriousness and divisiveness is now not a novelty, but business as usual.There was a longer structural process at work here, of course. The transformation of the Tories was the result of an economic climate that worked against the party. The very thing that creates natural Tory voters, that increasing sense of having a stake in the status quo via home ownership, social mobility, increasing savings and assets, is gone.Younger votersare not making the same conversion as they age that their predecessors did. Wage growth has stagnated and the biggest source of rising net worth now is through house-price appreciation. For new generations locked out of a future of anything to preserve, the main instinctive draw of the Tory brand diminished.That economic snookering is part of the reason the Tories opted for culture war. The energy that couldn’t be spent defending thedead end of British capitalism had to be directed on such diversions as leaving the EU, the Rwanda deportation scheme and various panics about non-issues such as lefty “agitatorstaking a bulldozer to our history”. This inevitably had an escalatingly corrosive quality, revealing how the party had become whittled down to something far smaller than a vehicle for a coherent, fiscally responsible ideology of governance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He also benefits from the diminishment in expectations and quality of leadership. The people in the Conservative party with the appetite and character to pursue its new brand of reckless bluster inevitably came across as a cohort of shallow knaves and charlatans. Let’s not forget all the ineffectual and insubstantial attention-seekers who acquired state power: Boris Johnson, Liz Truss, Kwasi Kwarteng, Rishi Sunak, Suella Braverman and, of course, Kemi Badenoch. Put them all together and the result isn’t even half of a decent politician. Badenoch in particular is less a party leader and more a sort of provocative statement generator. Shehates critical race theory. Wokeness is a “civilisation-ending philosophy”. Her big policy renewal programme was arant about net zero. The latest is apledgeto create an immigrant removals force modelled on US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). She embodies the legacy of a flight from seriousness, taking refuge in attack and rupture.This is all why the Conservative party conference looks and feels like a sideshow.Farage has none of the Tory party’s legacy and reputation to uphold, and all of the benefits of the lowered standards that the Tories have established. Reform is the Conservative party, but without the burden of history or that tempering, quasi-aristocratic sensibility of seeing yourself as the rightful steward of the country into posterity. We may cling to hope that, likethe Tories, Reform will also collapse under the weight of all that it cannot deliver. But for now, Farage’s continuity conservatism looks impossibly hard to vanquish.I sincerely hope, for the country’s sake, that one day I will be writing to you to say that I got that wrong too.In the meantime, and this may be little consolation to the party as it starts its conference at a historical low, what I would say toKemi Badenochis simple: do not see Reform’s stunning rise as a failure.

Not just the world-conquering Riders and Rivals, but all the way back to the Emilys and Olivias (all with pretty Jilly on the cover). When Lisa Jewell and I met her we literally sat at her feet in hero worship.

To never underestimate the power of clean hair. That it is perfectly fine and normal to get a bit sweaty and red in the face while throwing a dinner party, have casual sex with stable hands or get paralytically drunk at any given opportunity. It is not at all fine to be greedy, to gossip about someone while pretending to pity them, or show off about – or even mention – your children. And of course one must vow eternal vengeance on anyone who so much as snubs an animal of any sort.She cast quite the spell in person too. Many the journalist, plied with her generous pouring hand, didn’t quite make it back in time to file copy (and then were fulsome when they did). Last year, at the age of 87, she was asked what it was like to receive a damehood from the King. “Orgasmic,” she replied. You couldn’t send her a Christmas card without receiving treasured Jilly Mail in her spidery handwriting. No charitable cause went without a donation.It was wonderful that in her later years she finally got thescreen adaptation in Rivals she truly deserved. In tribute, the producers had a “no arseholes” casting policy, to make sure they kept her fun atmosphere, and it shows in every shot.That world – of smoking in offices, driving home after drunken lunches and making money in television – is fast disappearing in the rear-view mirror, and now we have lost its best chronicler too.But it is nice to hope she got her wish, that: “When you arrive in heaven, all your dogs come rushing across a green lawn to meet you.”Olivia Laing: ‘A person of total generosity and life’Dame Jilly Cooper was the absolute queen, a person of such total generosity and life. She started out as a journalist before writing a much-loved column for the Sunday Times about the mayhem of her domestic life as a new wife. A clutch of surprisingly sweet romantic novels was followed by Riders, the first in a long-running series of bonkbusters known collectively as the Rutshire Chronicles.“Bonkbuster” captures the essential joyfulness of these books, the central role of sex, but it doesn’t quite do justice to their wit and complexity as social comedy, let alone the beadiness of Jilly’s eye on class, her knack for satirising selfishness and pretension and her gift for understanding loneliness and isolation. Her Cinderellas are nearly always ugly ducklings too, like clumsy dyslexic Taggie and the decidedly plump and plain Kitty Rannaldini. Between the moments of high romance is a rich connective tissue composed of lovely landscape writing, social satire, silly jokes, highbrow quotations (George Herbert, Dylan Thomas) and endless puns.The Disney adaptation of Rivals brought her a new surge of appreciation, including a damehood. She was still working on edits and notes to the very last. It strikes me now that her books were as much about work as sex or love: about people who adored what they did, who got up in the cold and dark to train, who fought against poverty and injury to achieve brilliance. That was Jilly. The pinnacle is probably in Riders, when a heartbroken Rupert Campbell-Black competes in the Olympics with a dislocated shoulder (perfect for the reformation of this rake that he’s rewarded with a team and not individual gold medal. Jilly’s flirtation with Thatcherism only goes so far).View image in fullscreen‘The Disney adaptation of Rivals brought her a new surge of appreciation’.Photograph: Mark Richards/ANL/ShutterstockThen there are the animals. Periodically in my teenage years my mother would be woken by the sound of racking sobs. What on earth is wrong, she’d ask. Sailor’s died, I’d choke. From Badger the black lab to Gertrude the terrier with her perpetually outraged look, Cooper understood about the loyalty of animals, the place they have for people who are alone or struggle to trust. Her own retinue of much-loved rescue dogs kept her company after her adored husband Leo died.And now my head is full of scraps from her books. There’s Rupert muttering “I’d like to see Badger again” and cow parsley like scurf. There’s Sailor’s big heart giving out and the horses galloping to see Jake, and Fenella’s sharkskin jodhpurs splitting and everyone sending her to Coventry. Books about courage and getting up and getting on, about transformational haircuts and the luck of love, which is above all having a person whose eye you can catch, dissolving into giggles at some absurdity. Taggie with her misspelled sign at the airport, Imogen’s makeover in Saint-Tropez, Harriet with dirty hair in the hospital, waves of Miss Dior and the woods turning and catching your heart. Oh Jilly. I hope Leo and Bluebell came to greet you, I hope you were met with a sea of wagging tails.Jess Cartner-Morley: ‘The pages practically turn themselves’It feels impossible that Jilly Cooper could have died, because even though she was 88, she never got old. She was still naughty, and silly, and engaged with the world. Still ravishingly pretty, with her gap-tooth smile and twinkly blue eyes. More than 50 years after she wrote her first book, she was still plugged into contemporary culture: the television adaptation of Rivals, for which she was an executive producer, was theout-of-the-box hit of last year.I never met Jilly, but I loved her with a passion. (I like to think she would have approved of that. She understood how cheering it can be, as a grownup, to have entirely unrequited crushes, people you adore from afar and who make you smile to yourself while you are doing the washing up.) I have written about her, applied to be an extra on the TV show, even took my daughter’s name, Pearl, from a character in one of her books.Jilly’s best-known character is her great cad, Rupert Campbell-Black, but it was her female heroines who were the heart of her books. It was Nora Ephron who wrote the greatest line of woman-to-woman advice – “be the heroine of your life, not the victim” – but it was Jilly who engraved that mantra on my teenage heart. Jilly’s women are fallible and contradictory and complicated – they spend a lot of time chasing madly inappropriate men and can barely go 20 pages without bursting into tears over something or other – but they are also kind and funny, and never take themselves too seriously.Jilly’s books made being a grownup look fun. Not just sex, although that was definitely part of it. Her women drove cars and opened bills they couldn’t pay and walked dogs (endlessly) but they were never browbeaten or humdrum. There was always a smouldering glance or a spicy piece of village gossip to liven things up, or a friend who would drop in and sit at the kitchen table to quote Keats or open a bottle of Bolly.She was wise, with an instinctive cognition that was wrapped in emotion. She knew that the best thing to do on a bad day is to get into the fresh air – she could get positively thigh-rubby about a fresh bank of daffodils or a hedgerow bursting with champagne bubble blossom – or to sing loudly in a hot shower and blow-dry your hair. She knew that life will throw its worst curveballs out of a blue sky, but that this too shall pass and there will be joy at the end of the rainbow, even if that might be 200 pages away.She was a beautiful writer. Every sentence is crisp, every line of dialogue fizzes. The pages practically turn themselves, full of insight and joie de vivre and alive with Jilly’s unshakeable faith in the ultimate goodness of human nature. Her characters have tennis courts and helicopters. They have Polo mints in their Barbour pockets to win over ponies, and salacious puns up their sleeve to seduce lovers. They have petty rivalries and unsuitable liaisons and cultural blind spots. But most of all: they have fun.Explore more on these topicsBooksJilly CooperFictionTelevisionOlivia LaingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The director reveals how she made itDavid Smithin WashingtonMon 6 Oct 2025 10.53 EDTLast modified on Mon 6 Oct 2025 12.36 EDTShare‘To this day,” says Geeta Gandbhir, “I’m devastated.” The film-maker is talking about the killing of Ajike “AJ” Owens, a black woman shot dead by her white neighbour inFloridatwo years ago. Gandbhir first came to the case in a personal capacity, as 35-year-old Owens was a family friend.But things quickly changed. She and her team worked hard to drum up media attention and pressure law enforcement and government institutions to take action – and hold this neighbour, 60-year-old Susan Lorincz, accountable. They began filming protests and vigils, intending to create short pieces for news outlets.The law says you only have to prove you feared your life was in danger. This is being weaponisedAll this grew and has now resulted in The Perfect Neighbor, a film by Gandbhir, who may well have invented a new subgenre of true crime documentary. By telling the story almost entirely using official – and harrowing – police body camera footage, the 55-year-old director has moved beyond traditional narrative to present an unfiltered and unflinching account of a tightknit community facing a horror in its midst.It was made possible by Owens’ mother, Pamela Dias, who consented to footage being made public. “I showed Pam the film when it was completed,” says Gandbhir, “and I said, ‘Is this what you want?’ She said, ‘Yes – the world needs to know what happened to my baby.’”The central themes of the film, which premiered at this year’s Sundance festival and is about to stream on Netflix, include the devastating impact of Florida’s “stand your ground” laws, the weaponisation of race and fear, and the failure of law enforcement to de-escalate a known threat. The shooting was the culmination of a long-running argument between Owens and Lorincz over the former’s children playing in a grassy area near both their houses in Ocala, about 80 miles from Orlando. Owens went to Lorincz’s home after her children complained that she had thrown rollerskates and an umbrella at them, annoyed yet again by their boisterous play.Lorincz claimed she was acting in self-defence when she fired a single shot from a .380-caliber handgun through her front door, killing Owens. “She dehumanised Ajike over time,” says Gandbhir, “to the point where she was like, ‘The only answer is that I shoot her.’” There were protests in the black community in Ocala when prosecutors took weeks to charge Lorincz with manslaughter – a lesser count than second-degree murder, which carries a potential life sentence. She was eventually sentenced to 25 years in prison for manslaughter.The project’s trajectory shifted dramatically after one crucial development. Dias’s lawyers used the Freedom of Information Act to compel the police to release all materials pertaining to the case. As well as a huge amount of police body camera footage, this included mobile phone footage, security camera footage, phone calls made by Lorincz, and detective interrogations.View image in fullscreen‘A real lack of remorse’ … video provided by the Marion County Sheriff’s Office of Susan Lorincz’s arrest.Photograph: APAs Gandbhir and her team assessed these files, their immense potential slowly dawned on them. “It was a mess when it came to us,” Gandbhir says. “But I’m a film-maker – it’s my only skill in life. We managed to get through it all. And I realised we could do more with it.” This, she thought, was more than a collection of raw clips – it was a comprehensive, unvarnished archive that could form the basis of a feature-length documentary.Gandbhir approached Dias and suggested creating a film that would not only honour her daughter’s memory and seek justice, but could also be licensed or sold to provide financial support for the family, and have a broader societal impact. Dias gave her blessing, providing the moral mandate for the project to proceed.Gandbhir began her career in scripted film, working with directors including Spike Lee and Robert Altman, before switching to documentaries. Her decision to base it almost exclusively on official footage is the defining feature of The Perfect Neighbor, which deliberately eschews traditional elements such as narration, expert interviews and talking heads. The result is immersive and propulsive.“The key to the best storytelling,” Gandbhir says, “and what you see often in narrative films and scripted films and in the best verité documentaries, is show and don’t tell. If you tell an audience what’s happening, they might question you: who are you and how do you know? Talking heads are a wonderful tool but if you have the ability to show an audience, they will trust you. They will go on the ride with you. We believe audiences are smart and empathetic and can come to their own conclusions. We wanted to embed them in this world.”View image in fullscreenA patched bullet hole on the door through which Owens was shot.Photograph: John Raoux/APThe body camera footage certainly puts viewers right among the action. We watch a group of children, one on a bike, as an officer asks if they’ve been “messing with this lady”. We are with the police as they knock on Lorincz’s door to investigate complaints. We are thrown into chaos on the night Owens dies as her children grieve and emergency services try to revive her.“It’s institutional footage,” Gandbhir says. “I felt the public would never doubt its authenticity. There was no reporter on the ground with bias. Right now, there is a lot of doubt about the authenticity of things. I believed that people would trust what they were seeing as it unfolded.“Also, police body camera footage for people of colour like myself, for black and brown folks, oftentimes is seen as a violent tool. The police come into our communities and, afterwards, they use body camera footage to criminalise and dehumanise us, to justify violence they may perpetrate against the community. I wanted to take this footage and flip it on its head.”The footage includes previous incidents involving Lorincz and her neighbours over two years. “You see the community as they were before the crime, this beautiful little community living together, taking care of each other. You see the children playing in the street and the parents all looking out. There’s a father who comes out and says, ‘I look out for all of them as if they’re mine.’ There’s a neighbour who says, ‘All these kids are mine’ to the cops. The children themselves are confident and precocious and unafraid of the police. They are loved and secure. They have multiple guardians. I wanted to show how one outlier with access to a gun – one dangerous person – could change all of that.”She believed she was going to get away with it until the very last minuteThe police fundamentally failed the community, Gandbhir says. They consistently viewed Lorincz as a “nuisance” rather than a threat, even as her behaviour escalated. She used hate speech and racial slurs, waved a gun and terrorised the children – while repeatedly calling the police. In depicting Lorincz, the film relies on police interrogation footage that reveals a calculated pattern of behaviour, in which she would alternate between two personalities: one aggressive, another positioning herself as the perpetual victim.Under the pressure of questioning, says Gandbhir, “the case she had built for herself in her mind crumbled”. But rather than labelling Lorincz, the film simply presents her own words and actions. “Most fascinating,” Gandbhir says, “was how she believed she was going to get away with it until the very last minute. There was a real lack of remorse. Her only concern was herself.”The Perfect Neighbor also shines a light on “stand your ground” laws that, in more than half of US states, remove a person’s legal duty to retreat from a perceived threat before using deadly force. Florida’s version allows individuals to use deadly force if they believe their life is in danger, even if a safe retreat is possible. This led to the2013 acquittal of George Zimmerman, who shot unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Miami Gardens, Florida. Research shows that homicides with white aggressors and black victims are five times more likely to be ruled justifiable.During her police interrogation, Lorincz admits to having researched the “stand your ground” laws, thereby revealing that her actions were not the spontaneous result of fear but a calculated strategy. “These laws,” Gandbhir says, “are often weaponised by people. You just have to prove that you had a well-founded fear that your life was in danger. This is incredibly dangerous for people of colour, who are often criminalised and seen as a threat.”View image in fullscreen‘A violent tool’ … police bodycam footage in The Perfect Neighbor.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixThe story of Owens and Lorincz is also the story of America today, in all its seething rage and fear; a place of racial division and gun violence. But Gandbhir found grounds for hope. “This film holds a mirror up to society. You see it in Susan’s behaviour, in her weaponising the police and dehumanising the community and her neighbours. She choses to ‘adultify’ and criminalise the children, most of them under 12, playing in a yard near her house that they had permission to be in.“There are many Susans – but there are also many people like the neighbours. This shows you the best of America because it shows you a diverse, multiracial community living together, loving each other, taking care of each other’s kids.“The night that Ajike was killed, you see obviously the horror, but you also see that community spring into action. They put their lives in danger. They went out on to the lawn and surrounded Ajike. Susan was still in the house with a gun. They didn’t know how trigger-happy she was. They didn’t know what she was going to do. They went and immediately took the children and held them.“That is the best of America. That is what I believe in and what we hope people walk away with – realising that communities like that need to be protected. We must protect them from the Susans of the world.”The Perfect Neighbor opens in UK cinemas on 10 October and streams on Netflix from 17 OctoberExplore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsUS crimeFloridaRacefeaturesShareReuse this content"

What took so long?Lyndsey WinshipMon 6 Oct 2025 12.41 EDTLast modified on Mon 6 Oct 2025 13.04 EDTShareAcentury ago, the dancerMartha Grahambegan teaching at a small studio above Carnegie Hall in Manhattan. It was the start of a dance revolution. Graham wasn’t the first dancer to cast off ballet’s shackles and look for new ways of moving as the world shifted in the early 20th century: free-spirited Isadora Duncan had wafted her way through European salons; Loie Fuller experimented with costume and light effects; Ruth St Denis and Ted Shawn, with whom Graham trained, explored dance aping the styles of India, Egypt and Japan. But it’s Graham who became the true godmother of modern dance, developing a technique that would become the foundation of many dancers’ training around the world, and starkly modernist choreography that would point dance in a new direction.Where ballet leapt to the sky, Graham was rooted to the earth. Where classical backs stood straight, Graham curved the spine and tilted the pelvis in deep contractions, connecting to some primal place of power. In the most famous images of Graham dancing, she wears a full skirt kicked into a semicircle while she reaches high or far into space, but also into the psyche. You can sense her gravity by just looking at the photo. Masha Maddux, who joined the Graham company in 2007 (Graham herself died in 1991 aged 96) describes the technique: “It’s restrained. It’s very deep, very visceral, theatricalised and with a certain bite.” And what does it feel like to dance it? “Liberating!”View image in fullscreenStarting a trend … Edd Mitton and Abigail Attard-Montalto in Errand Into the Maze by Yorke Dance Project at Linbury theatre, London, in 2024.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianYet as Graham’s company prepares to celebrate its centenary in 2026, what’s strange about such a legendary performer, so fundamental to dance’s history, is that her work is rarely seen in the UK. “I do not understand why,” saysYolande Yorke-Edgell, whose London-based company Yorke Dance Project has presented a number of short Graham works.Aaron S Watkin, artistic director of English National Ballet (ENB), felt the same when he moved to London after working in Europe. “I was thinking, she’s the mother of modern dance, she’s so iconic and famous, but hardly anyone is doing it.”Yorke-Edgell, however, may have started a trend. Last year, her company performed Graham’s 1947 piece Errand Into the Maze, a Minotaur-inspired heroine’s journey (with demons real and metaphorical); it was then picked up by ballerina Natalia Osipova for her solo project. And now ENB is performing the same piece. “It’s like a 15-minute introduction to Martha Graham, everything that you’d want,” says Watkin. For an autumn tour, YorkeDanceProject is mounting another Graham piece, Deep Song, an angry, despairing solo made in response to the Spanish civil war. So, finally, there’s more Martha Graham on the menu.Born in 1894 in Pennsylvania, Graham later moved to California with her family. Her father, a doctor and psychiatrist, gave her what she called her first lesson in dance. “Movement never lies,” he told her. After dancing with St Denis and Shawn’s Denishawn company, Graham took a job with the Greenwich Village Follies musical revue, but was certain that her art form could be more than what Maddux says she called “inconsequential entertainment”. Graham soon established her school and company, creating weighty work inspired by Greek mythology, history, the American west and our rich interior worlds (as in 1930’s Lamentation, a study of grief), with strong female characters at the fore.So many important artists passed through her studio, from other dance pioneers such as Merce Cunningham, who performed with Graham’s company before setting out his own trailblazing path in modern dance, to Madonna, who took classes when she first arrived in New York. It was Graham who gave the rebellious student the moniker Madame X, a name Madonna used for an album title decades later. Graham was a force, no doubt, in person and on stage. In her photographs, dark hair swept back into a chignon, she emanates seriousness, and she was passionate too. Or as Maddux puts it: “Not the kind of person who would civilise herself. So if emotion was raw she didn’t hold back.” Yorke-Edgell, who encountered Graham at an audition, describes her having the kind of energy that vibrates. “She just had this presence; a total commitment to her art form,” she says, remembering what the former Graham dancer and teacherRobert Cohanwould say: “When she left the stage, she took the stage with her.”View image in fullscreenRooted to the earth … Martha Graham performing in Salem Shore.Photograph: Hulton Deutsch/Corbis/Getty ImagesBack in the present day, in ENB’s east London studio, Maddux is coaching dancers Minju Kang and Rentaro Nakaaki in Errand Into the Maze, trying to pass on some of that Graham energy. Nakaaki is the Minotaur character, with a horned headpiece attached to a bit he holds in his teeth. (Which can be painful, apparently. Yorke-Edgell tells of a performer in New York who dislocated his jaw from biting too hard during a performance. The physical challenge, she says, “does create more of a monster”). Between Nakaaki and Kang it is a battle of wills rather than blows. The shapes they make are like a woodcut, every movement so defined, solid, economical; there’s no visual noise. When Kang throws her leg straight up to the ceiling, turning her whole body into an arrow, it’s so decisive. But then the famous Graham contractions tug at the torso like inner turmoil. Some of the geometry is like jazz dance, but the context and the energy is so different it feels completely other.At the side of the studio, dancer Emily Suzuki is practising a step, her face intensely focused. She’s simply turning from facing the front to the side, but the resistance in the body has to be exactly right for it to work. “It’s like being pulled in both directions,” Maddux tells her. “Maybe her mind or her heart wants to resolve something, but physically she says no. It’s a very emotional internal dialogue.” It is not just a step to the side. These ideas are clear to see when you watch. The dancers’ faces don’t betray too much emotion, the point is that the dance does it for you. “We try to cultivate a physical voice that travels and projects far,” says Maddux. “To use the movement to crank up the volume on your entire body.”There is nevertheless a lot going on psychologically for the dancers at the same time. “They have to do some really deep emotional digging,” says Maddux. But for Graham, the movement itself could give you the emotion you need to portray. “Something here so deep produces that frightened state that the audience responds to,” says Maddux. You’re not “acting” emotions, she says: “You really have to internalise it and then let it bubble up. I call it the can of soda, you know, you shake it until …”Having recently seen three different dancers in the lead role in Errand, what’s interesting is that while Graham’s choreography is so recognisable and specific, each interpretation is still very different. “It’s such a fabulous role for the lead woman,” says Watkin. “It’s such a character, it’s like doing a full-length Onegin or Manon.”The sense of high drama, Watkin admits, could feel somewhat dated. But, at the same time, the distinctive choreography cuts through. The designs are striking too, and integral to the dance. A V-shaped sculpture by Isamu Noguchi for Errand Into the Maze is like a portal or gateway the protagonist steps through. In the iconic Lamentation, which Yorke Dance Company has performed, the dancer sits inside a stretchy tube of fabric. “You have to keep it completely taut the whole time,” says Yorke-Edgell, so that tension becomes an innate part of the dance. Graham designed her own costumes, such as the amazing yellow, green and black striped dress recently worn by singer (and classically trained dancer)FKA twigsto perform Graham’s 1932 piece Satyric Festival Song.English National Ballet’s R:Evolution review – a triple whammy of Balanchine, Forsythe and GrahamRead moreFKA twigs said the opportunity to perform Graham’s work was “like winning a Grammy”, such is the stellar power of her legacy. Why should we still be watching Graham’s dance – and maybe even watching more of it – a century on? “I think because there’s a purity to her technique,” says Yorke-Edgell. “It all comes back to the humanity of her work,” suggests Maddux. Graham wrote in her memoir Blood Memory that the essence of dance is the landscape of the soul. “I hope that every dance I do reveals something of myself or some wonderful thing a human can be,” she said. But I like another quote of hers that points to the transcendent power of her art: “Dancers are the messengers of the gods.”English National Ballet is performing Errand Into the Maze as part of R:Evolution atSadler’s Wells theatre, London, until 11 October.

We’ve now been together for 30 years’Interviews byDave SimpsonMon 6 Oct 2025 09.44 EDTLast modified on Mon 6 Oct 2025 18.28 EDTShareGrant Nicholas, singer, songwriter, guitaristI wrote Buck Rogers in a drunken state in my flat in Camden, London. I’d broken up with my long-term girlfriend but was hoping that we’d get back together, which is why the chorus goes: “I think we’re gonna make it.” A friend had told me she was dating a guy who’d just done a car advert, which must have been in my head when I wrote: “He’s got a brand new car. Looks like a Jaguar.” The second verse, about us starting again in a house in Devon and drinking “cider from a lemon”, was probably inspired by playing gigs in little clubs down there when Feeder were starting out – and by my teenage years in Wales, when we mixed cider with lemonade. They were throwaway lyrics to get a song going. I never intended keeping them.Some time after that, I was asked if I’d be interested in co-writing songs with a band who were working with producer Gil Norton, the sort of thing which happened a lot in those days. Gil was top of my list of dream producers for our third album, Echo Park, because I loved his work with Pixies, but he was in demand and out of reach. Taking up the offer was a way of meeting him.We had a few drinks in my local, went back to my flat and I played him some songs. As soon as Gil heard my old rough demo of Buck Rogers, he said: “That’s a hit.” The record company said the same thing. I tried to tell all of them: “It’s not finished!” But everyone insisted changes would ruin it.When we recorded it with Gil, he kept the “It’s got a CD player … player … player” effect from my original demo, because he thought it made a great hook. We repeated it for “lemon … lemon … lemon”.Jon Leeloved the song more than I did, but he was never happy with his drums and replaced them at the last minute. He played all the parts in one or two takes because he was a great drummer, and just gave it a bit more energy.Even at that stage, I thought the song would end up as a B-side at best. I would have been quite happy to leave it off the album – but it’s probably just as well I left it on! I must have written more than 300 songs but Buck Rogers is the one everybody knows and loves. It’s popular with cover bands and people sing it at karaoke. I went through a period of refusing to play it live, but I’ve made my peace with the song now. My wife finds the whole thing hilarious. She was the girlfriend who inspired it, and we did “make it”. We’ve now been together for more than 30 years.Gil Norton, producerMy wife was a big Feeder fan. I didn’t know them so much but I did really like their songHigh. Then, when I was working with an American band called SR-71, Grant’s name came up as a potential collaborator. We met and he played me Buck Rogers assuming it was a throwaway song that he was going to give to another band and never hear again. But I said: “You can’t give that away! You should keep it for yourself.”We started recording in the Kinks’ studio, Konk, near where we both lived in London, but there were electrical problems so we relocated to Great Linford Manor, near Milton Keynes. The vocals on Buck Rogers will be a very early take. I liked to get a guide vocal down and work from that, because you get a more honest, innocent take on the lyrics. I don’t remember Jon redoing the drums but I’m not saying it didn’t happen. He was the band’s grounding influence. Whenever there were any doubts, he’d be the person going: “Don’t worry. This is great.”Grant actually tried changing the words – especially the lines about the house in Devon and the cider lemonade – but I thought it was great imagery so convinced him to leave them well alone. Sometimes you don’t need to be Shakespeare – you just need to tell a story. Buck Rogers is seen as lightweight but if you listen closely, it’s actually quite a deep, emotional song. The best songs strike something within you, even if you don’t know what it is.A deluxe reissue of Feeder’s album Comfort in Sound is out now on BMG.Feeder play Bristol Beacon on 9 October and O2 Academy Birmingham on 11 OctoberExplore more on these topicsCultureHow we madePop and rockIndiefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Throughout his career, he made innumerable images of the consequences of ageing on the human face, and of its inevitability. For someone first, and perhaps in the world’s imagination still, most associated with images of youth and beauty, vitality and joy – the girl swirling her skirt, leaping over a puddle, playing pinball in Paris at midnight – there is at least as much of his oeuvre (his “Irv” as he would self-mockingly say) devoted to the old and wizened and wise.His friends always said that he was the youngest person in the room – but he didn’t want to be the youngest person in the room. It was, if not exactly an insult, a banality: what Dick wanted was to be the most complicated person in the room. He loved mixed emotions and contradiction within a single image, or sitter, more than a clumping at either end of the emotional spectrum. He loved images like the famous Leonardo da Vinci that juxtaposes the profile of a beautiful youth with a nutcracker-jawed old man. And so, in a beautiful pairing of portraits of movie directors, at first we may see the belligerent John Ford pitted against the benevolent Jean Renoir. Ford’s curled lip and ostentatious, angry eye patch – an eye patch is angry in its insistence on making you aware of the loss of the eye – seen against the gentle humanist glance of Renoir, who seems at first like a sage French artist-saint of the same kind as Georges Braque.But look again, and Ford and Renoir are equally belligerent and benevolent, the pugilistic curl of their lips contradicting the beam in their eyes, and Renoir’s asymmetrical gaze is as calculating as it is saintly. Ford may be staring us down (very Americanly), but Renoir is sizing us up. The easy complementary cliches of humanism are betrayed or deepened: men do not become movie directors by geniality alone. Ambition, craft and purpose are portrayed here too.Avedon was at war with the cliches of portraiture, including the cliches of ageing, and anything that seemed either merely pious or too picturesque offended him. Contradiction was the engine of his art. It was difficult sometimes for his sitters to believe that he was not belittling them or betraying them when he told them that he valued what they were hiding as much as what they were proud to display. This was one reason Avedon struggled, and never entirely succeeded, in taking on his own ageing self – either making himself look too angry in a way that was entirely uncharacteristic, or else too firm in a way that was too self-enclosed, perhaps because the vital contradiction in his own character was as invisible to him as his subjects’ were to them. The magician could work magic on others but not himself.View image in fullscreenThe Duke and Duchess of Windsor, Waldorf Astoria, suite 28A, New York, 16 April 1957.(The real contradiction in his character – between the serious and austere student of human accomplishment he was and the ambitious, hypercompetitive force within New York he was often accused of being – was invisible to him, as our real contradictions are to all of us. A late-in-life documentary showed him moonily walking the Montauk cliffs outside his house, lost in thought – a place in fact he never went, remaining inside on the telephone with friends, advising, consoling, strategising, delighting.)The old men and women who knew how to be two things at once – or even more things than that – were his true subjects, and his gift for somehow conveying their multitudinous selves in a radically compressed and seemingly laconic single image remains breathtaking, unique in the history of portraiture. He is often at his best with the worst: the antisemite Ezra Pound howls with the sheer pain of being, and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor become a frightened, wide-eyed Beckett couple. Even the people he admired were complimented by his eye for their asymmetries: Stravinsky looks at us with a levelled gaze that is almost stricken and calculating, both a man of surly genius and a man of calculation and ambition, a genius and a rug merchant.WH Auden is a druid and oracle, face lined with care, and a silent comedian out for an awkward flat-footed walk, a pilgrim on the Lower East Side in his bedroom slippers in the snow. (“I woke up and it was snowing, and I wanted to see Auden within it,” Dick explained once, and he phoned up the presumably bemused but willing poet and asked to take his picture.) His portrait of his old friend, contemporary and collaborator Truman Capote shows him as far more intelligent than he chose to pretend and eviler than he liked to admit. When it came to the elderly Dorothy Parker, Avedon did not admire her spirit less for her face becoming less “beautiful” and, registering accurately her decline, he italicised her courage.View image in fullscreenToni Morrison, writer, New York, 10 September 2003.One portrait that I had long overlooked is that of Harold Arlen, the great songwriter who married blues and jazz to Broadway melody. He was part of a class of men whom Avedon understood unconditionally; the artists who walked the dangerous and unwelcoming wire between art and show business. Arlen comes at us as astonishingly anxious, perhaps vain – his hair seems darker than the age of his face allows – his face marked by the stigmata of anxiety that Avedon sought and prized as much as Leonardo loved a half smile. He hardly looks the image of a smooth, suave, successful songsmith of the self-willed Hoagy Carmichael sort. But Avedon’s portrait shares a deeper truth in the form of a more contradictory view.It’s for that reason that, pressed to the wall to choose his own greatest portrait, Avedon almost certainly would have chosen that of Oscar Levant. He admired him almost unconditionally, as a wit and musician and member of the 20s Gershwin circle – for Dick, the highest social circle he could imagine, Jewish in its warmth but aristocratic in its self-presentation. Levant was a great songwriter (Blame It on My Youth) and in his day the most admired exponent of Gershwin’s concert music on stage. Levant had betrayed his own talent with drugs and dissipation – yet his gleam and crazy ecstasy in the midst of his own ruin seemed to Avedon the image, not only of where we’re all likely to go, but of where we’d all want to be.What worse than going toothless and to seed in Beverly Hills? But what better than being frankly crazy in one’s own best bathrobe? The descent of genius into madness, and the elevation of desperation into a kind of ecstasy – both of these were Avedon’s benchmarks, his obsessive fascinations. Avedon’s Levant is an image of doomed self-degradation in the grip of addiction; delighted self-celebration even in the face of despair. Both are there, and both are true.View image in fullscreenJacob Israel Avedon, father of Richard, Sarasota, Florida, 25 August 1973.Of all of Avedon’s pictures of ageing, the series he did of his father was closest to his heart and mind, and still in many ways the most difficult for us to assimilate and accept. It is a brutal study of an old man dying, from first anxious intimations of mortality to head bowed in the indignity of a hospital gown. It is difficult to believe – it was difficult for his father, who saw the first ones at least, to believe – that they were in any sense beneficent or empathetic, or even admiring. Avedon insisted that they were, and in one memorable night, he tried to explain to me why. His father had assumed a facade his whole life: Smilin’ Jack Avedon, an entrepreneur, a family man, like every Jewish man of that generation, as Philip Roth wrote once, serving his family in a self-annihilating way. The facade was not what was admirable about his father, or human – it was the frailty, the doubt that the facade was covering.“There was a picture of you on the piano that I saw every day when I was growing up,” Avedon wrote. “It was by the Bachrach studio and heavily retouched, and we all used to call it ‘Smilin’ Jack Avedon’ – it was a family joke, because it was a photograph of a man we never saw, and of a man I never knew. When you pose for a photograph, it’s behind a smile that isn’t yours. You are angry and hungry and alive. What I value in you is that intensity. I want to make portraits as intense as people.”An existentialist by generational conviction, Avedon was a humanist by instinct – someone who believed that being alive is the only conscious condition in the cosmos, and that what we are as people is all there is to know. No afterlife, no eternity, not even much chance of the immortality of reputation – and in any case, what good is the immortality of reputation if you are not there to experience it? Still, there is life …View image in fullscreenRichard Avedon, photographer, New York, 31 May 2002.A reasonable case has been made that thefamous Leonardo double profilein fact shows one man – the artist himself – imagined at two extremes of existence, youthful beauty and older senescence, not a confrontation of two kinds but the metamorphosis of a single being. The blurred line dividing beauty and ugliness is its subject, the two bookend conditions suggesting the spectrum between. Pictures of the human condition? Avedon’s portraits of the aged are more like commentary on the conditional nature of being human; we are all in the process of making ourselves, hiding ourselves, trying to be more beautiful and sage – like those other people, in their portraits – while forced to remain ourselves.Age creeps up on us genially from behind, a smiler with a knife, then stabs us in the back. All we can do is dance. And if the death throes look very much like the most ecstatic steps? Well, that’s life. Even when leaving the stage, we are still upon it. Even dying, we are still in play.This is an edited extract from the introduction by Adam Gopnik toRichard Avedon Immortal: Portraits of Aging, 1951-2004.

It sums up a stillness, a sadness and a romantic passion that breathes in this show – but you won’t notice it straight away. Instead you’ll be carried along in a rush of cheeky provocations and ludicrous juxtapositions of word and image: a joyous embrace of modern life or even, pardon my French, ajouissance.The pictures tower and expand in this perfect brutalist setting as if you’re walking through a city of art – a dirty, disreputable city. Ages (2001) is a yellow and red slab almost the scale of a cinema screen on which their blandly smiling faces are surrounded by male sex workers’ adverts: “27 YEARS OLD Latin, and very good looking,” “BLACK GUY 24 Marco. Sexy, horny and waiting,” “SKINHEAD JOE, 26. East End/10 mins Liverpool St. Administers firm service.”Where are they now? Is skinhead Joe running a cafe or is he dead? You find yourself not sniggering but wondering about these young men. It’s a slice of life, a montage of transactions, moments, relations of power, desire and money in a metropolis. Gilbert & George are great scabrous chroniclers of London in the tradition of Hogarth. Like him, they dive into the dirty alleys of a city that can be brutal and they come up laughing at it all. One of their obsessions a few years ago was Evening Standard headline hoardings that tempted commuters with the latest horrors. One picture is an array containing the word “Murder”. So many murders. Other such pictures highlight bombings, and brothels – “VICAR FIGHTS BROTHEL CLOSURE” is a gem.View image in fullscreen‘Almost the scale of a cinema screen’ … Ages (2001).Photograph: Guy Bell/ShutterstockIt’s hard to resist quoting Gilbert & George’s choice gobbets of found language. I won’t do it again, promise, except: “PEARLY PENILE PAPULES” and “LIFE AFTER DEATH PROVED.” The latter is at the centre of a picture that includes people snapped on a bus, Gilbert & George wearing terroristic balaclavas and a telephone box and postbox perhaps offering communication with the next life. It’s funny but serious, too – what if life after death was proven?You might find it hard to look past the words Sex, Money, Race and Religion on Gilbert & George’s epic quadripartite picture entitled, what else, Sex, Money, Race and Religion. But if you do, another story is told. Postmarks from old letters or postcards, surely hoarded by the artists, are scattered across masses of brightly coloured leaves. The dates are meaningful. On Sex, they come from the 1960s and early 70s: “Aylesbury, Bucks, 1969”, “Cambridge, 1971.” Money takes us through the late 70s into the 1980s when they began to make their pictures, thus monetising as well as preserving their previously ephemeral art. Race preoccupied them in the 1980s while religion worried them in the 1990s: “Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, 26. 2. 1996”, says one of the last postmarks.Religion still gets their goat. They are opposed to all authoritarianism, especially religious. Their insults to God have got ruder as religion in this century has grown as a sociopolitical force. Pixie Hill conflates Christ with a grotesque toy pixie, Was Jesus Heterosexual makes merry with crucifixes while other ginormous works are covered with graffiti against multifarious faiths. But you would have to try hard to be offended. The moment you see something that contradicts your personal politico-religious bubble, it’s contradicted. You might expect them to flaunt the union jack, and they do, but did you expect to see their Antifa inspired series that includes “Our grandparents didn’t vote for fascists … They shot them!”View image in fullscreenHeadline news … Murder (2011).Photograph: Jordan Pettitt/PAThey don’t mean to make a political point by the flag waving, or the fascist-killing – they just show what they see, and what they see is everything. All human existence is crystallised in their particular urban world, living and dying in their local streets. Yet the hardcore truth behind the hilarity is poetic. What stays with you is beauty. For they don’t just find rude objects and words on their walks. They collect leaves and twigs and photograph pockets of urban nature among the comic horrors. In Cross Kissing, a curly frond of city weed links their mouths. And the most recent work I noticed here, from 2024, portrays them with a twig they found. It’s called Twig. In a way, lust for life is their religion. What are all these vast multicoloured pictures if not stained glass windows? Gilbert and George worship in their own way – they reverence nature, the city, their relationship.‘Too soothing’: why have music-hating art duo Gilbert & George gone orchestra mad?Read moreAnother picture here, 28 London Streets, is a gallery of evocative street names from their neighbourhood – Princelet Street, Henriques Street, Chudleigh Street. Instead of gurning or cavorting as in their other self portraits, the artists here are two misty, spectral entities: the ghosts of Gilbert & George, haunting their old streets for ever. They made that back in 2003, at the start of their 60s. Now they are in their 80s. And they haunt the same streets, but not as ghosts. Not yet.Some sophisticates may be a bit sick of their antics, but to rip off Dr Johnson on London itself – to be tired of Gilbert & George is to be tired of life.Gilbert & George: 21st Century Pictures is at theHayward Gallery, London,7 October to 11 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsGilbert & GeorgeArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

She explains how the disrupted experience of Black daily life fills her workMon 6 Oct 2025 08.38 EDTShareThe ever-viral hip-hop video platform On the Radar has hosted freestyles from some of the biggest artists in the world. Drake, Central Cee and Ice Spice have each graced the channel with their presence, yet throughout its seven-year history, few acts have gone in quite like Klein. This time last year, the south London artistspiralled througha procession of evocative flexes, rasped through Auto-Tune over a mind-expanding loop of pitch-shifted wailing, then slung a black guitar over her shoulder to shred through a lacerating noise solo with a joyous smile.“People were trying to beat me up!” she says, giggling as she reflects on her appearance. “I was just being myself! Some people liked it, some people didn’t, some people hated it so much they would send me emails. For someone to feel that so viscerally as to send me an email? Low key? Iconic.”Klein’s wildly varied output exists on this polarising axis. For everyCaroline Polachek collaborationorfeatureon aMike record, you can expect afrazzled drone albumrecorded in a single session to be put up for Grammy consideration or the quiet, Bandcamp-only release of one of her “once in a blue moon”rapsongs. For everyunsettling rap videoshe directs or grinningappearance alongside Earl Sweatshirt, she puts out aReal Housewives of Atlanta reviewor a full-blownfeature film, starring kindred spirit composer Mica Levi and cultural theorist Fred Moten as her parents. She once convincedCharlotte Churchto duet with her and last year starred as a vampire missionary in a one-woman play in Los Angeles.On several occasions throughout our long video call, talking animatedly against a hypersaturated virtual beach scene, she encapsulates it best herself: “You couldn’t make it up!”This plurality is testament to Klein’s DIY ethos. Entirely self taught, with “two and a half” GCSEs to her name, she operates on instinct, taking her love of reality TV as seriously as inspiration as she does the work of contemporaries Diamond Stingily and the Turner prize winner Mark Leckey. “Sometimes I feel like a baby, and then sometimes I feel like a 419 [Nigerian financial] scam artist, because I’m still figuring things out,” she says.She opts for privacy when it comes to biography, though she credits growing up in the church and the mosque as influencing her approach to composition, as well as some aspects of her adolescent experiences editing video and working as logger and researcher in television. Yet, despite an impressively extensive body of work, she says her parents still aren’t really aware of her creative output. “They have no idea that Klein exists, they think I’m at uni doing anthropology,” she says, laughing. “My life is really on some Hannah Montana-type beat.”Her latest project, the singularSleep With a Cane, collects 16 avant-classical compositions, slanted ambient folk songs and haunted musique concrète. The sprawling record recasts rap mixtape excess as an eerie meditation on the surveillance state, police brutality and the everyday paranoia and stress of navigating London as a person of colour.View image in fullscreen‘My life is really on some Hannah Montana-type beat’ … Klein.Photograph: Lengua“The titles of my songs are always quite literal,” she says. “Family Employment 2008–2014 is funny, because that was just nonexistent for my family, so I wrote a score to help me understand what was going on around that period.” The prepared guitar composition For 6 Guitar, Damilola collapses classical naming convention into a tribute to Damilola Taylor, the 10-year-old Nigerian schoolboy killed in 2000. Trident, a 16-second flash of a track featuring snatches of vocals from the Manchester luminaries Space Afrika, embodies Klein’s feelings about the titular police unit set up to tackle gun crime in Black communities at the turn of the millennium. “It’s this echoing, interlude break that constantly interrupts the flow of a normal person trying to live a normal life,” she says.That song melts into the unsettling drone drift of Young, Black and Free, featuring contributions from Ecco2K, affiliate of the cult Swedish rap collective Drain Gang. “As we were finishing the track, I realised it was more of a question,” Klein says of its title. “There was a period where I lived in this area that was constantly surveilled,” she continues. “I saw police on horses every single day, to the point that I remember someone said I must have been sampling police noise [in her music]. No! Every sound was from my actual environment.”Sleep With a Cane’s most stunning, challenging composition, Informa, captures this relentless sense of persecution. Opening with a sample of a news broadcast about young people in London swapping “a life of violence” for “creativity and independence”, Klein exposes legacy media platitudes by illuminating the oppression suffered by Black youths. By stretching, looping and recreating the sample, she elongates and amplifies its myopic absurdity. “That in itself sums up how I was seen when I first started making stuff,” she says, “with people using weird dog whistles to allude to the fact that I’m Black, or allude to the fact that I grew up poor, without just saying what it is.”As though channelling this frustration, Informa eventually bursts into a brilliant pearlescent swell, perhaps the most straightforwardly beautiful moment of Klein’s discography so far. And yet, seething just beneath the surface, a sinister coda: “Your life doesn’t flash before your face.” The immediacy of this everyday tension is the animating force of Klein’s work, something few artists have captured so intricately. “I’m like an optimistic nihilist,” she says. “Everything’s going to shit, but there are still things that are magical.”Klein’s consistent efforts to dissolve boundaries between the dizzying variety of genre, media and influences that her work encompasses have led critics and fans to describe her as an experimental virtuoso, or an outsider artist. “What does being completely free look like?” Klein offers in response. “Music that is deemed classical or ambient is reserved for the experimental festivals or academia, but in my head I’m like, oh hell no! This is something for the streets!” While touring in support of her landmark albumHarmattan, released by the highbrow classical label Pentatone, it was the British rapper Jawnino she asked to open for her. “I want to hear harmonica in the strip club!” she continues. “These things shouldn’t be so separate. People do want to hear stuff that is challenging.”Klein’s outsider status, in all its complexity, has always informed her art, both as self-taught practitioner and unwilling object of state and music industry surveillance. “I feel like just existing as a Black woman makes me an outsider artist,” she says. “I’m going to a show and there’s a white man, watching behind me, to see if I’m really playing the guitar. That happens, that’sbeenhappening.“For me, as long as what I do reaches Black people, I’m good, man,” she enthuses. “If there’s one uncle, who works in my favourite Nigerian restaurant, who likes this one guitar song I did, my job is done!”Sleep With a Cane is out now on Parkwuud EntertainmentExplore more on these topicsExperimental musicHip-hopBlack British cultureinterviewsShareReuse this content"

As comedy goes, it couldn’t be more pleasurableRachel AroestiMon 6 Oct 2025 07.15 EDTLast modified on Mon 6 Oct 2025 18.55 EDTShareLike anyone who has grown up in the shadow of Alan Partridge’s three-decade dominion over British comedy, I want only the very best for Norwich’s most relentless broadcaster. By which I mean the absolute worst. For me, Partridge is at his finest when he’s scrabbling around the media’s outer fringes, rebranding past humiliations as glories and furiously name-dropping 1980s television personalities to the nonplussed acquaintances he genuinely believes to be his closest friends.Sadly, Alan has been riding (relatively) high in recent years. In 2022, Steve Coogan’s creation – now co-written by Rob and Neil Gibbons – embarked on a UK arena tour as a motivational speaker, imparting dubious advice to tens of thousands of adoring fans. Before that, he landed the job of a lifetime: a presenting gig on the BBC’s daily tea-time magazine show This Time. Obviously, he was disastrous – but was still invited to return for a second series.So it brings me great pleasure to report that Alan is finally back where he belongs: at rock bottom. In How Are You? It’s Alan (Partridge) – a self-produced, self-directed and largely self-funded series about the nation’s mental health – we are reunited with the presenter four years after the on-air meltdown that ended his BBC career. Since then, he’s pivoted (involuntarily) to the corporate sphere. He spent time in Saudi Arabia, shilling camel milk products with the requisite servility, and still presents Gulf Digital’s breakfast show from “downtown Jeddah” (AKA a Norwich business park) on an ad hoc basis. He hosts events for a pig feed manufacturer. He leads focus groups. He commentates on school sports days (“all-these-boys-racing-with-each-other-but-they’ve-already-won-the-race-of-life-by-going-to-a-fee-paying-school”). He lends his dulcet tones to everything from supermarket vans to the lift at Norwich library.Once a degrading step down of its own on the steadily descending staircase that was Alan’s pre-This Timecareer (previous rungs included military quiz Skirmish on digital channel UK Conquest andthe graveyard slot onterrestriallocal radio), Alan’s stint presenting Mid Morning Matters on North Norfolk Digital now seems like a peak never to be scaled again. At one stage, he wheedles his way into the station’s depressing offices where no one remembers his name in order to film content for the documentary with his erstwhile sidekick Simon Denton (Tim Key). Yet even the chronically amenable Denton hates his guts. Meanwhile, his supposed best mate Daryl Flench (whose tanning salon franchise is also sponsoring How Are You?) is clearly having an affair with his nasty new girlfriend Katrina (Katherine Kelly).View image in fullscreenThe perfect pairing? … Steve Coogan and Katherine Kelly in How Are You? It’s Alan (Partridge).Photograph: BBC/Baby Cow/Matt FrostWhy is there so much joy in seeing Partridge brought so low? It’s not quite schadenfreude – although his narcissism means it’s hard to feel particularly sorry for him. And while cringe comedy can also be feelgood TV – there is true comfort in knowing we are not Alan – that’s not the whole story. Instead, there’s something spellbinding and strangely uplifting about the way Alan reacts to the bottom falling out of his life. Ostensibly prompted by a fainting spell at a farming event, How Are You? is really an attempt to jump on the mental health bandwagon – if anything, the series fails because Alan is too functional to be an interesting case study. His arrogance and pettiness never falters, but neither does his resilience and determination. Really, it should have been over for Alan the moment he accidentally shot and killed a guest on his 1990s chatshow Knowing Me, Knowing You. Inspirationally, he has staggered on for decades.Alan is, of course, spurred on by steely delusion. He reframes his This Time exit as parting “ways with the BBC after delivering a few home truths”. A master of bullish doublethink, you believe him when he says he finds corporate work just as fulfilling as TV, even though he clearly doesn’t. He does, however, seem genuinely impervious to criticism. During a tense exchange with Denton in which the pair are encouraged to speak their truths therapy-style, his former sidekick admits, “I want to tell you to fuck off and say that when you worked here no one at the station liked you.” Alan seems invigorated, not wounded, by the exchange. He finds endless tiny ways to sate his ego – showing off a framed picture of himself with Crimewatch presenter Sue Cook’s brother, for example. He is either able to push guilt down into the furthest recesses of his being, or simply doesn’t feel it at all. Alongside a festering contempt for Noel Edmonds (the basis of many great gags here), this combination of denial and solipsism has coalesced into the kind of get-up-and-go that is unquestionably impressive for a man on the edge of 70.View image in fullscreen‘I want to tell you to fuck off’ … Alan Partridge with sidekick Simon Denton, played by Tim Key in How Are You? It’s Alan (Partridge).Photograph: BBC/Baby Cow/Ollie UptonThe other reason it’s so satisfying to see Alan on his uppers is because the character has long been an exquisite study in dwindling celebrity. Opportunities for the once-famous have never been greater: podcasts, crowdfunded content, social media, personalised video messages (“a nice little earner” for Alan), an entire ecosystem of reality TV and gameshows (we get a sublime glimpse of Alan on a celebrity cooking series, tearily admitting he’s forgotten what dill looks like). In an almost sketch show-less world, few are able to spoof the celebrity landscape. Often, fame seems effortless and aspirational – a product of the audience’s desire rather than the celebrity’s – yet Partridge’s interactions with the public remind us that most pursue it, feverishly.In How Are You? Alan is the funniest he’s been in years. This Time certainly had its moments (Sidekick Simon’s eye-watering struggles with the studio smart screen; Partridge demonstrating the optimal technique for corporal punishment on a visit to his old school), but it was always difficult to believe anyone would give Alan that job. Still, sometimes you just need a little boost to get you back on that comically fertile downward spiral.How Are You?

The case, which played out in an Australian court earlier this year, attracted global attention.The Mushroom Tapes, written with fellow Australian authors Chloe Hooper and Sarah Krasnostein, will be published by TextPublishingon 11 November in Australia and W&N in the UK on 20 November. The case has already inspired a television special, a forthcoming ABC drama series and several documentaries.Prosecutors alleged that Patterson, a mother and self-described true crime enthusiast, invited her estranged husband’s parents, Gail and Don Patterson, and Gail’s sister and brother-in-law, Heather and Ian Wilkinson, to lunch at her Victoria home in July 2023. Within days, three of the guests were dead and the fourth lay in a coma.Patterson, 51, denied any intent to harm them, claiming she had bought the mushrooms from a grocer and discarded a food dehydrator that later tested positive for deadly toxins only out of panic. After an 11-week trial, a jury found her guilty of three counts of murder and one of attempted murder. She was sentenced in September to life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 33 years.Garner, Hooper and Krasnostein were among the many writers, journalists and documentary teams who attended the trial. According to the publisher, The Mushroom Tapes emerged from their shared experience of “long days immersed in the case’s themes: love, hate, jealousy, revenge, marriage, money, mycology and murder.” The book is described as a “true crime study like no other” and an exploration of both the crime and the public’s obsession with it.Helen Garner’s work has often intertwined literature and the law. Her debut novel, Monkey Grip (1977), became an instant classic, while her later nonfiction – The First Stone, Joe Cinque’s Consolation and This House of Grief – cemented her reputation as a chronicler of Australia’s most fascinating court cases.Explore more on these topicsBooksErin Patterson mushroom trialPublishingnewsShareReuse this content"

The two murals are outliers in Hogarth’s back catalogue.Photograph: Barts Health NHS TrustHogarth was furious when he discovered that the Italian painter Jacopo Amigoni was to be given the commission to paint the staircase.Hogarth stepped in to offer his services free of charge, even though he had never painted on such a scale. “Amigoni was a safe pair of hands. He was a Venetian painter, but Hogarth, he was born literally a stone’s throw from the hospital. He knew the hospital well and almost felt an ownership of this project,” said Palin.“Hogarth also felt that English painters need to be supported and this very important commission should go to a native painter. He offered his services for free and I think it was probably the free bit which appealed to the government most.”The North Wing was built in 1732 to help run the hospital and raise money for it, but fell into decline as the hospital prioritised clinical areas. It has a Great Hall and staircase decorated by Hogarth.The two murals are outliers in Hogarth’s back catalogue. He never painted on such a huge scale again, and the works were meant to be inspirational to visitors who might then donate to the hospital.Hogarth’s painting includes sympathetic portraits of people afflicted with disease and injury: The Pool of Bethesda depicts a man who has been unable to walk for years being healed by Jesus.Planning, fundraising and execution of therestorationtook five years.

With the scene switching to Briney wearing oversized pink headphones and talking into a microphone, he adds: “You deserve to be loved … And thoroughly ruined.”Fans’ reaction to Briney’s unveiling as the narrator of an audio series on the erotica platform Quinn was feverish. Comments veered from: “I deserve to be WHAT?” and: “My God Jesus help me,” to the more esoteric: “I’M GOING TO BITE DRYWALL,” which, according to industry insiders, is “horny dialect” for: oh, go on then.But as well as being a major coup for a content platform that only launched its app in 2021, Briney’s move confirms erotica’s shift into the mainstream and highlights a seemingly insatiable appetite for romance and “spicy” fiction.‘Time-efficient foreplay’: inside the funny, filthy world of erotic podcastsRead moreLast year there were record book sales for the “romance and sagas” genre, whileEngland’s first romance-only bookshopopened in Notting Hill, west London, in June. In the audio space, Quinn’s revenues have doubled since February and its subscriber base has grown by 168% in 12 months, says its 27-year-old CEO, Caroline Spiegel, who founded the company while she was still at Stanford in 2019. A “cultural shift” is happening, she argues – and it’s being driven by women.“Our content is made for them – with them in mind, with them as the top priority and target customer,” she says. “Adult entertainment hasn’t historically prioritised women’s preferences, mostly because it’s been made by men, for men.”But audio erotica doesn’t just tell the stories women want to hear, it plays with narrative format to place them at the centre of their own fantasies, says romance writer and content creatorHolly June Smith, who wrote the Briney-narrated Hidden Harbor. Instead of traditional dialogue, the narrator speaks directly to the listener in an “immersive storytelling” experience.“Maybe the story is you’ve had a rough day at work, you’ve come home to your husband and he’s going to take care of you and tell you how amazing you are and then fuck you,” she says. “The focus is on you. You can just shut your eyes and imagine it happening. Some of my favourite listener feedback is when people say they’ve answered the narrator out loud with their headphones on in the supermarket.”The genre is still in its infancy, but content creators on Quinn – who earn money based on plays and overall performance, and tips from fans – are already attracting loyal fanbases. A recent “hangout” hosted by creatorsJohn Yorkand AJ was attended by about 100 erotica lovers. “It is such a welcoming and warm community,” says York. “People offer feedback and really helpful criticism. It really is unlike anywhere, unlike any sort of online space I’ve ever seen.While content is aimed at women, who make up 83% of Quinn subscribers, about three-quarters of creators are men, among themRyan Mairs, whose route into the genre was unconventional.A little over two years ago, the 29-year-old from Kent was working in recruitment, building a following on TikTok making comedy sketches and talking about mental health. Then, some keen-eared followers noticed his voice, and started making very specific requests. “It was all very: ‘Say this, say that’ – there were quite some very forward comments indeed,” he says. “It was, and it still is, quite an experience.”Deciding to give it a go, Mairs answered one request, and posted a video which was him simply saying “good girl”. Pandemonium ensued, with the video racking up a million views and sending Mair’s notifications wild. “It was a bit like: ‘Oh shit,’ but it was kind of fun,” he laughs. “It showed me that, wow, there is scope for this as a career, there’s a need in the community.”While there is little question that audio erotica is “spicy”, it is very different to traditional pornography, argues Spiegel. “Porn has become shorthand for graphic tube site content and exploitative practices, unrealistic portrayals of people and sex, lack of inclusivity, fetishisation, and the normalisation of sexual violence,” she says. “Audio erotica is acting, it’s built on consent, and it leaves space for your imagination.”Consent is big in the genre, and not just because platforms like Quinn have mandated its inclusion in all stories. Actually, listeners find consent sexy, says Smith. “In Hidden Harbor, Chris’s character, River, says: ‘Can I kiss you?’,” she says. “And people were going wild because they were like: ‘Oh, my God, that’s the hottest thing ever.’”Explore more on these topicsPodcastsAudio dramaSexWomennewsShareReuse this content"

Comedians have been going and playing Arab countries. There was a film festival there recently, it’s kind of opened up. But I’ve always said no to Arab countries.”CK said he was told there would only be two restrictions on what he could talk about on stage: “Their religion and their government.”“I don’t have jokes about those two things,” he added. “It used to be when I got offers from places like that, there would be a long list, and I’d just say, ‘No, I don’t need that.’ But when I heard it’s opening, I thought, that’s awfully interesting. That just feels like a good opportunity. And I just feel like comedy is a great way to get in and start talking.”Several comedians have questioned the ethics of performing comedy at a festival directly paid for by the Saudi Arabian government, which is notorious for human rights abuses and censorship, and its oppression of journalists, women and LGBTQ rights.The festival’s producersinclude Sela, a live events company owned by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund; and the kingdom’s General Entertainment Authority, which is chaired by Turki al-Sheikh, a royal adviser dogged by allegations of human rights violations, including the detention of people who criticise him on social media.Human Rights Watch arguedthe festival was an effort by the Saudi government to whitewash its actions “amid significant increase in repression including a crackdown on free speech, which many of these comedians defend but people in Saudi Arabia are completely denied”.Comedians including Marc Maron, Atsuko Okatsuka and David Cross have been scathing of performers who have complained about cancel culture and censorship in the past for agreeing to take part in Riyadh, with Crosspublishing a blistering statement on his websitethat called out CK by name.“Clearly you guys don’t give a shit about what the rest of us think, but how can any of us take any of you seriously ever again?” Cross wrote. “All of your bitching about ‘cancel culture’ and ‘freedom of speech’ and all that shit? Done. You don’t get to talk about it ever again. By now we’ve all seen the contract you had to sign.”CK acknowledged the criticism on Maher’s show.“I had mixed feelings about it too,” he said. “I struggled about going once I heard what everybody was saying. There’s some good in it, maybe some bad in it. But for me, I think it cuts toward going. That’s my decision, and I know where it’s coming from, because I can see right inside myself.”He added: “I love standup comedy, and I love comedians. So, the fact that that’s opening up and starting to bud, I wanna see it, I wanna be part of it. I think that’s a positive thing.”Kirson, who performed at the Riyadh festival on 29 September,told the Hollywood Reporter on Fridaythat she had asked for a guarantee that she could talk about being a lesbian on stage, saying she “hoped that this could help LGBTQ+ people in Saudi Arabia feel seen and valued … to my knowledge, I am the first openly gay comic to talk about it on stage in Saudi Arabia”.But she added: “At the same time, I deeply regret participating under the auspices of the Saudi government.” She apologised to fans who were disappointed by “a poor decision that had repercussions I didn’t fully consider” and said she would donate her fee to a human rights organisation.Burr, who performed in Riyadh on 26 September,defended his choice to take part, calling it “a mind-blowing experience”.“It was great to experience that part of the world and to be a part of the first comedy festival over there in Saudi Arabia,” Burr said on an episode of his Monday Morning Podcast.“The royals loved the show. Everyone was happy. The people that were doing the festival were thrilled. The comedians that I’ve been talking to are saying, ‘Dude, you can feel [the audience] wanted it. They want to see real standup comedy’ … I think it’s going to lead to a lot of positive things.”Explore more on these topicsComedyLouis CKSaudi ArabiaMiddle East and north AfricaHuman rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

He explains why now was the right time to write itMon 6 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 6 Oct 2025 07.43 EDTShareThere’s a telling moment in Lukas Gage’s new book where he refers to it as a “premature celebrity memoir”. It’s a self-deprecating joke, of course, but it is also true. Gage is not megawatt famous – at least not yet. Chances are, though, if you have seen him then you won’t have forgotten him. In 2020, he went viral after leaking an audition video in which the director – forgetting that he wasn’t on mute –is caught judging his living arrangements(“These poor people live in these tiny apartments,” he says, before Gage intervenes to let him know he can hear every word). The following year, Gage appeared in the first season ofThe White Lotus: in one scene, his character Dillon is caught by a hotel guest standing stark naked in the manager’s office, while said manager performs anilingus on him.“I thought: I don’t have too much to do in the show so I’d better put my mark on itbig,” he says with a smile today. “I wanted to give people something to remember me by – and I did!”Gage specialises in characters whose lives are messy and chaotic – just like his own. That life is all laid on the line in his memoir, which – here comes another self-deprecating joke – is titled I Wrote this Book for Attention. Although comically entertaining, its subject matter is anything but. We start with Gage’s feelings of rejection and abandonment by his father, then move on to drug use, sexual abuse, family dysfunction, addiction, personality disorders, shame, unstable relationships and heartbreak. What we don’t get all that much of is the glitz and glamour of stardom. Gage readily admits he is at the start of his career. He has no great reserves of wisdom to share on success. So what was the purpose of writing a memoir?“I think it’s cathartic for me to share my story,” he says over a video link from New York. “During the [Hollywood writers’] strike I had the free time to really dig in and go deep, so I just said: screw it.”Gage, 30, grew up in San Diego, and from an early age he was aware of his constant need for validation. He recalls a party where he appeared, aged four, wearing high heels and Playboy bunny ears; in particular, he recalls being wounded by his dad’s evident disgust at what he was doing. Their relationship never really recovered – Gage’s dad moved out and became increasingly distant with his sons (Gage has two older brothers) before settling down with a new family.Gage struggled to fit in at school. He was a natural performer, but this meant it was often hard to know who the real Lukas was. “I was constantly trying on different hats and personalities, which I think was quite polarising for people,” he says. It also had its advantages. Gage could effortlessly adopt the persona of a clean-living football player while secretly filling his bag up with booze at the back of the local store. He was sometimes paid by fellow pupils to call up and imitate their parents to get them out of class. “Becoming different people was effortless to me,” he says.The memoir deals with addiction – predominantly his older brother’s struggles with heroin that turn the cool sibling he idolised into a frail zombie, but also his mother’s obsession with casino slot machines. An early jackpot meant the family could afford to make the down payment on a bigger house, but Gage laughs when I ask if she actually made money from gambling. “Ultimately, how much she spent was definitely a lot more than that.”View image in fullscreenLukas Gage as Dillon and Murray Bartlett as Armond in The White Lotus.Photograph: HBOIt is funny, he says. Until she had read the book, his mum hadn’t really reconciled with this side of her personality. “She talked to my other brothers, like, ‘Do you guys feel this way too?’ And they were all like, ‘Of course, we’ve been saying this since we were kids.’”Gage has a lot of love for his mum, who clearly brought her children up in difficult circumstances. But she had a hard time reading it. “She felt as if she failed as a mother and I did not want her to feel that way whatsoever. I feel like even though there’s these chaotic things that happened to me, hard things, I actually loved the way that I grew up.”Gage didn’t begin to locate his true self until he was sent to an acting summer camp as a child, where being loud, flamboyant and attention-seeking was actually encouraged. The experience was life-changing in good ways, but also in a terrible one. One night, he was joined in his tent by a camp counsellor who instructed Gage and a girl camper to kiss, remove their clothes and rub their bodies against each other while he masturbated. For years afterwards, he tried to ignore the guilt and shame it left him with.“As with a lot of people who experience being molested, I felt like there was a willingness on my part because my body just checked out. I knew it was wrong. I knew that the situation should not be happening. But I just ploughed through it.”Gage is hard on himself in the book – and still is. He admits to searching out “dark critiques” of himself on the internet. “I dislike that I don’t always hold my acting and writing in the highest esteem,” he says. “I wish I could have more empathy with that part of myself.”Yet he accepts that this self-criticism drives him forward too. In high school, he appeared in a wart-removal commercial and spent the day on set asking every question possible about mic positioning and the role of grips. Despite his mum’s reservations, he left San Diego for Hollywood at the age of 18, staying in the Alta Cienega Motel where his hero Jim Morrison lived, on and off, between 1968 and 1970 (Tripadvisor reviews – “Stay FAR FAR AWAY from this DUMP!” – suggest it might not have been the most luxurious of lodgings).Gage’s big break should have come when he landed a small role in Mad Men, as Sally Draper’s crush. He told his whole family about it, but during a costume fitting he was forced to reveal the tattoos he’d had inked on his ribs, back and calf. “I had these agents saying to me: how could you ruin this? How could you mess this up? I don’t think that was the greatest thing for a teenager to hear when they’ve just lost something that big.”These days, such markings would be covered up in minutes, but back then he was shown the door and back to square one. The relentless rounds of auditions and rejections were brutal, but at least he had been trained well for them. “If I ever got rejected for a job, I would always think: it’s fine, it’s not as bad as my dad rejecting me for another family and kid,” he says.View image in fullscreenGage with Euphoria co-stars Sydney Sweeney and Hunter Schafer.Photograph: Randy Shropshire/Getty Images for Entertainment WeeklyGage persevered. The story of how he lied, begged and cheated to get an audition forAssassination Nation, which ultimately led to a role in the hit showEuphoria(as Tyler Clarkson, black-eyed and in a neck brace) and then The White Lotus, could take up a book in itself. Gage recalls the strangeness of shooting The White Lotus in 2020, holed up in a luxury Hawaii hotel while the pandemic and the US election raged on. It was actually Gage, along with co-star Murray Bartlett, who pitched the idea that their sex act should be something a bitextra– and show runner Mike White happily agreed. Gage laughs remembering his mum’s reaction. “She wrote me a message, like, ‘Such a cute bum, but maybe next time give me a heads-up that’s going to happen when I’m watching with my friends.’”It was while on set that Gage showed fellow cast members the audition video in which his apartment was slated. Their response – shocked, amused, supportive – convinced him to post it online. He wasn’t prepared for the reaction it got: countless news headlines, outpourings of support from fellow actors and strangers alike, and a crusade against the director in question, none of which Gage had any control over. “I felt like people were much more mad about it than I was, which confused me,” he says. “I didn’t want to take this person down for it. I found it more funny than anything. I don’t think it was anything worth cancelling someone for.”Does he regret posting it?“I think part of me does,” he says. “There was that feeling of, did I just blow up my life? You know, this is my first big thing that I’m known for and it’s not about my acting.”You get a good sense of the precariousness of the business – and the fleeting nature of fame – from Gage’s memoir. The highs of Euphoria andThe White Lotusare swiftly followed by moments of uncertainty and despair. “It’s such a high to be creating stuff for months in an amazing location like Hawaii … then suddenly you’re back in your apartment and figuring out what’s next,” he says. “It’s hard to trust in that moment that you’re going to be OK because we’re taught to believe in the scarcity complex – that there’s not enough jobs out there.”If Gage’s career felt bumpy, then his love life was even bumpier. In his teens, he developed an intense on/off relationship with a fellow wayward teen he calls Kaylee in the book – she was in and out of juvenile detention and often wore a monitoring bracelet on her ankle. Aged 19, however, Gage slept with a man for the first time and realised he was, in fact, queer.View image in fullscreenGage as Tyler Clarkson in Euphoria.Photograph: HBO“There was a part of me that always felt like something was different,” he says, “but I couldn’t articulate what it was. I wish I’d had that clarity earlier on because I think it would have made things a lot less confusing as a kid. I look back, like, wait, dancing as a Playboy bunny as a little kid? Writing a diary while I played Britney Spears? How the hell did nobody have this conversation with me as a kid?!”By the end of the memoir, Gage is seeing a therapist. She starts putting together pieces of his life – the trying out of different personalities, the needy relationships, his fear of abandonment – and arrives at a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder (BPD). Although Gage doesn’t particularly like labels, he accepts that it has been incredibly useful in understanding himself and some of the choices he has made in his life. “Suddenly, all of these things that I felt very confused by made sense,” he says.It was during therapy that Gage ended up speaking about his traumatic summer camp experience. At first, he made light of it, so his therapist forced him to face it. “She said: ‘You’re in your 20s now, would you do that with an 11-year-old?’ It wasn’t until she’d put it that bluntly that I actually had to sit with it.”So is this how the story ends? A facing of his demons, a diagnosis to explain his past and a bright future ahead of him, all tied up neatly with a pretty bow? That wouldn’t be a very Lukas Gage way of doing things. In early 2023, Gage met celebrity hair stylist Chris Appleton. The pair were so infatuated with each other that they were married by April that year. Kim Kardashian (one of Appleton’s clients) officiated the wedding and Shania Twain performed You’re Still the One to the newlyweds. By November, Gage had filed for divorce.“One of the tricky things [with BPD] is that, at first, they throw a bunch of medication at you,” says Gage. Rather than soothe his impulsivity, it exacerbated it. “It made me manic,” he says. These days, his meds have been fine-tuned and, he says, he does now carry an awareness that “you should a) probably get to know someone for four seasons before you settle down with them, and b) also have the clarity to listen to my loved ones when they’re saying, ‘Hey: you need to take a beat.’ I do think I can do that now, and I have done since.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m still a work in progress’Photograph: Maria Spann/The GuardianThe thing is, Gage doesn’t particularly want his book to have a neat ending. “My life is uneven and I wanted it to be honest rather than clean,” he says. “I’m still a work in progress. I’m still gonna make mistakes and mess up and not be the best partner or friend or family member. But I can acknowledge it now and invite this criticism rather than be resistant to it.”Despite knowing there will be rocky patches, he’s excited for the future. Writing interests him – not another book for a while, that took it out of him, but he’s just sold a screenplay that he’s excited to announce soon.I wonder if he has any worries, though, about releasing this memoir while he is still working his way up the fame ladder? Could all of these messy tales put potential employers off hiring him?“There was a part of me that did want to tame it down a little,” he admits. “But I wanted it to be truthful and show people who don’t have it all together, who don’t have this cookie-cutter upbringing, that they can do this too, and that some of the messiness is actually the thing that makes you different.”Besides, he says: “I don’t think I am a liability. I’m good at my job, I’m responsible, I never miss anything, I’m never late for work, I’m never a mean person.”Well, look at that, I say. We began the interview with you saying you didn’t rate your acting and ended it with you conceding that, actually, you’re pretty good at your job.“Yeah, we had an arc,” Gage says with a knowing smile. “There you go.

He even wrote a poem called The Two Voices in which dual versions of himself argued out the pros and cons of suicide. In this illuminating book, Richard Holmes has chosen to focus on the lesser known of the poet’s personae.The year 1850 was pivotal for Tennyson. He published the great poem sequence In Memoriam, over which he had laboured for nearly two decades. He became, as a result, both famous and rich. He got married, after a 14‑year courtship. He had been living in rented homes with his mother and siblings, or dossing down with bachelor friends in London, or lurking alone in a ramshackle cottage on one of his native Lincolnshire’s bleak beaches. Now he took a house where he could receive distinguished visitors. (When Prince Albert came calling, Tennyson was so far from obsequious that he forgot to invite the queen’s consort to sit down, though he did at least offer the poor man a drink.) He was appointed poet laureate. His life as a Great Man began.For Holmes, this settling down – emotional, financial, social and poetical – is the end of the exciting part of Tennyson’s life. The Boundless Deep is not about the bestselling author of the nation’s favourite poem – The Charge of the Light Brigade – or the laureate lord, pacing along the clifftops of the Isle of Wight or posing for Julia Margaret Cameron’s famous photograph (known derisorily in his family as “the dirty monk”). Instead, Holmes gives us “young Tennyson”, the wildly talented youth whose story is far more rich and strange than that of the bearded celebrity.From his teens he was imposing, even glamorous. He was very tall, unkempt but handsomeThe Tennysons, wrote Alfred, were a “black-blooded race”, meaning prone to moods and melancholy. His father, a reluctant clergyman, was angry and very often drunk. There was an incident, the details of which are obscure, that resulted in the family cook being burned to death in the rectory kitchen. One of Alfred’s brothers was confined to a lunatic asylum as a boy and stayed there for life. Another suffered from profound depression and followed his father into alcoholism. A third became addicted to opium. Alfred himself suffered from episodes of paralysing gloom and what he called “weird seizures”. His Maudis narrated by a madman: he must often have wondered whether he was or would become one himself.From his teens he was imposing, even glamorous. He was very tall, unkempt but handsome. Even before he began to wear a black Spanish cloak and sombrero, he could dominate a room. But, having grown up hugger-mugger with his siblings – three brothers to an attic room – as an adult he sought out solitude, retreating into silence when in company, vanishing for solitary walking tours.Holmes, master biographer that he is, vividly conjures up this awkward, compelling figure. What gives his book its exceptional energy, though, is not what is happening on the surface of Tennyson’s life and Holmes’s narrative. It is the powerful undertow of threatened belief and existential anxiety tugging the reader down into the “boundless deep” of the title, where 19th-century thinkers wrestled with terrible thoughts. In 2008, Holmes publishedThe Age of Wonder, a group biography charting the way that Romantic poets responded to the discoveries of their scientific contemporaries such as Humphry Davy, William Herschel and Joseph Banks. That book was full of exuberant hopes. This one, set a generation later, is its darker, sadder sequel.In Tennyson’s lifetime, geologists, astronomers and those “natural philosophers” who were beginning to think with Darwin about the origin of species, were raising appalling questions. If the history of life on Earth had begun millions of years before the appearance of the human race, then how to believe that the world had been made for humanity’s benefit and enjoyment? “It is inconceivable,” wrote Tennyson, “that the whole Universe was merely created for us, who live on a third-rate planet of a third-rate sun.” The new telescopes and microscopes revealed spaces infinitely large and beings infinitesimally small: how to hold to one’s faith, given such evidence, in a God who had made man in his own image? If dinosaurs had become extinct, then might the human race do so too?These conundrums were repressed. It was hard to confront them in public without being accused of blasphemy, or in private without seeming to give way to despair. It is easy, in retrospect, to make fun of those 19th-century creationists who strove to believe that God had hidden the fossils in the rocks for some good, if inscrutable, reason. Holmes doesn’t indulge in such patronising levity. He takes seriously the pain of those living through the crisis of faith, and writes about it with such sympathy that even his most secular-minded modern readers feel the shock of finding oneself alone and unloved in a God-forsaken universe.Holmes binds his narrative together with two recurrent motifs. The first he introduces on his second page – it is the image of the Kraken, the legendary sea monster. Tennyson was a 20-year-old undergraduate when he wrote his poem about it. In Holmes’s view, with its mix of “Norse mythology, 18th-century zoology, 19th-century science fiction and the Book of Revelations”, the 15-line sonnet introduces themes to which Tennyson would keep returning. Its sense of something immense, unspeakable and tragic, submerged beyond reach of human inquiry, prefigures the mood of In Memoriam. It marks Tennyson’s debut as a master of metre and as the creator of images in which awful mystery is compressed into a few dazzlingly suggestive words.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Where the imaginary sea monster epitomises all that is lugubrious about Tennyson, his relationship with a real-life person, Edward FitzGerald, of whom he would write “I had no truer friend”, summons up all that is affectionate and playful in the poet. With him, Holmes introduces us to a side of Tennyson seldom before encountered. A Tennyson who, after intoning some of his grandest lines with “grotesque grimness”, would suddenly roar with laughter at his own solemnity. A Tennyson who, after visiting “dear old Fitz” at home, wrote a thank-you letter in verse describing him in his rose garden with his tame doves sitting all over him, planting their “rosy feet … on shoulder, hand and knee”, and even on his head. It’s an image of pleasure nicely adapted to FitzGerald’s great celebration of hedonism – his version of The Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám. It also summons up the brilliant nonsense of the two poets’ mutual friend Edward Lear. It’s pleasing to be told that Tennyson, the mournful Great Man, was also the inspiration for Lear’s rhyme about the old man with a beard in which “two owls and a hen, four larks and a wren” built their nests.Holmes is not an uncritical fan – he is tart about the pseudo-medieval flim-flam of Idylls of the King – but when he loves a poem, he writes about it with a wonderful capacity for noticing every pulse of metre, every flicker of nuance. This biography is a compelling story of an odd, brilliant, charismatic character, and a reappraisal of a man who had become so very established we could no longer see him. In giving us young Tennyson – gauche, beautiful, veiled in stinking tobacco smoke – Holmes has given the great poet back to us.The Boundless Deep: Young Tennyson, Science and the Crisis of Belief by Richard Holmes is published by HarperCollins (£25).

In August, most other nominees dropped out in protest at Boyne’s gender-critical views – and this year’sprize has now been cancelled.Discussion of trans rights is absent from The Elements, although Boyne touches on plenty of big issues. Homophobia, the impact of traditional and social media, parental neglect and sexual violence are all explored. In Water, a grieving woman named Willow moves to a remote Irish island after her husband is jailed for horrific crimes. In Earth, Evan is a footballer on trial as an accessory to rape. In Fire, the adult Freya juggles revenge with her work as a surgeon. And in Air, a father flies to a funeral with his teenage son, and wonders how much to divulge about his family’s past.Trauma is piled on trauma as wounded survivors seem doomed to bump into each other again and again for eternityConnections abound. We first meet Evan as a boy trying to escape the island of Water. His trial’s jury contains the Freya who reappears in Fire. Aaron, the father from Air, works with Freya and has a child with Willow’s daughter. Supporting characters from one account reappear in cottages, pubs or courtrooms in another.These plot threads may sound tangled, but Boyne knows how to power a narrative – his 2006 Holocaust drama The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas has sold more than 11m copies, and he has been translated into 60 languages. His businesslike prose bristles with thriller-ish hooks: “after all, a doctor in the burns unit should know better than to play with fire”; “the first thing I do when I arrive on the island is change my name”.Characters are sketched in brief, effective lines: the compassionate Nigerian priest, the troubled pub landlord, the daughter at war with her mother. Some scenes ring with sad power or observational humour: a boy is punched by his father after wetting himself at a football match; a narrow-minded island mother and her Dublin-raised neighbour swap barbs over cups of weak tea.Boyne’s knack of carrying you wholeheartedly into each narrative gives the return of a character or plot strand from an earlier story a genuine frisson, for the first few times at least. Yet the cumulative effect of it all is numbing, and at times almost comic: trauma is piled on trauma, coincidence on coincidence in a grim farce in which wounded survivors seem doomed to bump into each other again and again for eternity.If this sounds less like life and more like limbo, that is part of Boyne’s point. These damaged people are weighed down by the crimes they have suffered, caught in patterns of thought and behaviour that churn and spiral and may in turn damage others. Boyne has spoken about the impact of hisown experiences of abuseand he describes with sympathy the way his cast negotiate this perilous landscape, reaching out for remedies – isolation, icy sea dips, reconciliation or bracing honesty – that might let light in.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But while The Elements is a flawed work, it’s also a thoroughly readable, victim-focused epic: a welcome riposte to the usual fixation on investigators and perpetrators. Boyne shows how trauma can run through lives and generations, and how time and tenderness can quieten its echoes.The Elements by John Boyne is published by Doubleday (£20).

Fleeing to Los Angeles after botching a job in London, Tommy (Josh Duhamel) is desperate to get back to his family – so mafioso Benson (Rick Hoffman) makes him an offer. If Tommy can get Benson’s son Julian (Jeremy Ray Taylor) to man up, he will smooth the waters with Freddy Darby (Aidan Gillen), his opposite number over the pond whose relative Tommy accidentally offed.Tommy has his work cut out: the kid’s a LARPer. Tearing Julian away from mates with foam swords and his current position as level three druid, the assassin gives him a work experience berth on his next murder. Benson assigns them to dispatch legendary hitman Alistair (Neil Sandilands), whose recent religious epiphany means he may be about to spill the beans on past crimes.You have to give director Allan Ungar points for effort; London Calling is slathered in gags, sometimes carefully nurtured – like the one about Tommy refusing to accept his worsening eyesight. But this persistence also means, with far too much of the humour missing its mark, that the film staggers on like an unfunny standup comedian. It aims for amoral Tarantinoesque snark, but too often delivers scattershot puerility or lazy, self-satisfied writing. Ungar imitates the neon-lacquered John Wick style well, but lacks finesse in picking out comedy beats within the action.Duhamel and Taylor, who have nice repartee, work the material as best as they can. At one point, posing as Russian mobsters, Julian advises Tommy to name Tolstoy as his favourite author; his boss mangles it as “Toy Story”. Taylor, who starred inthe 2017 It adaptation, seems like a prospect; his relaxed affability wrings maximum irony out of this heinous apprenticeship. Much more so than Hoffman, who overplays as his dad, and the less said about Gillen WhatsApping it in as the family-fixated cockney kingpin the better. This underworld knockabout has its moments, but sharper writing could have lifted it way higher.London Calling is available on digital platforms on 7 October and on DVD on 13 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmCrime filmsComedy filmsAidan GillenComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

If you’ve seenStrictly Ballroom,Baz Luhrmann’s 1992 directorial debut, the words on it – Scott’s knee-slide – will be immediately and ecstatically familiar. If not, allow me to introduce you to what is, for my money, one of the most purely enjoyable films ever made.Scott Hastings, the son of two retired ballroom dancers who now run a teaching studio, is a future champion. Or he would be, if he didn’t keep deviating from the stiff steps laid down by the Australian Dance Federation’s Barry Fife (a Trumpian ogre in a toupee) and throwing in his own moves. When his dancing partner dumps him after he goes rogue during a competition, Fran, the studio’s wallflower, offers to take on the might of the Federation with him. Cue lingering looks, secret rooftop rehearsals and a montage set to Time After Time, with plenty of neon eyeshadow thrown in – picture an early episode of Neighbours on speed, set in the Winter Gardens Blackpool, and you’re halfway there.‘An unhealthy fascination’: why Fast X is my feelgood movieRead moreStrictly Ballroom scooped international accolades and became famous for getting standing ovations in cinemas, but its beginnings were modest: it was originally a piece of student theatre and Luhrmann had to scrape together funding to film it. Like the original Star Wars, a large part of its charm for me stems from the fact that nobody involved knew how big it would be.Romeo + JulietandMoulin Rouge, the next twofilms in Luhrmann’s “red curtain trilogy,” were both so huge from the outset that they couldn’t help taking themselves seriously; the gleeful, unselfconscious camp of their predecessor was lost. There are almost no household names in Strictly Ballroom’s cast: Paul Mercurio, who plays Scott with smouldering physicality, was a principal with the Sydney Dance Company who had never acted before (he later turned down Guy Pearce’s role in Priscilla, Queen of the Desert).Then there is the Bafta-winning soundtrack, an irresistibly overblown dopamine hit that blends tango and samba rhythms with wildly dramatic orchestration and sound effects. Like Hans Zimmer’s compositions for Gladiator or Vangelis’s for Chariots of Fire, David Hirschfelder’s score reaches into whichever bit of your brain recognises a hero’s journey and lights it up. Any errand, however mundane, is elevated to the level of a mythic quest by having it in your ears.As a film it isn’t perfect: an initial mockumentary framing and some early magical realism both fizzle out, and parts of the plot have not aged well. Fran’s ugly-duckling-to-swan arc feels clunkily dated now, as does the deployment of her Spanish-Australian family for some Latin heat. Both elements would be handled differently today, one hopes.But nobody in their right mind would change a second of the film’s final 15 minutes, which take place at the Pan-Pacific Grand Prix ballroom-dancing championships. If I tell you what happens it won’t really be a spoiler because the ending is visible from space. Scott is persuaded to abandon Fran and his dream of dancing his own steps, only to leap off the stage at the 11th hour and disappear. Barry Fife, who has been using increasingly underhand means to stop Scott from rocking the boat, is jubilant.‘Never fails to delight’: why Metallica: Some Kind of Monster is my feelgood movieRead more“You hear that?” he crows, listening to the crowd cheering. “That’s the future of dance sport, and no one, but no one’s going to change that … ”Cut to my Post-it: Scott slides, in extravagant slow motion, into the frame on his knees, a move that at least one fan I know has shredded their trousers trying to copy. Fran appears too, transformed in glittering red, and the two embark on a scorching paso doble. An apoplectic Barry Fife cuts the music and disqualifies them. And then …I won’t ruin the entire thing for you, but suffice to say that what follows is guaranteed to give you goosebumps (I’m getting them now just writing about it). As a finale it’s a triumph, the kind of supremely satisfying knockout punch every creative dreams of landing. Yes, the message – that the most important thing is to follow your heart – is as subtle as a sequined brick. But the darker the world gets, the more of a necessary tonic it seems. I watch Strictly Ballroom several times a year, and clips of it on YouTube more often than I care to admit. With a new series of the television show named in homage to it now under way, there’s never been a better time to take to the metaphorical floor.Strictly Ballroom is available to rent digitally in the US, UK and AustraliaExplore more on these topicsBaz LuhrmannMy feelgood movieComedy filmsComedyRomance filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Until that day comes, here’s Carmen Emmi’s drama about a cop in early 90s New York who is part of an entrapment team at a suburban shopping mall prosecuting gay men who cruise the bathrooms (a type of police work that you might think went out in the era of Alan Turing).Tom Blyth plays Lucas, an undercover officer suffering from depression after the death of his dad and breakup with his girlfriend to whom he confessed having feelings for men; his nervous unease is not made any easier by a loudmouthed homophobic uncle at family gatherings. The movie is interspersed with Lucas’s anxiety-flash glimpses of his own life, significantly shot in the same dull, flat analogue video that the cops use to record incriminating evidence of their suspects in the toilets from a concealed camera. Video is endowed with the texture of shame and this is how Lucas subconsciously sees the dangerous truth about himself. In the course of his work, he falls for a gentle, intelligent older guy called Andrew, played by Russell Tovey, that he is supposed to be arresting. But just as poor Lucas realises that he is in love, he realises also that for Andrew he is just another ephemeral encounter.Plainclothes is heartfelt in many ways, but burdened with a colossally melodramatic ending connected with a very elaborate plot twist around a misunderstanding, like something from a 19th-century novel, concerning a lost or indeed purloined letter, the existence of which is not entirely plausible, considering that its author is supposedly anxious not to maintain contact with Lucas. An interesting, but flawed work.Plainclothes is in UK cinemas from 10 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsUS policingLGBTQ+ rightsreviewsShareReuse this content"

If something is troubling her then it invariably finds its way out in the open and into her work. Her early theatre shows, includingSex Idiotand7 Day Drunk, took audiences on a freewheeling tour through the perils of early adulthood. Love, desire and STIs. Anxiety, alcohol and the drive to create good work. They were whirlwind one-woman shows, brimming with creativity, rammed with zany props and mad detours, and – despite all the doubts and fears contained within them – glowing with a childlike sort of optimism.Later shows would see Kimmings pull other people and their concerns on to the stage. InCredible Likeable Superstar Role Model, Kimmings and her nine-year-old niece created and performed a powerful critique of the hyper-sexualisation of tween culture. She and her then partner Tim Grayburn explored the devastating impact of depression inFake It ’Til You Make It. As her profile grew, there followed an ambitious musical about cancer at the National Theatre (A Pacifist’s Guide to the War on Cancer) andI’m a Phoenix, Bitch, a ragingly powerful solo show about postnatal depression and the breakdown of Kimmings’s relationship and mental health.Now the 44-year-old artist is deeply worried about the climate crisis – and she’s not just creating a show about it. She’s upending her life. Three years ago, after getting together with projection artist and self-taught ecologist Will Duke, Kimmings left Brighton with her young son Frank and moved to rural East Sussex. The family is surrounded by farmland. They have huge polytunnels and water butts, 25 fruit and nut trees and their own chicks and ducks. Within the next two years, they fully intend to get a farming co-op off the ground (it normally takes around 10 years, but Kimmings isn’t one to hang around).View image in fullscreenRaging … Bryony Kimmings in I’m a Phoenix, Bitch in 2018.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianAs we talk over video call, Kimmings is just as personable on screen as she is on stage and quick to develop an intimate rapport with her audience of one. Her sentences splinter as her mind races off in different directions. There’s always another book to reference, an anecdote or silly impression to squeeze in; a different part of herself to reveal, laugh at and offer up for inspection.When we moved here, we were quite worthy. If you don’t have a solar panel then who are you? I’m glad we didn’t make the show thenBog Witch is Kimmings’s first devised theatre show in five years. Part of that is down to logistics. The show was a commission from Soho theatre – a long-time champion of Kimmings – which wanted her to headline the opening of theirnew 960-seat theatre in Walthamstow, east London. Only the building work kept getting delayed. Before all those delays, the show was going to be called Soil and Water. Kimmings laughs ruefully about this rather earnest starting point: “Luckily, we had more time to think about it. When we first moved out here, we were quite worthy. If you don’t have a solar panel then who are you? I’m glad we didn’t make the show then.”Some way into the devising process, Kimmings and her long-term collaborators decided to change the title and position it firmly as a mainstream comedy: “It had to be a standup show because I feel like that’s where it’s the most populist. That’s where we’ll get the most bums on seats.” And the butt of the joke? Kimmings. Always Kimmings. “In all my shows, I will always try to be the stupidest person in the room. Because that’s the clown way of doing things. Nobody in here is going to make a mistake as big as my mistake. I’m the clown. Laugh at me. Because then everyone feels less bad about themselves.”View image in fullscreen‘I always try to be the stupidest person in the room’ …Kimmings with her niece Taylor in Credible Likeable Superstar Role Model.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianGradually, Bog Witch evolved into a comedy aboutBryony Kimmings, the most reluctant and unlikely ecowarrior you’ve ever encountered: “It’s the story of being a terrible climate activist. Of not wanting to move to the countryside. Of wanting to try to find something to fill the void. The hole in my soul that wouldn’t go away. It’s about asking the audience: do you feel like there’s something wrong too?”It’s all part of Kimmings’s resolve, which started in earnest during the pandemic, to only make work about the climate crisis. On top of her work in theatre, Kimmings is also developing an eco horror movie called Little Red Hen. “It’s set in an eco homestead that is the only place in a rural community that is equipped to survive eco collapse. So all the other villagers, who have never helped this place before, descend on it during the emergency. It’s a slasher movie, too. When the end comes, who do you want to bring into the new dawn?”She’s hoping the film will be “camp” and “gory” and, most importantly, a bit of a laugh: “I’m desperate to make climate stories that are really funny. Engaging. Solution-based programmes and pieces of theatre.” She’s also got a primetime BBC drama in the works,The Rapture, which started filming this summer. Based on Liz Jensen’s bestselling novel and starring Ruth Madeley, the show follows a juvenile inmate in a mental health institution and her newly disabled psychotherapist, who have to figure out a climate conspiracy together.View image in fullscreenFreewheeling … Kimmings in 7 Day Drunk in 2011.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianAll of Kimmings’s latest work aims to cultivate hope rather than despair: “It’s a tough sell. Nobody wants to know about climate change for lots of reasons and some of that is because it’s just not fun. It’s bleak. And what I’ve realised from hanging around with all these farmers and permaculturalists is that there’s so much good stuff happening. There’s so much good going on out there. All of this is not a sealed deal.”In the past, Kimmings’s shows were often created with the intention of spurring the audience into action. With Bog Witch, she says: “I want to create a fucking great night out and equip the audience with some tools and coping mechanisms. But we’re not being too bold with this one. All we will say is that seeing Bog Witch might make you want to engage with the climate crisis. Dipping your toe in isn’t going to kill you.”Optimism runs through our conversation, although she struggles to feel hopeful about the theatre industry as a whole. “I love the world of performance art. I love the creativity and experimentalism. But there’s not much going on right now and that’s not because there aren’t brilliant artists. It’s because the courses have closed and the festivals have closed. An entire movement of art is scrabbling around trying to find opportunity and I find that very sad.”Kimmings believes it’s harder than ever to make a living in theatre. “It doesn’t pay enough. There isn’t enough work, especially for people like me. The funding is going down. It isn’t sustainable for family life. It doesn’t have social hours. Looking at this year on the spreadsheet of earnings, and then looking at TV, it’s a no-brainer that I work in TV.”Yet something keeps pulling Kimmings back to the stage. “Theatre is my love.” She’s not sure she likes straight plays – too fake, too staged – but on those rare and special times when theatre really works? “When that happens and you’re in a room with other bodies, there’s nothing like it. It’s like church. The awe. The connection.” For Kimmings, that’s what drives her stage work. “It’s always about that exchange. It’s never aboutmyfeelings. I’m a mirror foryourfeelings. As far as I’m concerned, you go to the theatre to see yourself.”Bog Witch is atSoho Theatre Walthamstow, London, 9-25 OctoberExplore more on these topicsBryony KimmingsTheatreSoho theatreComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Climate crisisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’ve got you.”Katriona O’Sullivan’s dedication of her bestselling memoir to her younger self is the emotional core ofSonya Kelly’s new stage adaptation. The remarkable story of the author and psychology professor who grew up in poverty in Coventry and Birmingham, her childhood blighted by drug addiction and sexual abuse, is split between the child (Holly Lawlor) and adult (Aisling O’Mara) Katriona, as joint narrators.With Katriona’s parents (Aidan Kelly and Hilda Fay) breaking into song on a car journey, the early scenes in Róisín McBrinn’s production shift uneasily in tone, as if the older Katrina, looking back, is determined to be upbeat and to keep the utter misery of her parents’ circumstances at a distance. The structure – an episodic, linear narrative – creates some distance too, with frequent references to the autobiography’s page numbers adding to the sense that the book is the blueprint for the play, rather than a starting point for Kelly’s dramatisation.View image in fullscreen‘I’ve got you’ … Hollie Lawlor and O’Mara om stage together.Photograph: Ste MurrayMoving on to the years of Katriona’s struggles as a teenage mother – initially homeless, then living on welfare – the staging sparks into life with the ensemble (Ghaliah Conroy, Mary Murray, Keiren Hamilton-Amos and Thommas Kane Byrne) conjuring multiple characters, aided by Aedín Cosgrove’s endlessly malleable set design.

The scenes of her therapy and recovery are affectingly raw.Raised by addicts, abused, neglected, broke: how Katriona O’Sullivan escaped her fateRead moreO’Mara captures Katriona’s ferocious will to survive; her determination to sober up and return to formal education. Lawlor pops up winningly in the guise of the Trinity College access programme director who practically drags Katriona to her exams – one of three key adults in Katriona’s life who believe in her and give her hope. This doubling of the actors playing the younger and older Katriona binds the story: swapping places, the spirited seven-year-old girl is now taking care of the astonishingly courageous young woman, scarred but not broken.AtGate theatre, Dublin, until 2 November, as part ofDublin theatre festival.

Her fellow countryman Sam Campbell has boyish charm, after all – and in some of those frocks, even Dame Edna cut quite the dash. But if you’re thinking in these terms – if you’re taking the claim at face value – you’ve already got the title toEftos’s hit standup showall wrong. You wouldn’t be the first. “I had fellow comedians telling me, ‘You shouldn’t call yourself that,’” says Eftos. “I found that so fascinating and sad, that I was told I was stepping out of line just for using this silly title.” She pauses. “Comedians are some of the most serious people I’ve met in my life. I do find it funny that they can’t take a joke.”Eftos speaks from the vantage point of the outsider – as a still-recent arrival in comedy, and because of her Greek-Macedonian heritage, palpably a significant thing for her when we talk over a video-call while she holidays after the Edinburgh fringe. From that perspective, she rips into comedy and its macho myths in her show (“Everyone tells you how hard it’s going to be [to do comedy] … It’s not that hard at all”), and publicly airs her beef with several prominent comics, too. Titled Australia’s First Attractive Comedian, the set secured for the 33-year-old a best newcomer nomination in Edinburgh, making gleeful play in the uncomfortable space between comedy, feminism and sex appeal.The fact that I don’t do self-deprecating comedy rubbed people up the wrong wayIt was, I say to Eftos, one of those shows you can’t believe hasn’t been made before – so fertile is its territory for comedy, so uncomfortable (clearly, still, for some) the inquiry: “Can you be both funny and sexy?” You might have thought that question had long since been resolved: there are no shortage of good-looking comics, after all. “But in Australia,” says Eftos, “everybody’s doing self-deprecating humour and dressing down. Nobody’s talking about how good-looking they are on stage. The fact that I don’t do self-deprecating comedy rubbed people up the wrong way.”Prior to life as a comedian, Eftos was an actor, and an MC in a cabaret with “a Pussycat Dolls vibe. The whole shtick was high status, ‘You can’t touch us up here.’ It was sexy and funny and strong.” So when she moved to Sydney and took up live comedy (“How else am I going to get on stage? How else am I going to get my name out there?”), performing as a glam siren supremely confident in her own sexiness felt like an obvious way to go.View image in fullscreenJokes – or brassy statements of facts? … Eftos.Photograph: Matt FordIt took chutzpah. “I am obviously confident on stage,” says Eftos, “but I also have self-doubt.” You’d never guess when watching the show, which begins with a homage to Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct and just gets sexier. Or sillier: one of its most fantastic qualities is that you’re never certain what’s a joke and what’s a brassy statement of fact. Do “couples in the crowd”, as Eftos would have it, “look at me as the other woman who’s about to steal their husband when I walk out on stage”? And does she really consider herself so superior to we “normies” in her audience? – whose supposed erotic excitement at the very sight of her is animated in a hilarious running joke.The character is, says Eftos, “a heightened version of me. Except, I’m a very anxious person in real life.” The flak her act has drawn – from veteran female entertainers including (greatly to Eftos’s alarm) Nia Vardalos ofMy Big Fat Greek Weddingfame – can only have added to that anxiety. But Eftos confronts that criticism head-on in the show, taking the attack right back to the sceptics. “I don’t mean to have a go at them,” she says, “but I try and encourage us all to think differently. I can only imagine what they went through, getting into comedy as women in the 80s and 90s. But my experience isn’t that different. And it doesn’t mean I’m a bad person or a bad comedian just because I wear a dress on stage and you can see my nipples.”She goes on: “As a woman, and as a woman in comedy, you’re always being told, ‘Don’t be too attractive.’ And even though the title doesn’t refer specifically to female comedians, female comic friends of mine would say, ‘Well, that’s how people will interpret it, so you shouldn’t say it.’” Is it an act of feminist betrayal to foreground, or send up, your own attractiveness? “What roles do you have to play to please society?” asks Eftos. “To please men? Versus this whole idea that if you’re a real feminist, you mustn’t do anything to please men.” Alongside the big laughs, her show engages thoughtfully with those questions, receiving acclaim for doing so.Elouise Eftos: Australia’s First Attractive Comedian review – fabulously provocative jokesRead more“I had a dream run,” says Eftos now of her fringe show, the goal of which was to secure UK management and profile, prior to a London move. “They get my sense of humour more over here,” says an act who cut her comedy teeth watching “Benny Hill, French and Saunders, Monty Python – all the old-school British comedy”. Now a follow-up standup show is brewing: “My next hour will focus on the fact that I’ve never been in love and I don’t think it’s real,” she says, tantalisingly.The comedy world, at least, now seems to be falling for Australia’s First Attractive Comedian – and she couldn’t be happier. “I’m so grateful I get to do this as a job. I’d love to be performing live for the rest of my life.”Elouise Eftos: Australia’s First Attractive Comedian is atSoho theatre, London, 7-11 OctoberExplore more on these topicsComedyEdinburgh festival 2025featuresShareReuse this content"

Now, having finally quit heroin, he’s back with a new album, a memoir – and no regretsMon 6 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTShareEvan Dando rolls up a sleeve and points to a line of small dents running down his forearm, faint scars from decades of heroin abuse. “It takes so long to get decent track marks,” he says. “You do it for years and you think: I can’t stop yet. Maybe my skin is particularly tough, but you can barely see it now. What was it all for, eh?” He grins and lets out a raspy laugh. “Just kidding!”Dando, one-time indie pin-up and leading light of 90s alt-rock band the Lemonheads, looks in reasonable nick for a man who has taken every drug going from the age of 14. The songwriter behind such exalted tracks as It’s a Shame About Ray and My Drug Buddy, Dando is also known as rock’s most notorious burn-out, a star who seemingly had it all and threw it away. He is warm, goofily charismatic and completely unfiltered. We meet at lunchtime at his publishers’ offices in Clerkenwell, central London, where he wonders if we should move our chat to the pub. In the end, he sends out for two pints of cider, which he then forgets to drink. Often losing his train of thought, he is apt to go off on wild tangents. No wonder he has given up owning a smartphone: “I can’t deal with the internet, man. My mind is too all over the place. I just want to read everything at once.”He and his wife Antonia Teixeira, whom he married last year, have flown in from São Paulo, Brazil, where they live and where Dando now has three adult stepchildren. “I’m trying to be the backbone of this new family. I didn’t embrace [family] much in my life, but I’m ready to try. I’m doing pretty good so far.” Now 58, he says he is clean, though this turns out to be a loose concept: “I’ll take acid occasionally, maybe mushrooms and I’ll smoke pot.”View image in fullscreenJust like Evan … Dando performing at the Newport Folk festival in July 2025.Photograph: Douglas Mason/Getty ImagesClean to him means not doing heroin, which he hasn’t touched in nearly three years. He decided it was time to give up after a catastrophic gig at Hollywood Forever Cemetery in 2021 where he could barely play a note. “I thought: ‘This is not good. The legacy will not bear this type of behaviour.’”He credits Teixeira for helping him to stop, though he has no regrets about using. “I think some people were supposed to take drugs and one of them was me.”One advantage of his (relative) sobriety is that it has made him productive. “When you’re on smack, you’re all: ‘Oh fuck that, and that, and that,” he says. But now he is about to release Love Chant, his first album of original Lemonheads music in almost 20 years, which containsflashes of the lyricism and melodic smarts that propelled them to the indie big league. “I’ve never really heard of this sort of dormancy period [between albums],” he says. “This is some Rip Van Winkle shit. I do have integrity about what I put out. I wasn’t ready to do anything new until I was ready, and [now] I am.”Dando is also publishing his first memoir, named Rumours of My Demise; the title is a nod to the stories that fitfully circulated in the 90s about his premature death. It’s a wry, heady, fitfully eye-watering account of his adventures as a musician and addict. “I wrote the first four chapters. That’s me,” he says. For the rest, he collaborated with ghostwriter Jim Ruland, whom you imagine had his work cut out given Dando’s haphazard conversational style. The writing process, he says, was “difficult, but I was psyched to get a good [publisher]. And it gets me out there as someone who has written a book, and that’s all I wanted to do since I was a kid. At school I was obsessed with James Joyce, Dylan Thomas and Flaubert.”View image in fullscreenPower couple … Dando with Kate Moss in 1998.Photograph: Kevin.Mazur/WireImageDando – the youngest child of an attorney and a former fashion model – talks fondly about school, perhaps because it represents a time before life got complicated by drugs and fame. He went to Boston’s prestigious Commonwealth school, a liberal institution that, he says now, “was the best. There were no rules except no rollerskating in the hallways. In other words, don’t be an asshole.”It was there, in bible class, that he met Ben Deily and Jesse Peretz and formed a band in 1986.The Lemonheadsbegan life as a punk outfit, in thrall to the Minutemen, Dead Kennedys and Ramones; they signed to the Boston label Taang!, with whom they put out three albums. After Deily and Peretz left, the Lemonheads effectively became a one-man show, Dando hiring and firing musicians at his discretion.In the early 1990s, the band signed to a major label, Atlantic, and dialled down the squall in favour of a more languid and accessible country-rock sound. This was “because [Nirvana’s] Nevermind came out in ’91 and they had nailed it”, Dando says. “If you listen to our early records – a song like Mad, which was recorded the day after we graduated high school – you can hear we were trying to do [what Nirvana did] but my voice didn’t cut right. But I knew my voice could cut through quieter music.” This new sound, waggishly described by critics as “bubblegrunge”, would take the band into the mainstream. In 1992 they released the LP It’s a Shame About Ray, an impeccable showcase for Dando’s songcraft and his melancholic croon. The title was taken from a newspaper headline in which a priest bemoaned a young man named Ray who had gone off the rails.Ray wasn’t the only one. By this point, Dando was using heroin and had developed a penchant for crack, too. With money in his pocket, he enthusiastically threw himself into the rock star life, becoming friends with Johnny Depp, shooting a video with Angelina Jolie and dating Kate Moss and Milla Jovovich. People magazine anointed him one of the 50 sexiest people alive. Dando good-naturedly rebuffs the idea that My Drug Buddy, in which he sang “I’m too much with myself, I wanna be someone else”, was a plea for help. He was having too much fun.View image in fullscreenGetting shirty … Evan Dando.Photograph: Kate Peters/The GuardianNonetheless, the drug use got out of control. In the book, he delivers a blow-by-blow account of the fateful Glastonbury incident in 1995 when he failed to turn up for the Lemonheads’ allotted slot after two women suggested he come back to their hotel. When he finally did appear, he performed an impromptu acoustic set to a hostile crowd who booed and threw bottles. But this was small beer next to what happened in Australia shortly afterwards. The trip was intended as a break from drugs and touring but, arriving in Sydney, Dando immediately binged on speed, ecstasy and Valium. A breakdown followed, which saw him feeding dollar bills into grates in the gutter convinced it would help him “teleport” back home. He went to the airport planning to get the first plane back to the US but skipped out on his cab fare, leading to his arrest.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

By the time he got to the airport, “I probably looked like a fucking crazy person. And I didn’t pay for my cab, so I ended up wrestling with five cops. But you know what? They were OK because their girlfriends were all fans.”View image in fullscreenExcess baggage … The It’s a Shame About Ray Lemonheads lineup.Photograph: Ebet Roberts/RedfernsRumours of My Demise may find Dando in the literal gutter but there’s no trace of self-pity. Despite the many lows, he says he always had fortune on his side. “I’ve never overdosed, not on anything. Who can say that?” he says, proudly. Most people, I reply, as gently as I can. He has a better example: the time Martin Scorsese picked the Lemonheads’ cover of Simon & Garfunkel’s Mrs Robinson for the soundtrack to 2013’s The Wolf of Wall Street. Dando never liked it, but Atlantic had pressured them into recording it in 1992 and it was a hit. When Scorsese alighted on it, Dando was broke. “Like, how did that happen? I think we got 80 grand. That saved the day. I’m just incredibly lucky sometimes, even when I fuck up.”When I ask about the physical toll after years of drug use, he replies: “The toll is on my teeth,” and flashes newly capped pearly whites plus a trio of gold crowns. “My lungs aren’t great – I have a bit of emphysema. But otherwise, I’m healthy. My heart isn’t enlarged, and I don’t know how I don’t have Aids or hepatitis C.” He illustrates how surprising this is through a particularly grisly story. “I once did this thing, getting all the blood out of all the syringes [used by] me and my girlfriend, and pooling them to see if I could get a hit out of it. Like, eww, that’s disgusting. But nothing happened.I have a very good constitution.”Dando maintains that, bar the Australia meltdown, everything that he has done he has done on purpose, though I’m not sure I believe him. He is, he says, “an entertainer. In my way, I feel like I was always in service to entertain people.” He pauses and grins. “And I’ve enjoyed it. I’ve enjoyed my life incredibly.”Rumours ofMy Demise is published byFaber on 23 October. Love Chant is released onFire Records on 24 October.Explore more on these topicsEvan DandoThe LemonheadsPop and rockinterviewsShareReuse this content"

So you’d assume the release of this year’s winner would be widely and loudly trumpeted. Not so. Consume Me’sapparently underwhelming early salesand surprisinglack of reviewsspeak more to ongoing issues of discoverability (and busy critics struggling with an autumn glut) than the game itself, which is an absolute delight.Admittedly, it’s easy to make it sound like something youshouldplay rather than something you’d reallywantto. Developed over a decade by Jenny Jiao Hsia (with collaborators AP Thomson, Jie En Lee, Violet W-P, and Ken Snyder), it’s a quasi-autobiographical story about an Asian American high-schooler attempting to lose weight while navigating the stresses and pitfalls of teenage life. It involves efficient management of energy and time. A content notice warns about themes of bullying, fatphobia and disordered eating. It’s also – somehow – one of 2025’s funniest games.View image in fullscreenA pizza date leads to watching her eating for the rest of the week … Consume Me.Photograph: HexecutableConsume Me deftly negotiates this tonal minefield, playfully but incisively satirising the gamification of diet culture. Protagonist Jenny’s mealtimes are abstracted into puzzle form. In a process that reminded me of arranging Leon’s attaché case in Resident Evil 4, you slot foodstuffs shaped like Tetris blocks into a grid representing Jenny’s stomach. L-shaped kale and S-shaped tomatoes will keep you under your daily target (crucially, she’s not counting calories but “bites”) while eggs handily plug those awkward single spaces. Junk foods come in appealingly convenient shapes – but filling up with a cookie means spending your precious free time trying to burn it off, or using up one of your limited cheat days. Leave any gaps and her stomach will rumble, meaning she’s likely to need a snack later.You’ll also need to keep Jenny’s energy and mood above zero or it’s game over. That’s straightforward at first: the tasks that make up your schedule, from chores to studying to applying makeup, comprise simple but fun minigames with the antic energy of Nintendo’s WarioWare series but little of the challenge. Items earned or bought with pocket money make it easier still to keep Jenny happy and healthy. But time is the enemy, and balancing needs and wants becomes steadily trickier. Rely on energy drinks too often, for instance, and a caffeine headache awaits, meaning any activity but bed rest will make you grumpy.View image in fullscreenA sinkside squabble with an overbearing mother … Consume Me.Photograph: HexecutableWhether things are going well or not, it’s beautifully observed. Ominous music accompanies the weekly weigh-in, as you physically drag Jenny’s feet on to the scales. Cleaning the bathroom is followed by a forensic inspection from your overbearing mother, who leans in close to scrutinise your handiwork, pressing her index finger against the sink to ensure it comes away spotless. When Jenny first meets boyfriend Oliver’s well-to-do parents, the simple introduction of an anxiety meter is enough to have your own heart beating a little faster, even before her imagination casts his prying mother as a trenchcoated detective, a spotlight adding to the interrogative vibe. And in the couple’s first attempt at making out, their clumsy limbs crisscross the screen, forcing you to manoeuvre round them to lock lips.Love soon becomes another obligation, and thus a source of tension, shrewdly re-contextualised in each chapter. Jenny can’t miss too many of the potential dates she pencils in her diary, but a trip to a pizza restaurant forces her to be strict with her eating for the rest of the week. When Oliver goes to college, Jenny must invest valuable evening time texting or video-calling him, convinced their long-distance relationship will take “poison damage” every day if she doesn’t. (By night, she presses her face against a glass case, tearfully watching petals fall from the rose inside it, brilliantly evoking the wayeverythingbecomes a melodrama at that age.)This might be a game about routines, but despite some purposeful repetition, Consume Me never fully settles into one of its own; it keeps finding inventive uses (and reuses) of systems to punch home its themes without losing its sense of humour. If you have an uneasy relationship with food and personal fitness, there are moments that will hit close to home – and even if you eat and exercise well, you can surely relate to being too busy with life’s essentials to find room for the things you’d rather be doing.Again, though, I’m wary of making it sound too much like eating your vegetables. This spiky, funny, and bracingly original game consumed a few laughter- and tear-filled evenings, and left memories that will stay with me a good deal longer.Consume Me is available now, £12.79Explore more on these topicsGamesPCreviewsShareReuse this content"

But look closer and these beguiling works evoke societal as much as material collapseMon 6 Oct 2025 08.43 EDTLast modified on Mon 6 Oct 2025 10.26 EDTShareIf you’re considering bathroom renovations, I would perhaps advise against hiring Lisa Herfeldt to do the work.Yes, it’s true, she’s something of a whiz with a silicone gun – creating compelling sculptures from this unlikely art material. But the more you look at her creations the more you realise that something is a littleoff. The thick lengths of sealant she produces stretch beyond the shelves on which they sit, sagging off the edges towards the floor. The knotty foam pipes bulge until they split. Some creations escape their acrylic glass box homes entirely, becoming a magnet for dust and hair. Let’s just say the Checkatrade reviews would not be pretty.“I sometimes have the feeling that things are alive in a room,” says the German artist when we meet in Margate, where she is about to open her first UK solo show atRoland Rossgallery. “That’s why I came to use this foam material because it has this very bodily texture and feeling.”Indeed there’s something rather body horror about Herfeldt’s work, from the phallic bulge that protrudes, hernia-like, from its cylindrical stand in the centre of the gallery, to the intestinal coils of foam that rupture like medical emergencies. On one wall Herfeldt has framed photocopies of the works viewed from different angles: they look like wormy parasites picked up on a microscope, or growths on a petri-dish. “It interests me that there are things in our bodies happening that also have their own life,” she says. “Things you can’t see or control.”Talking of things she can’t control, the poster for the show features a photograph of the leaky ceiling in her own studio in Kreuzberg, Berlin – a brown, uneven stain on a square white panel. The building was built in the early 1970s and, she says, was instantly hated by local people because a lot of old buildings were torn down in order to make way for it. It was already in a state of disrepair when Herfeldt – who was born in Munich but grew up north of Hamburg before arriving in Berlin as a teenager – moved in.This decrepit property was frustrating for the artist – she couldn’t hang her art works without fearing they might be damaged – but it was also fascinating. With no building plans available, nobody had a clue how to repair any of the issues that arose. When the ceiling panel in Herfeldt’s studio became so sodden it collapsed entirely, the only solution was to replace the panel with a new one – and so the cycle continued.At another site on the property, Herfeldt says the leaking was so bad that a series of shower basins were installed in the suspended ceiling in order to redirect the water to a different sink. “I realised that the building was like a body, a totally dysfunctional body,” she says.View image in fullscreen‘Things you can’t see or control’ … Lisa Herfeldt.Photograph: Peter Flude/The GuardianThe situation reminded her ofDark Star, John Carpenter’s debut 1974 film about an AI-powered spacecraft that takes on a life of its own. And as you might notice from the show’s title – Alice, Laurie & Ripley – that’s not the only film to have influenced Herfeldt’s show. The three names refer to the female protagonists inFriday 13th,HalloweenandAlienrespectively. Herfeldt citesa 1987 essayby the American professor Carol J Clover, which identifies these “final girls” as a unique film trope – women left alone to save the day. “She’s a bit tomboyish, on the silent side and she can survive because she’s quite clever,” says Herfeldt of the archetypal final girl. “They don’t take drugs or have sex. And it doesn’t matter the viewer’s gender, we can all identify with the final girl.”Herfeldt sees a parallel between these characters and her sculptures – things that are just about holding in place despite the pressures they’re under. So is her work more about societal collapse than just leaky ceilings? Because like so many institutions, these materials that should seal and protect us from damage are actually slowly eroding around us. “Oh, totally,” says Herfeldt.Before finding inspiration in the silicone gun, Herfeldt used other unusual materials. Recent shows have involved tongue-like shapes made from the kind of nylon fabric you might see on a sleeping bag or inside a jacket. Again there is the sense these strange items could come alive – some are concertinaed like caterpillars mid-crawl, others lollop down from walls or spill across doorways attracting dirt from footprints (Herfeldt encourages viewers to touch and dirty her art). Like the silicone sculptures, these nylon creations are also housed in – and escaping from – cheap looking acrylic glass boxes. They’re ugly looking things, and really that’s the point.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Children sit in a rock pool playing mermaids, and in the next room there’s a talking pea in a display case, beside a towering stack of mattresses. It’s the world ofHans Christian Andersen(1805-1875), one of the 19th century’s most beloved writers. I’m in Odense, on the island of Fyn (sometimes anglicised to Funen) in the south of Denmark, to explore Andersen’s enduring legacy in his home town 150 years after his death, and to discover a few fairytales of my own.HC Andersens Husis the city’s museum dedicated to the writer, incorporating his first home. Niels Bjørn Friis fromMuseum Odensesays that in earlier iterations of the museum there was little focus on Andersen’s stories. The writer’s life was explored, but The Ugly Duckling, Thumbelina and The Little Mermaid were nowhere to be found. For visitors who come to Odense seeking storytelling magic, it was a little lacking.A map showing the island of Fyn and its location in relation to CopenhagenThe redesign of Odense city centre, rerouting a major road, provided the opportunity to reimagine how the city’s most famous son could be honoured. A major architecture competition awarded Japanese firm Kengo Kuma and Associates the contract, with the curators’ new approach at the core of the design. The distinctive timber-clad museum with interlinked spiralling spaces opened to great fanfare in 2021. “We’ve tried to create a space where we don’t talk about Andersen, but we talk like Andersen: with humour, irony and perspective,” says Friis. Even the gardens take this approach: “It’s a garden for wanderers and for giants, it’s designed to make you feel small,” he says, a challenge achieved by clever planting, playing with height, scale and many winding paths in a deceptively small space.Andersen wrote two and a half autobiographies and frequently contradicted himself. HC Andersens Hus takes this approach to heart; often the views of his friends or snippets of letters are presented to gently question the author’s own version of events. “Andersen is the guide, but he’s not reliable,” says Friis. The result is a compelling whirlwind tour of Andersen’s life and art, thought processes and best-loved stories. It’s provocative and playful, for adults and children, with a bonus basement make-believe land, Ville Vau, for the youngest visitors.View image in fullscreenThe HC Andersens Hus museum, a space of ‘humour, irony and perspective’.Photograph: Ailsa SheldonBack in the real world, the small city of Odense is charming, with cobbled streets and old wooden houses painted in bright colours. The Andersen legacy is everywhere: the traffic lights feature the writer with his signature top hat, brass footprints provide a freeAndersen walking tour, and there’s a sculpture trail too. Every August this dedication peaks with the annual HC Andersen festival, which celebrates the author’s legacy through art, dance, theatre and music.This year, the week-long festival had 500 shows, most of which were free. As I explore Odense, I meet painted stilt-walkers, ghoulish monsters and an Andersen lookalike telling stories. I hear feminist spoken-word pieces and see an incredible late-night performance featuring acrobatic dancers descending from the town hall and hanging from a crane.Still to comethis year are lectures, family art workshops and, expanding the storytelling legacy beyond Andersen, the city’s annualMagic Days festival.All good fairytale destinations need a castle, and Fyn boasts 123 castles and manor houses across the islandAs in most of Denmark, bikes are the best way to get about in Odense and a “cycling highway” winds through the city centre. FromHotel Odeon, I cycle to the free harbour-side swimming pool, then out of town for a loop around Stige Ø, a small island connected by causeway to the mainland. City residents picnic here after work, or enjoy a quiet hour fishing, paddleboarding or swimming.Back in Odense, I eat atRestaurant Under Lindetræet, where the menu is inspired by Andersen themes and stories. The poem Denmark, My Native Landis featured when I visit, and proprietor Nils Palmqvist reads extracts, translated into English, as he presents each course. It’s an experience repeated often in my days in the city, thefynbo(as residents of Fyn are known) love a yarn and it feels as though storytelling is always on the menu here.View image in fullscreenCycling is the best way to get around Odense and Fyn.Photograph: Daniel VilladsenAll good fairytale destinations need a castle, and Fyn boasts 123 castles and manor houses across the island. Taking day trips from Odense, I visitEgeskov Castle, Europe’s best-preserved Renaissance water castle. While much of it is open to visitors, Egeskov is also the family home of Count Michael Ahlefeldt-Laurvig-Bille and his wife, Princess Alexandra zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg. I wonder if she can feel a pea through a stack of mattresses. The couple are often found in the vast landscaped gardens and play park chatting to visitors.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After a family inheritance dispute that emptied the castle contents, Albinus decided to open her home to visitors and filled it with art, inviting international artists to create site-specific pieces. The juxtaposition of the high cornices and fine wallpapers with Czech artist Jiří Georg Dokoupil’s huge balloon-like sculptures and colourful bubble paintings would no doubt have amused Hans Christian Andersen, who loved to challenge expectations.View image in fullscreenHans Christian AndersenFrom Valdemars Castle, I catch theMS Helge, a wooden ferry built in 1924, which transports passengers around the South Fyn archipelago. This beautiful coastline was last year designated aUnesco Global Geoparkfor its unique “drowned” ice age landscape. I disembark in Svendborg and rent a bike fromSouth Funen Bicycle Rental. I’m cycling today with Mette Mathiasen from Destination Fyn, who is behind the development of the 410-mile (660km) castles route around Fyn. It’s divided into 14 sections, with local operators offering luggage transfer. We’re exploring a 21-mile section, along the coast to the village of Åbyskov and Elsehoved beach. We pass turreted castles, manors and long stretches of quiet coastline, pedalling along country lanes with hedgerows overflowing with blackberries. Unlike most of Denmark, there are some hills in the south of Fyn, but with quiet trails and the option of an ebike, this is gentle, all-abilities cycling.As dusk falls, I pedal across the moat to my last castle of the day and my final destination on Fyn –Broholm Castle. Broholm has 700 years of colourful history and plenty of ghost stories, and was a frequent haunt of Andersen, featuring in his 1837 novel Only a Fiddler. From a childhood of poverty to international acclaim, Andersen’s life was quite the adventure. Following in his footsteps on Fyn has been full of castles and colourful characters, with a few surprises too.The trip was provided by Visit Denmark and Destination Fyn.Hotel Odeonhas doubles from1,100kroner (£128) B&B.Broholm Castlehas doubles from1,695kronerB&BExplore more on these topicsDenmark holidaysEurope holidaysScandinavia holidaysCity breaksShort breaksCultural tripsLiterary tripsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That’s not a misnomer if you were using my grandmother’s home-dried chillies, but it would be charitable to say that I’m far less adventurous with chilli, so here I suggest chilli flakes instead. It’s an extraordinarily good marinade for these paneer and potato skewers.Gunpowder paneer and potato skewers with lime-mint dressingYou will need six to eight metal or wooden skewers (if wooden, soak them in water for 10 minutes first).Prep10 minCook30 minServes2400gwaxy potatoes, cut into 4cm chunks225g paneer, cut into 2cm cubes1tsp coriander seeds½tsp fennel seeds1tsp cumin seeds1tsp black peppercorns1tsp chilli flakes1½tsp flaky sea salt,plus extra to serve2garlic cloves, peeled and grated2½cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated40mlneutral oil1 red onion, peeled and cut into eight wedges, then halved crosswaysFor the dressingFinely grated zest and juice of 1 lime10g fresh mint leaves, finely chopped½tsp flaky sea salt100g natural yoghurtBoil the potatoes for nine minutes, then drain them and leave to steam dry for a minute. Meanwhile, put the paneer cubes in a bowl of boiling water for five minutes, then drain and pat dry.Tip the coriander, fennel and cumin seeds into a mortar or spice grinder, add the peppercorns, chilli flakes and sea salt, then pound or blitz to a rough rubble.Tip into a medium-large bowl with the grated garlic and ginger, add the oil, then gently stir in the cubed paneer, cooked potatoes and red onions to coat. Thread the paneer, potatoes and onions on to six to eight metal or soaked wooden skewers, then transfer to a baking sheet and set aside until needed – if you like, you can at this stage cover and refrigerate the skewers.Whisk all the ingredients for the dressing in a medium bowl. Heat the grill to its highest setting, then cook the skewers for five to seven minutes on each side, until the paneer is golden brown and the potatoes are starting to char. (This may take a little more or less time depending on the fierceness of your grill, so keep an eye on them, especially when cooking the first side.)Serve the skewers hot, scattered with a little more sea salt and the dressing alongside for dipping.Explore more on these topicsIndian food and drinkQuick and easySnacksFoodPotatoesCheeseStarterMain courserecipesShareReuse this content"

Today’s Rajasthani stir-fry is one I cook often, and the combination of ginger, chilli and jaggery lends it a lovely balance of flavour. The biryani, meanwhile, is packed with whole spices, basmati and ghee, which give so much more flavour to the layers of rice and vegetables.Mushroom and squash biryaniNational curry weekstarts on October 6, so what better way to mark the occasion than with a rich, warming, all-in-one-pot biryani? If you like, make the vegetable curry element in advance and layer everything on the day you want to serve.Prep20 minCook2 hrServes4For the squash and mushroom gravy4 tbsp ghee, or butter1 tsp cumin seeds2 dried bay leaves4 cloves450g white onions, peeled and thinly sliced3 green bird’s eye chillies, slit open lengthways5cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and cut into matchsticks2 tbsp tomato puree¼ tsp mild chilli powder, or kashmiri chilli powder1 tsp ground turmeric2 tsp coriander powder1 heaped tbsp greek yoghurt300g butternut squash flesh, cut into bite-sized pieces300g button mushrooms, cleaned and halved if on the large side400ml vegetable stock, or waterSalt, to taste2 tbsp chopped coriander, to garnishFor the rice200gbasmati rice2 bay leaves4 green cardamom podsA pinch of saltFor the biryani2 tbsp melted ghee1 pinchsaffron threads, soaked in 3 tbsp warm water1¼cm piece freshginger, peeled and cut into matchsticks3 tbsp finely chopped fresh mint leaves1 tsp ground cardamom powder1 tsp garam masalaRaita and salad, to serveFirst make the gravy. Melt the ghee in a large, heavy-based saucepan on a medium heat, add the cumin seeds, bay leaves and cloves, and fry for a few seconds. Stir in the sliced onion and cook, stirring often, for 30-35 minutes, until softened. When the onions start to brown, transfer half of them to a plate and set aside (you’ll use them later during the layering).Add the green chillies and ginger to the remaining onions in the pan, fry for a minute, then stir in the tomato puree, chilli powder, turmeric and coriander powder, and fry for a minute. Turn down to a low heat, stir in the yoghurt and cook for two minutes.Add the squash and mushrooms, stir to coat in the spices, then fry for three minutes. Add the stock or water, and season to taste. Bring to a boil, then turn down the heat, cover and simmer for 18-20 minutes, stirring once halfway to make sure nothing’s stuck to the bottom of the pan. Garnish with coriander, then take off the heat.Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Wash the rice, then put it in a saucepan with a litre of water and the bay leaves, cardamom and salt. Bring to a boil, cook for 10-12 minutes, until three-quarters cooked, then drain.To build the biryani, put a tablespoon of melted ghee in a casserole pot for which you have a tight-fitting lid. Ladle in half the vegetable curry, then top that with half the rice. Add half the saffron water, ginger, mint, ground cardamom and garam masala, then add the reserved fried onions. Top with the remaining vegetable curry, then spoon on the remaining rice. Top with the remaining ghee, saffron water, ginger, mint, ground cardamom and garam masala.Cover with baking paper, cover with the lid, then bake on the middle shelf of the oven for 15-17 minutes, so all the flavours soak into the rice. Take out of the oven, leave to rest, still covered, for 10 minutes, then lift off the lid and serve with raita and salad.Rajasthaniachari kaddu(squash with pickling spices stir-fry)View image in fullscreenMaunika Gowardhan’s Rajasthaniachari kaddu, or squash cooked with pickling spices.The Indian word “achari” refers to flavouring a dish using pickling spices, and the mix includes mustard seeds, fennel, fenugreek, cumin, asafoetida and nigella, but they’re not used only in pickles. The blend also features in all manner of curries and stir-fries, such as this one.Prep10 minCook30 minServes41 tsp black mustard seeds½ tsp fenugreek seeds1 tsp fennel seeds4 tbsp vegetable oil1 pinch asafoetida5cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped750g squash flesh, or pumpkin, cut into bite-sized pieces1 tsp mild chilli powder½ tsp ground turmericSalt, to taste1 tbsp jaggery, or dark brown sugar2 tsp dried mango powderPut the mustard seeds, fenugreek and fennel seeds in a mortar, crush coarsely, then set aside. Put the oil in a large frying pan orkadhaion a medium heat. Add the crushed spices and the asafoetida, and fry, stirring, for a few seconds. Add the ginger, fry for a minute, then stir in the squash, chilli and turmeric, and fry, stirring, for five minutes more.Add 50ml water to the pot, season with salt to taste and bring to a boil. Cover, turn down the heat, and leave to cook for 20 minutes, stirring once halfway through. Add the jaggery, crushing some of the pieces a little, then add the mango powder, stir well and serve warm with chapatis or naan.Maunika Gowardhan is a cook and food writer.
