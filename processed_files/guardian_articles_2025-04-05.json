But he added: “We have both a trade defence arsenal with anti-dumping, anti-subsidy and safeguard systems in case of import surges.”Referring to Trump’s tactics, Lamy said it was best to respond robustly in a way the US president understood: “I think Mr Trump learned to do business in the New York mafia-influenced real estate market and that his tactics are based on extortion – you hit and keep hitting for as long as you do not get a good price for stopping. Showing your muscle, it seems to me, is the way to transact with him and his people.”View image in fullscreenDemonstrators attend a rally against US president Donald Trump during a ‘Hands Off' protest in Washington DC on Saturday.Photograph: Tierney L Cross/ReutersIn a sign of growing concern in the US about the direction of the country after Trump’s election, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of Washington and other big cities on Saturday in a show of defiance against the president’s “authoritarian overreach and billionaire-backed agenda”.The“Hands Off” protests– of which more than 1,000 events are planned across the country – were expected to be the largest single day of action since Trump was sworn into office for a second term.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerThe ObserverTrump tariffsTariffsEconomicsAutomotive industryChinaEuropean UnionShareReuse this content"

Multiple messages denounced the two men for shuttering government agencies, cutting jobs and services and – in often graphic terms – for threatening the survival of US democracy.“Resist like it’s 1938 Nazi Germany” and “Fascism is alive and well and living in the White House”, read two slogans at the Hands Off gathering, organized by the civil society group Indivisible and featuring speeches from a host of other organizations as well as Democratic members of Congress.The rally, which coincided with roughly 1,000 other similarly themed events across the country, was punctuated by a fusillade of barbs aimed at Trump as well as Musk, whose infiltration into government agencies through the unofficial “department of government efficiency”, or Doge, without congressional approval, and cash-fueled interventions in election races have been seen as anti-democratic affronts.View image in fullscreenThe protest in DC.Photograph: Roberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty Images“They believe democracy is doomed and they believe regime change is upon us if only they can seize our payments system,” said Jamie Raskin, a Democratic representative from Maryland who is the party’s top figure on the House judiciary committee.He added: “If they think they are going to overthrow the foundations of democracy, they don’t know who they are dealing with.”Saturday’s events followed weeks of anxiety among anti-Trump forces that the president had railroaded through his agenda in the absence of adequate resistance from congressional Democrats and minus the displays of popular mass opposition that appeared early in his first presidency.But they also came days after the Democratsdrew encouragementfromvictory in a racefor a vacant supreme court seat in Wisconsin into which Musk had unsuccessfully ploughed $25m ofhis own moneyto support the Trump-endorsed Republican candidate.It also followed the roll-out of Trump’s flagship policy of import tariffs, which triggeredmassive plungesin international stock markets and fueled fears of an economic downturn.Multiple speakers and attendees said they hoped the rallies would embolden other American disillusioned by Trump’s policies to join future rallies, giving a fledgling protest movement much-needed momentum.View image in fullscreenProtesters in DC on Saturday.Photograph: Roberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty Images“We want to send a signal to all people and institutions that have been showing anticipatory obedience to Trump and showing they are willing to bend the knee that there is, in fact, a mass public movement that’s willing to rise up and stop this,” said Leah Greenberg, Indivisible’s executive director.“If our political leaders stand up, we will have their backs. We want them to stand up and protect the norms of democracy and want them to see that there are people out there who are willing to do that. The goal of this is building a message.”Robert Weissman, co-president of Public Citizen, a consumer-rights advocacy group, told the crowd: “There’s only one thing that can face down the authoritarian moment we are facing, and that’s the movement we see here today.”Asked by the Guardian whether the mass demonstrations were sufficient to stop Trump, he said: “It’s not a one-time thing. It’s got to be a sustaining phenomenon. There’s been a lot of criticism of the Democrats for not standing up in Congress, so an event like this will stiffen their spine.“It’s about making the Democrats better and giving them courage – and it will. That’s also true for ordinary people, because Trump’s authoritarian playbook is designed to make people think it’s useless to resist. This demonstrates power and it will bring in more people.”Several congressional Democrats predicted the rally would inspire more protests, ultimately fueling an electoral triumph in next year’s congressional midterms, when control of the House of Representatives and the Senate will be up for grabs.“This is what freedom fighting against fascism looks like,” said Eric Swalwell, a representative for California. “This is not the last day of the fight, it’s the first day. When it all comes to [be] written about, you will see that April 5 is when it all came alive. Energy and activism beget energy and activism.”View image in fullscreenProtesters at the Washington monument on Saturday.Photograph: Ken Cedeno/ReutersSeveral members acknowledged that protests were rarely enough to supplant authoritarian governments, as demonstrated in countries like Turkey and Hungary, whose strongman leaders, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Viktor Orbán respectively, have survived in office despite repeated episodes of street protests.“We invited some historians in to discuss that question,” said Raskin. “They said, in some countries there was just a legislative parliamentary strategy, and that only succeeded about one-third of the time.“In other countries, there was just a popular-resistance strategy, and that succeeded a little bit more than a third of the time. But when you have a popular-resistance strategy and an effective legislative strategy, it wins more than two-thirds of the time. It’s not a guarantee, but you need to have national mass popular action at the same time that you’ve got an effective legislative strategy, too.”Representative Don Beyer, whose northern Virginia district – home to 75,000 federal workers – has been disproportionately affected by Musk’s assault on government agencies, compared the effect of Trump’s actions to the upheaval wrought by Mao Zedong in the Chinese cultural revolution.But, he said, Trump would be derailed by next year’s election, which he said he was “somewhat confident” would be ‘“free and fair”.“They’re not perfect [but] the people do have a chance to speak,” Beyer said. “Elections are very much decentralized and organized precinct by precinct. There are lots of chances to push back. We just saw that in Wisconsin.”Explore more on these topicsWashington DCProtestDonald TrumpElon MuskUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

He became mayor of the west of England in 2021.His constituency website said he trained with the NSPCC and worked as a teacher and child protection officer.Avon and Somerset Police said: “A man aged in his sixties was arrested on Friday on suspicion of sexual offences against a girl (under the Sexual Offences Act 1956), rape (under the Sexual Offences Act 2003), child abduction and misconduct in a public office.“He’s been released on conditional bail for enquiries to continue.

A spokesperson for YWAM said the organisation was “heartbroken” by the claims and was “deeply committed to the safety and wellbeing” of everyone in its care.The allegations span two decades and include claims that young missionaries were publicly shamed, subjected to rituals to “cure” their homosexuality, and told that leaving was against God’s will.Young British adults who signed up for training schools and overseas mission trips – many during their gap years – described regular confession sessions where they were pressured to admit their “sins” in a group.These included perceived moral transgressions such as homosexual thoughts, sexual activity, abortions and watching pornography, as well as other “sins” such as disobeying a leader or having “rebellious thoughts”. Those who confessed could be questioned and made to give public apologies, according to former missionaries. They could be prayed for or could face punishment, including being removed from volunteer roles. In some cases, interventions were more extreme. Former YWAM volunteers described the use of rituals similar to exorcisms to banish demons from people who acknowledged having sex outside marriage.Another former British YWAM worship leader described a “casting out” at a base in Australia, arranged after a man revealed that he had sexual relations with other men. Leaders placed their hands on him before chanting prayers to “banish the spirit of homosexuality”, and he reportedly convulsed. The British man was himself struggling with his sexuality and said he was left feeling as though a “demon” was living inside him.Others described how people disclosed being victims of assault or sexual abuse, as well as transgressions such as speeding fines.The “repentance and forgiveness” rituals are alleged to be part of a wider picture of control at some bases, which also included restrictions on romantic relationships, clothing and when missionaries could visit family.Commands were often communicated by leaders as though they were instructions from God. “They were always changing what other people wanted to do by saying: ‘I reckon, God is saying this.’ It was used to manipulate,” one former missionary said.YWAM operates in about 180 countries and sends about 25,000 people on short-term missions each year. It was founded in 1960 by the American missionary Loren Cunningham and has key bases in the US, Australia, Switzerland and the UK, where it is a registered charity.A spokesperson for YWAM England said it was committed to “continuous improvement in safeguarding practices” and that each location was responsible for upholding standards. It said it was “strongly opposed” to forced confessions. “While confession of sin may occur, the person should never be publicly shamed or pressured to apologise.”Last year, YWAM’s base in Perth, Australia – one of the biggest in the world – faced scrutiny over its handling of alleged historic sexual misconduct, including claims that its leaders told alleged victims to apologise to their alleged attackers for “leading them on”. A YWAM base in the UK was recently closed amid claims of spiritual abuse.The allegations come as a prayer movement linked to YWAM – which aims to recruit the next generation of Christian missionaries – sweeps through Britain.The Send UK & Ireland, an initiative by a coalition of Christian groups, which is legally controlled by the YWAM branch in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, launched with a show last July at Ovo Arena Wembley. It has since held pop-ups at churches and concert halls across the UK.Its aim is to recruit 100,000 young British adults to do missionary work in the UK and abroad and reverse the trend of decline among western missions.After the Wembley event, hundreds of people signed up via QR code to serve as missionaries through YWAM and the Send’s other partner organisations.The allegations, made by former missionaries whose experiences span two decades and 18 countries, raise questions about culture and safeguarding within YWAM, which has a decentralised structure that critics say leads to insufficient oversight. The organisation defers power to leaders on bases around the world, who say they take safeguarding seriously.YWAM has underlying statements of principles and runs discipleship training schools which have a similar structure across all bases, with lectures on topics such as “sin, repentance and restitution”, “spiritual warfare” and “discipling nations”.The code of conduct for the University of the Nations, YWAM’s unaccredited Christian university, which oversees YWAM training schools, says “any moral violation”, including “sexual immorality”, is grounds for disciplinary action. Other bases list fornication and homosexuality as immoral behaviours alongside incest and bestiality.In 2020, Lynn Green, one of YWAM’s most senior leaders and the founder of YWAM England, published a blog post urging the human race to “repent for ignoring the laws of God”, blaming abortion and “the homosexual agenda” for “bringing destruction”.Felicity Davies, 34, a designer from Yorkshire who spent six years in YWAM after joining at the age of 18, said the “purity culture” and alleged controlling behaviour at a base in South Africa left her feeling “suffocated” and “not good enough”.“I constantly had to do certain things in order for God to love me or to be accepted,” she said. “People should be aware that this isn’t all happy-clappy. A lot of people get traumatised.”Lena Stary, 26, from Bristol, who joined YWAM aged 18, said her experience in Switzerland left her suffering panic attacks and had taken years to untangle. It had made it “very difficult to trust other people”. She is no longer religious. “I just found it so difficult to believe that God is a loving being if all of what I was being told was true,” she said.A YWAM spokesperson said: “Although a high number of individuals have had a positive experience in YWAM, we are aware and deeply regret that some have had harmful experiences of spiritual abuse and manipulation.” They said each base was responsible for safeguarding and was held to account by leadership teams overseeing specific regions.In England, a YWAM spokesperson said leaders had “implemented stricter oversight mechanisms” after claims of spiritual abuse at a base which has since closed. They said YWAM held “traditional Christian views on sexuality and marriage” but was reviewing how it communicated those beliefs to prevent “shame or rejection”, and that it condemned any practice that traumatised people or associated their identity with demonic influence.“We are deeply grieved to hear reports that spiritual practices intended for healing were instead used in coercive or shaming ways,” they said.Green stood by his comments on abortion and homosexuality and said he sought to approach the matters “with both grace and faithfulness”, adding that he, “like others in YWAM”, condemned any form of spiritual abuse.A YWAM Perth spokesperson said any comment that an alleged victim had “led on” their alleged attacker or must apologise to them did not reflect the views of leadership.Explore more on these topicsChristianityThe ObserverYoung peopleReligionMental healthnewsShareReuse this content"

Given how hard they worked and how little they were paid, Liu stepped in. He couldn’t unilaterally raise their incomes, so emailed them Amazon eGift cards. This ran into problems too, however. “Everyone thought they were being scammed,” he recalls. And so he switched to writing cheques.As the co-founder of several companies, Liu can make ends meet without his Harvard salary, and has set up a charitable foundation to further scientific research. Its coffers are due to swell considerably now that Liu has received the $3m Breakthrough prize for life sciences, which he was presented with on Saturday at the annual awards ceremony in Los Angeles.The Breakthrough prizes, described by their Silicon Valley founders as the Oscars of science, are awarded annually to scientists and mathematicians chosen by committees of previous winners. This year, two further life sciences prizes were given for landmark research on multiple sclerosis and GLP-1 agonists, better known as “skinny jabs”.Other winners on the night were Dennis Gaitsgory, a mathematician in Bonn, for his work on the Langlands program, an ambitious effort to unify disparate concepts in maths, and more than 13,000 researchers at Cern for testing the modern theory of particle physics.Liu was chosen for inventing two exceptionally precise gene editing tools, namely base editing and prime editing. Base editing was first used in a patient at Great Ormond Street in London, where itsaved the life of a British teenager with leukaemia.Scientists have worked on gene editing for more than a decade. Progress, they hope, will lead to therapeutics that correct the mutations responsible for thousands of genetic diseases. But the first generation of gene editing tools had limited success: they were good at disabling faulty genes, but not at correcting them.View image in fullscreenAlyssa Tapley received pioneering treatment for leukaemia made possible by base editing.Photograph: Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children/PABase editing allows scientists to make changes to single letters of the genetic code, while prime editing has been compared to the search and replace function in a word processor, giving researchers the power to rewrite whole stretches of DNA. Together, they have enormous potential. “The vast majority of known pathogenic mutations can now be corrected using prime editing or base editing,” Liu says.Liu grew up in Riverside, California, and traces his interest in science to playing with bugs in his back yard. He went to Harvard and worked with EJ Corey, a Nobel laureate considered one of the greatest chemists of our time. “That was the start of what turned into a lifelong love of experimental molecular science,” Liu says. “He encouraged me to follow my passions and curiosity.”His curiosity was not confined to chemistry. Liu read that radio-controlled plane enthusiasts wanted a plane that flew slowly enough to pilot around a room. After working the equations, he built the Wisp, a six-gram carbon fibre plane that zoomed around at a leisurely one mile per hour. Another project merged Lego bricks with the heat sensor from a burglar alarm to produce the “mouseapult”, a device that detected cats and lobbed toy mice in their direction.Video games also featured heavily. In the early 1990s, Liu hung out with Andy Gavin and Jason Rubin, the students behind the games developer Naughty Dog. He tested games and was an occasional voice actor. One performance made it intoWay of the Warriorfor the 3DO games machine. “I said something like…” he pauses to adopt a mocking tone “…‘my dead grandfather fights better than you’.”A riskier hobby took root while Liu was in hospital recovering from an operation. He wanted to beat blackjack and wrote a simulator to understand the mathematics. Before long, he had worked out a series of card counting techniques and went to Las Vegas to test them. He did so well that he was banned from all MGM Grand casinos and, to use the gaming euphemism, “back-roomed” twice to be read the Nevada trespass laws.We are going to end up with treatments that work, but that nobody wants to pay for.David LiuLater, as a professor at Harvard, a group of students persuaded Liu to run a class on card counting. “The best decision I made about that team was that no members put in their own money and no members took out their own money. It all went back into the fund for us to fly to Las Vegas and pay for our hotel and meals,” he says. “It was all about the fun of learning something really difficult.”In the lab, Liu was trying to crack a very different problem.Gene editingat the time could disable genes, but not rewrite the letters of the DNA code. But disabling genes would never be enough to treat genetic diseases. “They need to be treated by fixing the gene,” he says.Thefirst breakthroughcame in 2016 when Liu’s team described base editing, a way to correct single-letter mutations that account for nearly a third of genetic diseases. The procedure usedCrisprguide molecules to find the faulty code and an enzyme to change the aberrant letter. Waseem Qasim, a paediatric immunologist at Great Ormond Street hospital, remembers reading the paper over breakfast the day after it was published. “My kids were relatively small at the time. I spat on my cornflakes and said, look at this, guys, science fiction!”Afollow-up paperin 2019 described prime editing, a less efficient but more powerful technique that in principle can repair nearly all disease-causing mutations.The benefits of base editing became clear in 2022 when Qasim’s team became the first in the world to use the procedure on a patient.Alyssa Tapley, a 13-year-old from Leicester, had run out of options after chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant had failed to treat her leukaemia. The cancer affected her T-cells, a group of immune cells that normally fight infections.The doctors collected T-cells from a healthy donor and modified the genetic code so that when infused into Alyssa they would seek out and attack her cancer cells. The treatment worked: more than two years later, Alyssa remains in complete remission.More than a dozen clinical trials are now under way to test base editing and prime editing. Positive results have already been reported for leukaemia,sickle-cell disease,beta-thallasaemiaandhigh cholesterol. But major hurdles remain. While Alyssa’s treatment involved editing cells outside the body and sending them in, most diseases require mutations to be fixed inside the patient. This is a trick scientists have yet to crack.It’s not the only problem. Qasim’s team is treating more patients in a trial, but when the trial ends, there may be no one to fund future treatments. “We are going to end up with treatments that work, but that nobody wants to pay for.”Liu is optimistic that researchers can find ways to deliver the therapies and reduce the costs, but he has grave concerns about the future of science, particularly in the US. He believes the recent wave of firings and funding cuts pose an existential threat to the next decade or two of progress that will have ramifications around the world.“To me, slashing funding and people from science in the United States is like burning your seed corn. It’s not even eating your seed corn. It’s just destroying it,” he says. “What can be more human than wanting to use all of our knowledge, all of our effort, all of our resources, to try to make the lives of our kids safer and better than our own lives? A huge part of that aspiration requires, and is indeed driven by, science.”Explore more on these topicsGene editingThe ObserverGeneticsBiologyMedical researchHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

One appliance from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) is at the scene.Another wildfire had been reported in around the same area on Thursday and covered about 1.5 miles (2.4km).On Wednesday, crews in Scotland tackled a large grass fire at Gartur Moss in Port of Menteith, Stirling.The National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC) has warned it needs “long-term and sustained investment” to cope with the climate crisis and “increased demand” on its services, after firefighters battled wildfires across the UK this week.This year has seen 286 wildfires hit the UK, according to the NFCC, more than 100 above the number recorded in the same period in 2022, a year that had record-breaking temperatures and unprecedented wildfire activity.The NFCC warned the government that it could not continue to cope with “significant increases in wildfires” with current budgets “already under strain”.Phil Garrigan, chairman of the NFCC, said: “There is no getting away from the fact that climate change is driving increases in extreme weather events, such as wildfires.“Responding to wildfires requires a lot of resource, and often over long periods of time, which puts pressure on other fire and rescue service activities.“Rising resilience threats mean there is an increased demand on fire and rescue services and that has to be met with long-term and sustained investment. This is really crucial to ensuring we can continue to keep our communities safe.”Fire services in Scotland, Wales and England have all warned against barbecues and campfires in open spaces this weekend, as well as urging people to dispose of cigarettes properly.Explore more on these topicsScotlandFirefightersnewsShareReuse this content"

She is seeking a judge’s order to enforce the agreement after Schrader said he couldn’t go through with it. The terms, including a monetary payment, were not disclosed.“This is an open-and-shut settlement enforcement matter,” Doe’s lawyer, Gregory Chiarello, wrote in court papers accompanying the breach-of-contract claim.Schrader’s lawyer, Philip J Kessler, deemed the lawsuit “desperate, opportunistic and frivolous” – and said many of the allegations in it are false or materially misleading.“We absolutely deny that there was ever a sexual relationship of any kind between Mr Schrader and his former assistant, and we deny that Mr Schrader ever made an attempt to have a sexual relationship of any kind with his former assistant,” Kessler said.The lawsuit, filed in a New York court, laid bare allegations that the confidential settlement between Doe, 26, and Schrader, 78, had been intended to keep under wraps.They include her claim that the filmmaker trapped her in his hotel room, grabbed her arms and kissed her against her will last year while they were promoting his latest film,Oh, Canada, at the Cannes film festival in France.Two days later, the lawsuit said, Schrader called Doe repeatedly and sent her angry text messages claiming he was “dying” and couldn’t pack his bags. When Doe arrived to help, the lawsuit said, Schrader exposed his genitals to her as he opened his hotel room door wearing nothing but an open bathrobe.Doe alleges Schrader fired her last September after she again rejected his advances. Soon after, the lawsuit said, he sent her an email expressing fear that he’d become “a Harvey Weinstein” in her mind. Weinstein, the movie mogul turned #MeToo villain, was convicted of rape in Los Angeles in 2022 and is awaiting a 15 April retrial in his New York rape case.According to the lawsuit, Schrader agreed to the settlement on 5 February but changed his mind after an illness and “soul searching”. Schrader conveyed through his lawyers in March that he “could not live with the settlement”, the lawsuit said. Kessler disputed that.“The agreement that they’re trying to enforce against Mr Schrader, in plain English, required both parties to sign it before it became legally effective,” Kessler said. “Mr Schrader declined to sign it. It’s frankly as simple as that.”Doe worked for Schrader from 2021 until 2024, according to the lawsuit. During that time, Kessler said, she posted on social media about how much she loved her job and referred to Schrader as an extraordinary mentor and “my man”.Schrader rose to fame through his collaborations with the directorMartin Scorsese, beginning with Taxi Driver in 1976.Robert De Niro’s iconic line “You talkin’ to me?” is seared into the lexicon and ranked among the American Film Institute’s all-time greatest movie quotes.Schrader co-wrote Scorsese’s 1980 boxing drama Raging Bull, also starring De Niro, and authored his 1988 religious epic The Last Temptation of Christ and his 1999 paramedic drama Bringing Out the Dead.He also directed 23 of his own films, including 1980’s American Gigolo, which he also wrote. He received his only Academy Award nomination for writing First Reformed, a 2017 thriller about a small-town minister that he also directed.Schrader told the Associated Press last year that he made Oh, Canada – the film that Doe said brought them to Cannes – as he reconciled his own mortality after a string of hospitalizations for long Covid.In 2016, Schrader told the Hollywood Reporter that police visited him after he ranted on Facebook about Donald Trump’s then-looming first presidency. Schrader wrote that Trump’s election was “a call to violence” and said people should be “willing to take arms”.In 2023, he trashed the Oscars as scrambling “to be woke” with diversity efforts and more international voters. And in 2021, in the wake of #MeToo, he decried so-called “cancel culture”, telling Deadline it was “so infectious, it’s like the Delta virus”.“If your friend says, ‘They’re saying these terrible things about me that aren’t true,’ you’re afraid to come to their defense, because you might catch that virus, too,” Schrader told the entertainment news outlet.Explore more on these topicsPaul SchraderRape and sexual assaultUS crime#MeToo movementLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

Successive prime ministers have used the king’s long track record on campaigning for climate action to help promote Britain’s leadership on combatting the challenges.In December 2023, for example, the king told the Cop28 UN climate change conference in Dubai that more urgent action was needed to bring the world towards a zero-carbon future. “After all, ladies and gentlemen, in 2050 our grandchildren won’t be asking what we said, they will be living with the consequences of what we did or didn’t do,” he said.At that point, the main UK political parties were agreed on the issue. Now the monarch runs the risk of becoming embroiled in a party political dispute. In addition to the change in the Conservative view, Reform wants to scrap net zero completely.Craig Prescott, a constitutional expert at Royal Holloway, University of London, suggested the king must be less specific about his own views on the target. “I think if you take the view that the monarchy has to be ‘two or three steps away’ from party politics then, as party politics changes, the monarchy should change,” he said.Charles, who flies to Italy tomorrow with Queen Camilla for a state visit that lasts until Thursday, will still put tackling the climate crisis and other environmental challenges at the heart of his monarchy.The work to create a more sustainable future will be a feature of the trip. In Rome, the king will join a meeting chaired by the foreign secretary, David Lammy, and attended by business leaders to hear how Britain and Italy are working together on the transition to clean energy. In Ravenna he will meet farmers whose land and crops have been severely affected by devastating floods in the region in the past few years.He and Camilla, who celebrate their 20th wedding anniversary at a state banquet in Rome on Wednesday evening, will visit the Colosseum and celebrate close defence ties between the two countries, in spite of the political differences between Keir Starmer’s Labour party and Italy’s rightwing leader, Giorgia Meloni.The need to avoid involving the king in party political controversy has been highlighted after documents released on Friday revealed that the monarch secretly met Prince Andrew to discuss his future and was twice briefed about plans for him to be involved in a £2.4bn investment fund run by an alleged Chinese spy, Yang Tengbo. Buckingham Palace insisted Yang, since banned from Britain despite protesting his innocence, was not specifically mentioned.Prince William is likely to attend the Cop30 UN climate conference in Belém, Brazil, in November and may also be more guarded than before about his views on achieving net zero, although royals may still be expected to reflect on government policy on the international stage.Any silencing of the monarch and his heir threatens to weaken Britain’s voice abroad, according to some environmental groups. Shaun Spiers, executive director of the environmental thinktank Green Alliance, said Charles might be unable to speak out specifically on the 2050 target but could talk generally about the need for climate action. “The king is a well-respected leader and it would be a shame if he didn’t speak on it, particularly internationally,” he said.Reshima Sharma, deputy head of politics at Greenpeace UK, pointed to popular support for green policies. “King Charles has long been an important advocate for action to clean up our environment and tackle climate change. While the monarchy must remain politically neutral, thankfully climate action continues to receive the kind of popular support that politicians can only dream of. This is reflected across voters of all stripes,” she said.Buckingham Palace declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentThe ObserverMonarchyKing Charles IIIKemi BadenochConservative leadershipnewsShareReuse this content"

Crowd members who had audibly joked about struggling to stay awake through some of Simon’s mellower, deeper cuts joined those around them in collectively belting out the concluding “lie-la-lie” refrain and a round of cheers that ultimately rivaled the closing standing ovation later.Simon’s 19-number turn at New Orleans’ Saenger Theater – designed to resemble one of Italy’s baroque courtyards – marked his return to touring after announcing in 2018 that he would stop, citing in part the rigors of travel and time away from family.Of course, the 16-time Emmy winner didn’t stop creating music. He has previously explained how a dream telling him to write Seven Psalms later led to the release of a 33-minute album of that name, which he has described as a contemplation of faith, spirituality and the struggle to maintain belief. But he has also said he did consider fully retiring after losing most of the hearing in his left ear while recovering from severe Covid and recordingSeven Psalms.Embarking on A Quiet Celebration, with plans for 55 shows across 20 North American cities, demonstrated that the 83-year-old opted for at least one final circuit of curtain calls.As had been telegraphed ahead of time, Simon played the entire Seven Psalms album in order without commentary, marked largely by his voice and guitar except for a couple of duets with spouse and fellow lyricist Edie Brickell. Then there was an intermission. He traded in the dark business suit with which he started for a baseball cap, velour jacket and jeans.And things got palpably bluesier and more upbeat as he delivered on a show-opening promise to spend the post-intermission period on rearranged, more familiar selections from his and the Simon & Garfunkel songbooks, including Graceland, Slip Sliding Away, Homeward Bound and – with Brickell – Under African Skies.Simon avoided letting the second part of the show become a “best of” compilation. He announced he would toss in some of the lesser-known work he has produced through a career spanning eight decades, though he joked that he knew them well because “I mean, they’re my songs.” But he coupled them with anecdotes about their inspiration.He set up St Judy’s Comet – saying it’s one “I very rarely perform” – by recounting how he named it after Robert St Judy, a drummer in the band led by Clifton Chenier, a zydeco musician from Opelousas, Louisiana, about three hours north-west of New Orleans. He played The Late Great Johnny Ace and explained how he got the idea for it having learned of the 1954 accidental, self-inflicted shooting death of the R&B singer of that name.And while playing Rene and Georgette Magritte With Their Dog After the War, he explained he came up with it having seen a picture of a surrealist painter with his wife and their pet some time following the second world war. The song’s title was the photograph’s caption.The final three numbers needed no introduction. Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard and The Boxer elicited sing-alongs that contrasted starkly with the Seven Psalms portion. Then Simon went without his backing ensemble for the solo finale: The Sound of Silence.Concertgoers left pockets of seats in at least some parts of the venue empty. One likely factor may simply involve New Orleans having the reputation for last-minute, walk-up crowds while also knowing Simon had a second show scheduled at the Saenger on Saturday.Prices, however, were a talking point in and around the theater among fans. With tickets being listed for between about $99 and $450, T-shirts inside were $40. Zip-up fleeces were $100. Someone whose water bottle rolled down several rows quipped it was no big deal because it only cost roughly $17.Meanwhile, at least four people in New Orleans’ central business district – where the Saenger stands – could be overheard on Friday engaging in gallows humor about their 401(k) retirement accounts being drained after tariffs imposed by the Trump administration upended stock markets.Nonetheless, if that same kind of chatter was any indication, Simon likely hit the right pitch with his mix of song choices.Father and daughter Enrique and Yedithza Nunez said they traveled from Sacramento, California, to both visit New Orleans and see Simon play live for the first time during what they called a bucket-list trip. Echoing others in the theater, they viewed listening to Seven Psalms as sort of part of the admission price to then indulge in the music that vaulted the main attraction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist and member of Simon & Garfunkel.Married couple Ron and Darlene Moore made the short trip over to the Saenger from their home in New Orleans’ Marigny neighborhood to see Simon in person for a third time. They said they had been most looking forward to seeing him play Seven Psalms live, having already taken in his more commercially successful material.“I do like the old pieces,” Darlene Moore said. “But I love how he evolves.”Explore more on these topicsPaul SimonNew OrleansSimon and GarfunkelPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But as she tried to leave the US she was stopped, interrogated and branded an illegal alien by ICE. Now back home, she tells others thinking of going to Trump’s America: don’t do itJenny KleemanSat 5 Apr 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 5 Apr 2025 15.01 EDTShareJust before the graphic artist Rebecca Burke left Seattle to travel to Vancouver,Canada, on 26 February, she posted an image of a rough comic to Instagram. “One part of travelling that I love is seeing glimpses of other lives,” read the bubble in the first panel, above sketches of cosy homes: crossword puzzle books, house plants, a lit candle, a steaming kettle on a gas stove. Burke had seen plenty of glimpses of other lives over the six weeks she had been backpacking in the US. She had been travelling on her own, staying on homestays free of charge in exchange for doing household chores, drawing as she went. For Burke, 28, it was absolute freedom.Within hours of posting that drawing, Burke got to see a much darker side of life in America, and far more than a glimpse. When she tried to cross into Canada, Canadian border officials told her that her living arrangements meant she should be travelling on a work visa, not a tourist one. They sent her back to the US, where American officials classed her as an illegal alien. She was shackled and transported to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention centre, where she was locked up for 19 days – even though she had money to pay for a flight home, and was desperate to leave the US.Burke had arrived in the US during the Biden administration, only to become one of32,809 peopleto be arrested by Ice during the first 50 days of Donald Trump’s presidency. Since February, several young foreign nationals have been incarcerated in Ice detention centres for seemingly little reason and held for weeks, including GermansLucas Sielaff,Fabian SchmidtandJessica Brösche. (Brösche, 26, spent more than a month in detention, including eight days in solitary confinement.) Unlike these other cases, Burke had been trying to leave the US, rather than enter it, when she was detained for nearly three weeks.I had been following news of Burke’s trip since she arrived in the US on 7 January. To me and my family, Burke is Becky, our neighbour and, for two and a half years, the person who took care of my kids after school. Her London home was only five doors down from us, but we met online, through a website that matches families with people offering childcare. Becky spent her mornings as a graphic artist and comic-book editor, and her afternoons collecting my son and daughter from primary school and entertaining them back at my place, making them snacks and refereeing their squabbles. Best of all, she drew with them. When my daughter turned seven, she asked if she could have a comic-making party; all her friends went home with little zines Becky had helped them make. We felt so lucky to have her in our lives.She booked her plane ticket while pundits were still predicting a close race for the presidency, or a Kamala Harris victoryTwo years ago, Becky went to San Francisco for two weeks on aWorkawayplacement, staying in a family home free of charge in exchange for sweeping floors and walking the dog. Last August, she used Workaway again, in Switzerland. The internet was opening up the possibility of another life for her – one where she could see the world on a shoestring. In September, Becky told me she was going to leave London in January to go travelling on her own. We were sad to see her go, but I was full of admiration for her; I wish I had been as bold and free in my 20s. We threw her a farewell party just before Christmas; everyone cried. I kept up with news of her travels on Instagram, and there were regular postcards and WhatsApps: pictures of the tattoo she had got in Portland; a video she filmed of herself on a forest walk. She told me she had seen bald eagles and woodpeckers, deer and seals. And then, on 26 February, everything went silent.Becky wasn’t someone who liked to be immersed in global news. But, even if she had been, she could never have foreseen what would happen to her. She booked her plane ticket six months ago, while pundits were still predicting a close race for the presidency, or a Kamala Harris victory. Her story gives a glimpse of what America has become since then.Imeet up with Becky at her parents’ house, in Monmouthshire, six days after she arrived back in the UK. After so long in detention, she wants to spend as much as possible in the sunshine, so we sit in the garden while their dog – a cocker spaniel named Mr Bojangles – runs circles around us. Becky is much paler than the person my family knew so well. Her eyes are hollower.She began her trip with a stopover in Iceland, taking in the northern lights, going on to spend three nights in a hostel in New York City. Having already stayed in San Francisco on a Workaway placement, she didn’t feel she had anything to hide when she landed in New York. She would have told the border official her plans in full had he asked about them, she tells me. But he didn’t.The homestays were a big part of the appeal of her trip.“I really liked becoming part of these other families. You don’t get placed so firmly in the community if you’re going to a hotel that’s sterile and separate.” Her first placement was three weeks with a household just outside Portland. Becky would “destroy dandelions from their lawn” and cook meals; her hosts took her on day trips, including an overnight stay at the seaside. They drove her to her next homestay, which was in Portland itself. Becky’s second host took her on forest hikes. “She knew every single plant, every single bird call. It was like having a personal tour guide,” Becky beams. “It was incredible. I thought, this is goingtoowell, I’m having too much fun here.”Both her hosts had been worried about how the US was changing under Trump. “I’m hearing so many scary stories about Ice raids and passports being detained,” Becky WhatsApp’d me on 8 February. Her first host had a transgender friend whose passport had been seized after she tried to change the name on it. But Becky felt like a spectator to it all. “I was worried on their behalf – an abstract worry and concern for others – rather than for myself. Because, I thought, I’m getting out of here.”On 26 February, Becky boarded a Greyhound coach for the three-hour ride from Seattle to Vancouver. She was due to spend two months in the home of a divorced father who wanted help with meal prep and laundry during the one week out of every two that his kids lived with him. Becky had never been to Canada before and was looking forward to this part of her trip. She sat at the back of the coach, listening to a comedy podcast, watching the world flash by.She wasn’t thinking about the dismal state of US-Canada relations when she handed her passport to the Canadian border official. He asked what she was planning to do in Canada. Travel, she replied. He asked where she was staying. Living with a man and his family, she said. He asked how she knew him. Becky said they had met on Workaway, and that she would be helping out around the house. The official told her they needed to research what Workaway was. He told Becky’s coach driver to leave without her.Workaway warns users that they “will need the correct visa for any country that you visit”, and that it is the user’s responsibility to get one, but it doesn’t stipulate what the correct visaisfor the kind of arrangements it facilitates in any given country. Becky had always travelled with a tourist visa in the past – including to the US in 2022 – without any problems. She checked that work visas were only required for paid work in Canada. She had had months to plan her trip, and would have applied for a work visa if it was necessary, she says.But the Canadian officials told Becky they’d determined she needed a work visa. She could apply for one from the US and come back, they said. Two officers escorted her to the American side of the border. They talked to the US officials. Becky doesn’t know what was said.After six hours of waiting – and watching dozens of people being refused entry to the US and made to return to Canada – Becky began to feel frightened. Then she was called into an interrogation room, and questioned about what she had been doing during her seven weeks in the US. Had she been paid? Was there a contract? Would she have lost her accommodation if she could no longer provide services? Becky answered no to everything. She was a tourist, she said.US officials took her fingerprints, seized her phone and bags, frisked her, and put her in a cell. ‘I heard the door lock, and I instantly threw up’An hour later, Becky was handed a transcript of her interview to sign. She was alone, with no legal advice. “It was really long, loads of pages.” As she flicked through it, she saw the officer had summarised everything she told him about what she had been doing in the US as just “work in exchange for accommodation”. “I remember thinking, I should ask him to edit that.” But the official was impatient and irritable, she says, and she was exhausted and dizzy – she hadn’t eaten all day. “I just thought, if I sign this, I’ll be free. And I didn’t want to stay there any longer.” So she signed.Then she was told she had violated her tourist visa by working in the US. They took her fingerprints, seized her phone and bags, cut the laces off her trainers, frisked her, and put her in a cell. “I heard the door lock, and I instantly threw up.”At 11pm, Becky was allowed to call her family. Her father asked what was going to happen next. “I looked at the officer and he said, ‘We’re going to take you to a facility where you’ll wait for your flight. You’ll be there one or two days – just while we get you on the next flight home.’”Becky was shackled and put into the back of a van. “I had no idea where we were going. It was just bumping around in darkness with handcuffs on.” At 2.30am, she arrived at the Ice facility in Tacoma, Washington. She was made to change into standard-issue underwear, a yellow top and trousers. Officers took away all her personal belongings, measured her height and weight, made her pose for a mugshot, and assigned her an “A” number (short for “alien”). Whenever she asked the people processing her arrival how long she would be detained for, they told her they couldn’t help: they worked for GEO, the private company contracted to run the facility, and not Ice, the government body that would decide her fate.At 5.30am, she was taken to the dorm that she was to share with 103 other women: a massive room filled with metal tables, benches and bunk beds, some cells around the perimeter, and a row of payphones, “like a hospital mixed with a canteen”. It was bathed in bright halogen light that Becky would come to learn would always be on, albeit slightly dimmed between 11.30pm and 5.30am. Becky’s bunk was on a mezzanine level.View image in fullscreenBurke’s sketch of her bunk in the detention centre.Illustration: RE BurkeAll Becky wanted to do was sleep, but instead she headed to the payphones to make the one free call she had been told she was entitled to, to tell her family how to put money into her inmate account. “In my head, this was a thing I had to do immediately, otherwise I’d be stuck without a way to communicate with the outside world.” She gave her parents her A number, and they tried to reassure her.It’s just one or two days, they repeated to her.A horrible experience. But over soon.As soon as the call ended, Becky went on one of the detention centre iPads, which had apps allowing inmates to send messages to Ice and check the balance on their inmate account. “I sent a message to Ice straight away saying: ‘I am a tourist. I was just backpacking. I have not outstayed my visa. I’ve only been in America one month and two weeks. I don’t know why I’m here. I want to go home. Please can you help?’”She frantically refreshed the app to see if her account had been credited. (It took longer than expected, because funds can only be transferred into accounts for “illegal aliens” from within the US. Becky’s father, Paul, discovered he could only do it through an American friend.) “I was seeing no money arrive, and I was getting really upset thinking I told them the wrong A number.”As she sobbed holding the iPad, Becky found herself surrounded by other inmates who wanted to comfort her. A woman called Lucy offered to let Becky use her phone credit if money hadn’t appeared in the account within a few hours. Rosa, a Mexican woman who spoke barely any English and had already been detained for 11 months, offered Becky a Pot Noodle she had been able to buy from the commissary, the shop where they could purchase luxuries. At 8am, Becky finally curled up in her bed to sleep, with Rosa praying in Spanish in the bunk below.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Wake-up time was 5.30am. Breakfast – which for Becky was cold potato and a sachet of peanut butter, the only vegan option – was at 6am. Lunch – black beans and more cold potato – was anytime between 11.30am and 2pm. Four times a day, inmates had to sit on their bunks for an hour so they could be counted by staff. Dinner frequently arrived after 8pm. They were often ravenous between meals, which was why the commissary was so vital. It was also the only place they could access shampoo, deodorant, nail clippers and anti-shank toothbrushes.On her first day in the facility, Becky asked for a scrap of paper and a pen, and began to draw the inmates on the table next to her. She was immediately inundated with portrait requests. A Mexican woman called Lopez, who had a photo of her children stored on one of the iPads, told Becky she would buy her some paper and colouring pencils from the commissary if Becky drew her kids. She soon became the dorm’s unofficial artist-in-residence, with women huddling around the dirty mirrors to make themselves look presentable before they sat for her. They would decorate their cells with Becky’s drawings, or send them to their families. Lopez declared herself Becky’s manager. “She kept saying, ‘Becky, you need to ask for stuff in exchange. Ask for popcorn.’ And I’d be like, ‘Lopez, I don’t need anything.’ I thought, I’m here briefly, you’re stuck here a long time. I’m not going to take your food away from you.”The majority of the women were from Latin American countries, but some were from India, China, Iran, Afghanistan and Gaza. “Most of them were asylum seekers, but there was this handful of new people who had come in recently who did not know why they were here.” Lewelyn joined the dorm a few days after Becky. She had just returned from visiting her family in the Philippines; she had been living in the US since 1976, working as a lab technician at the University of Washington hospital’s cancer centre. “She’d had a visa issue that had been resolved many years ago, but now it was flagging on the system again.” Kseniia, a Russian woman who had been working for two years in a California nail salon, had permission to work in the US but was handcuffed while waiting for her husband to come out of an Ice interview. “She was so confused. She kept saying to me, ‘I’ve got a work permit.’”View image in fullscreenBurke’s sketches of some of her fellow detainees.Illustration: RE BurkeThere were other tourists, too. Bana, from Romania, was on holiday in Canada and visited Peace Arch park, on the international boundary between the US and Canada. She told Becky she had been taking selfies with her husband when a US border official told her they had strayed into American territory without the right visa and took her into custody.Becky had arrived in the detention centre on a Thursday. She soon realised she would not be out of it before the end of the weekend. No one ever replied to the message she sent to Ice on the iPad; she found out the Ice officer assigned to her case had gone on annual leave. The following Monday, Paul contacted the Foreign Office in London, and the British consulate in San Francisco. “They were doing the diplomatic bit,” he tells me. “But, after seven days, I could see it wasn’t really working. My perception is the British consulate couldn’t get Ice people to respond to them. There was no end in sight.”After Becky had been incarcerated for more than 10 days, Paul decided to go to the media. A quiet, unassuming man, he found himself live on Newsnight, Sky News and Good Morning Britain. Becky made it to every national newspaper in the UK, and had coverage in US press, too. Hours after her story broke, she was visited by an Ice officer who told her she was now “at the top of the pile” to be processed. Four days later, on a Thursday, another Ice officer came to the facility to tell Becky her flight had been booked for the following Monday.Becky’s face began to appear in the newspapers they received at the facility. At one point, her face flashed up on one of the three TV screens they had in her dorm. “Everyone clapped. After that, a few people came up to me and said, ‘Can you put me on TV, too?’” She feels very guilty that she was able to leave. “I was aware that it was from a major position of privilege that the press listened to this story. I was a British tourist, I had these images of my trip on Instagram, and I had contacts with journalists, so I was very lucky. And I wanted the same thing that Ice wanted, which was for me to go home.”At lunchtime on 17 March, officers came into the dorm, barked Becky’s name and told her to get ready to go. She had hidden some of her drawings among her official paperwork – her signed transcript and the document declaring her an illegal alien – in the hope she could smuggle them out. She wasn’t allowed to tell her family she was on her way home, but one of the women offered to ring her parents to notify them. Becky was shackled at the ankles, wrists and waist, and then made to shuffle out into a van.“When I got close to the airport, I felt really relieved and also overwhelmed, watching people with their suitcases, people going on holiday. It was a bit like whiplash – reality whiplash. Did that just happen?”But her ordeal was not over. She was taken to the basement of Seattle-Tacoma international airport for a security check. While every item in her bag was swabbed and dismantled, she was subjected to a full body search. “I was in this very loud, weird, industrial space with pipes and conveyor belts and lights and sirens, being told to open my legs. I was silently crying, watching all my stuff being torn apart as someone else was searching every crevice of me.” She boarded the plane before any of the other passengers. “I found my seat, threw my bags on it, and went into the toilet and sobbed in the cubicle, with the British Airways classical music surrounding me.”Six days after she landed at Heathrow, Becky still sleeps with her lamp on. She is enjoying home-cooked food and long showers, but feels guilty for resting in comfort when she knows her friends are still incarcerated. “I’m thinking of them every day,” she tells me. She is working on a comic that will tell the story of what happened to her, and the women she shared 19 days with, based on the drawings, notes and official documents she managed to take out of the detention centre.She is advising anyone planning to travel to the US not to go. ‘First, because of the danger of what could happen to you. And, secondly, do you really want to give your money to this country right now?’Becky still doesn’t know why she was incarcerated for so long. She suspects it might be because Ice is simply overwhelmed. “Maybe border security have been pressured to prove they’re stepping up.” She shrugs. “It did feel like they wanted to get me from the moment I was walked to the American side.” On 4 March, theWhite House issued a statementcelebrating how “Ice arrests of illegal immigrants havesurged627%” during Trump’s first month in office.Jasmine Mooney, aCanadian woman who was detained by Ice for two weeks, says while the private companies who own the facilities are run for profit, there’s no incentive to get people out quickly. But in the era of Elon Musk’s department of government efficiency (Doge), it seems counterintuitive for public money to be deliberately wasted on detaining illegal aliens with the will and means to return home.Trump’s border tsar, Tom Homan,promised “shock and awe”from day one of his administration.Perhaps Becky’s incarceration was political theatre – or performative cruelty. Whatever the reason, in Trump’s America, a tourist who makes a mistake can be locked up, seemingly indefinitely.The deportation paper Becky signed bans her from the US for the next 10 years. Paul tells me they are going to try to appeal it, but Becky says America isn’t the country she thought it was. Her advice to anyone planning to travel to the US is simply not to go. “First, because of the danger of what could happen to you. And, secondly, do you really want to give your money to this country right now?”She has emerged from the experience with new eyes. “I was naive to think that what was going on in the world, or at the border, wouldn’t affect me,” she tells me, her arms folded across her chest. She had believed if she was honest and acted in good faith she would be insulated from harm, but now thinks that might have been naive, too. “If I’d lied, I’d be on holiday in Canada right now.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationCanadafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Staff at Heartlands Auto Centre inBirminghamhave repaired about 15 cars with chewed battery cables in the past week. The rats are drawn to the warmer cars at night, he says – rats gnaw to keep their teeth a manageable length.Sadiq would be much happier to go without the extra business if the inner city streets of Small Heath and Alum Rock were not strewn with bin bags and overflowing wheelie bins – because Birmingham city council’s refuse collectors have been on strikefor nearly four weeks. “Why should we be dragging our bins across Birmingham?” Sadiq says. “The whole council from top to bottom should be fired. We’re not in a third world country. We’re in England.”His views, and those of many Brummies who blame the council, seem to have spooked Labour in the buildup to England’s local election campaign, and sparked a row between Keir Starmer and trade unionUnite.Downing Street said the union should “focus on negotiating in good faith” and “drop their opposition”, prompting Unite’s general secretary, Sharon Graham, to hit back saying it was “not surprising that many workers in Britain question the Labour government’s commitment to working people” for blaming bin workers for the dispute. Angela Rayner held a summit on Saturday night with council leaders to try to solve the crisis.How did it come to this? Superficially, the strike is about the council’s plan to scrap the role of waste recycling and collection officer (WRCO). It wants to save money. Unite wants to save jobs.But that’s as simplistic as saying the first world war was caused by the killing of an archduke. This is the second Birmingham bin strike, and its roots lie in the first Birmingham bin strike of 2017, as well as a landmark ruling over equal pay still sending shockwaves through British industry, and a decade of underfunded local government.Back in 2017, the refuse collectors went on strike, also over plans to cut jobs, and bin bags built up for seven weeks. It ended with a classic fudge – some working conditions would change, and the council would create the role of WRCO.Each waste lorry in Birmingham has a driver and three workers at the back who collect bins and empty them into the cart.Two are loaders, grade-two jobs, and one is a WRCO, a grade-three job, paid up to £8,000 more, for extra responsibilities such as collecting data on a tablet, nicknamed the “slab in the cab”.The problem, as lawyers successfully argued at an employment tribunal, was that these extra responsibilities didn’t really exist. The tablet disappeared within a week. This was simply “job enrichment” – a way for the council to pay some of the men more, to resolve the strike under cover of bureaucracy.View image in fullscreenBirmingham council refuse collectors on strike in the city on March 3.Photograph: Sonja HorsmanThose lawyers were Leigh Day, acting on behalf of women working in council roles that didn’t get those kinds of perks – traditionally female-dominated functions such as teaching assistants, cleaners and caterers.The WRCO job was used as a comparable by Leigh Day to demonstrate that the council discriminated against women in favour of men. Even worse, Birmingham had created the WRCO role five years after it had lost a landmark equal pay claim in 2012, when it had given bonuses to refuse collectors and street cleaners but not to cleaners and caterers. By 2023, it had paid out £1.1bn in a series of compensation claims, and that year effectively went bankrupt. Other similar claims have been lodged against Next, Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons and the Co-op.Last December, Birmingham settled this new claim, brought by GMB and Unison, and agreed in principle to pay a £250m settlement to 6,000 women. The final details are still being worked out and the council is trying to prevent further claims by changing its employment practices – hence the scrapping of the WRCO which led to this year’s strike.“This is an issue that’s dogged this council for years,” said John Cotton, Birmingham’s leader since 2023. Successive administrations had failed to “eliminate the injustice” he said, “and clearly, if we don’t follow the right processes and procedures relating to pay grading, then we risk opening up a future liability.”Fixing the problems could mean levelling up pay for the teaching assistants, the cleaners and the caterers, but given Birmingham’s financial problems, adding millions to the payroll is not an option for Cotton.The Labour leader insisted the council was not levelling down. It had made a “very fair and reasonable” offer to the refuse workers “which means nobody needs to lose any pay”. He said “everyone who’s affected” had been offered alternative roles, either as street cleaners on the same grade, or an option to become a driver on a higher grade. Others could take voluntary redundancy or have their pay protected for six months.But Unite’s national lead officer, Onay Kasab, said in fact some workers would lose up to £8,000 in pay cuts. “Not everyone can retrain as a driver,” he said; reversing out of a narrow cul-de-sac is not an easy task.“We know there aren’t enough vacancies so people will train, then go down to a grade two until a vacancy comes up.”And Kasab was sceptical that any loader taking on a street cleaner’s job would stay on the same pay. “If you’re reducing a loader’s pay, it’s not going to be long before you reduce a street cleaner’s pay too. So it’s a disingenuous offer.”Morale seemed solid on the picket line at the Atlas depot in Tyseley on Thursday, where the strikers had been disrupting the council’s attempts to use agency workers to clear the rubbish mountain by walking slowly in front of each bin lorry as it left the depot, delaying their rounds by two hours or more. The next day, police were asked to step in and the lorries were able to move freely.For workers such as Wayne Bishop, a 58-year-old who has worked in all weathers for the past 15 years, collecting potentially dangerous waste including needles and medical equipment, gas bottles and electrical goods, it seems wrong to ask them to pay for the council’s previous mistakes.“If we’re demoted and we lose £600 a month it’s taking a big section out of our money,” he says. “They just put it on us. The council has left us with no other option. All we want is fair pay for a fair day’s work.”Explore more on these topicsBirminghamThe ObserverIndustrial actionWasteTrade unionsHealthUniteLocal politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her two daughters, two and seven years old, her husband and their domestic worker, were all inside a six-storey hotel in Mandalay, centralMyanmar, when it collapsed.Delays to search operations have added to her agony. Hnin rushed around the devastated city, where communication lines were barely functioning, to buy head-torches and fuel for poorly equipped teams. A hotel manager refused to allow the use of a digger, fearing the building would collapse. Days passed before Chinese and Russian rescue teams arrived.“How can I sleep? When I wake in the middle of the night, I feel as if my tears have run out. I can’t cry any more,” said Hnin.She stands outside the building, calling her husband’s name, hoping for his reply, and makes offerings to spirits, praying for her family’s safety.0:57Myanmar: earthquake destroys temple and collapses bridge amid widespread damage – videoAt Mandalay general hospital, a short drive away, doctors have barely slept.

Some have moved furniture outside, and sleep in tents marked with their apartment number.Aidhas started to arrive, but residents, especially outside the cities, say it is not enough. Clean water, food and medicines are desperately needed. Many are still trapped beneath buildings, the smell of decaying bodies spreading.How will Myanmar’s earthquake impact the civil war? – podcastRead moreAccording to the military junta which rules the country, the earthquake has killed 3,100 people. The real death toll and the true scale of destruction is yet to emerge. And across Myanmar, the immediate shock at the disaster is morphing into questions abouthow the country can ever rebuild.It is expected that urban centres will have to be razed and reconstructed almost entirely. But it remains unclear how the country’s embattled and isolated military will afford to rebuild. Doing so will cost billions of dollars, and it has no access to international finance, nor the legitimacy needed to secure money from the World Bank or Asian Development Bank, say analysts.It is also unclear how the earthquake might affect the country’s conflict and political crisis. Myanmar has been gripped by a widespread uprising against junta rule since the generals seized power in a coup in 2021. The military is widely reviled by the public and has lost control of vast areas of the country’s borders.View image in fullscreenPeople sleep in makeshift shelters by the railway track in Amarapura township.Photograph: ReutersDesperately trying to cling to power, it continued airstrikes against its opponent for days, even after asking for international aid. The military finally agreed to pause fighting until later this month, though many fear the bombing will continue as soon as international attention has shifted.The main cities devastated by Friday’s quake are under military control. Some have speculated that it is perhaps because Naypyidaw, the junta’s seat of power, was among the places badly affected that the military made a rare request for international assistance.The capital, purpose-built by the paranoid and secretive generals in the 2000s, was supposed to be an impenetrable fortress. Its grandiose buildings include a presidential palace surrounded by a moat.View image in fullscreenDamage in Naypyidaw, the capital.Photograph: Sai Aung Main/AFP/Getty ImagesFriday’s quake, however, caused destruction. Government employees’ housing collapsed, trapping families. The supreme court has collapsed, ministry, parliament and hospital buildings are either totally or partly destroyed, and pagodas toppled. The palace’s spiral staircase and chandelier were destroyed.0:56Myanmar earthquake: man pulled alive from rubble after five days – video“There’s no transparency,” said John*, a worker for the transport ministry, of the death toll in the capital, asking not to give his real name. “Most of the deaths were among family members, including elders, children and wives of government employees.”In the aftermath of the quake, the junta chief, Min Aung Hlaing, acknowledged that some buildings had been built “carelessly”, but boasted that there was “absolutely no deviation, falling down” of the Great Maravijaya Buddha statue and its throne – a pagoda widely seen as a vanity project of the leader, who tries to represent himself as a protector of Buddhism and is known to be highly superstitious.The extent of damage to military facilities in Naypyidaw is not known.View image in fullscreenPagodas have been toppled, with court, ministry, parliament and hospital buildings also destroyed in Naypyidaw.Photograph: Nyein Chan Naing/EPAThe quake will undoubtedly be a blow to the morale of Min Aung Hlaing’s ground troops, say analysts. Ye Myo Hein, a global fellow at the Wilson Center, said he believed many soldiers had been unable to get in touch with their family members, not just in Naypyidaw but also in other parts of the country that were heavily affected by the earthquake, because of the communication outages.In the aftermath of the quake, the junta’s propaganda machinery had been working relentlessly to boost morale, he added, “portraying its soldiers as the nation’s saviours”.The UN human rights office, however, accused the military on Friday of limiting critically needed aid. Volunteers, the backbone of relief efforts,report that they are being blockedby soldiers, especially when trying to enter opposition or contested areas.View image in fullscreenPart of the emergency department of a major hospital in Naypyidaw was destroyed.Photograph: Sebastien Berger/AFP/Getty ImagesEven in areas under military control, such as Mandalay, soldiers have been notably absent from relief efforts.It is possible this is because the military simply doesn’t have the manpower. “Most of the troops are tied down, desperately defending bases and territory across the country,” said Richard Horsey, a senior adviser for Myanmar for Crisis Group. Even when the military sought to respond, its priorities were often misplaced, he added.In Naypyidaw, John was still required to go to work to help with a train building project the day after the earthquake, even though his house had collapsed and the entire city was in a state of crisis. Min Aung Hlaing is “crazy about this train”, said John, who sleeps in his workplace.View image in fullscreenInternational aid is yet to reach many people in Sagaing, by the Irrawaddy River, where the Inwa Bridge collapsed.Photograph: Sai Aung Main/AFP/Getty ImagesOthers are in a worse position, especially in Sagaing where international aid is still yet to reach many.“Out of the earthquake-hit areas of the city, only about 30% of the city’s population receives assistance,” estimated U Nyo*, 64, a shopkeeper. “There is no one to help in the suburbs and other areas outside Sagaing. There is a lot of need for food, drinking water, and medical assistance.”His two-storey family home was destroyed, he said.

I was born into the sound. My dad [radio presenter John Peel] used to make these mixtapes. We had three TDK 90s and we would drive around France in our battered, crappy Peugeot 505 estate, travelling the world musically through these cassettes.As teenagerswe used to get called crusties – we had long hair. It was that grunge era, early 90s. And then rave culture started and me and my friends got really into hardcore and jungle, and we got called ravers, but as an insult. I look back at that with great pride.I always wanteda shell suit, but my mum wouldn’t let me have one, because they were highly flammable.It’s a physical instinct,finding new music. It’s not conscious. I hear a noise – a bit like smelling something in the air you like – and I follow it on its journey to see what it does next.My dad would takeall four of us to festivals, then he would just disappear, and we’d be left to our own devices. We grew up running wild. This was before festivals were nice. There was no food, everyone was crapping outside, there were fires everywhere.I remember beingtaken to a Nirvana gig in London’s King’s Cross when I was very young and it being a terrifying experience. The whole family lived in my dad’s world, everything we did fitted around his work, we were his entourage. I was born into the radio community, and I’ve been in it ever since. People would stare at us, wanting to know: why is there a child here?Music was Dad’s thing– we felt we couldn’t be involved. But after he died I suddenly realised it’s what I wanted to do. I don’t know if I was filling a hole that was now in our lives. But I grabbed it and thought, I’m not going to let you go.I’m a domestic god.I do all the cooking, all the cleaning, all the laundry. My wife admitted the other day she’s never used the vacuum cleaner. I usually get back about one in the morning and before I go to bed, I put the first wash on.Life is pretty nuts,but when you throw four kids into it, too, it’s absolutely insane. I love the chaos of having four kids. I mean, frankly, I’d have more.I have the mostastonishingly bad memory. I don’t know any of my children’s or my wife’s birthdays. I don’t know any phone numbers. The advantage is that I can’t remember enough to regret anything.My dad drilled intohis children not to have any ambition, which at the time seemed fun, then later in life, we’re like, “Oh that’s not very useful!” There was almost no competition at all. There still isn’t.Dad was a verykind man and incredibly generous. Kindness was, for him, the most important thing. My brothers and sisters are all the same. We’re all sort of soft, slightly pathetic creatures.I’ll still be goingto festivals in my 80s. I mean, you go to some festivals and you’re like, this is nicer than my house. I miss the filth, to be honest.Tom Ravenscroft presentsNew Music FixDaily andThe Ravers Houron BBC Radio 6 MusicExplore more on these topicsRadioThis much I knowfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Their hand-milled batches now ready for whisking with hot water, they will soon be rewarded for their patience.The foreign tourists attending amatcha-making experience in Uji, near Kyoto in westernJapan, are united in their love of the powdered, bitter form of green tea the Japanese have been drinking for centuries, and which is now at the centre of a global boom.Made from the leaves of theCamellia sinensisplant and originally served, in highly stylised fashion, at formal tea ceremonies by masters ofsado– the way of tea – matcha is the flavour profile of the times, the must-have ingredient in everything from lattes and chocolates toice-creamand boiled sweets.Global matcha Japan mapAfter the lean years of the Covid-19 pandemic, businesses in Uji, a town known for deep historical ties to the matcha trade, are cashing in.Buoyed up byrecord levels of tourism to Japan, restaurants take the matcha theme to its culinary extreme:gyozaandtakoyakidrizzled in matcha-infused dressing, and bowls of “stamina” ramen topped with the chlorophyll-rich green stuff. Every cafe is packed on an overcast, drizzly afternoon, as are the family-run shops doing a roaring trade in packets of locally produced tea, colourfully decorated containers and matcha-themed confectionery.AtChazuna, a park and museum devoted to the town’s tea culture, matcha workshops are fully booked for the next fortnight. Of the 60 people a day who come to make, and then drink, their own tea, about 90% are from overseas.“We opened in 2021 and for the first two years we didn’t have many visitors,” says Chazuna’s director, Naoto Sakayori. “Then everything changed in March last year and, since August, interest has rocketed. It’s all about matcha, matcha. People think that if they come to Kyoto on holiday, then they absolutely have to come here for a matcha experience. And then everyone posts their photos and videos online.”Stephen Blackburn, a tourist from New York, was among the first to ride the matcha wave. “I have more or less stopped drinking coffee and now just drink matcha,” says Blackburn, a former barista who started drinking the Japanese pick-me-up eight years ago. “I like the taste and the way it makes me feel. It’s not like coffee. It doesn’t leave me agitated … it makes me more focused.”But some visitors to Uji are still not convinced. “To be honest, we don’t really like matcha,” says Henrik Hantel, who is honeymooning in Japan with his wife, Tessa. “We tried it in Germany several times and disliked it, but we thought Japanese matcha might be different … and it’s everywhere here, so we don’t have much choice but to try it in its traditional home. We’re going to give it one more go and hope we won’t be disappointed again.”View image in fullscreenA small matcha plantation near Chazuna, a park and museum celebrating Uji’s historical links to the trade in green tea.Photograph: Justin McCurry/The ObserverHowever, the global appetite for all things matcha is a double-edged sword. Reports of a shortage emerged last autumn, prompting tea companies in Kyoto to impose unprecedented purchase limits on the powder, which has been consumed in Japan since the 12th century after it was introduced by Buddhist monks from China.Soaring demand in Europe, the US and Australia has prompted warnings of further shortages this year. While consumption of leaf green tea and matcha is declining in Japan, the rest of the world can’t get enough, with the global market in matcha alone expected tosurgefrom $2.8bn [£2.2bn] in 2023 to about $5bn by 2028.According to the agriculture ministry, Japan produced 4,176 tonnes of matcha in 2023, almost three times the quantity in 2010. Keen to exploit the growing commercial potential, Japan’s government is reportedly planning subsidies to encourage growers to move away from traditional leaf tea, orsencha, and produce moretencha– tea for grinding – the type of leaf that produces matcha.Official campaigns to spread the word about matcha have been wildly successful. The tea promotion account onInstagram, run by the Japan Food Product Overseas Promotion Centre, has almost 50,000 followers.This year’s tea harvest, which will start this month, will replenish the matcha supply, but relief will be temporary. Overseas consumption “reached a record high last year”, Fumi Ueki, chief of the Leaf Brand Group, a department of Ito En, one of Japan’s largest tea companies, told theJapan Times.Inevitably, social media has been a driver of interest.Matcha contentis hard to avoid on TikTok, with users pointing to evidence of the health benefits of regular consumption of antioxidant-rich green tea, whose caffeine levels are slightly lower than those in coffee.While he has been taken aback by the levels of interest in matcha – Chazuna will soon host large groups of British visitors – Sakayori appreciates its aesthetic, even spiritual, appeal.“It’s not like drinking coffee or English tea,” he says. “It’s about more than the taste… drinking matcha is an experience.”The march of the brilliant-green powder continues, winning unlikely converts along the way, including Henrik and Tessa Hantel. “We decided to try matcha along with a dessert and, to be honest, it was the best experience we’ve had so far,” they wrote in an email after speaking to theObserver. “I still don’t think we’ll order it back in Germany but it was a happy way to end our matcha experience in Japan.”Explore more on these topicsTeaThe ObserverAsia PacificFoodJapanSupply chain crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

Can’t we just wait and see?Kate MaltbySat 5 Apr 2025 12.04 EDTLast modified on Sat 5 Apr 2025 12.38 EDTShareInI am The Walrus,John Lennon told us:“Man, you should have seen them kicking Edgar Allan Poe”.Lennon’s song, from the EPMagical Mystery Tour,is a two-fingered salute to academic efforts to impose an interpretative framework on the Beatles’ creativity.He wrote it after learning from a pupil at his ­former school that the English teacher was tasking boys with ­formal ­literary analysis of Beatles ­lyrics. Hence the reference to Poe, which follows hard on the ­incongruous image of a “semolina pilchard climbing up the Eiffel Tower”. “Let the fuckers work that one out, Pete!”, Lennon told former ­bandmate Pete Shotton.Did Lennon see himself as another Poe – one more Byronic poet picked apart by ­moralising ­critics and overinterpreted by ­obsessive fans? Or was that just another blind in a series of absurdist non-sequiturs, deliberately constructed to resist logical interpretation? To this day, Poe fans are among the most active literary ­communities online, hurling fury at actors ­including John Cusack and Harry Melling who have the nerve to ­portray their idol on screen.Yet even legacy sci-fi Poe fans have nothing on Beatles buffs. Last week, Sam Mendesunveiled the four actorschosen to play the Beatles in four interwoven biopics: Barry Keoghan as Ringo Starr, Paul Mescal as Paul McCartney, Harris Dickinson as John Lennon and Joseph Quinn as George Harrison. One hopes that Mendes ducked for cover or found a spot for some nice transcendental meditation until the fuss dies down.View image in fullscreenPaul McCartney, John Lennon, Ringo Starr and George Harrison in 1963.Photograph: THA/ShutterstockNone of the actors are from Liverpool, which isapparently a problem.Radio Timesargues that all four are too well known to portray iconic musicians without their own cultural associations. “It would take less suspension of disbelief with an unknown than it does to buy that the long-haired guitar player fromStranger Thingsis actually George Harrison,” writes the magazine’s Patrick Cremona.Two of the chosen actors are English, and two are Irish. This means that Mendes now stands accused of erasing the Beatles’ cultural heritage in two different ways.The Beatles furore is the latest in a cultural phenomenon that routinely sees movies torn apart online before they’ve even finished filming.Snow White, Disney’s recent $250m flop, was troubled early on by rows about the casting of Rachel Zegler, and the question of whether it was more offensive to actors with dwarfism to cast them exclusively as Snow White’s companions, or to replace them with CGI.Last week, images were leaked from the shoot of Emerald Fennell’s forthcoming adaptation of Emily Brontë’sWuthering Heights. Margot Robbie, who plays Catherine Earnshaw, has been seen in a white wedding dress, which has distressed self-proclaimed ­historical experts.View image in fullscreenMargot Robbie will play Catherine Earnshaw in Wuthering Heights.Photograph: Jordan Strauss/Invision/APHas Fennell committed a crime against period dress? EvenVoguefelt theneed to weigh in.Fennell’sWuthering Heightshas been under fire since it announced lead casting last September. Part of this was inevitable: a female artist such as Fennell, who is both hyper-talented and hyper-privileged, gets two successful films or albums before the envious backlash kicks in.It didn’t help that, in tacklingWuthering Heights,she was taking on one of the few classic novels to touch with nuance on race in 19th-century England – a nuance altogether lacking from the social media chat about ethnicity and casting.Robbie’s co-star is Jacob Elordi, a white, dark-haired actor who plays the adult incarnation of the outcast orphan Heathcliff. Brontë clearly wrote Heathcliff as a character who is ostracised in rural Yorkshire in part because he looks foreign to English eyes.In Andrea Arnold’s 2011 adaptation, Heathcliff was played by James Howson, the first actor of black heritage to take the role.To many racially conscious Brontë fans, including prominent American film critics, Fennell’s choice of a white actor felt like a step backwards. But what form Heathcliff’s “foreignness” takes is deliberately ambiguous in Brontë’s text. In a much-analysed line, one neighbour says Heathcliff could be “a little Lascar, or an American or Spanish castaway”. Arnold herself had originally searched for a Romany actor.All the text tells us for sure is that Heathcliff’s adoptive father claims to have found him on the streets of Liverpool. The city’s associations with the slave trade often suggest to contemporary readers that Heathcliff is the child of an enslaved African. That is entirely possible.But it is also possible he was the child of the seafaring Spanish and Basque community, established in Liverpool during the 19th century. One such prominent family was the Elordietas. They would have looked not unlike a certain Jacob Elordi, whose Basque father emigrated to Australia at the age of eight.When we assume that a dark-haired outsider must be of African origin, we let English racism off the hook. We forget how narrowly beauty standards defined “Englishness” to exclude even a hint of darker colouring. English chroniclers under the Tudors, keen to whip up anti-Spanish prejudice, would routinely accuse the Spanish population of being miscegenated with north African blood, attributing conventional Spanish dark looks to this ancestry. These attitudes were still around in Brontë’s day.Yet the rows consuming the Beatles,Snow WhiteandWuthering Heightsare part of a much bigger story than our limited view of English racism. They emerge because we are now consuming culture in a new way. The shift owes much to what academics term “participatory culture” – a fan experience exemplified by the rise of 21st-­century franchises such as Harry Potter andGame of Thrones,in which collectively interpreting clues is key to how fans theorise about the future plot twists. This should excite literary critics: hermeneutics is suddenly part of popular culture.But if we understand culture as a series of clues to uncover “the truth” of classic stories – even historical stories such as that of the Beatles – we also risk imposing our truths on adaptations before they’ve even had a chance to develop.Mendes and Fennell will be ripe for criticism when their films are released. If we can’t wait until then, let’s at least hold off until their films have wrapped. Without that grace, the process of art becomes a real-time exercise in damage control. Alternatively, like Lennon, the sharpest artists will attempt to resist interpretation completely.Explore more on these topicsThe BeatlesThe ObserverPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This large duplex, perched on the top two floors, is not just a home but a canvas where colour and creativity collide. With a fearless approach to bold hues, Tiphaine has transformed what was once a blank slate of plain white walls into a theatrical and inviting sanctuary.When Tiphaine first stepped into the apartment, it was a minimalist’s dream – or, as she might put it, a colour enthusiast’s nightmare. “All the walls were just plain white,” she recalls. But Tiphaine, an interior decorator and furniture designer, saw the potential in the apartment’s unique layout. “I was drawn to the fact that it felt like a house in the sky, with a clear separation between the day and night spaces.”View image in fullscreenThe dining room, with pink-onyx marble table by Les Causeaus, Tiphaine’s own interiors brand.Photograph: Ramona Balaban/Living InsideWith her keen eye and love for bold design, she wasted no time changing things. “I quickly took out my paintbrush and in just four months, the place was completely unrecognisable,” she says. The transformation was successful, but not without trial and error. “To my children’s despair, I painted the living room three times before being satisfied,” she admits.Tiphaine’s design philosophy centres around the emotional power of colour. “For me, colours are the best way to convey emotions and feelings,” she explains. “They are instruments to create singular and authentic environments.” Nowhere is this more evident than in her favourite space – the living room. “When I started thinking about this room, I really wanted a warm and cosy environment,” she says. The result is a harmonious blend of salmon pink and bright yellow, a daring yet comforting combination that envelops the room in warmth. The space feels like a perfect reflection of Tiphaine’s personality: playful, feminine and a tad nostalgic. It features fuchsia-pink armchairs byAlki, a coffee table with a sunken container in its centre by Italian designerWilly Rizzoand a Japanese chandelier fromHK Living. The curved floor lamp was a flea-market find.View image in fullscreenTiphaine Verdier in the living room, beneath the lamp she bought at a flea-market.Photograph: Ramona Balaban/Living InsideIn the adjacent dining room, the statement pink-onyx marble table is byLes Causeuses, Tiphaine’s own interiors brand, while the chairs are also by Willy Rizzo. The old but inviting sofa is a family heirloom from the 1950s, which Tiphaine spruced up by changing the fabric. Many of the pieces she has collected over the years are from hunting at flea markets, a favourite pastime.The kitchen houses a vintage Japanese cabinet that Tiphaine herself re-covered, and the striking flower painting is byMartin Jarry.View image in fullscreenA vintage Japanese cabinet ties the reds and greens of the room together.Photograph: Ramona Balaban/Living InsideIn the master bedroom, she has cultivated a homely, vintage vibe thanks to the bed linen, the painting (another flea-market find) and a 1930s floor lamp, with modern touches, such as the bedside lamps from Etsy and the large mirror by Les Causeuses.Having spent eight years in London, Tiphaine’s work is imbued with a touch of its style. “As a French expat in London, I definitely adopted British eccentricity as one of my signature themes,” she says. This influence is evident in her use of bold patterns and her embrace of eclectic, whimsical elements. “I applied my daring and typically British floral vocabulary to the creation of Les Causeuses to cheer up the interiors in Paris and beyond.”View image in fullscreenThe ‘homely, vintage vibe’ of the bedroom, with Les Causeuses mirror and floral bedding.Photograph: Ramona Balaban/Living InsideLes Causeuses is a celebration of both colour and craftsmanship. Specialising in vintage-inspired décor and furniture, the brand focuses on creating joyful environments and ethically produced pieces. Each item, which includes lamps, armchairs and cushions, is made in Portugal, blending what she calls “playful aesthetics” with high-quality materials.Tiphaine’s journey into interior design was almost predestined. “Brought up from an early age with museum visits, flea markets and antique book fairs, my career in creation was a natural choice,” she says. A graduate of Studio Berçot, she transitioned from fashion design to the study of art, a foundation that continues to inspire her work today. Her home reflects this rich background, with every corner showcasing her love for art and antiques. From the floral-patterned chairs to the vintage-inspired lighting, the space feels both curated and lived-in: a true expression of Tiphaine’s unique vision.For information, go tolescauseuses.frExplore more on these topicsInteriorsThe ObserverHomesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The site was uncovered in the 1950s on the Greek mainland at Mycenae, the legendary seat ofHomer’s King Agamemnon.Dr Emily Hauser, the historian who commissioned the digital reconstruction, told theObserver: “She’s incredibly modern. She took my breath away.“For the first time, we are looking into the face of a woman from a kingdom associated with Helen of Troy – Helen’s sister, Clytemnestra, was queen of Mycenae in legend – and from where the poetHomerimagined the Greeks of the Trojan war setting out. Such digital reconstructions persuade us that these were real people.”View image in fullscreenA 13th-century BC fresco from Mycenae.Photograph: Peter Eastland/AlamyHauser, a senior lecturer in classics and ancient history at the University of Exeter, said: “It is incredibly exciting to think that, for the first time since she was laid beneath the ground over 3,500 years ago, we are able to gaze into the actual face of a bronze age royal woman – and it truly is a face to launch a thousand ships.“This woman died around the beginning of the late bronze age, several hundred years before the supposed date of the Trojan war.”A digital artist, Juanjo Ortega G., has developed the lifelike face from a clay reconstruction of the same woman that was made in the 1980s by Manchester University, pioneers of one of the major methods in facial reconstruction.Hauser, whose bookMythica: A NewHistoryof Homer’s World, Through the Women Written Out of Itwill be published next week, said that technical developments in forensic anthropology and DNA analysis, as well as radiocarbon dating and 3D digital printing, have led to dramatic improvements in reconstructions of the ancient world.“We can – for the first time – peer back into the eyes of the past.”The woman had been buried with an electrum face mask and a warrior kit of weapons – including three swords that were assumed to be associated with the man buried next to her, but are now thought to have belonged to her.Hauser said: “The traditional story is that, if you have a woman next to a man, she must be his wife.” Facial similarities had previously been noted, but DNA has confirmed that these were brother and sister rather than husband and wife.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I can’t see my boys playing rugby and soccer, and it has been a very stressful time because I’m used to soaking it all up. It’s distressing.“You get emotional, but you have to get used to it because I’m lucky to have the life I have. I still have my wonderful family, and I can still see something out of here,” he said, pointing to his left eye.He added: “You say to yourself, just get on with it.”John has previously said his eye issues have affected his ability to record music and have left him feeling “stuck”.However, he recently recorded Who Believes In Angels?, a collaboration with the US singer Brandi Carlile, which involved working with the producer Andrew Watt and his long-term songwriting partner Bernie Taupin.Elton John and Brandi Carlile: Who Believes in Angels? review – a true meeting of mindsRead moreLast month, and before the album’s release on Friday, John and Carlile hosted an evening of performance and storytelling at the London Palladium.His headline set at Glastonbury in 2023 had previously been his last UK performance, as part of his 330-date Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour, which ended with an emotionally charged show in Stockholm, Sweden.John reflected on how he used to do “120 shows a year” but said having children had made him entirely shift his perspective.“I always said I wanted to die on stage,” he said. “Now I want my gravestone to read: ‘He was a great dad.’ My career has been wonderful, but the kids are what matters.”Reflecting on his career he said he was “riddled with music” and it was the “greatest gift” he had ever been given. “Here I am at 78, feeling better than I have ever been,” he said.Gesturing to his eyes, he added: “This is a bastard, but we’ll get over it. There is a lot more to do.”Explore more on these topicsElton JohnnewsShareReuse this content"

Recipients were invited to add their details to the list, send a letter to other signatories, and then pass the booklet on to someone new.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.“They were included in letters as a side thing,” Ryan-Punch, now 44, says. When it was full of potential pen pals, the friendship book would, hopefully, be returned to the person who made it. “I didn’t have anyone to send them on to, but I wrote to people out of them and that kind of grew into a circle.”When the first mail from my pen pal came, the excitement I felt was beyond reason | Anna SubletRead moreIt was the start of what would become a lifelong hobby. While email, social media and instant messages have replaced handwritten letters for most, the practice of “swapping” friendship books, or FBs, has not only persisted but blossomed into a stand-alone subculture, with its own vernacular, etiquette, rules and drama.Ryan-Punch’s first pen pals came through the now defunct International Youth Service (IYS), a Finnish company formed in 1952 that described itself as “devoted to the furthering of the cause of penfriendship … For, just to have a friend abroad is an education in itself.” IYS connected teens of the pre-internet generation with other hopeful pen pals of the same age around the world. FBs were a DIY way of doing the same thing, and pen pals who found each other through the IYS often found themselves recipients of FBs, too. After a while, many began making and swapping FBs for their own sake.View image in fullscreen‘Swappers’ send handmade, highly decorated booklets including stickers, labels and lists of likes and dislikes to strangers by post, who eventually – hopefully – send them back.Photograph: Eugene Hyland/The GuardianFBs are creations as varied as the hands they pass through, ranging from compact “nice and neat” constructions (N&Ns) to elaborately decorated productions (decos), allowing each swapper a whole page on which to express themselves. “High-quality” FBs (HQs) fall somewhere in the middle. There are mini quizzes (slams, or “silly little answering machines”) and tightly packed single sheets (crams) with space for addresses only.Alongside FBs, swappers also trade stickers, labels, postage stamps, notepaper and other nick-nacks through the post. Ryan-Punch shares a sticker bag with instructions: “Take out any 4 stickers. Put in 8 new ones (NO tiny) and your [address] label. Sign and date. Signer #6 please send home to owner or any ICR [a signatory who has indicated “I can return” finished items to the maker].” Label bags work similarly, but recipients put in their own address labels and send or make items for those whose labels they take out.We are generally all stationery addicts – that’s a common themeAnna Ryan-PunchRyan-Punch, a librarian, now writes to about 20 people and swaps with the same. With so much incoming and outgoing post, she has had to develop a filing system to keep track of who swaps what, who sent what when, and to whom she has responded.“We are generally all stationery addicts – that’s a common theme,” she says. She collects washi tape and stickers and uses them to decorate her swaps. “I like the craft activity with no pressure. It doesn’t really involve word processing, so it’s a break from reading or writing letters as a leisure activity.”Charlene, 54, a swapper who spoke to Guardian Australia but asked that her surname not be published, got her first pen pals through an ad in an American crochet magazine when she was 28. Naturally crafty, when FBs started accompanying her pen pals’ letters, she fell in love with them. She most enjoys decos, embellishing them with scrapbooking paper, stickers, washi tape, lace, ribbon, or anything else she has on hand. “They’re basically little art collage books,” she says.Charlene connects with new swappers on internet forums and Facebook groups. Strict standards attend some of these: one, for instance, says N&Ns must have no visible staples or binding on the front cover and be embellished with multiple decorative elements. LQs, or “low-quality” FBs, are seen as lazy. People who keep FBs that weren’t made by or for them, who steal stickers, slice the decorations off other swappers’ labels to use as their own barter, or who “send crap” are blacklisted.View image in fullscreen‘I’m really bad at answering emails … I want to receive a letter and write back in a month or so.’ Anna now writes to about 20 people and swaps with the same.Photograph: Eugene Hyland/The Guardian“The unspoken rule is that you play fair,” Charlene says. “If it says ‘take two, add five’, you take two, add five. Or if you don’t want to take any, you add three. There are some people out there that don’t play fair. But I always put something in there that I’d like to receive.”Charlene has no idea how many people she swaps with now. Sometimes, she says, she sends so many FBs and goodie bags at once that the parcels weigh up to 5kg.‘Something to believe in, even if it’s deeply silly’: why 15,000 people signed up to a letter-writing projectRead moreIn what appears to be the sole academic article published on swapping, German researcher Anja Löbert claims friendship books are an innovation of Take That fans in the 1990s. Devotees of the British pop group used FBs to find other fans globally with whom they could swap photos, posters, videos and other memorabilia.Ryan-Punch, whose early swapping intersected with this fandom, remembers the illicit trade in Take That memorabilia – in particular, a photo-developing shop in central Melbourne that bought and sold bootleg fan photos under the counter. “You had to shuffle in and be like, ‘Have you got Take That photos?’ and they’d produce baskets from under the desk for us to flip through and buy,” she says.But while Take That fans made prolific use of FBs, they did not invent them. FBs were circulating at least as early as the 1980s, well before the group’s establishment.Kate Denton received her first FB at 13 in 1988. She was already writing to 50 people worldwide since a local teen magazine published her request for pen pals when she was just 11. These days, she only writes letters to four, but she swaps with 35 others around the world.“I’ve always loved writing, playing with pretty paper and that sort of thing,” says Denton. “I’m a paper crafter at heart – I make cards, and I do scrapbooking.” Swapping is another way for her to indulge in those loves, she says. “It’s just something fun to do that brings a smile to your face instead of getting bills in the mail.”I’ve always loved writing, playing with pretty paper and that sort of thingKate DentonIs this why swapping has persisted, even after the internet sounded a death knell for so much handwritten mail?Its persistence also seems at least partly generational nostalgia. The IYS closed in 2008, citing a lack of youth interest in letter-writing, yet its influence on earlier generations was profound. Few traces of it remain online, save for a handful of nostalgic blog posts, but when its archives were sold by a Finnish auction house in 2010, one single lot contained 5m envelopes in 7200 boxes, weighing 25,000kg.The sale came to the attention of an American philatelist, who wrote in a breathless circular: “They kept the incoming mail! Not only did they keep it, but they sorted it by country into boxes. Even better, they kept the covers [envelopes] in the boxes in incoming date order. And then they marked the boxes with the country name and dates of the covers within.” The entire haul was bought by a stamp collector in Africa, and many of the envelopesstill show up on eBay, often with stamps of Australian origin.View image in fullscreenWhile email, social media and instant messages have replaced handwritten letters for most, swapping has blossomed into a stand-alone subculture, with its own vernacular, etiquette, rules and drama.Photograph: Eugene Hyland/The GuardianFor some swappers, FBs are still a route to longhand letters. Signatories mark their names and addresses with acronyms like LLPW (“long letter pals wanted”), NSW/NPW (“new swappers wanted/new pen pals wanted”), A/A (“answer all”). Some add extra stipulations – “no prisoners please” is an unexpectedly common one. Charlene says she corresponded with inmates in United States jails until one revealed that pen pal addresses were bought and sold.Swappers are often shy about what they do for fear of being mocked – Denton says she and her model-train building husband bonded early over their “unique hobbies” – but Ryan-Punch happily posts pictures of her colourful mail on social media. “I like seeing where they go around the world and how long they take to come back. Sometimes, they never come back.”Handiwork: ‘The act of writing a letter changes the way you communicate completely’Read moreHandwritten letters still hold a unique appeal for her, which she surmises is because they narrow her focus and allow for thought and reflection in a way that social media and email don’t. “It’s like journaling but better,” she says. “I’m really bad at answering emails. There’s something about the immediacy of it that I don’t like. I want to receive a letter and write back in a month or so.”She has never worried much about her address circulating among strangers by post. “When I started, we were all in the White Pages anyway.”Explore more on these topicsHobbiesFriendshipCraftAustralian lifestylefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now she’s back with a show about motherhood in her 40s – but don’t expect any cute parenting storiesSat 5 Apr 2025 06.55 EDTShareMy favouriteSara Pascoejoke is her imaginary riposte to people asking if she’s going to have kids. They mean well, these prying parents – they just don’t want her to miss out on a life-enhancing experience. The thing is, the comedian has had some life-enhancing experiences of her own. “But I have never, ever said to anybody: ‘Oh, have you been on QI? Ahhh, you should go on QI!’” she insists, settling into her archly patronising pep talk. “No I didn’t think I wanted to be on QI until I wasonQI, and then it was like I looked back and my entire life had been leading up to me being on QI. Yes it’sverytiring being on QI, but it’s so worth it. I just wouldn’t want you to leave it too late and they’ll have stopped making it!”As a skewering of smug, insensitive acquaintances foisting their own ideas of fulfilment on a child-free woman in her 30s, it’s a gratifyingly clever joke. In reality, however, Pascoe wasn’t laughing. During the period she was doing that routine on stage, she was actually “quite sad about not being able to have children”, she says over coffee in a north London cafe near her home. She’d long suspected she had fertility issues after unsuccessfully trying for a baby with an ex-boyfriend.“So I wanted to pre-empt the audience feeling sad for me. I didn’t want to admit the vulnerability of: it looks like I’m not going to have children. Or even – after Igot married to Steen[Raskopoulos, who is also a comedian] – my husband wants children and I don’t think we’re going to be able to have them, because that felt so raw. Instead I was like: ugh, children – stupid bastards!”Things couldn’t be more different now. Pascoe did have fertility issues, but thanks to IVF is now “completely flattened and eroded by having two children in two years in my 40s”. This – to my delight as a fellow depleted mother – is the subject of her new tour, I Am a Strange Gloop. The title is a play on I Am a Strange Loop, philosopher Douglas Hofstadter’s book about the formation of the self, as well as a reference to the stage of butterfly metamorphosis when caterpillars’ bodies melt into goo. Before our interview, I watch her relay this information to Rylan and Scott Mills during a BBC video segment, but Pascoe’s trademark erudition is utterly lost on the pair, who side-eye each other in camp incomprehension. “That was the first time I ever described the tour. I remember thinking: well, don’t say all that again!” she laughs. “Obviously I adore him, but Rylan’s little face was like: what babe?”View image in fullscreenJust kidding … Sara Pascoe performing on Live at the Apollo earlier this year.Photograph: Ben Gregory-Ring/BBC/Optomen TVPascoe’s fans will understand. Over the past decade, the 43-year-old has achieved household name status by delivering bracingly confessional comedy with a scholarly twist, extrapolating brilliant observations about humanity from her reading on biology, sociology and anthropology (she’s also the author of two heavily researched nonfiction books,AnimalandSex Power Money). Combined with a breathless, just-let-me-finish-this-thought delivery, Pascoe’s persona is quirky and a bit dorky. Yet this doesn’t translate into real-life awkwardness. In fact, she’s so easy to talk to that at times the interview strays dangerously close to a fully reciprocal conversation.You don’t feel like: I’m going to write some genius jokes, after you’ve been wiping up sweet potato all dayThat’s partly because Pascoe is as unguarded in person as she is on stage: she immediately admits, for instance, to having second thoughts about that tour title. When she came up with the name, the strains of motherhood were drowning out her sense of self, so “rather than calling it something like ‘I’m having a breakdown, please come and laugh’” she went with some intellectual wordplay. A better title, she thinks now, would be hypnagogia, the term for that kaleidoscopic state between sleep and waking. Another of the show’s themes is “what happens to your brain if all of your thinking is done at night-time. I find that memories that come up at night are really different, and things are very emotionally raw. I’m doing standup about stuff like Paula Radcliffe doing a poo in the marathon, because I suddenly started thinking about it all the time at night – I’m still processing it 19 years later.”There is a reason Pascoe is doing so much nocturnal musing. Well, two. Her three-year-old is being “bribed massively” with Paw Patrol toys to stay in his bed. “But every night he decides it’s not worth it and comes in to chat.” Her 18-month-old’s sleep is touch and go due to “turbo teething, where his teeth come through in clusters”. He also wakes up at three in the morning demanding a bottle.I feel slightly guilty about rubbernecking at Pascoe’s sleep deprivation, which is significantly worse than my own. But then that is precisely the appeal of comedy about parenthood: it acts as a form of consolation for those with children and – Pascoe believes – those without. She sees her current role as “the opposite to an influencer” for people struggling to decide whether to have kids. “I’m a putter-offerer. I think, how great to have someone make you go: no, no, no – looks rubbish!”View image in fullscreenMum’s the word … Sara Pascoe.Photograph: Alexandra CameronFor those who have already taken the plunge, Pascoe is here with all the relatable domestic drudgery material. “I know no one likes housework, but I’m affronted by the amount of washing and wiping up I have to do. I’m trying to write a bit about Sisyphus” – whose punishment from the gods in Greek mythology involved him eternally pushing a boulder up a hill, only for it to roll back down when he approached the summit – “and how actually he’s really lucky: he’s outdoors, he’s buff, he doesn’t have a husband dropping his shoes in front of the rock.”Cleaning up after children means doing the “same thing over and over again. And it’s not good for your brain. You don’t feel like: I’m going to write some genius jokes, after you’ve been wiping up sweet potato all day. So the world is giving us these mixed messages of: go out, express yourself, live your life to its full potential, but the drudgery is this unfair tax on it. Who’s going to do that? Either I do it or I pay another woman to do it. It does have to be part of the discussion. Even if it’s just whinging to feel better about it – I don’t have a solution!”When we meet, Pascoe is about to travel to Australia for a series of shows (yes the whole family are coming, and yes she expects the flight to be “24 hours of hell”). That will be followed by a 52-date UK tour – a run that cements her position as one of the most in-demand comics in the country. It’s quite an achievement for someone who didn’t grow up with a knack for performance. Born in Dagenham and raised in Romford, Pascoe vividly recalls deciding she wanted to be an actor aged 12, but she was far from a natural. “I wasn’t shy, but I want to say the word frigid, if that makes sense? Like physically not good at expressing myself. I had none of the skills needed for acting.” Her motivation was solely affirmation. “Even by that age, I didn’t feel very cool or popular. And I realised that you could get a lot of attention for pretending to be someone else.”She wasn’t making people laugh, either – according to her mother, at least. “My mum loves to tell people: ‘She wasn’t funny as a child and she’s not funny now.’ But she means in real life, not on stage.”View image in fullscreenFunny business … Pascoe and her husband, Steen Raskopoulos.Composite: Getty Images/SuppliedPascoeisfunny in person and on stage – yet she’s more than happy to admit that her path to fame has been almost surreally smooth. So smooth, in fact, that during her previous show,2022’s Success Story, she posited the theory that she was actually “in an asylum, doing all this to the wall. And the nurse is like: ‘Oh, that’s nice, she’s at one of her gigs again.’” Success “felt like mental illness because I wanted stuff and then it happened to me and it felt like: how can this actually be true?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Well, I write 20 words a dayThese days, Pascoe is unpicking her luck with more logic. She started doing standup on a whim – initially as character comedy, viewing it as acting-adjacent – despite having barely witnessed any before. “I was arrogant. I think if I’d actually seen the masters of their craft I would have known my place. Instead, I was having a glass of wine and going out with the energy of a mad woman at a bus stop.” She was, however, “really, really, really addicted from the beginning”, finding the idea of commanding a packed room with opinions and a microphone far less intimidating than walking into a pub on a Friday night as a punter (it’s a comedian thing).Serendipitously, this was 2007, a time when women were hugely underrepresented in comedy and the industry was “desperate for them”. This meant female comics “were constantly getting recommended for gigs” which created a fast track to success. It was also the brief era – now over – when the glut of panel shows meant you could earn good money and better exposure as a comedian on TV. Pascoe marvels at the fact that all her peers from her early days on the circuit – including Josh Widdicombe, James Acaster, Katherine Ryan and Ed Gamble – have found mainstream success: “Everyone I knew from that time is famous now.”Yet as her profile skyrocketed, Pascoe struggled to hone her skills quickly enough to keep up. Just a few years into her career, she was asked to appear on the BBC’s flagship standup show, Live at the Apollo; immediately afterwards she did a small Edinburgh preview show where “nobody laughed at me for an hour. I remember thinking: crikey, should I do Apollo? And I thought, do you want to be the worst person who’s ever done Live at the Apollo, or not do Live at the Apollo? I’d rather be the worst person. And so you have to make your peace with it.”View image in fullscreenRoar power … Pascoe on her Animal tour in 2016.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianI find it impossible to believe the hyper-thoughtful and always entertaining Pascoe is the least funny person in Live at the Apollo history – but brutal self-deprecation is her default mode (“I’ve never let being bad at things stop me doing them,” she says at one point, “which is how I’ve had a career”). She seems similarly sanguine about abandoned projects, including a nonfiction book about murder, which her publishers decided was a project for a criminologist rather than “a clown”. She is, however, working on her second novel, a follow-up to her compellingly idiosyncratic debut,Weirdo. But progress is understandably slow. “You know how people are like: ‘I write 800 or 2,000 words a day.’ Well I write 20 words a day.” Between childcare and preparing for the tour, she is fitting in work in “tiny windows. I parent, parent, parent, parent, all the way up to the edge of working.”Sara Pascoe: ‘I got told not to wear skirts on stage – but you can be hysterical and wear a nice dress’Read moreDespite the grind, Pascoe radiates joy when she talks about her children, who are “at the stage when they just think you’re amazing”. When she took her eldest to a show, he “was so into the fact that there are bowls of sweets in the green room. Now whenever I leave the house, he’s like: jelly snakes? Fruit chews? I’m in such a cute phase of my life.”Pascoe’s existence may now be dominated by cartoon canines and a kitchen encrusted with root vegetables but, in some of the most essential ways, this high-achieving comedy obsessive hasn’t changed at all. Deep down she still identifies “as an infertile childless woman”, she says. “I don’t know if it’s because I didn’t have children until I was 40.” And while the context of that QI joke is different now, the message – that work and other achievements are just as valid as having kids – remains evergreen.“I think that cliche of telling someone who doesn’t have children that there’s this amazing love that they will never understand is really unhealthy and actually wrong. I still stand by that routine, because I’ve had my babies, but they are not the only thing I will achieve.”Sara Pascoe’sI Am a Strange Glooptours 21June to March 2026.Explore more on these topicsSara PascoeComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For the legendary Irish trainer it came when little Nick Rockett, an unfancied 33-1 shot, emerged from the packto take a 177th Grand Nationalhere that fizzed with drama and extraordinary storylines.Grand National meeting 2025: Gold suits and tangled boots – in picturesRead moreNick Rockett? More like Pocket Rocket. And the jockey guiding him home in the black and tangerine silks? None other than Mullins’s 35-year-old son, Patrick.As Mullins Jr crossed the line, the cameras zoomed in on Willie in the stands. There was an almighty puff of the cheeks. Then a second. And a third. For a brief moment you feared he was hyperventilating. He wasn’t, but the tear ducts were already opening.By the time Willie had got down to the finish to give his son a well‑deserved thump on the back his hanky was already soaked. Then the television cameras arrived and the dam burst.“You have done most things in sport,” ITV’s Matt Chapman said. “But even you appeared to need to pinch yourself about this …”“Ah well,” came the reply. “To be able to let your son …”Mullins’s stoicism has long been worthy of Seneca. But by now every word was a struggle.“Willie, take a moment,” said Chapman. “Why does that mean so much to you?”Finally, through rivers of tears, came more words. “It’s lovely to be able to give your son a ride in the National. But to be able to win it was just unbelievable.”As Mullins was speaking, his son was getting a piggyback from Stewart Andrew, the owner of Nick Rockett. He, it turned out, had a hell of a story, too.The horse had been originally owned by his wife, Sadie, who had wanted him to be trained by Willie Mullins. She got her wish. But she died of cancer in December 2022, a few days after the National winner’s first race over jumps.“My wife wanted a horse in training with Willie,” he said. “She had her holy communion with him. We bumped into him by chance at Cheltenham sales, and she said: ‘Why don’t we get him to buy one for us?’”When Sadie found out she had terminal cancer, Willie ran the horse to let her see him, even though he was not really ready.Later, in Australia, Mullins laid out a plan for the horse over a cheap bottle of wine: win the Thyestes chase, win the Bobbyjo and to shoot for the National. On the brightest of April days the master trainer also proved to be a masterful prophet.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I went to school with Sadie years ago and I met her years later and we went for a cup of tea in Cheltenham and we said we must buy a horse. And here we are.”It is a very different National these days. In 2013, the wooden core of each fence was replaced with plastic, which made them less rigid and with more give. The top of each fence also has loose spruce, which horses can fly through.That certainly helped Nick Rockett. But it also took an exceptional ride from Patrick Mullins, who is technically an amateur, but rode like anything but, to steer him home.“He was just perfect,” he said. “I actually had too good a start and I was trying to take him back all the way. He just jumped fantastic.“When I was five or six years old I was reading books about theGrand Nationalso to put my name there is incredibly special.“He’s just a brilliant horse. He’s not very big, one of the smallest in the field, but he’s brave as a lion.”There was also a word or two for his father. “It was lovely to see my dad, because he’s not very emotional,” Patrick said. Then came a smile that could have lit up the whole of Liverpool.Explore more on these topicsGrand NationalThe ObserverWillie MullinsAintreeHorse racinganalysisShareReuse this content"

Three weeks on from first sight of the conceptual drawings forSir Jim Ratcliffe’s stately pleasure dome, also known as the proposed Manchester United Stadium Soccer Product Hub, there is still a sense of double-take about the whole thing.Early impressions of the new ground ranged from a defunct Venusian mercury mine, to Dubai Butlin’s, to a pointed corporate monument to our divided world. Welcome to the Staff Lunch Arena, embodiment of the 21st-century conviction that if you just stopped buying so many sandwiches and also fired the tea lady you could probably afford a vast and unattainable house.Manchester United’s post-Ferguson strikers: 12 years, 19 players, few triumphsRead moreThe stadium project has at least brought into sharper focus the transient world in whichManchester Unitedmust now exist, shadowed not just by ghosts of the past but the ghost of the future too. This is already an entity engaged in a constant struggle with itself. For now the new development will remain just another zone of conflict, another front on which the club must lobby and balance competing interests, confirmation that the state of unresolvable civil war has now spread to the ground beneath its feet. And that there is, as ever, something rotten in the state of Denmark.With this in mind it feels appropriate the first home Premier League game of the post-plans era should be a derby visit fromManchester Cityon Sunday afternoon. Who are Manchester United’s biggest rivals these days anyway? For so long the answer to this was Liverpool. City have inserted themselves into this dynamic by sheer weight of success. Otherwise the real enemies at Manchester United are now within, a roster of internecine battles that have tracked the past decade.So much so that trying to understand the current tensions at Manchester United is like being asked to provide a complete structural read-out of the causes of the Syldavian war of independence, a blur of factions, ancestral claims, popular dissent, moustachioed emperors in exile.Everyone has a side here. Supporters against Glazers. Supporters against Ratcliffe. Glazers against Ratcliffe (dormant but watch this space). And beyond this an endless arm-wrestle of stadium fans against internet fans, MUFC plc legal dept against the planning authorities, dissident squad members versus incumbent manager, exiled loanees with a grudge, agents, hangers-on, parasites.Step further out and you’re into the drowned world of online fanaticism, Ronaldo loyalists, Ole ultras, Sheikh Jassim stock photo nostalgists, Nemanja Matic truthers, and every other strain of grudge and unscabbed wound. All of it soundtracked by the wailing Easter Island heads of the United legends punditry lineup, constantly reasserting their own relevance by saying things on podcasts, trotting out the Great Roy Keane Of History theory, a self-fuelling industry in themselves.At the end of which those noises off are so persistent that the arrival of some people in sky blue shirts from down the road wanting an actual game of football almost feels like an interruption. Do you mind? There’s an unceasing battle for local supremacy going on here.But there are also some handy things about civil wars. First, not everyone can lose, or at least not at the same time. And this has so far been a good thing forRuben Amorim. United’s latest manager may have overseen an appalling run of form, driven by the obvious mismatch of evangelically stubborn tactics and an ill-tailored squad, but he is in effect bulletproof right now.View image in fullscreenSir Jim Ratcliffe has made plenty of changes and plans since joining Manchester United.Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty ImagesFor a start he can lose himself in the fog of other people’s failure. Nobody is actually ready to blame the last man in through the door for any of this. It may have been illogical to hire a tactical ideologue in mid-season, then ask him to fudge something up out of your existing bits and bobs. But this is hardly his fault. When someone comes through the door wearing a hat that saysI really like wing-backs, there’s a chance they might just really like wing-backs.For now Amorim’s greatest attribute is his easy, sleepy charisma, the ability to laugh and seem a little detached, the smile, jawline, wardrobe, the cinematic qualities. United in this state really don’t need another hollow-eyed prisoner, another sad dad. They need a cool uncle. How long can that last?The answer to this is of course: probably not much longer. The sense of a derby happening by default won’t come again for Amorim. And there are at least three good reasons why this isn’t actually a dead game.First it’s a chance to lob a grenade into City’s season, which has now narrowed to the unlikely but still slightly jaw-dropping prospect of missing out on Champions League football next year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionWith this in mind it seems significant that Amorim’s record against Pep Guardiola is relatively good. This may mean very little on Sunday. That record spans two different clubs and City teams in various states of convulsion. But there is also perhaps a tactical element.Three years ago Amorim’s Sporting Lisbon werethrashed 5-0 by City, having set up in a defensively pitched 5-3-2. In three meetings since Amorim has fielded a 3-4-3 with slightly more advanced flank players. This has coincided with a second leg 0-0 andvictories this season by 4-1and 2-1. City were in a swoon against Sporting in the first of these. The second was the Miracle of Amad. But there is perhaps evidence that shape is well tailored to finding spaces behind City’s full-backs. Guardiola will clearly react to this. But making Guardiola react is also a note of honour.This is the second thing Sunday offers, a chance to show some kind of actual progress beneath the results, because at some point Amorim will have to barter for his future. Right now there is only a vague sense of what a Ruben-shaped team might look like. United look better with Leny Yoro and Patrick Dorgu in the team. Theloss at Nottingham Forestin midweek followed seven games without defeat.If there is a positive underlying metric here it is that United have been at their best against the better teams. Some might suggest this is a function of the players dusting off their best efforts for the big day. There is perhaps a tactical element here too. Amorim’s rigid shape is more effective as a reactive way of playing. When the shirt weighs you down like a Victorian diving suit it is a little easier to play if you don’t have extra pressure to keep the ball, define the game, to be Manchester United in the abstract.This is the final key note before Sunday. Everything United do now is basically prep for the only live element in their season, the Europa League and the possibility of a gateway back to the big stage. Winning the competition isn’t impossible. It will require passage past Lyon, then two more rounds, with Athletic Bilbao, Eintracht Frankfurt and Lazio the stronger teams still in the draw.It is hard to overstate the importance of this opportunity, not just to Amorim, but to the club generally. In the new Champions League format teams can make £80m just for reaching the quarter-finals. This is money this unstoppable cash-sluicing machine actually needs. The brand needs it, the brand which is, despite evidence to the contrary, far from indestructible.For the age of Amorim this feels like a potential Mark Robins FA Cup moment, the thing that might still generate momentum, budget, a restraightening of the ship. Manchester United has always been a saga of collapse and rebuild, right back to the first big stadium rebuild after the Luftwaffe had bombed Old Trafford into the ground. The next few weeks are, if nothing else, an opportunity; one that starts on Sunday.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedThe ObserverRuben AmorimManchester CitycommentShareReuse this content"

At least the manner in whichNottingham Forestswarmed their goal as they pushed for a second-half equaliser may prove a decent dress rehearsal for Wednesday’s Champions League quarter-final first leg at Paris Saint-Germain.Forest pulled a goal back through the half-time substitute Jota Silva and then dialled up the pressure but the visitors, determined to emulate Villa by gatecrashing Europe’s elite, were beaten by early goals from Morgan Rogers and Donyell Malen. For Villa, who cut the gap to third-placed Forest to six points, attention will quickly turn to analysingthe Ligue 1 champions.Aston Villa 2-1 Nottingham Forest: Premier League – live reactionRead moreSimon Hooper officiated a 5-5 Championship draw between these teams in November 2018, when Tammy Abraham scored four and John McGinn and Matty Cash were on opposing sides, and while this time the fixture did not throw up six goals like last season, this was another watchable feast.Murillo smacked the crossbar from 30 yards in stoppage time. Then there was a slice of argy-bargy between Emiliano Martínez and Jota. Forest peppered Villa in the second half, with Neco Williams and Elliot Anderson both blasting inches wide, and Nuno Espírito Santo will wonder how his side, who registered 19 shots but only three on target, left empty-handed.There were no glaring misses but Forest felt the absence of Taiwo Awoniyi and Chris Wood, because of hamstring and hip problems respectively. Anthony Elanga, who predominantly operated centrally, was withdrawn at half-time with an unspecified injury, adding to Nuno’s problems, with Ola Aina also sidelined because of a calf issue. “For me, football is [about] strikers,” Nuno said. “We miss Chris and we miss [Taiwo] because the way we play, the way we do things, we need a reference player. We tried to find solutions.”View image in fullscreenDonyell Malen doubles Aston Villa’s lead from close range.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/ReutersEmery has almost the opposite problem and made eight changes from aresounding victory at Brightonon Wednesday. Martínez, Rogers and Youri Tielemans were the trio who retained their starting spots. Approaching the half-hour, a gaggle of Villa players – Pau Torres, Ezri Konsa, Jacob Ramsey and Boubacar Kamara – gathered close to the touchline. A few minutes later McGinn and Marcus Rashford joined them.This was Villa’s strength in depth hiding in plain sight. On the day those aforementioned players represented plan B, though plan A went so swimmingly that Emery did not need to worry about changes until the 62nd minute, when Rashford, Ramsey and Kamara entered, tasked with trying to disrupt Forest’s groove. Villa were tense in possession, vulnerable out of it.It was a stark contrast to the first half, particularly the opening 15 minutes, at which point Villa led 2-0. Forest were floored by Villa’s boundless energy. Ian Maatsen, who did not feature in Villa’s previous two matches, enjoyed stretching his legs and registered Villa’s first shot after latching on to a Rogers back-heel. Then Marco Asensio prodded wide.Villa’s first goal spoke to the confidence flowing through a team still fighting on three fronts. Tielemans floated a ball over Morato and Rogers, surely one of the stars of the season, did the rest. He took the ball down with the outside of his right boot and then whistled a left-foot finish through the legs of Matz Sels.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Villa were drowning under pressure and Jota pulled a goal back approaching the hour. Williams pushed the ball inside to Anderson, who recorded a swing and a miss, but Jota swivelled and sent a shot through the legs of Konsa, another half-time arrival.Forest went for the jugular. Anderson put his hands on his head in disbelief after dispatching another effort wide. Up the other end Rogers missed a chance to kill the game after seizing on a mistimed jump by Murillo. Forest kept coming. Morgan Gibbs-White volleyed wide and Williams tried his luck from the opposite wing. Murillo cracked the frame of the goal. Then, eventually, the final whistle and Emery’s mind switched to PSG. “We are motivated, excited, but they are favourites,” he said.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueThe ObserverAston VillaNottingham Forestmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Saracens’ director of rugby, Mark McCall, was evidently irked by the criticism he received for resting five England players, the suggestion being that he had disrespected the competition. Though there was an inevitability to Toulon cantering to victory once they had gathered themselves, an understrengthSaracensside gave their hosts a sizeable scare.It is impossible to tell if Maro Itoje, Jamie George, Ben Earl, Tom Willis and Elliot Daly would have made enough of a difference, but the suspicion is – not least because Saracens are not the first English club to be on the wrong side of a hiding against French opposition this season – they would still be bowing out in the last 16. Maybe the final margin would not have been 30 points, but when French sides get on a roll the evidence shows us that English teams find them nigh-on impossible to stop.‘I’d like to be on that tour’: Chandler Cunningham-South on the Lions, ball-carrying and Love IslandRead moreSaracens led by 22 points after 32 minutes. Theo Dan was inspired – tipped by teammates as a British & Irish Lions bolter afterwards – while Olly Hartley, Theo McFarland and Hugh Tizard could hold their heads high.In the ensuing 48 minutes, however,Toulonscored 59 points, Saracens seven. Facundo Isa and Melvyn Jaminet finished with hat-tricks, Baptiste Serin with his reputation further enhanced for the manner he controlled proceedings after coming on from the bench. The upshot was the second-highest scoring match in European Cup history.“There was too much talk about who wasn’t playing and not enough talk about who was playing,” said McCall. “We had some very good players who are very proud. There were some very young players in that 23 and some experienced players. We conceded a lot of points, but other English teams have conceded a lot of points in France this year.”View image in fullscreenMelvyn Jaminet (right) is congratulated by team mate Jiuta Wainiqolo after he scored Toulon’s eighth try.Photograph: David Rogers/Getty ImagesIt was all a far cry from this fixture nine years ago when Saracens came here as the kings of Europe and ended Toulon’s unbeaten run in this competition on the way to successfully defending their crown. Even if McCall had selected the five England players, this current side is some way off that of their heyday. The gulf between the Premiership and the Top 14 is most pronounced in terms of physicality and it feels as if it is widening. All is not lost for McCall, however.“I remember going to Toulouse in 2016 for a pool match and the stadium was half-empty,” he said. “We won with a bonus pointpretty easily and Toulouse, who had been a force, weren’t a force then, but have become a force again. Their big thing was committing to promoting from within, they were going to bring through their own players.“English rugby has got piles of young players coming through who need to be given opportunities and time. Investing in youth, everybody being patient with the youth, rather than just grabbing players from overseas is ultimately what is going to make the difference.”View image in fullscreenSetariki Tuicuvu breaks clear to score Toulon’s 10th try.Photograph: David Rogers/Getty ImagesGranted, Toulon’s first-half implosion registered high on the Richter scale, but the opening half-hour could hardly have gone better for Saracens.

One era does not yield easily to another. What constitutes an era changes over time. While history is happening it’s often hard to make sense of it; patterns seem to emerge that, from the perspective of 20 years later are meaningless, or culs-de-sac. That seems particularly true this season. As theChampions Leaguereaches its quarter-final stage this coming week, it feels that one age has ended and another has yet to materialise.The past was a simpler place. First there was the age of dominance byReal Madridand Benfica, teams from the capitals of Iberian nations under right-wing dictatorships, packed with great individuals. Then came systematisation,catenaccioand the Italian ascendancy, followed, with a brief period of crossover, by the era of domination by the northern European industrial powers, skipping swiftly over Celtic and Manchester United to the Dutch and Total Football and then Bayern Munich. Then came the long period of English superiority before the Heysel ban, after which everything gets more complicated.Real Madrid win Champions League final as Dortmund rue missed chancesRead moreThere were the one-off champions – Porto, Steaua, PSV Eindhoven, Red Star Belgrade, Barcelona and Marseille – around the mighty Milan of Arrigo Sacchi, who in 1990 were the last side successfully todefend the title for 27 years. As the Champions League began, and began making the rich richer, the nature of the pattern changed. As increasing number of sides were admitted from the bigger leagues, so the level of competition increased. It became harder and harder for one club or one country to dominate.There was a period when it was clear Italian sides were the teams to beat, but that resulted in more defeats in finals for Serie A clubs than successes. Then Real Madrid won three titles in five years. Porto beating Monaco in the 2004 final in 2004 felt like the end of an era, the last time a team from outside the big four European leagues won the competition.What has followed has been the era of the super-clubs, 20 years in which the prize has been passed around nine teams from four countries. Include losing finalists and you only add five more clubs and one country. Real Madrid, with six titles in that time, have clearly been the dominant club, while the Premier League, with six titles shared out, has probably underperformed given its financial dominance. This is not about the domination of a single country but the domination of capital. Finance is all.View image in fullscreenBukayo Saka celebrates scoring against Fulham on his comeback. The winger’s return to fitness offers Arsenal some hope against Real Madrid.Photograph: Josh Smith/PPAUK/ShutterstockBeyond that, it’s very hard to isolate more precise themes, although there is a clear irony in that the spell from Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona beating Manchester United in the 2009 final to the present day has been the most theory-driven period of football’s history, and yet the most successful side has been essentially pragmatic, a team based on brilliant individuals with a remarkable knack of doing something brilliant just when it is needed.It was the era of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, but it was also the era, at least more recently, of huge swings and turnarounds. Which made for great entertainment, but perhaps suggested teams unused to defending in domestic leagues in which they were dominant finding themselves unable to scrap and shut games down when they came under pressure.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A new age is coming into being, may perhaps already have begun, but what will it look like?In one obvious way, it seems a lot like the old age, in that there’s every chance Real Madrid win a 16th Champions League, their seventh in 12 seasons, despite an unconvincing campaign – they lost three times in the group stage – and, more remarkably, despite consistentlylobbying against the Champions Leagueand its structures, and being at war with their own federation. This feels a very modern fable, the serial winners sickened by being unable to win quite enough, or at least lucratively enough, the establishment outraged by challenge.Arsenal’s chances of upsetting them were diminished byGabriel’s hamstring injury,but they have the best defence in the Premier League and that, plus the return of Bukayo Saka and his delivery from corners, gives them at least a glimmer of a chance. The other Premier League hope, Aston Villa,have enjoyed their European campaignbut neither they nor Arsenal seem on the verge of starting a dynasty.View image in fullscreenOusmane Dembélé has been one of Europe’s best players this season and has inspired Paris Saint-Germain to the quarter-finals.Photograph: Jean Catuffe/DPPI/ShutterstockThere could be a first-everclásicofinal, which would be enticing both from a historical and footballing point of view, although Barcelona are also at war with the Spanish federation and are one of the other holdouts against Uefa in the campaign for a Super League. It’s hard to imagine Dortmund, after their miserable season, presenting much opposition. Bayern have dominated other German opposition, but there have been times, notably against Feyenoord and Celtic, when they have seemed inexplicably slow. Inter, meanwhile, have gradually improved over the season to top Serie A.Which leaves Paris Saint-Germain, who have developed radically since a tame defeat by Arsenal in the group stage, andbeat Liverpool with verveand energy. Victory for them would be the first for a league outside the big four for two decades and would represent vindication for their move away from celebrity. That leaves the potential for a semi-final, between PSG, tool of the Qatari state, suddenly representing a progressive team-based ethic, and the old money of Real Madrid and their star system.But there is no clear pattern. Madrid appear the default winners but there are possibilities for a mix of familiar big names, plus one upstart newcomer. The environment is different, but as around the turn of the century, there is a slightly messy sense of an age coming into being – which reflects the scrappiness of the Premier League this season, itself probably a function of accumulated fatigue amid the absurd new calendar.It’s likely Real Madrid will win the Champions League again because that’s just what happens. But there is a chance amid the uncertainty of the interregnum for a less-fancied side to nick a fragment of history for themselves.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueInside footballReal MadridParis Saint-GermainArsenalAston VillacommentShareReuse this content"

        "Content": "7h ago15.41 EDTRoundup: Banton makes history with 344Be gone Harold Gimblett, Viv Richards, Justin Langer – there is a new man in town. Tom Banton’s astonishing 344 not out againstWorcestershireeclipsed them all, the highest score by aSomersetplayer – and marks the revival of a blazing young gun, whose star had dimmed but is now aflame.It was also an innings that will have gladdened the hearts of the England selectors, with Banton said to be in their thoughts for Tests this year as they look to build a small pool who play across all formats. It wasn’t all cider and sausages, at 39 for three on Friday afternoon, concentration had been crucial. But by the penultimate ball yesterday, Langer’s 342 in sight, Banton threw caution to the wind and flat-packed a boundary to rapturous applause and handshakes all round.“It’s a weird feeling,” he said, “and I was a bit emotional up there in the dressing room. This is the best day I’ve had in cricket and will probably be the best day I’ll ever have.“These days don’t come along very often and you have to make the most of them. I won’t lie, I was pretty tired out there and I kept saying to myself: ‘Just keep batting, keep going’. There were a few moments when I felt I wanted to be back in the dressing room, but I wanted to go for it [the record] tonight, so I tried to play my shots when possible.”If he was dropped in the 300s by a tiring Worcestershire, it was an aberration – this was a innings of power but also finesse. He didn’t hit a six until he had passed 200 – quite a display of discipline for a man who has graced the Big Bash, the Indian Premier League and the Pakistan Super League. He is also now the joint owner of the earliest triple in Championship history, sharing the record notched up by Sam Northeast on 5 April last year.Banton’s partner in a record fifth-wicket stand of 371 was James Rew – whose second season last year was a more crunchy experience than the first. But his 152 was gloriously heady – and his and Banton’s efforts leftSomersetfans walking away from the ground in disbelief, the scoreboard reading 637 for six.There were runs galore at Chelmsford, whereEssex’s centurions Matt Critchley and Michael Pepper tucked intoSurrey– Dan Lawrence whisking down 35.2 overs against a club where he barely bowled. After the excitement of Sam Cook pinning Dom Sibley leg before in his second over, and having Ollie Pope dropped on 10,Surreythen dropped anchor, with Pope and Rory Burns adding 101 on a gentle pitch. Simon Harmer toiled away, but in sunglasses, not his customary April snood.Edgbaston also proved rich pickings, John Simpson’s 181 helpingSussexto 528. Rob Yates’s unbeaten 113 ledWarwickshire’s reply. A misbehaving sprinkler system delayed play at Trent Bridge, where Australian Fergus O’Neill duly collected his fifth wicket, on debut.Durhamthen picked away atNottinghamshire’s lineup.Jonny Bairstow made an exuberant 56 againstHampshire, the newYorkshirecaptain dropped three times before he passed 20, and eventually dismissed by Sonny Baker for the second time in the match. The lead is 61, but with just four second-innings wickets left.In Division Two, Marcus Harris made a hundred on debut forLancashireagainstMiddlesexat Lord’s, proving an excellent prop for the flaky middle order. Twenty wickets fell at Wantage Road, where the writing is on the wall forNorthamptonshireagainstKent;Derbyshire’s Wayne Madsen collected his 40th first-class century, againstGloucestershire, andLeicestershirecaptain’s old and new, Lewis Hill and Peter Handscomb, made hay againstGlamorgan.Share"

A fifth this year already looks to be a tall order as the team swing from a period of undisputed dominance to being left impotent by a car they cannot tame and in no little disarray, so much so that Verstappen may be considering his options.In Japan, all eyes have been on the home hero Yuki Tsunoda, promoted to Red Bull from the sister team, Racing Bulls, with indecent haste, afterLiam Lawson was sent packingthe other way after two races. Even by F1 standards it was a brutal decision but indicative of the disorder that embroils Red Bull.The fans here could not be happier, with their man in one of the top cars engendering a febrile atmosphere. Those who had fashioned elaborately tailored Yuki tribute costumes in the Racing Bulls livery had barely a week to upgrade it all to match theRed Bullcolours but they managed it, the heaving fan areas in the shadow of the ferris wheel bustling with celebratory Yuki attire.This was a positive at least after another week when Red Bull were left looking almost rudderless. The former driver Giedo van der Garde described the Lawson sacking as a “panic move” in an Instagram post that was pointedly liked by Verstappen and which the Dutchman confirmed in Suzuka included sentiments with which he concurred.View image in fullscreenChristian Horner has been embroiled in power struggles at Red Bull.Photograph: Mark Thompson/Getty ImagesChristian Horner, the Red Bull principal, said his engineers had been concerned about Lawsons’s ability to cope, while Helmut Marko, the team’s motorsport adviser responsible for their young drivers programme, came out last week to justify the decision. His arguments lacked cohesion and felt more like retroactively attempting to account for it, but one thing he said was impossible to ignore. “We have this huge motivation to achieve this fifth title,” he said. “We also know that if we don’t deliver for Max, all the top drivers have performances clauses in their contract.”Other teams, not least Mercedes and Aston Martin, are more than aware of this and have been circling Verstappen for some time. The performance clause means Red Bull need to produce a strong car for Verstappen and they have not.From winning 21 of 22 races in 2023 a victory at this point would be very welcome and Verstappen’s remarkable securing of pole for Sunday’s Grand Prix serves only to further underline the Dutchman’s talent. Still, it is hard not to draw comparisons with the similarly perplexingdecline at Manchester City. At Milton Keynes, as at the Etihad Stadium, this is not the time for panic.The Lawson decision, was not an isolated event, but rather the latest in what has been almost relentless tumult. Before the season began last year there was the furore around Horner being investigated for alleged inappropriate behaviour after a complaint made by a female employee of the team, charges he strongly rejected. Horner was exonerated by an independent inquiry but it exposed frailties at the heart of the organisation.There was an internal power struggle between Horner and the team’s parent company, Red Bull GMBH, and between Horner and Verstappen’s father, the former F1 driver Jos, who was openly calling for him to be sacked. Marko was under threat of suspension, prompting Verstappen in turn to threaten to leave. It was a power struggle worthy of the machinations of the Roman senate but not quite as bloody.Even as they rode out the storm the team have since been battered on many levels. They have played it down but senior key figures leaving are serious blows. The first was the departure of Rob Marshall as chief engineering officer at the end of 2023 to become chief designer at McLaren. He was followed in 2024 by Adrian Newey, the team’s genius designer,joining Aston Martinand then Jonathan Wheatley, the sporting director, moving to Sauber and Will Courtenay, the head of strategy, alsoleaving for McLarenthough being held to see out his contract by Red Bull for this year.View image in fullscreenLiam Lawson has been jettisoned after just two races.Photograph: Kym Illman/Getty ImagesThrough it all Verstappen has remained stoic, focused on the job in hand and the world champion eased through the opening part of last season when the car looked every bit as dominant as it had for the previous two years. But six races in, at the Miami GP, the wheels came off. McLaren brought upgrades that moved them to the front, while every development Red Bull applied to try to keep pace only set them back, to the extent Verstappen declared the car undriveable.There was no quick fix and none in the longer term; the anticipated step up over the winter has not been produced. Meanwhile, McLaren and Mercedes have moved forward as Red Bull have made the car all but unmanageable.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionVerstappen’s prodigious talent may well have been masking fundamental problems the team have failed to address. The design philosophy for the regulation change of 2022 was rightly focused around having the car suit Verstappen and the extremely pointy front-end he prefers. For two years their performance advantage over the opposition, in Verstappen’s hands at least, was such that all was well, but when the other teams began catching up and Red Bull had to develop, the negative traits of the car and its increasingly narrow performance window only became more and more severe.The pursuit of extreme performance at the expense of driveability was based on Verstappen’s capability to manage a demanding ride. Now it has reached the point where even Verstappen is barely managing, despite his performance in qualifying at Suzuka.Newey has said he had identified problems in the car toward the end of 2023 and that as 2024 went on they became more acute. “It’s something I was starting to become concerned about,” he says. “But not many other people in the organisation seemed to be very concerned about it.”He was right but the team, now under the technical director, Pierre Waché, continued in the same developmental direction even as the car became harder to drive, to the point where Verstappen was publicly demanding changes.All of which suggests a level of questionable decision-making, of which the Lawson-Tsunoda switch is only the public tip of the iceberg. That particular call is a no-win for Red Bull. If Tsunoda smashes it on Sunday it only demonstrates their decision to overlook him for Lawson was flawed; if he fails then not giving Lawson a better shout also looks like an error, that it is not the drivers at fault but simply that Verstappen’s talent has concealed a fundamental problem.Red Bull are 20 years on from their debut and still a formidable force. Yet there are no guarantees in F1. In the 80s and 90s the idea that teams such as Williams and McLaren might find themselves languishing as also-rans would have seemed fanciful. Yet Williams know only too well how far the mighty can fall while McLaren have only just emerged from more than a decade in the doldrums.Past success counts for nothing when the slate is swept clean every season; the challenge is perhaps not so much how Tsunoda comes through this but how Red Bull themselves fare.Explore more on these topicsRed BullThe ObserverChristian HornerMax VerstappenFormula OneMotor sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Better now than laterPhillip InmanThere is already arguably too little flexibility in the chancellor’s budget plan. Trump’s tariffs chaos makes a rethink inevitableSat 5 Apr 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 5 Apr 2025 10.57 EDTShareCritics ofRachel Reevesare enjoying another “told you so” moment. It was never realistic, they say, to formulate a budget plan with virtually no leeway to accommodate for unforeseen events.Less than £10bn of headroom on a budget of £1.2tn was asking for trouble. It is clear there are just too many events that could be put on a list of “known unknowns” for a UK chancellor to almost wilfully wish away their potential impact on the economy and the public finances.One of those was the prospect of Donald Trump winning the US presidency and, once installed in the White House, pulling every lever at his disposal to create the uncertainty, if not chaos, he believes gives the US supreme bargaining power over whatever issue he wants to tackle. Theglobal tariff warunleashed by the mobster-like president last week is a case in point.At last month’sspring statement, Reeves rejected another opportunity to inject more flexibility into her budget rules to accommodate the almost inevitable swings in economic forecasts that, in turn, affect the public finances.TheOffice for Budget Responsibility(OBR), the body that produces independent forecasts for the Treasury, has shown in charts how Reeves is one of the worst offenders since the OBR was created in 2010.Previous chancellors have tended to leave themselves a bigger buffer to absorb changes to the forecasts. The implication is that they offered more certainty about the direction of travel.What the OBR’s analysis must ignore, though, is the political imperative behind maintaining a significant buffer in the public finances and why the largest can be traced to George Osborne’s time as chancellor.Osborne’s agenda was to reduce the size of the state. It meant that a buffer of about £30bn was part of the overall austerity message.Any chancellor who wants to energise government to boost economic growth, as Reeves wants to do, is going to find it difficult to leave tens of billions of pounds unspent, sitting in a reserve fund, just to accommodate a budget rule, albeit one that is self-imposed.View image in fullscreenDespite the UK only being hit with 10% tariffs by Donald Trump, its economic prospects will suffer from a wider global trade war.Photograph: Carlos Barría/ReutersThat leaves the UK in an unenviable situation. Unless the budget rule is ditched, the situation will persist. There is already speculation that the autumn budget willneed to raise taxes againto cope with the fallout from Trump’s tariff regime. A10% tariffmight have left the UK relatively unscathed compared with the EU’s 20%, but Trump’s trade war will hit global growth and, with it, the UK’s economic outlook.A downgrade to the prospects of growth over the next few years will reduce tax receipts and government income.On the plus side, a slowdown in the world economy means the Bank of England will want to cut interest rates at a faster pace – or at least it ought to. And international investors will lend to governments at a cheaper rate.A decline in borrowing costs will be a boon for Reeves, who inherited a debt-to-GDP ratio of close of 96%, and little room for manoeuvre after the Liz Truss debacle.How these cross-currents affect the budget deficit is not clear. Lower growth will increase the deficit, while cheaper debt will reduce it.Even if the result is a positive number, it leaves businesses to wonder whether there will be higher taxes or not. And what we know about business sentiment is that it is very sensitive to the government’s tax and spending plans.Most business people don’t like to take risks, whatever they say in public. They want the reassurance of solid government backing for projects that enhance growth.What are Rachel Reeves’s fiscal rules and could they be changed?Read moreInvestment decisions often take at least five years before they make a return, during which time businesses will want a settled economic outlook. The UK can look back on a disastrous decade of low business investment largely because Tory infighting overBrexitmeant the direction of travel was a subject of constant debate.What can Reeves do? She needs to end the speculation – and soon. Waiting for the next budget creates another six months’ more uncertainty. It also ties the summer spending review to austerity-lite spending limits. If the need to protect welfare payments and for higher defence spending was not enough to justify rewriting the budget rules before the spring statement, surely Trump’s tariffs provide the green light now.Loosening the deficit rule would allow the government to protect businesses from the worst of the downturn and intervene in industries that are essential to the UK’s independence, such as steel. Cuts to police numbers could be avoided and cash-starved bodies, such as further education colleges, could be given a new lease of life.Otherwise, there is the prospect of perpetual debate about what more pain each budget will bring, killing consumer and business confidence and the growth the UK desperately needs.Explore more on these topicsEconomicsThe ObserverRachel ReevesTax and spendingSpring statement 2025Autumn budget 2024Office for Budget ResponsibilityTrump tariffscommentShareReuse this content"

With gentle stretching, a coffee in bed? It could be a walk in the sun, a hot breakfast or simply managing to spend the first 20 minutes off your phone before spending the next 20 onInstagram. Lately, it may feel like the answer is being more productive.The optimised morning routine has become a near-mythical ideal for young people, sold by fitness influencers posting obsessively about their 5.30am starts, claiming to finish their weight training, macronutrient-rich meals and emails before our first alarm – promising that everything in your life would be better if you, too, had the discipline to just get up early.Our comparative feelings of inadequacy in response to this trend may have reached new heights last month, after the viral morning routine from the US fitness influencer Ashton Hall. The video features him getting up at 3.52am, plunging his face into multiple ice baths, following an idiosyncratic skincare routine (involving banana peel), meditating, journaling and completing several workouts to maintain his ripped physique. Female staff swarm around in the background, bringing towels and ice, preparing him breakfast and delivering branded Saratoga glass water bottles – these women often only seen as a pair of hands. In the caption on TikTok and Instagram, Hall says this routine “changed his life”; warning that “sin lives late at night” and to deal with “a weak mind, bad decisions or lack of productivity”, his followers should go to sleep early and spend the first four hours of the day practising this grimly rigid schedule. You have probably already seen this video: at the time of writing, it has been viewed more than 900m times across various platforms.In the days since the routine was shared, it has drawn wide commentary, with many questioningif men are OK, if the video is even all that serious (Hall is a content creator for work and this could easily be pure rage-bait) and asking what it says about modern masculinity. The activist Matt Bernsteinnoted on X: “15 years ago this routine would get you called gay (or ‘metrosexual’) but is now considered peak alpha male behavior. Something weird has shifted.”While many men may be turned off by the overtness of Tate, this doesn’t mean they are turned off to a world defined by masculine dominanceWe’ve spent three years talking about the chilling rise of hyper-macho,Andrew Tate-style misogyny influencers, who promote an alpha brand that looks very different from Hall’s: one that glorifies domestic violence, explicitly says that women deserve limited rights and broadly champions a vision of gender dynamics that were common 80 years ago. Hall’s video also went viral in the middle of a public discussion around what to do about these ideas proliferating on social media, spurred on by the popularity of the Netflix seriesAdolescence, which makes the somewhat thin argument that all young men are susceptible to violent misogynistic thinking. As a result, this video might look like a departure from what we’ve come to know from alpha-influencers, revealing a perhaps absurd corner of the online male self-optimisation space, but one that’s completely harmless.Hall’s video undoubtedly shows us a ridiculous side to hustle culture. But is that all it tells us about men today? Despite its risibility – and even Hall’s relative sweetness and politeness compared with those such as Tate, thanking the women in his videos – this content is evidence of a once-fringe manosphere squarely part of the mainstream. Now it has room to adapt and evolve to meet a growing audience of young guys attracted to a conservative gender philosophy, in which Hall pitches a less toxic version of a similar ethos.While many men may be turned off by the overtness of Tate, this doesn’t mean they are turned off to a world defined by masculine dominance. Content like this plays into an egocentric male fantasy that glorifies the impossible image of a perfectly sculpted physique and encourages men to hustle and grind to meet an austere, success-obsessed brand of individualism.Elsewhere, Hall promotes a Christian, puritanical living – not just through his content, but through his (paid) mentorship scheme, where he coaches men to avoid hook-up culture and to stop trying to impress women; to, instead, change their lives in service to themselves and God. As Beth McColl, the writer and co-host of the culture podcastEverything Is Content, said on a recent episode dedicated to Hall’s video: “You have to live this clean life in service to God – but you’re almost God yourself, because everything is actually in service of your own perfection.”From the police to the prime minister: how Adolescence is making Britain face up to toxic masculinityRead moreThis content is less obviously misogynistic, but is still designed to promote regressive ideas about masculinity, which reinforce the new wave of conservatism we have begun to see among Gen-Z men.Menare placed at the centre of the universe, waited on and served by women who are obedient, submissive and secondary, if they are even considered. However, unlike content from those explicitly advocating for a patriarchal hierarchy, these videos masquerade as something mindlessly benign – giving them, at times, a greater power to disseminate via the implicit message that this is how good, happy, successful men and women act.There are a concerning number of boys and men who align with the extreme views of figures such as Tate. But alone, Tate and men like him cannot shift wider culture. What can is the echoing reverb of something more palatable, that nudges us closer and closer to the same thing. Our reactionary shift is going to look much more like what Hall offers: a subtle lean towards patriarchy, which wears its motivations more lightly while feeding into our many new channels of misogyny.Ashton Hall is not the cause of our current gender divide, but we shouldn’t fool ourselves into thinking content like his isn’t part of the problem. We guarantee ourselves a worse future by letting these ideas fester in plain sight, unchecked – dismissing something sinister as nothing more than silly.Sarah Manavis is a US writer and critic living in the UKDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Love (actually)Arwa MahdawiThe first lady spoke about (wait for it) diversity as she presented awards to courageous women from around the worldSat 5 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 5 Apr 2025 11.14 EDTShareMelania’s guide to getting through hard timesLet’s take a quick break from the increasingly dreadful news for a little check-in, shall we? So … how are you holding up right now? How are those stress levels?Mine aren’t great, to be honest. I’m pickling in my own cortisol as I write this. But I’m not here to moan. I am here to share some helpful advice, courtesy of our inspiring first ladyMelania Trump, about how to get through these challenging times.Now, I know what you may be thinking: what on earth does Melania Trump know about adversity? The woman divides her time between a gold penthouse in Manhattan and a mansion in Florida, occasionally dropping into the White House to wave at commoners. She’s not exactly worrying about the price of eggs or the balance of her 401(k).But let’s not be too quick to judge. Money doesn’t insulate you from everything, and I’m sure Melania has her own problems. I mean, the poor woman is probably forced to regularly socialize with Elon Musk – which would drain the lifeblood from anyone. Then there’s the fact her husband has taken to using the stomach-turning nickname the “fertilization president”.Melania’s also not just lounging around in luxury: I am sure she is working extremely hard for the millions of dollars Amazon hasthrown at herfor the privilege of making a sycophantic documentary about her life. And then there’s all the annoying first lady admin; her office has just had to reschedule the White Housespring garden tours– which Melania is not expected to actually attend – because of somepesky protesters.So how does our first lady navigate these very stressful challenges? Whilepresentingthe state department’s 19th International Women of Courage awards, which honored eight women from around the world, Melania shared her secret trick for getting through hard times. It’s … wait for it …love.“Throughout my life, I have harnessed the power of love as a source of strength during challenging times,” Melania said. “Love has inspired me to embrace forgiveness, nurture empathy and exhibit bravery in the face of unforeseen obstacles.”Melania noted that the award recipients – which included women from Yemen, South Sudan,Israeland the Philippines – “came from diverse backgrounds and regions, yet love transcends boundaries and territories”. She further added that she was inspired by “the women who are driven to speak out for justice, even though their voices are trembling”.The first lady deserves an award of her own for that speech because I have absolutely no idea how she managed to say all that with a straight face. I mean, seriously, is she trolling us? How can she talk aboutlovewhile her husband’s hate-filled administration is deporting everyone they can? Havingthe wrong tattoo– or just a stroke of bad luck – can now get you sent to aprisonin El Salvador. (The secretary of state Marco Rubio, by the way, who is presiding proudly over these deportations, also made a speech at the International Women of Courage awards.)How can Melania talk aboutjusticewhen the Trump administration is currently doing their best todeport or imprison anyonewho speaks out for justice for Palestinians? And how dare she talk about diversity and women’s rights, when the Trump administration is erasing women fromgovernment websitesas part of their crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion.But, look, I don’t want to completely dismiss Melania’s advice. Perhaps she has a point. Perhaps, in these challenging times, we should all just channel Melania and reach for the power of love. So: if you happen to get into trouble with any US border guards because you’ve indulged in a little wrongthink online, just remind them of Melania’s words. Remind them thatlove transcends borders and territories.And then sit back, and enjoy your free trip to El Salvador.Katy Perry says she is ‘going to put the “ass” in astronaut’Please don’t, Katy.For more cringeworthy quotes on how “space is finally going to be glam”, read thisfeature in Elle.

And why do we respond to them with such deep pleasure?Sat 5 Apr 2025 16.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 5 Apr 2025 21.00 EDTShareLast Sunday, while I was walking along a coastal path in Sydney, I was stopped in my tracks by a marvel. It was first noticed, as these things often are, by a small boy who was walking with me. Look at that! We both stopped and gazed at the marvel.It sat on a low sandstone rock near the edge of the sea. We squatted down to examine it more closely. It was only a walking boot, but it was laced delicately all over the back and sides and tongue, and even the rim of the sole, with small white conical seashells, as if someone had stitched the shells into the fabric. The shells’ bright whiteness was tinged with a faint pink and there was a dark narrow opening where, with careful observation, we could see in each shell a soft living creature.Each shell must have attached itself as the boot lay on the sandy bottom of the sea, forming over many months a colony of creatures on this strange new sea architecture. The boot was still damp and prettily sprinkled with sand and must have been cast up from the depths on to the shore the stormy night before.A friendship break-up is a radical loss. Why don’t we talk about it more? | Patti MillerRead moreThe Tempest came to mind:Full fathom five thy father lies/ Of his bones are coral made/ Those are pearls that were his eyes/ Nothing of him that doth fade/ But doth suffer a sea change/ Into something rich and strange.The boy had heard of Shakespeare but was more interested in testing how firmly the shells were attached. I wondered aloud about the owner of the boot, but its origins were of no concern to the boy. It was the boot covered in shells, the object itself, so rich and strange, that enchanted. It was a true marvel. Neither of us had seen anything like it before in all our varying decades.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsIt has made me wonder, what qualifies as a marvel? And why do we seek them out?Marvels are usually pointless, that is, not useful in the functioning of everyday life. They cannot normally be set to work, or made into a tasty dish, or sold. And yet we long for them. I think of other marvels I have come upon: a flat stone in an almost exact shape of Australia, a fountain frozen solid in mid spray, a church entered through a rock crevice, eight puppies born in the car shed, an origami crane held by a spider’s thread above the window sill; a megalithic tomb made of quartz; each one of them I could not do without, but none of them are practically useful to me.Marvels must have, too, a quality of randomness, although we often try to order them. The crowds that arrived to see tigers in the Place des Vosges in Paris, the hundreds of people sitting on clifftops along the coast watching for whales, the travellers gathering on a stony ridge in Kakadu to watch the sun go down over the wetlands – all are expecting a marvel. But you can’t necessarily book or buy tickets to see a marvel. There are marvels in museums and galleries and at famous sites and natural wonders, but neither the Mona Lisa nor a Kakadu sunset, nor Niagara Falls qualify as marvels because they are expected. Marvels must be encountered randomly, although there is a knack to putting oneself in a situation where a marvel might occur.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

Most marvels are beautiful, but it is not an absolute requirement. Some marvels are merely “rich and strange”: a swallow’s nest made of knobbly mud, a tadpole with four legs and a tail, an Irish cave with holy cards and faded flowers stuck to the walls. And even the lovely shell-encrusted boot a friend said was “gross”. Instead of beauty, a marvel needs to have originality and rarity, something quite like this never seen before.But why do we long for, search for, marvels? Why do we respond to them with such deep pleasure? It must be partly an aesthetic pleasure, the desire for beauty, but there is something else, something to do with a gift that cannot be ordered and paid for. The fact it is randomly bestowed is crucially important – it means we all have equal access to the random gifts, and blows, of the gods.I used to think the desire for transcendental wonders was the residue of a religious upbringing – I was promised angels, endless fire, rising from the dead – but the boy has had no such fabulous stories shaping his perceptions and still he pays as much attention, or more, to the wonders that land on our path.It could be childhood training, being taught by our parents or grandparents to pay attention to curiosities. I’ve spent many hours showing the boy what must be noticed as we walk across the world – bats hanging upside down in the paperbark swamp, water dragons lying perfectly still, a man playing a harp at the market. In turn, I was shaped by the Argonauts, a 20th-century radio club for children, which had us vow: “Before the sun and the night and the blue sea, I vow to stand faithfully by all that is brave and beautiful; to seek adventure, and having discovered aught of wonder, or delight; of merriment or loveliness, to share it freely with my comrades ... ” It was a solemn vow to spend one’s life to searching for and sharing marvels, which even now seems to me a reasonable enough life aim. Yet most of the world have never been Argonauts and still have a love of marvels.Walking helped me discover the slow unfurling joy of reading books aloud | Patti MillerRead moreThere must be something innate in the desire for and recognition of what is rare, random, extraordinary. Years ago in Paris I saw an artwork which resembled a pinball machine, a wooden box on legs with a glass top, but inside it, instead of the usual levers and ricocheting ball, there was a tiny figure of a man in a bleak landscape, pushing against a high wooden gate. We, the viewers looking from above, could see there was a beautifully made paradise on the other side of the door. The door moved a little inwards each time the man pushed, but never opened. I wondered how the man knew there was beauty and wonder on the other side.It seems it must be a part of human DNA, the chemical bases as yet unmapped, to search for and be delighted by marvels. One day scientists will discover the exact sequence, somehow evolved in us for who knows what purpose, which causes us to be delighted and astonished by marvels. I gaze at the sea boot and touch one of the laced shells. Something expands in my solar plexus; for a moment the world is more extraordinary than I could have imagined.Patti Milleris the author of the books Writing True Stories and True FriendsExplore more on these topicsAustralian lifestylecommentShareReuse this content"

Over a period of two years, he sent her inappropriate messages and tried to isolate her from friends and family as part of a “predatory” plan to have a sexual relationship with her.There followed seven years of failings, in which further complaints were ignored, the Met told external agencies she was making up her claims, and a senior officer attempted to contact her GP, informing social services that he thought she had mental health problems. A letter from the directorate of professional standards now concedes decisions may have been influenced by these beliefs, which had “no basis in fact”.“Surely predators are more drawn to vulnerable people with mental health issues,” Lorraine told the BBC. “Surely they would investigate that more, not less, had it been true?”Criticism has rightly focused on the Met and the way they deal with victims of rogue officers. But there is also a wider pattern here. Although mental health stigma is broadly declining, there are pockets in which it still runs rampant. This is perhaps no better illustrated by the way diagnoses are weaponised against victims of abuse.People with severe mental health problems are particularly vulnerable to abuse in the first placeThat can happen at scale. It recently emerged that hundreds of female members of the armed forces who accused their colleagues of rape were misdiagnosed with personality disorders – a difficult-to-treat pattern of maladaptive behaviour – that meant they would be no longer able to serve. When seeking help for sexual assault from heath professionals within the military, they had beenin effect “written off”: slapped with a stigmatised label and then medically discharged.According to thecharity Salute Her UK,which supports veterans struggling to adjust to civilian life, some 133 of the 393 female referrals they received in a year had been diagnosed with a personality disorder. This echoesan earlier US scandal, reported in 2012, whereby rape victims in the Marine Corps and other branches of the armed forces said they were being discharged with these diagnoses. As they are pre-existing conditions, the military is not obliged to pay disability benefits.Then, too, there is a long history of the courts using the mental health records and counselling notes of crime victims to attack their credibility – although recent legislation has made this harder.This lingering pattern has severe consequences. Framing a victim as mentally ill shifts the focus away from the abuse, placing the onus on their disordered mind rather than the perpetrator of the crimes, who can more easily convince others that the victim is delusional.Agencies and the justice system may disbelieve or ignore their testimony; meanwhile, their trauma is never validated, causing further distress. There may be unnecessary medication, and their medical history is for ever altered, which might mean changes to insurance, and barriers to employment.This is compounded by the fact that people with severe mental health problems are particularly vulnerable to abuse in the first place: they are five times more likely to be a victim of assault, three times more likely to be a victim of household crime, and four times as likely to be preyed upon by relatives or acquaintances than the general population. Trauma can also trigger and exacerbate mental health conditions. Aware of the stigma, those suffering from these disorders areless likelyto report crimes.Where to start with addressing the issue? Part of it must involve a reassessment of the use of personality disorder diagnoses when treating victims of trauma. Psychiatrists are divided on whether these definitions help or harm. Borderline personality disorder is seen by some clinicians as asexist and stigmatising labelthat can get in the way of treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, which some believe is often the true cause of symptoms.But there is a broader issue here. Despite a plethora of mental health campaigns that seek to reduce stigma, and raise awareness, discrimination is still very hard to shift in places.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They often do so by making these problems relatable: after all, everyone has experienced feeling anxious or low.This has been a great success: the taboo over seeking help has significantly decreased. The Time to Change campaign that ran from 2007 to 2021 was shown to havereached its aimsof decreasing stigma. In the largest recent survey, three quarters of Britons say we need to adopt amore tolerant attitudeto mental health, and 68% say seeing a mental health professional is a sign of strength.Yet amid all this, vulnerable people are being squeezed out of the picture. As more are “made aware” of possible mental health issues at the milder end of the scale, resources are diverted away from the smaller number who really need them. There is evidence that stigma against severe conditions like schizophrenia is not shifting, even as sufferers from depression become more widely accepted.Media coverageof psychosis still tends to associate it with violence.Is it time for a more targeted approach to mental health stigma? The public are more aware of loneliness, anxiety, depression and body image issues, and Britain is kinder for it. But we also need to root out discrimination in workplaces, in the justice system, the armed forces and the police, and against those with more severe conditions.

I don’t have any direct evidence of this conspiracy to rob us of the pleasure of the open road, other than the cacophony of beeps, blips, bloops and blops that greet us in the latest models. Oh, and the screens. Every year, they try to find a new place to glue a touchscreen in a car, like Pizza Hut hunting for more orifices to stuff cheese into one of their pies.Everything is computerized, automated or impossible to turn off. According to surveys of new-car buyers by the market research firm Strategic Vision, satisfaction with car controlsplummeted by 23 percentage pointsin the last nine years. The whiz-bang gizmos foisted on the North American car buyer have devolved from the glorious, life-saving back-up camera to gesture controls that allow you to turn an invisible knob to crank up the volume onEspressowithout touching a single thing in your vehicle.Elon Musk could be the Democrats’ best hope | Moira DoneganRead moreBack in January of this year, BMWditched gesture controlin their cars after a decade-long run of forcing adults to poke and prod the air like a mime drunk on cheap wine. Gesture control was cheaper for the automaker because they could cut back on making actual knobs, plus it’s just funnier to watch while stuck in traffic.Here’s what you had to dotomake your car work, according to the company:Turn the volume up: circle your finger in a clockwise direction.Turn the volume down: circle your finger in a counter-clockwise direction.Accept a call: point to the BMW iDrive touchscreen.Select navigation/custom setting: use two fingers to point to the touchscreen.Change rearview camera angle: draw a circle using your forefinger and thumb.Regret your life choices: look in the mirror for 10 seconds.When do I have time to learn this? You want me to draw a circle with not just one, buttwoof my fingers? What do I do if I lost a digit in a particularly gruesome lathe accident? Drive an Audi, that’s what.If carmakers aren’t trying to ruin driving, then I’m pretty sure they’re just bored. After decades of the industry claiming an electric car wasn’t commercially viable, the Toyota Prius came along and realigned our expectations of what could be under the hood of a car. The hybrid engine – part gas, part electric – was the first baby step toward the fleets of all-electric vehicles from Chevrolet, Volkswagen and that one used car you are desperately trying to sell butno one would dare drive in it any more.In an effort to solve problems that don’t exist, carmakers are creating more problemsCar companies have solved the greatest problem in the history of automobiles: that these vehicles emitactual poisonwhenever you operate them. So the ennui has set in: “And Alexander wept, seeing as he had no more worlds to conquer.” Yes, but what if Alexander could remove some knobs from the console of your Mini Cooper? Perhaps aretractable door handlethat you constantly have to be reminded how to use? Hey Alexander, quit weeping andstart playing Cat Quest in your car.The Volkswagen ID.4 electric car was designed withelectronic sensors inside the door handles. VW alleged that this helped with “drag reduction”: the handles were flush with the car, making it less wind resistant, or something. This “innovation” barely registered with me. The only drag I care about is banned in Tennessee. Of course, the ID.4 went through a massive recall because water was getting into the door handle sensors and corroding the electronics. Also, drivers reported the doors would open on their ownwhile the car was in motion. At last, I can do a barrel-roll out of my car,hands-free.In an effort to solve problems that don’t exist, carmakers are creating more problems. Ambient lighting to make your car look like an airport lounge. Touchscreens in the passenger seats. Cameras so you canwatch your child pick their noseinstead of looking at the road. Driving is frequently a frustrating pursuit as it is. You have road hazards, aggressive drivers and gridlock to contend with.But, the auto industry says,what if it was worse?I guess that’s why Elon Musk, the world’s least popular car company owner, got into politics. It’s yet another endeavor we all have to suffer through that’s pretty bad, but could be significantly more painful with just a bit of tinkering. Firing countless government workers, gutting entire departments and withholdinglegally appropriated fundsisn’t too far from looking at a car and saying: “What if the door had no handles?”Cars and governments are necessities of modern life. They are because we, the people, designed life to need them. We are hopelessly intertwined with the car, with democracy, with a massive, heaving bureaucracy that does annoying stuff like ensuring we don’t alldie of plagueand our food isn’triddled with rat droppings. To Musk, getting rid of vital government services is just like replacing your air conditioner with an entire video game system.A fun thought experiment! What if you had to solve a series of increasingly complex word games in order to unlock your car? Would you just give up and walk to work?I’m old enough to remember when things got better, not worse. Televisions got bigger, cars became more efficient, movie special effects dazzled us andPizza Hut was still discovering new places to put cheese. Someone decided to put a water dispenser on a refrigerator door and we all rejoiced. Now, technology is solving for issues that don’t exist. AI has finally fixed the problem of …summarizing emails that are a couple paragraphs. Praise the Lord, technology has rid us of the scourge of reading comprehension. And, as an added bonus, now I can turn a photo of myself into aSimpsons character. I can die fulfilled.I contend that things do not have to be worse. In fact, allow me to be so bold as to suggest they could bebetter. When the president of the United States says he “couldn’t care less” if foreign automakers jacked up their prices because of his tariffs, he is saying very plainly that things must be worse for some reason. If we just allow the knobs to be taken out of our cars that now cost twice what they used to, some vague good thing will happen. We’ll be happier. We’ll be richer. We’ll have fewer knob-related injuries, I suppose. Imagine telling someone that you’re about to do a thing that will deeply inconvenience them and then expecting them to be thrilled about it. America used to be a place to value convenience above all else. Today, it feels like what we actually expect is to be harassed, put out and given a screen in our face to shut us up.Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsTechnologyOpinionAutomotive industryElon MuskcommentShareReuse this content"

But it seems that at least 15 million souls have gone in for it and are delighted to know that they have Viking ancestry, or discombobulated to find that they have siblings of whom they were hitherto unaware. The corporate vehicle that enabled these revelations is called 23andMe, which describes itself as a “genetics-led consumer healthcare and biotechnology company empowering a healthier future”.Back in the day, 23andMe was one of those vaunted “unicorns” (privately held startups valued at more than $1bn), but is now facing harder times. Its share price hadfallen precipitatelyfollowing adata breach in October 2023that harvested the profile and ethnicity data of 6.9 million users – including name, profile photo, birth year, location, family surnames, grandparents’ birthplaces, ethnicity estimates and mitochondrial DNA – and there have been internal disagreements between its board and the CEO and co-founder, Anne Wojcicki. So on 24 March itfiled for so-called Chapter 11 proceedingsin a US bankruptcy court in Missouri.At which point the proverbial ordure hit the fan because the bankruptcy proceedings involve 23andMe seeking authorisation from the court to commence “a process to sell substantially all of its assets through a Chapter 11 plan or pursuant to Section 363 of the US Bankruptcy Code”.And those assets are… well, basically the genetic data of the company’s 15 million users. And the problem is that these assets are very attractive to many potential purchasers – some good (medical researchers, for example) and some not so good (marketers, scammers, spooks and authoritarians, to name just a few). A person’s genome yields information about biological characteristics (eye and hair colour, height predisposition); health (disease risk, cancer susceptibility, recessive genetic conditions that could be passed on to offspring, how they might respond to certain medications); information about ancestry; and of course precise identification for forensic purposes.Genetic data can reveal a lot about a person, from their health predispositions and vulnerabilities to even their food preferences. Researchers at Edinburgh University and Milan, for example, haveidentified hundreds of genetic variants– differences in people’s genetic make-up – linked with their liking for specific foods, including ones associated with a love of aniseed, avocados, chillies, steak, oily fish and many more.If your credit card is hacked, you can always get a new replacement. But you can’t get a new genomeBut the really important thing is that genetic data is permanent, unique and immutable. If your credit card is hacked, you can always get a new replacement. But you can’t get a new genome.When 23andMe’s data assets come up for sale the queue of likely buyers is going to be long, with health insurance and pharmaceutical giants at the front, followed by hedge-funds, private equity vultures and advertisers, with marketers bringing up the rear. Since these outfits are not charitable ventures, it’s a racing certainty that they have plans for exploiting those data assets, though they will be, er, economical with the truth about their intentions.In 2020, ancestry.com, a US genealogy company that operates a network of genealogical, historical records and related genetic genealogy websites, was bought by the Blackstone group for $4.7bn. When theLos Angeles Timesstarted asking questions about why one of the world’s biggest asset-management firms was interested in genealogy,the company declared: “We invested in Ancestry because it is a clear leader in its industry with a digital subscription business that has continued to grow significantly. Blackstone has not and will not access user DNA and family tree data, and we will not be sharing this data with our other companies. To be crystal clear, doing so was never part of our investment thesis – period.” Aw, shucks: a megacorp settling for modest subscription revenues.What can those who entrusted their genetic information to 23andMe do to ensure that their ultra-personal data isn’t enriching its new owners? There’s plenty of good advice available. California’s attorney general, Rob Bonta, immediatelyissued a consumer alertto the company’s customers, advising them to delete their data and destroy any samples of genetic material held by the company – and to revoke permission for their data to be used for research. Similar advice came from theNew York Timesand theElectronic Frontier Foundation.But perhaps the best advice of all is to think before you sign up for any of these services. Asurvey of 23andMe customersin 2017 and 2018 showed that more than 40% were unaware that data sharing was part of the company’s business model. Once upon a time, we used to say that “if the service is free, then you’re the product”. Turns out that even if it’s not free, you’re still the product.What I’ve been readingNaked self-interestThe imperialism has no clothesis a nice Substack essay by historian Timothy Snyder about JD Vance’s ludicrous visit to Greenland.Breaking newsCan journalism survive Trump?

It must be guided more by its progressive values rather than political expediencySat 5 Apr 2025 14.30 EDTLast modified on Sat 5 Apr 2025 16.28 EDTShareThe market reaction to Donald Trump’s announcement last Wednesday that he would be levying punitive tariffs on imports from the rest of the world was immediate: US stock markets experienced theirworst single-day decline since Covid. The long-term implications will depend on how permanent Trump’s reshaping of the global economic order turns out to be. At the moment, his administration is sending contradictory signals as to whether these tariffs are here to stay, or whether they are intended to be used to in effect blackmail other countries into doing the bidding of the US. But the global recession they could trigger raises huge strategic headaches for a British government already struggling to square the fiscal circle and deliver its pledge to boost growth.There is no logic to Trump’s trade populism: contrary to his claims, the US has done immensely well out of being the dominant economy in the global free trade system of recent decades. If Trump doesn’t change course quickly, his act of economic self-sabotage will reverberate around the world, harming not just Americans, but triggering increasing poverty in America’s poorer trading partners, generating even more of the global instability that has become synonymous with Trump’s presidency.In the UK, much of the focus is on whetherKeir Starmerwill be able to negotiate a trade deal that reduces or even eliminates the 10% tariffs imposed on British exports to the US. While this goal is entirely legitimate, it comes with some nasty traps. Trump is unpredictable and self-interested when it comes to negotiations. That the UK has escaped relatively lightly compared with the EU, which faces 20% tariffs, or China, with 34%, is likely to be because of the formula Trump used to calculate tariffs, as opposed to any diplomatic strategy from the British government. The US has a trading surplus in goods with the UK, which accounts for the minimum baseline tariff being applied.The direct impact of these tariffs, given our relatively limited volume of exports to the US compared with a closer market like the EU, will be painful for those exporters it affects hardest, but more manageable for the UK as a whole compared to some other countries. The biggest risk is a more macro one: first, that British producers will face competition from the UK being flooded with cheaper imports that would have been once been destined from the US, and second, that the global recession and ongoing trade war could trigger what would inevitably have ahuge knock-on impacton British economic growth.There is no logic to Trump’s trade populism: the US has done well out of the global free trade systemThere is a risk that theTrump administrationwill make unsustainable or intolerable demands of the UK – such as lowering our regulatory standards, or lifting VAT on American imports – in exchange for a deal that might offer us little protection from the broader effects of a trade war. Such a deal could make it harder for us to do business with the EU, with whom we trade in far greater volume than with the US. Ministers cannot have too much riding on a potential deal with the US.The bigger global consequences of a trade war – which no trade deal with the US can protect us from, even if one were to be forthcoming – raise two urgent questions for the government. The first is what it can do to reset our trading relationship with the EU, which remains our biggest and closest trading partner – that is more aligned with our regulatory standards. A stronger relationship with the EU will provide more economic resilience than a trade deal with the US and should be a priority.The government has taken important steps to align with EU regulations through theProduct Regulation and Metrology Bill, but there is no substitute for rejoining the customs union and single market in terms of eliminating trade barriers, and ministers should be working to achieve this as a longer term goal. An EU reset and a trade deal with the US may, or may not, be achievable at once: if there is a trade off between the two, economic good sense dictates that Starmer should look east to our more reliable European allies than across the Atlantic to Trump.The second problem is what a global recession means for the chancellor’s fiscal arithmetic. Labour’s strategy to transform the country is entirely contingent on economic growth – promised during the election to revitalise the economy and generate the tax revenues needed to reduce rising rates of child poverty and improve Britain’s creaking public services and infrastructure.But with the UK’s growth forecast slashed in the weeks before Trump’s tariff announcement, Rachel Reeves faced a choice between cutting spending, raising taxes or relaxing her fiscal rules to allow her to borrow more.She decided to cut disability benefitsby several billion, a move that will only serve to increase disability and child poverty, instead of opting for alternative solutions that would have shared the burden more fairly, such as freezing income tax and national insurance thresholds for two years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Starmer’s pledge to transform Britain’s growth prospects withinfive years was never realistic but Trump’s election has made a set of infelicitous circumstances far worse. We are living through a new age of sharp global insecurity characterised by damaging economic shocks and increasing levels of war and conflict.

The feat will be achieved using a special radar scanner that has been fitted to a probe, named Biomass, that will be fired into the Earth’s orbit later this month.For the next five years, the 1.25-tonne spacecraft will sweep over the tropical rainforests of Africa, Asia and South America and peer through their dense 40m-high ­canopies to study the vegetation that lies beneath. The data collected by Biomass will then be used to create unique 3D maps of forests normally hidden from human sight.Less than 2% of sunlight reaches the forest floor in these regions, yet Biomass will study them in unsurpassed detail from a height of more than 600km. More importantly, the mission will allow scientists to calculate how much carbon is stored in the forests and measure how levels are changing as humans continue tocut down trees in the tropicsand increase carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere.View image in fullscreenThe 1.25-tonne spacecraft will sweep over the tropical rainforests of Africa, Asia and South America.Photograph: GettyTim82/Getty ImagesIn addition, Biomass – which has been built by a consortium led by Airbus UK and funded by theEuropean Space Agency(Esa) – will map the sub-surface geology and topography of forest floors while it will also provide data about the rate at which biodiversity is being lost as forests are cleared for mining and agriculture.“We need to know the health of our tropical forests,” Simonetta Cheli, director of Earth Observation Programmes for Esa, told theObserverlast week: “We need to know the quality and diversity of its vegetation and the amount of carbon stored there. To get that information we are going to create 3D images of them – from the top of the forest canopy to the roots of its trees.”Tropical forests play a crucial role in protecting the planet from some of the worst effects of global warming because they absorb so much carbon dioxide from the atmosphere: estimates suggest they take up about eight billion tonnes and are often described as the Earth’s green lungs.But deforestation and environmental degradation are now reversing this effect. Carbon, once stored in vast amounts, is being put back into the atmosphere, adding to growing levels of greenhouse gases. Hotspots include northern regions of South America, sub-Saharan Africa, south-east Asia and the Pacific where increased production of beef, soya, coffee, cacao, palm oil and timber aretriggering widespread deforestation.Quantifying the problem is essential for forecasting what is going to happen to Earth’s climate in coming years, said Bjorn Rommen, mission scientist for the Biomass project: “We don’t properly understand what changes are now taking place, partly because we do not have accurate estimations of carbon levels in these forests. Biomass is going to help us to get a better grip on those numbers.”Biomass is scheduled to be launched from Esa’s spaceport near Kourou in French Guiana on 29 April on aVegaC rocketand will carry a radar known as a P-band synthetic aperture radar. Its use of long wavelength signals will allow it to peer down through canopies in order to assess how much carbon is stored on the floor and branches of the trees in the world’s tropical forests and to assess how levels are changing. This type of radar has never been flown in space before and has required Biomass to be fitted with a giant 12m antenna which will be deployed as the spacecraft begins its sweep over the Earth.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

So we are going to be able to weigh the carbon content of the world’s tropical forests from space and, crucially, work out how much these are changing over time. We will then know the balance of carbon that is flowing to and from the atmosphere. That is enormously important.”This point was backed by Cheli. “We need to be able to predict what the Earth will look like as temperatures rise.

As fires increasingly spread deep into neighborhoods, researchers estimate roughly 115 million people – more than a third of the US population –live in areas that could host the next fire catastrophe.The understanding that many more Americans are at risk of losing their homes to wildfires comes as the climate crisis turns up the dial on extreme weather, drought and heat. But it’s also the result of new research that has exposed deep and dangerous gaps in our understanding of the threat.“The risks are more extensive than people think,” said Joe H Scott, the chief fire scientist at the wildfire risk research firm Pyrologix. Recent tragedies have added to grim examples of what’s possible when the right conditions align.There was Lahaina in 2023, when a firestorm killed 102 people and turned the historic Maui town into smoldering ruins. In 2021, powerful gusts drove flames through suburbs of Boulder, Colorado, as the Marshall fire became the most destructive in state history. And, in January, 30 people were killed and homes on all sides ofLos Angeleswere flattened when the fierce Santa Ana winds rained embers across neighborhoods.View image in fullscreenVal Casco and her grandsons Hawea Casco, 9, and Hanuola Casco, 6, stand at the entrance to her home in Lahaina on 24 August 2023. The house was destroyed in the 8 August wildfires that tore through Maui.Photograph: Tamir Kalifa/Washington Post/Getty ImagesKey stakeholders – scientists, first responders and members of the insurance industry among them – are racing to understand the dynamics that drive these types of fires.They’ve learned that flames enter and move through structures differently from when they burn through backcountry, complicating scientific models used for decades that showed wildfires fizzled out at the edges of neighborhoods. Realizing that homes themselves serve as fuel, they’re working to build new tools that will help at-risk residents adapt.Still, a stark disconnect about who is vulnerable remains, researchers say. Many of the suburbs and cities hit hardest by wildfire in recent years were caught off-guard. Millions more across the country don’t know that they are at risk.“It is obvious wildfire and wildland urban fire is increasing,” Scott said. “Fire reached all of those places and did really damaging stuff. What other places are like that? The answer is, almost anywhere.”The watershed year of ‘oh, no’Long before flames roared through Lahaina, near Boulder and into neighborhoods across Los Angeles, researchers knew the hazards were there.But there were blind spots.It was clear that homes nestled deep in forests or canyons were in danger, but not as clear about the towns and cities just beyond them. Then, the towns and cities started to burn.“You can really trace it back to around 2017,” said David Acuna, a battalion chief at Cal Fire, California’s fire agency. It was the watershed year of “oh, no”, he added.In the state of California alone,more than 10,000 homes were damaged or destroyed by fire. The Thomas fire, which raged through neighborhoods in Ventura county, consumed more than a thousand homes alone.Drone shot of neighborhood burned to the groundAerial video from March shows the devastation wildfires caused in Los Angeles’s Pacific Palisades neighborhood. Video: Thalia Juarez/GuardianIt was a record-setting fire in a record-setting year. And the records wouldn’t last long.The following year, the Camp fire would wipe the town of Paradise from the map. The blaze claimed 85 lives, including many people who perished while they were rushing to escape. More than 18,800 structures were reduced to rubble.Following those disasters, researchers intensified their efforts to try to understand the dynamic set of conditions that sent flames surging out of the wildland and into communities.Meanwhile, the conditions – and the fires fed by them – were also changing.In California and other states across the American west, a region always exposed to extremes, swings between intense periods of wetness and dryness became more intense. Strong rains spurred dense vegetation in spring, while spiking temperatures in summer parched the young plants and turned them to tinder.View image in fullscreenA firefighter with the US Forest Service checks for flare-ups in Los Angeles after the Palisades fire, on 10 January 2025.Photograph: Gabrielle Canon/GuardianIn northern forests, centuries of fire suppression led to unhealthy overgrowth that helped create more catastrophic burns. To the south, meanwhile, too-frequent fires and long stretches of drought damaged native plants, leaving more landscapes open to the spread of invasive grasses that grew and dried quickly.Fire season, which was once confined to a window during the year when the weather was hot and dry, now started earlier and lingered longer, ultimately stretching further into the winter and autumn months when strong winds tended to whip through the west.“Climate change is giving fires more time, and giving them more time gives them more access to bad conditions,” Scott said.Temperatures and low humidity, which used to calm after the sun went down, were now continuing into the night. When fires are given more time to spread, they grow exponentially, according to Scott: “If you give a fire 10% more time to grow, it doesn’t just get 10% bigger – it gets 20 or 30% bigger.”A growing ‘wildland/urban interface’Even with behemoth blazes on the rise, development into once-wild areas continued a steady march, lining once-rugged hillsides and valleys with flanks of homes. The outcome of both housing shortages and growing costs in cities, along with the pull of rural living, these communities can increasingly be seen across Los Angeles, scattered through Oregon, or in Texas ranges.Many were built directly into the wildland, expanding the “wildland/urban interface”, a term used to describe areas where there was a high chance of direct impact from fires. The population living in these WUI zonesroughly doubled from 1990 to 2010, according to a study published by Stanford University researchers in 2022.Two maps that flip back and forthThe team of climate scientists, fire scientists and eco-hydrologists found that areas with the most rapidly rising risks were among the most popular: the numbers of people living in the highest-hazard regions grew by 160% during that decade.More people residing in danger areas means more people who could be affected if a fire starts. More peoplealso mean a greater chance for accidental ignitionsthat can turn into infernos. Utility lines that pop up alongside developments can malfunction during extreme weather events, lawnmowers can spark the grasses they are cutting, and cars and trucks increasingly start fires in the vegetation that lines roads.View image in fullscreenThe suburban Porter Ranch neighborhood of Los Angeles in March.Photograph: Thalia Juarez/GuardianA growing number of high-risk zonesWhile it’s part of the explanation of the US’s growing fire risk, the wildland/urban interface phenomenon isn’t the only one. It doesn’t capture the growing risks to neighborhoods not as rural or remote, neighborhoods where residents felt far away from hillsides, grasslands or forests, and safely guarded by blocks of sidewalks and shopping districts.“I was not technically in a high-risk zone,” said Loretta Williams, an Altadena resident whose home was leveled during January’s Eaton fire in Los Angeles. She knows, because she was concerned when she bought her house back in 1999 and looked the zones up herself.Thediverse district, rich with historic landmarks and deep community ties, stood nestled against the San Gabriel mountains. Those closer to the hills understood the dangers, but even after multiple fires churned through vegetation along the slopes through the years, residents farther away were assured by the miles between the hills and their homes.On the night Williams’s home burned, she recalled, it seemed as if catapults were launching fireballs from on high.Her house was not in the WUI. It was in the ember zone.Map of the Altadena neighborhood of Los Angeles with a green overlay of wildland and an orange overlay of an ember zone. Within the emberzone are annotated buildings damaged in the January wildfires.“When you have a high wind blowing a fire, the fire is not on the ground, it is in the air,” said Hugh Safford, a fire ecologist at the University of California at Davis and a regional director for the California Fire Science Consortium. Embers can cast flames miles ahead of the fire front, “exploding the entire landscape at once as this whole thing rolls down the mountain”, he said.In past years, scientists have come to agree that embers help push fire footprints over larger swaths of land, but they also pose particularly high risks to homes. Drips of fire can land in decorative landscaping, waft into uncovered air vents or settle on eaves, quickly turning a wildfire into an urban conflagration that sweeps from house to house.In extreme cases, embers have been documented traveling more than 10 miles (17km). But typically encompassinga mile and a half, the ember zone significantly expands the range of danger into suburbs and cities alike. The homes that burned in Los Angeles last month were in the ember zone, according to maps created by the US Fire Administration that detail the threats. There are thousands more across the city that remain at risk; in Los Angeles county, there are close to 9,000 structures in the wildland areabut 1.3m in the ember zone.While wind can add erratic elements to a fire, carrying embers farther, parched plants also play a role.“Dead fuels get turned into embers really easily,” Safford said.Embers are just the beginning, though. Once they find their targets and begin to burn a structure, the flames are then more likely to spread from home to home, according to Dr Michael Gollner, associate professor of mechanical engineering at the University of California at Berkeley. In September last year, he and his team at the school’s Fire Research Lab released a new type of model that wasthe first to fully reflect how fire moves through structures.The work has provided an important piece to a puzzle that has long eluded fire-response experts, who have had to rely on models that only capture fire behavior in wildland and not in developed areas.Looping video of an ember test on two homes, one prepared for wildfires, the others not. The one that is unprepared is engulfed in flames after 16 minutes.It also builds on other models created to expand public understanding of the risks. The United States Forest Service, for example, has a tool thatcategorizes wildfire riskto communities with approximations of the ember zone.On an interactive website, maps show risk to homes with an index of where wildfires are likely and where intensity will be high. Los Angeles, for example, has a very high risk of wildfires –higher than 98% of communities in the US– according to their model.There are more than1,100 communities in 32 states across the US with characteristics similar to those that burnedin the LA fires, the data from their project shows – and they aren’t only in the west.More than half with the highest potential for disaster are scattered in other regions, and Florida, Texas, Oklahoma and Alabama rank among the top 10 states facing high threats from urban fire catastrophes, according to a new analysis done by the research organization Headwaters Economics that used that data.“People were surprised that fire got into those communities that have burned in recent years,” said Greg Dillon, director of the Fire Modeling Institute for the USFS. He worked with Scott to build the project and said of the devastating fires that burned homes inHawaiiand Colorado: “In hindsight, we can look back into our data and see we had predicted those places to have very high wildfire risk.”Racing to learn how urban fires behaveExpanding the footprint of where the risks lie is just the beginning. Researchers are now working to learn how fires in urban centers behave – and how they can help residents prepare.The Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety, a non-profit research and communications organization funded by the insurance industry, started a 10-year project in 2018 to look at how wind-driven fires spread from building to building. Their research relies on observations straight from the source: they are burning structures down.With large fans housed in air hangars, researchers are setting the conditions and testing materials. They are positioning structures at different proximities to find the sweet spots for spacing. Piece by piece, they are starting to puzzle together the recipes for resilience.Already they have honed in on the series of attributes that often create catastrophes: drought conditions and winds gusting at least 20mph, densely packed structures with highly flammable exteriors, and a pathway of fuel for the fire – landscaping plants or fences that feed flames onto homes.“When embers land around or on buildings, in the first few minutes after ignition the flame is a few inches tall,” said Dr Faraz Hedayati, the lead researcher for the project. With enough fuel, though, whether that’s a decorative bush, an open trash bin or a wood-shingled roof, the fire grows taller.Higher flame lengths are harder to fight and can spread quickly, especially in windy conditions. Once the flame has gotten into or onto a structure, it almost always results in ruin. Ninety percent of structures built without fire-resistant materials will be fully destroyed after that point, according to their research.The left image depicts plants cascading over the back wall of a home, while the right image shows charred trees against a fence.Plants or fences that can feed flames onto homes are among a series of attributes that often create catastrophes.

Even the best fire-resistant materials on newer homes built to higher standards are vulnerable to sustained radiant heat when there’s less than 20ft (6 metres) of space.In a dense neighborhood, where sheds, fences, shrubs and accessory dwelling unites (ADUs) are packed between homes, fires have plenty of fuel and can consume blocks at a time.Often, when the fierce winds blow, several dynamics are happening at once: embers shower from above, starting fresh fires that sweep between structures on the ground.That’s why, the experts say, limiting fuel for both forms of fire is essential to stopping spread. “Zone 0” instructs residents to remove anything burnable from within 5ft (1.5 metres) of a house.Wood fences or trellises shouldn’t hug homes. Mulch must be cleared. Trees, plants and storage structures have to be set back, allowing enough space for an ember to snuff out before it’s given a chance to grow. Farther out from 5ft, vegetation should also be managed and spaced, with specific recommendations set for zone 1 (5-30ft) and zone 2 (30-100ft).Firefighters rely on defensible space to stage their battles more safely and a slower-moving fire is far easier to extinguish.Clearing the space could prove incredibly effective, but it’s a challenging change to implement. Beloved trees and plants may have to be culled from neighborhoods that pride themselves on landscaping. It may mean sacrificing shade in urban centers grappling with spiking temperatures in favor of protecting against ignitions.View image in fullscreenResidents survey the destruction in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood.Photograph: Gabrielle Canon/GuardianFor now, researchers are focused on providing as much information as possible to empower more people to make these decisions, from new models that can provide firefighters better intel while battling the flames, to tools communities can use to lessen their risk.While large-scale fire disasters are still relatively rare, they are on the rise. There is more to learn, and even more to do.

Still, under Joe Biden, the agency began putting in place some bans, such as on the use of formaldehyde in consumer goods, includingleather.PFAS are among the most widely used and toxic chemicals in consumer products, and many states have zeroed in on the chemical class. Maine in 2021 passed a ban onPFASfor all non-essential uses, while across the country about 15 states have enacted a patchwork of prohibitions for clothing, menstruation products, cookware, food packaging, playground equipment, and cosmetics, among other goods.Massachusetts and ConnecticutbannedPFAS in firefighting turnout gear after firefighters demanded action in response to high cancer rates likely connected to the chemicals.Beyond PFAS, Washington prohibited lead in cookware; Nevada banned flame retardants in children’s toys; and Maryland prohibited some phthalates in cosmetics, among other actions.“The states are on the front lines and they’ve been stepping up because communities want these laws,” said Sarah Doll, the national director of Safer States, which pushes for state level restrictions on toxic chemicals. “People don’t want toxic chemicals in their homes. Firefighters don’t want to be exposed to PFAS in firefighting foam.”The state laws are also effective because theycreate pressureon industry to stop using dangerous chemicals. PFAS is banned for use in clothing in California, Colorado and other states, so it makes logistical sense for producers to stop using the chemicals instead of producing some clothing treated with it and some untreated.Chemical giant 3M announced it would stop making PFAS in part because state laws banning the chemicals complicates their use.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThe laws’ effectiveness and pressure have put them on industry’s hit list, and the Trump EPA submitted a rule that reworks how risk evaluations are performed.The Biden EPA approach stated that if any specific use of a chemical – clothing, cosmetics, or food packaging, for example – presents an “unreasonable risk”, the entire chemical should be considered a risk. States can regulate chemicals that are considered an unreasonable risk.The Trump EPA’s new rule would require the agency to evaluate whether a chemical presents a risk for each intended use. Formaldehyde, for example, has 63 uses. The agency plans to claim most chemicals do not present an “unreasonable risk” in consumer goods because they make up such a small part of products, the EPA employee said.Industry scored a major victory in a 2016 rewrite of the nation’s laws around toxic chemicals by working in a provision that says if the EPA finds that a substance does not present an “unreasonable risk” then states cannot write laws banning or limiting its use.“They are going to exclude a huge number of consumer products from being considered for risk management,” the EPA employee said.They added that an individual television may contain a small amount of PFAS, “but when you produce 50m televisions, it adds up” – especially for the environment, or for workers producing them.However, the laws will not go into effect overnight. The EPA, with its limited staff, has to regulate one chemical at a time, and the process for each could take as much as three years. In the meantime, more state laws will be passed, and pressure on goods producers to move away from toxic chemicals will continue to mount, Doll said.“The market is moving, adapting and innovating … and in three years it will to great effect have already shifted,” Doll added. “It’s a potential threat, but I don’t think it’s going to have a chilling effect on states responding to demands from communities on the ground who are saying, ‘We are dealing with this challenge.’”Explore more on these topicsPFASTrump administrationUS Environmental Protection AgencyUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The largest international survey ever conducted on diet and endometriosis, involving 2,599 people, found 45% of those who stopped eating gluten and 45% of those who cut out dairy reported experiencing an improvement in their pain.When women cut down on coffee or other caffeine in their diet, 43% said their pain was reduced, while 53% of women who cut back on alcohol reported the same.Philippa Saunders, senior author of the study and professor of reproductive steroids at the University of Edinburgh, said: “It really feels like we are on the cusp of something pretty big with understanding how diet affects endometriosis symptoms.“It is so important for women if they feel they can do something for themselves to tackle the pain of endometriosis – that is tremendously empowering.”Endometriosis occurs when cells similar to those in the lining of the womb grow in other parts of the body. It affects one in 10 women of reproductive age in the UK.However, there is very little research into the causes of the disease or how to treat it – beyond surgery, which is often only a short-term fix, or managing symptoms through hormonal contraceptives like the pill, which many women dislike because of side effects. It takes an average of almost seven years for women to receive a diagnosis of endometriosis due to lack of awareness about the disease.The new study, led by Edinburgh University and published last week in the American medical Association’s journal JAMA Network Open, asked volunteers about changes to their diet and about dietary supplements used to try to improve their symptoms. Researchers believe that the women who cut out gluten or dairy and reported feeling less pain may have experienced changes in their gut bacteria.Reducing caffeine may work because it can affect sleep, and pain often feels worse when people are tired. Cutting back on alcoholic drinks is potentially impactful because alcohol has a similar effect on cells to oestrogen – the hormone that fuels endometriosis.Endometriosis largely causes pain in the pelvic area, which is often worse during periods, but many sufferers report sciatic pain, with others experiencing breast pain or a flu-like joint pain affecting the whole body.The womb-like tissue of endometriosis is able to grow new nerve cells – the cells that transmit pain sensations – and make existing nerve cells more active. The pain signals this sends to the brain are increased even more by inflammation – an overreaction of the immune system. It is this inflammation that could be tackled by dietary changes, experts believe.Cutting back on certain foods may reduce bacteria in the gut that powers inflammation. The study found almost 40% of respondents reported reduced pain from endometriosis after cutting out processed food like ready meals, ice-cream and sweets, which are known to alter gut bacteria.Almost a third of women said their pain improved after cutting out garlic and onion, which could relieve so-called “endo belly” – uncomfortable bloating sufferers can experience.Experts say people should check with their doctor before making dietary changes. Larger studies, with women randomly assigned to different diets, are still needed to gather compelling evidence on how diet might affect endometriosis, and could include measurements of people’s inflammation and pain.The Edinburgh study relied on self-reported pain levels and surveyed people from 51 countries, including 1,115 people from the UK.Francesca Hearn-Yeates, who led the study from the University of Edinburgh, said: “Women are in need of anything that can help with the pain of endometriosis. This condition is so under-researched and there is so much to discover, but there is growing evidence that gut bacteria could play a part in symptoms, and that explains why many women have experimented with changing their diets, and why we have found that this appears to work for many.”Jo Hanley, specialist adviser for Endometriosis UK, said: “We follow with interest studies on the potential impact and role of diet and nutrition in the management of endometriosis.“There is a need for more high-quality evidence but I’ve heard many a success story from individuals where dietary changes have led to improved pain, although unfortunately others have reported no improvements.“An anti-inflammatory diet can help reduce the body’s inflammation response, and anti-inflammatory foods can include fruit, vegetables, beans, chickpeas, wholegrains, nuts, seeds and olive oil, with some fish and poultry.“Foods that contain refined sugars, carbohydrates, unhealthy fats, dairy, red and processed meats … can create inflammation in the body. I would advise keeping a food and symptom diary, which will help to identify any food triggers that could be flaring symptoms such as constipation and bloating, which make pain worse.”Ying Cheong, professor of reproductive medicine at the University of Southampton, said: “While these self-reported benefits are promising, further clinical research is needed to confirm the true impact of specific dietary changes.”Dr Nilufer Rahmioglu, senior research scientist at Nuffield Department of Women’s and ReproductiveHealthwithin the University of Oxford, said: ‘This study provides valuable insights into the lived experiences of individuals with endometriosis who have explored dietary modifications and supplements to manage their pain.“While it cannot assess causality, the findings highlight the need for further rigorous research into these potential non-hormonal strategies.”Explore more on these topicsEndometriosisThe ObserverWomenHealthDiets and dietingnewsShareReuse this content"

These include 94 employees who each received more than £150,000 in the year to 31 March 2024.DHSC accounts reveal the average cost per employee of exit packages from it and its agencies that year was £48,840. Based on these figures, the next round of redundances could cost between £700m and £1.2bn.Labour has previously called the hundreds of millions of pounds in redundancy payouts presided over by Tory health secretaryAndrew Lansleyin the reforms of 2012-13 a “colossal waste” of public funds. Lansley’s reforms led to the creation of NHS England, which Labour has described as the world’s biggest quango and which is now being disbanded.The health secretary,Wes Streeting, will be questioned by MPs on the parliamentary health select committee on Tuesday about his reforms. Streeting has said the scrapping of NHS England is the “final nail in the coffin” of the 2012 reorganisation, with sources briefing that it will save as much as £500m a year.Siva Anandaciva, director of policy, events and partnership at the King’s Fund, an independent thinktank, has warned that the scrapping of NHS England could be a “massive roadbump” in the development of a new 10-year health plan for the health service. “It’s a huge distraction to keep reorganising the NHS,” he said.Mark Exworthy, professor of health policy and management at Birmingham University, said there had been a duplication of roles in NHS England, but it was not clear how abolition would help deliver Labour’s key health objectives. He said: “It might be seen as a high-level reorganisation, well away from patient care, but it will have impacts down the line.”An analysis by the Nuffield Trust thinktank found the proposed cuts in NHS central and support staffing levels will mean fewer full-time equivalent staff in those roles than in 2013.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He added: “You need to make sure there is regional support for local [NHS] organisations or there is a risk you could be left with a real void.”A DHSC spokesperson said: “The figures claimed are based completely on speculation and not on fact. Our plans to bring the NHS back into the department will eliminate duplication, freeing up hundreds of millions of pounds for frontline care to deliver better treatment for patients.“We are investing an extra £26bn in health and care, and thanks to the reforms so far we are already delivering on our mission to cut waiting lists – delivering an extra two million appointments and cutting the waiting list by 193,000 since July.”Explore more on these topicsNHSThe ObserverRedundancyHealthAndrew LansleyWes StreetingHealth policyPublic services policyShareReuse this content"

Much of the increase in spending is linked to a huge rise in the number of working-age adults claiming disability benefits linked to mental ill health on a scale that demands a policy response. At the heart of the debate is the question of what has caused this increase and how it could be reversed.Worsening mental healthIn 2002, mental and behavioural problems were the main condition for 25% of claimants. By 2024, the figure had risen to 44%, withmore than half (55%) of the post-pandemic rise in disability benefitsaccounted for by claims primarily for mental health, according to a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) thinktank. The same report found “compelling evidence that mental health has worsened since the pandemic” and experts agree with this assessment.“We observe clear trends of increasing mental ill health,” says Dr Darío Moreno-Agostino, who researches population mental health at University College London and King’s College London. His team’s analysis of longitudinal data, tracking cohorts born in 1970, 1958 and 1946, suggests that fafter the pandemicall three generations reached or surpassed the worst mental health levelsin 40 years.“We don’t know exactly the reasons, but there are some clear candidates,” says Moreno-Agostino. “Socioeconomic adversity is one of the fundamental measures of mental health inequalities. I don’t think that there’s evidence that this is due to overdiagnosis.”NHS records reveal similarly stark trends. The number of people in contact with secondary mental health services rose by 600,000 between 2019 and 2024 – a 45% increase in five years,according to data from the Care Quality Commission, which said the increase in appointments had not kept pace with this trend. In June 2024, very urgent referrals to crisis teams for adultswere 45% higher than just one year earlier. Rates of common mental disordersmore than doubled in 16- to 24-year-olds between 2000 and 2019and have increased more steeply since then.As the NHS has struggled to keep pace, clinicians are witnessing a steady increase in the severity of cases, designated green, amber or red. “In the past we’d see a mixture of green, amber and red,” says Prof Daisy Fancourt, the head of the social biobehavioural research group at UCL. “Now it’s basically all red cases and a few amber. There isn’t actually the space to see the greens.”Fancourt, too, is sceptical that overdiagnosis is at play. “We’re going through extremely difficult times for young people,” she says. “Poverty, Covid disrupted young people’s lives at a critical time, the difficulty securing housing and employment, existential challenges, global strife, climate change. On top of that we have challenges around social media and increased availability of global news.”Unequal diagnosisThere are also striking inequalities in who receives a diagnosis, according to a recent study by Prof Susan McPherson, a social psychologist at the University of Essex. The research found there were12 times as many people with “undiagnosed distress”(symptoms severe enough to meet clinical diagnostic criteria) as there were people with diagnoses in the absence of clinically significant symptoms, using data from theUK Longitudinal Household Study. The “overdiagnosed” group was so small, McPherson says, that they were almost excluded from the analysis for statistical reasons.People living with a disability had nearly three times the risk of undiagnosed distress compared with those without a disability and women had 1.5 times the risk of being undiagnosed. Both these groups were also at greater risk of having questionable diagnoses (although in much smaller numbers) highlighting that over- and under-diagnosis coexist in a health system that,the study suggests, is designed around “patriarchal and ableist concepts of normality”. “They can be misunderstood in both ways,” says McPherson. “It suggests that mental health services just aren’t geared up to meet their needs.”While her research undermines Streeting’s claim, McPherson is critical of an “over medicalisation” of mental health.“There’s a huge problem out there and we can’t make it go away just by saying it’s overdiagnosis. But diagnosing it all is not the solution either,” she says. “The answer is looking at the problem from a more social and economic perspective.”Social and economic adversitySpeaking to experts, a recurring theme is the role of social and economic adversity in mental ill health and the NHS is grappling with how to reflect this at a time of widening inequalities. Social prescribing, which aims to improve the health and wellbeing of patients by connecting them to community resources and activities,has tripled in the last three years.“A lot of the time when people have milder problems there can be community-based solutions,” says Fancourt, who is running trials of social prescribing for young people on mental health waiting lists and in schools. Participants are offered six hour-long sessions with a link worker, who supports them in taking up hobbies, getting involved in volunteering, sport, social activities or dealing with practical challenges around transport or housing. The concept has faced some criticism,with one study of 6,500 people failing to identify evidence of efficacyand concerns over whether patients might feel dismissed. Fancourt agrees that further research is needed, but said demand for the schemes had been far greater than anticipated.“It’s extremely popular across age groups,” she says. “It’s not a pill, it’s not a stigmatising treatment. People are building new identities that are based around their hobbies. It’s an asset rather than a deficit-based approach.”The welfare systemThere is also a question of how the welfare system has played a role in shaping the public conversation around mental health.“The way the system has been designed, you’re either fit for work or ill,” says Dr Annie Irvine, a lecturer in social policy at the University of York.“The only part of people’s life situation that the welfare system is interested in hearing about and legitimising is the health part,” she adds. “No matter what other issues you’re also dealing with – housing, lone parenthood, domestic violence, relationship breakdown, caring – the only part of that the system has a space for at the moment is the mental distress part.”Irvine is not questioning the legitimacy of people’s mental distress. “This idea of shirkers and scroungers claiming benefits by choice is just not reflected in the research I have done,” she says. However, based on her qualitative research with welfare recipients, she argues that mental health is often not the only significant barrier to employment.“The barriers to work are much broader than that,” she says. “To bring those numbers down, you need to look beyond the medicalised explanation for worklessness.”The government’s green paper, Irvine says, shows some encouraging signs of recognising this bigger picture.Many are concerned, though, that “overdiagnosis” is a politically convenient idea at a time when squeezing benefits spending is a priority and when the more ingrained determinants of mental health are difficult to fix.“Identifying it as an individual crisis of care speaks to a wider political motive,” says Prof Ewen Speed, a medical sociologist at the University of Essex. “It backgrounds a social crisis of inequality. To talk about this as overdiagnosis is a mischaracterisation of the scope of the problem.”Explore more on these topicsMental healthHealthWelfareBenefitsWes StreetingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On Friday she was found guilty of two charges of breaching the order.She was given a conditional discharge and ordered not to commit any additional offences over a two-year period. She was ordered to pay costs of £20,000 towards what the judge said had been the “considerable” resources expended by the local authority, along with £26 towards a victim surcharge fee.Tossici-Bolt told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Saturday: “I was not there to express my views. I was there to offer free conversation, consensual conversation, to anyone who wanted to speak to me and not on the topics I want to speak. I was there to listen.”She added: “I was there not to make any woman unhappy or distressed. I was there to speak to everyone in the community that wanted to have a conversation with me.“Certainly, anyone could have approached me, including, if they wanted to, women accessing the clinic. It was up to them and I was there to listen to them, not to try and convince them at all. I was just there for everyone just to talk to me.”When asked if she was there to try to get the women to change their minds, she said: “No, absolutely not.”Tossici-Bolt’s lawyer, Jeremiah Igunnubole, said he and his team were “exploring all legal options”. “We need to look very closely at the legal decision made yesterday and also the prosecution costs of £20,000 that has been imposed on Livia,” Igunnubole told the Today programme.“This is unprecedented circumstances; never before have we seen entirely peaceful conduct criminalised for nothing other than offering a consensual conversation.”A delegation from the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL), an office within the US Department of State, met Tossici-Bolt last month during a visit to the UK.They were accompanied by aUS-backed anti-abortion group, which had been supporting her case.In a post on X hours after the conviction on Friday, the DRL said: “We are disappointed with the UK court’s conviction of Livia Tossici-Bolt for violating a designated ‘buffer zone’ at an abortion clinic. Freedom of expression must be protected for all.”After the verdict, the chief executive of BPAS, Heidi Stewart, said: “The clinic in Bournemouth has been subjected to decades of anti-abortion protests which resulted in more than 500 reports of harassment before this local safe access zone was brought into force.“This case was never about global politics but about the simple ability of women to access legal healthcare free from harassment.”Explore more on these topicsFreedom of speechHealthAbortionWomenBBCRadio 4ActivismnewsShareReuse this content"

Some protesters held banners which read “Stop arming Israel” while others let off green flares before being moved along by the Metropolitan police.Youth Demand said its supporters divided into two groups and, at about 12.15pm, a group of 40 people blocked traffic on Euston Road near King’s Cross.The Met issued the protesters with a warning under section seven of the Public Order Act, Youth Demand said, and the group moved on after 10 minutes. No arrests were made, according to Scotland Yard.A Met spokesperson previously said: “Youth Demand have stated an intention to ‘shut down’ London over the month of April using tactics including ‘swarming’ and road blocks.“While we absolutely recognise the importance of the right to protest, we have a responsibility to intervene to prevent activity that crosses the line from protest into serious disruption and other criminality.”Last Thursday, six people from Youth Demandwere arrested at a Quaker House meetingon suspicion of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance. More than 20 uniformed police, some equipped with Tasers, forced their way into the Westminster meeting house.However, Youth Demand said the publicity surrounding the raid had had the effect of increasing awareness of their activities, and hasresulted in a large number of people signing upto join.Explore more on these topicsProtestPalestinian territoriesGazaIsraelLondonArms tradenewsShareReuse this content"

Average net debts reached £8,313 across all age groups in 2022, up from £5,008 in 2010 – a 25% real-terms increase after accounting for inflation.The increase is probably due to ­rising rents, student loans and the cost of living crisis, and underlines the divide between renters and homeowners, whose properties are usually worth more than their mortgage debt.But the distinction is not academic: women with assets – usually savings – at the age of 23 earn 11% higher wages by the time they reach 33, with a 5% premium for men. Women with assets of more than £1,000 at 23 are significantly more likely to report “excellent” health later in life. And anyone with financial assets is more likely to vote or volunteer.Although student loans repayments are exempt for young people earning less than £27,295 who started their courses after 2012, the burden of repayment makes it harder to build up a nest egg. “Even student loan debt is a barrier to people building up financial assets,” Snell said.“It’s worrying, but not surprising, that levels of indebtedness are rising. Politicians need to tackle debt, and the broader problem that millions don’t have any financial assets, as a priority, because this issue is damaging our economy, our social fabric and even faith in our democracy.“We had initiatives like the Child Trust Fund scheme in the past; we can and should consider bold asset-building policies again, like a citizens’ inheritance that gives everyone a lump sum when they reach adulthood, funded by higher taxes on wealth, to ensure that everyone has a stake in the economy.”A third of the people who turned to StepChange, the debt charity, for help last year were aged 25 to 34, according its chief client officer, Richard Lane, who said that was a “huge disparity” since people in that age bracket only make up 17% of the UK population.“Younger adults typically tend to be private renters, sometimes with lower or more insecure incomes, and tend to experience more transitional life events, like having children, that increase costs,” Lane said.“All of these factors can contribute to a more squeezed income or reliance on credit to make ends meet.”StepChange is increasingly helping people who owe money on gas, electricity, water, council tax and other household bills. YouGov polling for the charity in January found that 35% of 25- to 34-year-olds were showing signs of financial difficulty in the previous three months, and 15% had used credit, loans or an overdraft to survive until payday, compared with 10% of UK adults.Lane said: “The rising costs associated with running a household is making it harder for people to save and build financial resilience to protect them from future financial shocks – creating a harmful cycle of debt for more and more young people.”Explore more on these topicsPovertyThe ObserverYoung peopleSocial exclusionHealthUK cost of living crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

Details of the amounts reportedly donated have not been disclosed. However, it is understood the Russell family have not received any money from the donation.“Following the coroner’s inquest into Molly’s death, we have decided that we will pursue the aims we share with Meta and Pinterest through the Molly Rose Foundation to help ensure young people have a positive experience online, instead of pursuing legal action,” the Russell family said in a statement. “We, Molly’s family, have always made clear that we would never accept compensation consequent upon Molly’s death.”The reported donations come as social media companies face increased criticism over the impact of online platforms on children’s mental health.In January, as part of sweeping changes to its policies, Meta’s boss, Mark Zuckerberg, said the company wouldscrap factcheckersin order to boost free speech and reduce “censorship”, and would rely on users to report content.The Molly Rose Foundation previously warned that Meta’s changes could place young people at greater risk of encountering harmful content online. It has launched campaigns urging the government to strengthen the Online Safety Act and place more responsibility on technology companies for content promoted through algorithms.According to the BBC, the charity has recruited a chief executive officer, two public policy managers, a head of communications and a fundraising manager within the past nine months.Ian Russell, Molly’s father, remains an unpaid trustee of the foundation and continues to be a prominent internet safety campaigner.Meta and Pinterest have been approached for comment by the Guardian.Explore more on these topicsInternet safetySocial mediaMetaPinterestDigital mediaChildrenYoung peoplenewsShareReuse this content"

Now every day I fear being sent back to my home country. Having a normal life here looks like a dream for me. I’m really suffering mentally.“When I was working with western government projects I received security training about how to respond if I was caught up in a bombing or a kidnapping. Every day I was a few minutes or a few seconds away from bomb blasts.“My heart beat so fast when I had to pass the checkpoints. Every morning when I said goodbye to my family to go to work I thought it might be the last time I saw them,” she said. “Some of my colleagues just disappeared. TheTalibanchanged the Ministry of Women’s Affairs to the Ministry of Vice and Virtue – proper, systematic elimination of women.”The Home Office has previously generally accepted protection claims from women like Mina who could be targeted by the Taliban because of their high-profile work empowering women and who have provided evidence of their work with western government projects.But in the most recent data for the last three months of 2024immigration statisticsshow 26 Afghan women had their claims rejected. Overall2,000 Afghan asylum seekers had their claims refused, an increase from 48 in the same quarter of 2023. The grant rate for Afghan cases has gone down from 98.5% in the last quarter of 2023 to 36% in the last quarter of 2024.The 2025Human Rights Watch reportinto Afghanistan documents a serious deterioration in the rights of girls and women and an increase in risks to their safety.Although Mina explained in her Home Office asylum interview of the dangers she faced in Afghanistan because of the work she did a Home Office decision maker who rejected her claim, concluded that: “It is considered that you do not face a real risk of persecution or harm on your return to Afghanistan on the basis of your claimed adverse attention by the Taliban.”The refusal letter adds: “You likely have a great support network due to your occupation.”However many of those Mina worked with prior to the Taliban takeover are either in hiding or have fled the country and these support networks have largely been destroyed.“There are no compassionate factors in your case that warrant a grant of leave to remain outside the immigration rules,” the letter states.“When I arrived here I felt safe,” Mina said. “I thought I would have a chance to live. In Afghanistan I had not been considered a human. I learnt to ride a bicycle here, something I was not allowed to do in my country. I was really full of hope that my life would change. But someone pressed pause on my life. I hope someone will press play again.”Her solicitor Jamie Bell of Duncan Lewis said: “It is shocking that 26 Afghan women were refused asylum in the last quarter. However this is a particularly upsetting case where the Home Office states that a woman who risked her life defending women’s rights in Afghanistan would not be at risk on return. The UK should be proud to offer protection to an individual like her. This refusal letter is offensive to all those who defended western values in Afghanistan and who ought to be offered protection when they cannot safely return.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “It is our longstanding policy not to comment on individual cases.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumAfghanistanWomenTalibanHuman rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

It shows a red fire engine and clearly marked ambulances driving at night, using headlights and flashing emergency lights.The vehicle stops beside another that has driven off the road. Two men get out to examine the stopped vehicle, and then gunfire erupts before the screen goes black.The Israeli military has said its soldiers “did not randomly attack” any ambulances, insisting they fired on “terrorists” approaching them in “suspicious vehicles”.Lt Col Nadav Shoshani, a military spokesperson, said troops opened fire on vehicles that had no prior clearance to enter the area, and were driving with their lights off.The IDF said on Saturday that the incident was still under investigation and that “all claims, including the documentation circulated about the incident, will be thoroughly and deeply examined to understand the sequence of events and the handling of the situation”.Late on Saturday, Reuters cited an anonymous Israeli military official as telling journalists that the initial account of the vehicles not having emergency lights on was mistaken.Fifteen Palestinian paramedics and rescue workers, including at least one UN employee, were killed in the incident in Rafah on 23 March, in which the UN says Israeli forces shot the men “one by one” and then buried them in a mass grave.View image in fullscreenEmergency vehicles are seen with their lights and sirens flashing.Photograph: APAccording to the UN humanitarian affairs office (Ocha), the PRCS and civil defence workers were on a mission to rescue colleagues who had been shot at earlier in the day, when their clearly marked vehicles came under heavy Israeli fire in Rafah’s Tel al-Sultan district.

A 10-year investigation was followed by a nine-week trial last autumn and the three judges delivered their verdict after a three-month deliberation.Le Pen and eight other RN European Parliament members, who all denied the charges and have appealed, were judged to have been part of an organised “system” of embezzlement between 2004 and 2016 in which European funds supposed to be used to pay EU parliamentary assistants were used to pay the party’s workers in France. The court found Le Pen to be at “the heart” of this system and guilty of directly organising eight fictitious contracts and instigating a wider fake jobs scheme.Le Pen and her colleagues are not the only French politicians to have been accused of financial impropriety. In February 2024, eight members of Bayrou’s centrist party MoDem were found guilty of similarly misusing European Parliament funds. They were fined, sentenced to prison terms and banned from public office. Bayrou was cleared of embezzlement.Rightwing French MP Éric Ciotti, who supports Le Pen, and has suggested overturning the law barring her and others convicted of fraud from public office, is under investigation on allegations of misuse of public funds.In 2022, former PM and presidential hopefulFrançois Fillon and his Welsh wife, Penelope, were convicted on appeal of embezzling public funds in a fake job scandal.View image in fullscreenSupporters of Marine Le Pen gather near Toulouse to protest against her conviction for embezzling European Parliament funds through a fake jobs scam.Photograph: Valentine Chapuis/AFP/Getty ImagesLe Pen was sentenced to four years in prison, two suspended and two to be served with an electronic tag. She was also fined €100,000 and hit with an immediate ban from public office for five years. Because of the appeal against her conviction, the sentence is postponed until a retrial, but the bar from public office remains in place.French legal authorities have said they will speed up the process, which can take decades, to ensure the Court of Appeal hears the case and delivers a verdict by the summer of 2026.To take part in the presidential election she will need to be either cleared, or convicted a second time but with the ban lifted. The second option raises the prospect of a convicted fraudster entering the Elysée wearing an electronic anklet.While the RN is hoping for a show of strength this weekend, polls suggest Le Pen may not have the public support she is counting on and claims.An institute cluster poll forLe Pointmagazine found 61% of French people thought her conviction justified and two out of three of those quizzed said the immediate application of a bar on standing for public office was “fair”; 43% said the condemnation and punishment was “extremely justified”.Stewart Chau, director of polling at Vérian Group, said France was engaged in a “battle of opinion” and that the polls had to be viewed with caution.“If 60% of people believe this justice is impartial and thinkMarine Le Penis not above the law and should be judged like anyone else, it still means 40% do not agree and think it is a political decision, which is not an insignificant number,” Chau told theObserver.He said he did not think there would be a massive mobilisation in support of the RN on Sunday.“The RN is trying to wrap this judgement against it up as a wider issue of an attack on democracy. While the political earthquake caused by last Monday’s judgement is felt by the RN’s inner circle and its supporters, I don’t think the wider dynamic is there,” he added.The French far-right has repeatedly presented itself as above the corruption and abuse of power scandals that have hit other parties. Le Pen’s father and founder of the Front National, Jean-Marie Le Pen, who died in January, adopted the slogan “clean hands and head held high” before the 1993 legislative elections. For decades, his daughter, who took over the party in 2011, has campaigned for stricter laws to tackle corruption in public life; when the ineligibility rule for public office for convicted fraudsters was debated in parliament in 2016 she called for those found guilty to be barred for life.Commentators say to beware of rallies suggesting there is widespread popular support when most of those attending are already party members or supportersbackers.“There will no doubt be a large crowd at the RN’s Paris meeting on Sunday. As in 2017 at the meeting called by François Fillon at Place du Trocadéro when he was indicted. But beware of optical illusions: every time, it’s not the ‘people’ who revolt against the judges, it’s just the supporters, the faithful who fly to the aid of their candidate,”wrote FranceInfo.Explore more on these topicsFranceThe ObserverNational RallyMarine Le PenEuropeTrial by juryScamsShareReuse this content"

Protesters from Málaga on the Costa del Sol to Vigo in the Atlantic northwest chanted “end the housing racket” and “landlords are guilty, the government is responsible”.Valeria Racu, a spokesperson for the Madrid tenants’ union, called for rent strikes such as those mounted recently in some Catalan coastal towns.“This is the beginning of the end of the housing business,” Racu said. “The beginning of a better society, without landlordism and this parasitical system that devours our salaries and our resources.”The union says 1.4m Spanish households spend more than 30% of their income on housing, 200,000 families more than 10 years ago.Housing has become the number one social issue in Spain as a combination of property speculation and tourist apartments have driven the cost of rented housing beyond the reach of all but the most wealthy.Official statistics suggest there are at least 15,000 illegal tourist apartments in Madrid while in Barcelona the city council says it will not renew the existing 10,000 tourist apartment licences when they expire in 2028.What was initially a problem in areas with a high concentration of tourists, such as the Balearic and Canary Islands, as well as Barcelona, has become an issue across the country, with protests in Seville, Valencia, Santiago de Compostela, Burgos and San Sebastián, among other cities, where protesters rattled sets of keys in what has become a symbol of discontent over the lack of affordable homes.In the Balearics the average rent for a small apartment has risen by 40% in five years to about €1,400 (£1,190) a month, more than the average monthly salary of those working in the hospitality sector, the region’s main industry.The young have been hardest hit as housing costs have soared while salaries remain stagnant. A study published by the Spanish youth council showed that a lack of affordable housing meant that last year 85% of young people under 30 were still living with their parents.In Barcelona, where thousands gathered in the Plaça d’Espanya, protesters demanded a 50% reduction in rents, indefinite leases and an end to property speculation.According to the Catalan housing agency, rents in Barcelona have increased by 70% in the past 10 years. Salaries rose by 17.5% over the same period.“The housing game is rigged in favour of anyone with assets while tax incentives encourage them to acquire more and more property,” said Jaime Palomera of the BarcelonaUrban Research Instituteand the author ofEl Secuestro de la Vivienda(The Kidnapping of Housing).“The rich have got richer since the financial crash in 2008 and the Covid crisis and they have used this wealth to buy more and more property, constantly driving up prices and increasing inequality.“The fact is that property offers a better return than other investments. We have an economic model that encourages investment in assets that don’t create any value but simply use rent as a way of sucking money out of the middle classes.”The solution, Palomera says, is to tax those who own multiple properties.He cites the example of Singapore, where the state offers financial support to first-time buyers but imposes an ascending tax regime on second and subsequent homes.Explore more on these topicsSpainProtestHousingEuropeCommunitiesActivismnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s really subhuman,” he said.Eastern DRC has long suffered from violence, and the camps in Goma, capital of North Kivu province, host people who have been displaced for years.View image in fullscreenBeatrice, whose husband and a child were killed in the war.

The Rwandan-backed group has managed toseize large parts of eastern DRC, including Goma and other key towns, since January.Egeland said the humanitarian situation had been complicated by M23 forcing displaced people to leave the camps, often giving them only 72 hours to move on. Many people had returned to their homes, where there was relative safety now that the M23 had taken control.He warned, however, that a political settlement was needed now as well as aid, especially in the form of cash, to ensure displaced people could buy food and rebuild their homes and livelihoods in placesdevastated by years of conflict.Mass burials and market looting in eastern DRC – in picturesRead moreEgeland said charities were struggling because they often had still not been paid for work done last year because of President Donald Trump’s freezing of US aid spending in January, and even projects that had been approved by Washington had not yet received money.He said that while support from Norway, which had fast-tracked pre-existing pledges, had allowed the NRC to continue working, other humanitarian organisations were struggling.“At a time of enormous needs – because of the recent increase in fighting – and of opportunity [to help] the many who can return, the money is not coming in,” he said. “It means people are not helped, they linger in camps with worsening conditions, that children cannot go to school.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentDemocratic Republic of the CongoRwandaConflict and armsAfricaHumanitarian responseAidnewsShareReuse this content"

TheTrump administrationis seeking to deport him under a provision in federal immigration law that permits the state department to deport non-citizens considered to be a threat to US foreign policy.Federal officials have said that Khalil, who has not been charged with any crime, led activities “aligned to Hamas”, which the US designates a terrorist organization.In anop-ed published Friday in the Columbia Spectator, dictated to his attorney, Khalil accused Columbia’s leadership of suppressing student dissent over Israel’s war in Gaza, which it launched after the 7 October 2023 terror attack by Hamas.“Since my abduction on March 8, the intimidation and kidnapping of international students who stand for Palestine has only accelerated,” Khalil said, pointing to the arrest of three other students, the self-deportation of a fourth and another who is fighting similar orders but without arrest.“The situation is oddly reminiscent of when I fled the brutality of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria and sought refuge in Lebanon,” Khalil continued. “The logic used by the federal government to target myself and my peers is a direct extension of Columbia’s repression playbook concerning Palestine.”Khalil also accused the university of suppressing student dissent under the auspices of combating antisemitism and bowing to pressure from Congress to turn over student disciplinary records and creating a taskforce on antisemitism “that broadly categorized anti-Israel sentiment as hate speech to condemn protests”.He urged students to continue their protest efforts. “It is incumbent upon each of you to reclaim the University and join the student movement to carry forward the work of the past year,” he wrote.The US secretary of sate Marco Rubiosaid last monththat the state department had revoked roughly 300 students visas. “Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visas,” Rubio said at a news conference in Guyana.Khalil mentioned other students who had been arrested and are facing deportation, including the Tufts University doctoral studentRümeysa Öztürk, whom the Department of Homeland Security has said “engaged in activities in support of Hamas”.Judge rules Mahmoud Khalil’s deportation case must continue in New JerseyRead moreKhalil said that Öztürk, whose deportation has been temporarily blocked by a judge, and others have been “snatched by the state”.Öztürk was a signatory to an opinion piece in the Tufts University student newspaper that called on the university to label Israel’s war in Gaza a “genocide”. Tufts has said the op-ed is consistent with speech permitted under its policies of free expression.Khalil’s letter comes a month after Columbia University’s president, Katrina Armstrong, resigned as the universityacceded to administration demandsto crack down on what the administration deemed acts of antisemitism at the campus.Trump threatened to withdraw $400m in federal funding to Columbia if the university did not agree to a series of changes including banning face masks on campus, empowering security officers to remove or arrest individuals, and taking control of the department that offers courses on the Middle East from its faculty.Explore more on these topicsMahmoud KhalilColumbia UniversityTrump administrationUS campus protestsUS politicsUS immigrationIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

But Xi may have to go it aloneBeijing has launched a charm offensive with other countries as US tariffs tighten. If they can’t be won over, it may have no choice but to stimulate its vast domestic marketPhillip InmanSat 5 Apr 2025 12.31 EDTFirst published on Sat 5 Apr 2025 07.00 EDTShareChina’s leader, Xi Jinping, says he is prepared to dance if it means sidestepping some of the worst of Donald Trump’s trade tariffs. Last week he sent a letter to India’s president, Droupadi Murmu, urging her to join him in a tango to celebrate 75 years of ­bilateral trade.Xi said it was “the right choice” for the two countries to be “partners of mutual achievement and realise the ‘Dragon-Elephant Tango’”, which, he added, “fully serves the fundamental interests of both countries and their peoples.”Beijing is on a wide-ranging charm offensive, aimed at redirecting its exports away from the US to other willing destinations as Washington erects trade barriers.Tariffs on China imposed by the US president amounting to 20% earlier this year were more than doubled last week to 54% and an effective average rate of 65%, raising the cost of Chinese imports to a level that many analysts believe will be uncompetitive.The response from Beijing was swift. A sell-off on financial markets intensified afterChina’s finance ministry said it would respond in kind, adding 34% to the tariff on all US goods from 10 April.Investors worry that a recession in the US cannot be ruled out as the trade war intensifies and companies hunker down, cutting investment and jobs to weather the storm.tariff rates chartHere comes a Chinese waveFears that China could embark on a campaign of dumping goods or increasing subsidies to help domestic firms win foreign contracts are growing. There are also concerns that the US, already unpopular in much of the developing world, will foster a realignment of global trade that favours authoritarian regimes, including China’s.BYD, which has leapfrogged Tesla to produce the world’s most popular electric cars, is looking to expand in Europe, despite separate tariffs imposed by the EU and UK limiting European sales.Former UK Treasury minister Jim O’Neill says closer trade ties with Beijing should be part of a realignment that is inevitable following Trump’s “kamikaze” tariff initiative.Lord O’Neill, a former Goldman Sachs chief economist, said that G7 countries could take the lead in this, but that India and China should be included too.“It’s important to realise that the rest of the G7, except the US, collectively are the same size as the United States. And I would have thought a very sensible thing to be doing is having a serious conversation with the other members about actually lowering trade barriers between ourselves,” he said.China, in fact, sends more goods to the EU than the US, and the export trend away from the US has accelerated since Trump’s first period in the White House, even when the Covid-related surge in exports of Chinese goods is discounted. Whereas China sendsabout $440bn (£340bn) of goods to the US, it exportsclose to $580bnto the EU’s 27 members.View image in fullscreenBYD’s electric car sales have overtaken Tesla’s.Photograph: Chalinee Thirasupa/ReutersChristopher Dent, a professor of economics and international business at Edge Hill University business school, said there might be a “bigger picture” that Brussels thinks is worth pursuing, in a fundamental break with the US.“Trump’s aggressive trade policy will most likely compel other countries to form stronger trade clubs and alliances among themselves.“The EU and China, for example, might look to resolve or put aside their own trade disputes with each other and champion the cause of trade multilateralism and liberalism along with willing others, such as the UK, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Australia, lowering their tariffs and signing new kinds of trade agreements – a trend that is already evident.”The EU’s trade and economic security commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, indicated that talks could take more than a few weeks or months. He said after a meeting with Chinese vice-premier He Lifeng last weekend that there could only be a more open relationship if trade flows and investment were “symmetrical”.The UK is in a particularly tight spot. It managed to escape with the lowest level of tariffs imposed by Trump, 10%, and is hopeful of securing a deal with Washington. Yet it cannot be seen to succumb to Beijing’s advances. Like others, Britain risks being engulfed by the flood of cheap Chinese goods, from electric cars to steel, that will soon wash up on its shores, threatening jobs.Speaking at a recent Chatham House event, the UKbusiness secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said the “majority of UK China trade is not in particularly contentious areas”.“We’ve got to engage with a fifth of the world economy. The Conservative view, which is to just pretend China does not exist – I’m sorry, I don’t think that’s realistic whatsoever.”He said there were “areas we can work more closely”, but added there was no suggestion of returning to the so-called golden age pursued by David Cameron.“Pork exports would be an obvious example,” he said. “Whichever way we go on these areas, there is nothing to be gained from just pretending China does not exist.”trade subject to tariffs chartChina and its neighboursJohn Denton, head of the International Chambers of Commerce, likens the onset of these tariff wars to the oil shock of the 1970s, such is its seismic importance. “The overriding theme is the battle for supremacy between China and the US for global trade dominance,” he said.Denton is among the senior international business leaders imploring politicians to resist retaliatory action, to prevent a death spiral of punitive import charges that push up inflation and crash the world economy.He is worried that the tariffs pose an existential crisis for Asean (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations), which has become a conduit for Chinese firms exporting to the US. This was noticed in Washington, hence tariffs adding a 46% surcharge on imports from Vietnam and 49% on those from Cambodia.US trainer-maker Nike, which manufactures 50% of its shoes in Vietnam, has been caught in the crossfire. Its shares slumped by 15% after the tariffs were applied. But Chinese-owned clothes and shoe factories based in both countries are the chief targets.Mary Lovely, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute in Washington, said most American workers would not aspire to work in a clothing or shoe factory, which is why they had been outsourced to east Asia.“Are we supposed to knit our own knickers?” she asked an audience at the Brookings Institution in the US capital. “I mean, really, what is a good job for an American worker?“Reducing the dependence on China was a good thing, but we totally whacked it [with these tariffs].”Vietnam has taken steps to convince the US it is serious about reducing its trade surplus, which reached $123.5bn last year, and the third highest gap for the US, behind China and Mexico. Hanoi expects the economy to grow by 8% this year, even though exports account for 90% of economic output and the US accounts for 25% of that total. It declined to change the outlook after Trump’s announcement, preferring instead to dispatch a team to Washington to plead with officials.View image in fullscreenTrump meets Xi at the G20 summit in Osaka, 2019.Photograph: Susan Walsh/APMeanwhile, with regard to India, Xi said the two countries were both ancient civilisations, major developing countries and important members of the “global south” standing at a critical stage in their respective modernisation efforts.Murmu refused to reply to his letter in kind. In a short response, she noted that together they were home to a third of the world’s population, and that a stable, predictable and friendly relationship would benefit both countries and the world.It was a message widely seen in Indian business circles as a way to sidestep many longstanding political and economic issues.Indians are sceptical that there is much mileage in talks when the trade balance is almost nine to one in China’s favour. In part, this is due to severe restrictions on Indian imports of pharmaceuticals, IT services, basmati rice and beef.There is also a long-running border dispute in the north of India that ignited into conflict in 2020 and remains unresolved.Worse before it gets betterBut for China, it looks like the situation is only going to get worse. Trump plans to phase out a “de minimis” exemption next month that allows packages with a value of $800 or less to be shipped to the US from China duty free, and is central to the business model of companies such as fast fashion firm Shein and household goods supplier Temu.Trump is also expected to apply additional tariffs on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, targeting China and affiliates in neighbouring countries, before deciding how to punish firms that trade in rare earth metals sourced from China.Goods exportsThe White House has bipartisan support when it applies a tourniquet to China, especially the communist state’s carmakers and tech companies, which are widely considered to be leapfrogging US manufacturers to become global leaders.China’s full-throttle shift to become a tech powerhouse – a move exemplified by the rise of telecoms giant Huawei and AI firm DeepSeek – has also spooked many potential export destinations, including Europe, which fear the Moscow-friendly nation is as keen on harnessing personal data and industrial secrets as it is hard cash.Christopher Beddor, deputy China research director at Beijing-based Gavekal Research, said China had few friends it could rely on to take goods previously destined for the US market.In an initiative that parallels the Murmu letter, Chinese government officials have also toured European capitals to say that China, unlike the US, still believes in the rules-based international trading system, giving them a common cause. “But I have been interested to see how there is still lots of resistance to the idea of China as a reliable partner,” said Beddor.Maybe a renewed effort to attract foreign firms to build factories inside China will help ease tensions. Last month, China’s second-in-command, Li Qiang, urged countries to open their markets to combat “­rising instability and uncertainty” at a business forum in Beijing attended by the bosses of Europe and the US’s largest companies.Ola Källenius, the chair of Mercedes, was in attendance with Laurent Freixe, chief executive of Nestlé and bosses from Siemens, BMW, Saudi Aramco, Rio Tinto, and UK bank Standard Chartered. AstraZeneca’s chief executive, Pascal Soriot, was also in the audience with Tim Cook of Apple and Cristiano Amon of chip designer Qualcomm.Li urged them to increase their investment in China based on promises that the world’s second largest economy would buck the global economic slowdown that was sure to follow a further round of tariffs.Is there a way back?A rapprochement with the US looks unlikely. If anything, the Trump administration wants to ringfence Beijing, preventing America’s consumers from buying any of its goods unless a huge surcharge is applied.Trump’s planned tax cuts, due to be announced before the end of the year, are paid for with the ­revenue from tariff charges, though there are wildly differing forecasts about how much will be raised.Trump’s comments that he is open to bargaining away some tariffs also complicates the picture. The US president said after announcing his latest measures that a deal to secure US ownership of TikTok could reduce China’s tariff burden. But the deal is subject to legal wrangling and it’s not clear when China might be ready to make concessions.Beddor says the US’s stance and a lack of international partners will force Xi to look inwards for extra sales and growth.“Chinese exports into the US are about 2% of its overall economic output, and so Beijing will think that is manageable,” Beddor said.US imports of Chinese goods reached $438.9bn in 2024, or 2.3% of China’s $19tn economy, while the trade surplus hit $295bn, a 5.8% increase from 2023.“It is a much bigger problem when Trump’s tariffs create a global downturn. That is a different order of magnitude,” Beddor said. “And for China, if there is a global slowdown, there is nowhere for Beijing to go other than to the Chinese consumer.”He said Xi had already signalled that an economic stimulus package outlined at the beginning of the year in response to tariff threats could be enlarged.“China’s policymakers are now almost certain to ramp up stimulus efforts in the coming months, and will probably introduce more fiscal measures later in the year.“The fiscal stimulus this year may be well beyond anything we’ve seen in the past decade.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal economyThe ObserverTrade policyTrump tariffsDonald TrumpEconomicsTariffsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She was just my mother, swirling in and out of the house, singing to her jonquil bulbs, tripping over the animals I rescued, all while reading five books at once. If she was in the kitchen, my sisters and I hid downstairs as she clattered and crashed all the saucepans and swore like a sailor at the latest ruined batch of biscuits.She wept at whatever devastation the nightly news delivered into the lounge room. She loved and was loved in return by my father, Douggie. She birthed four babes, grew the surviving three into formidable women and instilled in us a fierce belief that there was nothing we could not do.Sue is a force as powerful as any storm. I think that one of the reasons I am so connected to nature is that when I was a wee, wild thing, I felt like my mother was nature itself, growing inside the house. She made a garden of our lives.Away with Gina Chick: ‘I like to travel with a parrot. I get to feel like a pirate’Read moreI didn’t know other mothers were any different. So in a way, her magnificence was invisible to me. Now that we know about her biological mother, my grandmother, Charmian Clift, it’s obvious why my mother is the way she is. From which deep wellspring she inherited her many gifts. Her wild genes.Back then, though, all we had was a story. We knew only what Mum had been told; that her mother had died in childbirth and her father had died in the war.I remember us all curled up together one Christmas morning. Mum’s birthday. A tangle of young limbs and sandy-pawed dogs and a couple of Siamese cats, torn wrapping paper everywhere. Birthday presents and cake for Mum before any Christmas presents could be touched – that was the rule, she needed to feel extra loved.We were playing one of our favourite story games, where we would make up imaginary mothers for our own beautiful one. Our grandmother was a famous ballet dancer, perhaps, because of Mum’s strong, shapely legs. Or an opera singer, because of her huge alto voice, or an artist, or a Russian princess, with those cheekbones. And Mum would laugh, and cry, and pull us deeper into her arms, and all her love flowed forwards rather than backwards, because we were all she had.View image in fullscreenSuzanne and Doug Chick on their wedding dayBut no matter how much she loved us and Douggie, and the animals and the beauty of Jervis Bay, there was always a jagged edge in her. A tremble of loss. She searched passing faces for those that looked like her own. Her wild genes pushed at her to be more than a mother and a wife.“I just want to make my scratch on the world,” she said when she was frustrated. There was no time in her life for working out what making that scratch would entail. She had chosen a family instead.I was in my very early 20s when the adoption laws changed in Australia and Mum could finally find out the name of her birth mother. That’s all she wanted. The name. Little did any of us know what that name would unlock.I was at uni, working in a fitness centre in Mosman at the time, making all the mistakes of youth – searching for a place where I wouldn’t be too big, too loud, too much. Somewhere my own wildness would make sense. Where the dislocation I felt would resolve into an understanding of my own nature. Somewhere I could belong.Mum called to tell me she’d received her birth certificate and she knew the name of her mother: Charmian Clift.I ran with my sister Danni across to the Mosman bookshop and discovered a host of books with Charmian Clift’s name on them.View image in fullscreen‘I felt instant recognition.’ Charmian Clift in Sydney in 1964.Photograph: Clift EstateOn the back of one of those books was a photograph of Charmian, staring right at us from across the years as if from a mirror. Wide mouth, high cheekbones, deep-souled eyes. My sister and I could barely speak. It was inarguable, inescapable. Our mother had never seen an older face that looked like hers, but here she was. This was our grandmother.I ran my fingers along the spines of the books my grandmother wrote, feeling the skeins of stories rippling inside, bursting to escape. I felt instant recognition. Grandmother to granddaughter. She was … big. This explained everything.Over the next year, as Sue went on her odyssey of discovery, I finally began to see my mother as someone separate to my sisters and me. Someone with her own thoughts and feelings and dreams. Discovering Charmian brought her home to herself. She broke open, down, through.I came home from uni mid-year, and in the study was a photo of us three girls. A quote was pinned next to the photo, in Mum’s handwriting.The price of anything is what we give up in order to achieve it. It is the path not taken.Sue had given up the siren pull of her wild genes for a life of family, security, safety. And now those wild genes had come to claim her. It was time for her to make her scratch on the world.…After she wrote Searching for Charmian, about trying to trace her mother’s life,Mum and Dad travelled overseas for the first time. They were in their 50s. Mum was still following the breadcrumbs left by her mother, and they led inevitably to Greece. First stop wasHydra, to search for Charmian among the stray cats and cobblestones, the sponge divers and black-robed priests.Hydra, the Greek island for dreamers | Polly SamsonRead moreThey found locals who knew Charmian, and there, under the Mediterranean sun, Mum brought the final pieces of her mother home. After a year travelling through Europe, Mum and Dad returned to Australia deeply in love, and then Mum started to paint. And paint. And paint. Huge canvases, alive with light and texture. Greek landscapes. Musicians. The endless changing colours of Jervis Bay.Figures swimming in velvet water. Whatever had been holding my mother’s creativity back, it was finally gone.She was free.…On my 53rd birthday, writing my own book after emerging from67 days solo in the Tasmanian wilderness, I found myself in Hydra. As my mother had done 30 years before, I walked Charmian’s cobblestone streets, passed her jade harbour, ducked under curtains of bougainvillaea and jasmine on the way to her house, which I eventually found.View image in fullscreenGina Chick with her mother, SuzanneI knocked on her door, but the house was all boarded up. I could not find Charmian in the restaurants, in the lumpy marble streets, among the donkeys and mules loaded cruelly with huge loads.I could not find her in the stony hills or the cobalt, velvet water. No sense of her pierced my heart. Her ghost was not there for me.Hydra had moved on. Flotillas of fishing boats had been replaced with rows of shiny superyachts, the bohemians and artists with wealthy Athenians and thousands of tourists pouting for selfies while buying cheap souvenirs at ridiculous prices.On my last day, waiting for the ferry, I pulled my wobble-wheeled luggage through bumpy winding streets to her house one more time and came upon the taverna where a famous photo was taken: Charmian andLeonard Cohenwith their backs to a white painted tree. She’s leaning back, face tilted, displaying the cheekbones I know so well in my mother’s face and mine. He’s glancing, side-eyed, at the camera.The tree had grown fatter in the last 60 years, but I saw the photo clearly in my heart. She’s young, frozen in time, with a rapt expression I recognise from my mother’s face and my own, when music turns a key in the locked door of our hearts and lets our sadness grow wings and fly free.I felt Charm’s crushing, nameless soul-ache at giving up her first child, and I told her I understood this lossI sat on the raised platform that encircled the tree, leaned back on it, this tree that had held my grandmother all those decades ago. Suddenly I felt her, all at once, the grandmother who gave me her wild talent, whose genes unfurl into rivers of words that regularly choose my hands to birth them into the world. I felt Charm’s crushing, nameless soul-ache at giving up her first child, and I told her I understood this loss, having lost my own daughter Blaise to cancer when she was three. Both of them were with me, the ghosts of my grandmother and her great-granddaughter, and I was the bridge between, my living heart beating in time to the echoes of theirs.I broke. My skin split, and 30 years of separation rained rivers into the white paint and grey stones. I wept for the ghosts of my lineage. Wombs are baskets of tears, amphora that crack and spill so their stories can fertilise new life. I wept for the first time in three decades for the grandmother I never knew but who seeded so much of who I am.View image in fullscreenI wept for my mother, left to live without her. I wept for myself, finding my way in a world where my own daughter no longer dances. As I buckled, sobbing, I saw Blaise placing her small starfish hand into Charm’s big one. Charmian came full circle, finally taking her place as an ancestor inside me.The egg that made me grew inside my mother, who had grown inside Charmian. Charmian was my first home and now, in a way, I have become hers. I write with her hands. Her gifts are mine. There, in her taverna, on her tree, I claimed my beautiful, sad, wildly talented grandmother and in doing so, brought a lost part of myself home.This is an edited extract from the updated edition ofSearching for Charmian by Suzanne Chick(Simon & Schuster, A$36.99)Explore more on these topicsAustralian booksFamilyAustralian lifestyleAdoptionAutobiography and memoircommentShareReuse this content"

We’re just two tracks in; Tempest assures us that if the electronics are not back up soon, they’ll do the whole show a cappella.They could, too. The teenage Tempest cut their teeth battle-rapping in south London, turning to slam poetry when more direct avenues into hip-hop refused to open easily to a young, blond slip of a thing. You suspect they have never wasted the opportunity when handed a mic. Given Tempest’s extended output over more than a decade of albums, works of fiction, poems, plays and nonfiction, with prizes and accolades for many of them – you can’t imagine them ever being at a loss for words either.In the end, the cult classic 2025 Tempest a cappella set doesn’t materialise. But throughout the remainder of their show the primacy of words is never in doubt, even as a trio of backing vocalists coo and sway, and instrumentalist Pops Roberts eventually conjures up slick, big-stage sounds from their rig.Displayed on the screens is Tempest’s key message: ‘I’d be more worried if we weren’t disturbed’Tonight’s intimate set concludes a short run of gigs; there’s also a recent new track – the hard-hitting Statue in the Square, out three weeks ago – Tempest’s first new music since 2022. If the signals all point to a new album campaign, five new tracks tonight confirm that Tempest’s emphasis on more personal writing continues. It’s a direction of travel that crystallised post-pandemic with their last musical outing, 2022’sThe Line Is a Curve, then swerved into the 2023 poetry collection,Divisible By Itself and One,and came to its most public fruition in a revealing BBCArenadocumentary. A career overview,Being Kae Tempest(2023) also featured candid mentions of hormones and surgery – not least the effect testosterone might have on Tempest’s voice.Their work has always examined where the personal and the political intertwine; how, as per the pithy takedowns of their 2017 trackPerfect Coffee, “the squats we used to party in are the flats we can’t afford”. Their discomfort in, and dismay at, the world has been a constant feature. Butsince coming out as non-binary in 2020, Tempest’s pen – previously given to vignettes about other people – has increasingly taken on their evolving selfhood.“This is how the new album begins,” says Tempest, launching unaccompanied into a new lyric about the pain of keeping their gender identity a secret for fear that their career would be over; and the relief at finally becoming themselves, an unburdening despite the “bitterness” they encounter when “using the facilities”. Tempest doesn’t mention it, but this gig takes place on International Transgender Day of Visibility. They start the gig in a boxy suit and eventually reveal a white vest top. “I adore us,” they rhyme, “I do everything for us.”Watch the video for Statue in the Square by Kae Tempest.A sense of community is the stated upside to the many difficulties Tempest details in these new tracks. Statue in the Square is more direct still, about how LGBTQ+ figures, denigrated now, will be memorialised in the future, the murky sense of threat in the music (the track was co-produced by A-lister Fraser T Smith) matched by the flames licking Tempest’s words. A fast-paced rap at the heart of the track feels like a throwback to those squat party, mic-passing days.Identity is not Tempest’s only theme, of course. Many of tonight’s lyrics remain furious and despairing of the state of the nation. Another new song remembers someone who is gone; a third, both tender and chilling, finds Tempest wishing they could go back in time to guard a child’s door overnight.View image in fullscreen‘Additional vocal texture’: Kae Tempest at Village Underground.Photograph: Andy Hall/the ObserverBut yet another track reels off a set of conditions and acronyms – “PTSD, ADHD, OCD” – before slyly noting that, with so many letters flying around, it’s handy Tempest turned down their OBE. Displayed on the screens is Tempest’s key message: “I’d be more worried if we weren’t disturbed.” On this evidence at least, Tempest’s forthcoming fifth album is shaping up to be very timely indeed – a mainstream-courting record with a lot to say.Direct, plain-speaking art has a long and powerful history, particularly at times when standing up to be counted against hatred feels like an imperative. And Tempest is a brave artist who does not mince their words. But there are times in the set where Tempest and the choir do a little elegant call and response, or when fellow south Londoner Tawiah – whom Tempest credits with tonight’s vocal arrangements – comes onstage with some additional vocal texture, where space and musicality take over from the laser focus on words.Fortunately, too, there are tracks such asGrace– fromThe Line Is a Curve,set against an arpeggiating guitar line – that don’t just plug into love, joy and suffering as universals; they do it a little more obliquely, a little more surreptitiously. It all ends with People’s Faces, Tempest’s 2019 track, and an invocation that is hard to disagree with: “More empathy, less greed, more respect.”Explore more on these topicsKae TempestKitty Empire's artist of the weekSpoken wordRapreviewsShareReuse this content"

In 2020 he was shortlisted for the Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse comic fiction prize with his first novel,Nobber, about the Black Death’s arrival in the Irish village that gives the book its title. His other books include the 2016 story collectionHostages, described by theSpectatoras “DayGlo-Breugelish nightmares”; Ferdia Lennon calls him “one of the most strikingly original Irish writers working today”. His new novel,Eden’s Shore, is a violent seafaring epic centred on a Spanish colony in Latin America at the end of the 18th century.How did this book begin for you?It’s a confluence of things I’ve been interested in all my life: Latin American literature, history, revolutionary politics, spirituality. LikeNobber, it’s about a dying town with a proliferation of characters, which I like. That’s not new – it’s Balzac, it’s Dickens – but for some reason we’ve distilled novels down to chamber pieces of six or seven characters; to me, that’s theatre, which I also love, but novels can proliferate horizontally in a way that other forms can’t.What draws you to set your novels in the past?You can do things with language and form that might not be as accepted in contemporary work, but I don’t see myself as a historical novelist. Literary fiction seems quite contemporary at the moment; historical fiction seems to be slipping into “genre”, like fantasy. In other parts of the world, it’s just part of literary fiction. We’re living through a moment in Irish literature with a lot of very good Irish writers who are all very different and talented, but maybe they’re not experimenting in genre as much as they would do elsewhere in the world. Because I find myself an Irishman among these people, you’re like, ‘Oh, he’s different.’ In the 1960s in America, or Latin America in the 50s and 70s, you’d be like, ‘Oh, he’s just one of the lads.’I always thought of books as a way of being brave. To read adventurously, to read more – I identified that with going forward, being biggerThere are some pretty grisly scenes here. What were they like to write?The nuts and bolts of novel formation are difficult for me – setting up a scene, getting from one place to another – but give me someone picking bullets out of someone’s gut and I think: here we fucking go. I’m writing for these moments where the body becomes real. Like, the eyeball scene... you should’ve seen the 300 words that were deleted; you’d have been seeing it for the rest of your life. I love my cousin to bits, but he had this fear of eyes as a child; mention the word “eye” and you’d see him kind of flinch. I tapped into that.Is that what lights you up as a reader?Six or seven years ago I read a lot of body horror. I can’t any more – I get scared! Now I readRobert Aickman, who’s more about what you don’t see; that’s a muscle I’d like to develop. But my reading has no rhyme or reason. I’ll read detective literature for three months, then Greek tragedy for three months. It doesn’t have to be ribs getting cracked open and child murder; the last time I was utterly astounded was by Marcel Schwob, who does these page-long imaginary lives of famous people through history. You’re gasping on every page.Did you always want to write?In my teens and 20s, there was nothing else. I was at the altar of literature and had its fire in me because I knew its effects: the Yeats poems I read when I was 13 or 14 are who I am. That fire has carried me for 15 years, but I basically have to find a new way to work or I’ll fucking die. And I won’t have lived, you know? Because the fact is, literature is not life, and I’ve lived my entire life book-first. I’ve been trying to balance the scales, but the lasting power of literature [for a reader] is that it’s so big; if I’m lucky enough to get to 50, 60, 70, I know there’s the right novel, the right poem, waiting for me.Tell us what you read growing up.I learned to read later than my peers. I remember thinking: what are they doing? My mother did extra work with me after school and brought up my reading age. I always thought of books as a way of being brave. To read adventurously, to read more – I identified that with going forward, being bigger. I remember readingCalvin and Hobbes, laughing so much I couldn’t breathe, people knocking on the door to say I had to go to sleep. When I was eight or nine I read a book about a dog – it had 100 pages. I remember getting to the end: 100 pages! I couldn’t even count that high. As a teenager I read fantasy. Growing up in rural Ireland, I’d see an oak tree on a hill and think: my God, this isRobin Hobb, JRR Tolkien,Ursula K Le Guin. It gives you back these parts of your life and allows you to recognise them as magical. Then at 14, I was like: time to readUlysses! At that age you’re always reading above your capabilities. Dostoevsky might resonate deeply, but you fundamentally don’t know what’s happening. You readNotes from Undergroundthinking: “Yes, he’s totally right! Finally someone understands!” Then you reread it: “Oh, this is a comedy?”Name a novel you’ve enjoyed recently.I’d nearly finishedEden’s Shoreand was wondering: am I going too far? Then I rereadGravity’s Rainbow[by Thomas Pynchon] and thought I absolutely hadn’t gone far enough: I’m stuck in the shallows and this guy’s swimming in the ocean. Sometimes a book makes you slow down and offer yourself to it, like the Bible. That devotional quality is what I want; the more you give, the more comes back.Why did you dedicateEden’s Shoreto “el capitán, Ronaldo”?It’s not the footballer! It’s my Argentinian dad. It’s an affectionate in-joke. He’s my connection to Latin America. Maradona’s the only footballer I’d dedicate it to; Portuguese Ronaldo’s not getting anything out of me. Maybe Roy Keane, one day.Eden’s Shoreis published on 10 April by John Murray (£16.99). To support theGuardianandObserverorder your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Before becoming a published novelist in her 50s, she worked a variety of odd jobs including bricklayer, technical writer and secretary, also running a postpunk zine. In 2014, with the help of Jonathan Franzen, she published her debut novelThe Wallcreeper, followed closely byMislaid,which was longlisted for a National Book Award. Her seventh novel,Sister Europe, out 24 April, charts the unravelling of a Berlin high-society party – Vogue called it “a worldly hangout novel of 21st-century manners”. Zink, a committed birder, lives outside Berlin.View image in fullscreen1. BookHope Against Hope by Nadezhda MandelstamThis is the book that’s keeping me cheerful. It is just impossible to feel sorry for yourself if you’re reading the memoirs of Nadezhda Mandelstam, whose poet husband Osip died in the transit camp to the Siberian gulag in 1938. She is incredibly wise and stoical on dealing with this Stalinist terror of the 1930s, and writes about it really beautifully, with a deep belief in humanism and a constant critique of using people as means to an end. Reading about what it was like to be on the run from Joseph Stalin, you think, wait a second, I don’t have it so bad.2. OperaTristan und Isolde at Staatstheater Cottbus, Germany, until 4 MayView image in fullscreenTristan und Isolde at Staatstheater Cottbus.Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/AlamyI have seen three different productions of this Wagner opera in three different places in the past year or so, and the hands-down winner was the production in Cottbus, because they took it seriously. It was a straight-up production, which the Brechtian ones in Dessau and Berlin were not. The finale was so beautiful and moving that the audience had tears in their eyes. And the theatre in Cottbus is a beautiful art nouveau building – a real destination – where the best seats in the house are €32. It’s worth a trip, andTristan und Isoldeis playing again soon.3. ArtVaginal Davis: Fabelhaftes Produkt at the Gropius Bau, Berlin, Germany, until 14 SeptemberView image in fullscreen‘She has that ironic, pop-cultural, intertextual aesthetic down cold’: Vaginal Davis.Photograph: Catherine Opie, Courtesy of Regen Projects, Los Angeles and Lehmann Maupin, New York, London, Hong Kong and SeoulVaginal Davis is a queer drag performer from LA who absolutely has that ironic, pop-cultural, intertextual aesthetic down cold and walks a tightrope over punk and drag, combining the two while always annoying somebody on either side. She’s also a photographer and film-maker, and just somebody who is very creative and constantly churning out material that’s funny and beautifully pointed. She moved to Berlin 20 years ago and now there’s a solo show of her work – including some large-scale installations – at the Gropius Bau in Berlin. I haven’t seen it yet but it’ll be extremely interesting.4. FestivalLit Link, CroatiaLit Link is the most brilliant literary festival put on by two Croatians. They invited me to speak years ago and then again in 2023. They pick different countries each year – this time it’s Sweden and Norway – inviting not only writers from those countries but also editors and translators. They rent a van and go from Zagreb down to Istria, and it’s just insanely pretty. Last time we stopped in Labin, a jewel of a hill town with an adorable little theatre looking out over the Adriatic. It’s fun to ride around in a van and go to these unbelievably beautiful places and then read to the Croatians.5. BirdNightingaleView image in fullscreen‘It’s important to have nightingales pestering you every night.’Photograph: AlamyIt’s the time of year to hear nightingales, but they are threatened because people keep their gardens and public parks too tidy. A nightingale needs thick underbrush in which to build a nest where no one can see it. The nightingale’s song is never what people think it is. It’s great by the standards of the Romantic era when people sang in an incredibly sappy way that today we’d probably find unbearable. He’s super-horny and whiny, like, “Pleeeease, baby, please”. But it’s important to have nightingales pestering you every night, starting in April, so don’t rake up the leaves or trim the hedges; let things get a bit chaotic.6. ObjectNebra Sky Disc at the Landesmuseum für Vorgeschichte, Halle, GermanyView image in fullscreen‘The oldest depiction of the night sky that we have on Earth.’Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PAThis is one of these precious artefacts found by accident by guys with metal detectors in Germany and it’s apparently the oldest depiction of the night sky that we have on Earth, dating back to 1800-1600BC. I saw it for the first time recently and it’s really gorgeous – a blue-green bronze disc with gold symbols of sun, moon and stars. They went out of their way to give it a dramatic setting in the Halle prehistory museum, with beautiful lighting and really good information. Halle is a nice town with an art academy that’s worth a visit. Having art students in a town improves it, I think.Explore more on these topicsCultureOn my radarBirdsOperaArtMuseumsFestivalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He had no symptoms, was perfectly fit, at the peak of his game. Yet the Oscar-winning film-maker and artist believed it was inevitable. After all, his father had died from it, and he is a black man. The statistics speak for ­themselves. They are as overwhelming as they are bleak. One in eight men will get prostate c­ancer. They are two and a half times more likely to get it if their father or brother had it. They’re twice as likely to get it if they’re black – and they’re two and a half times more likely to die from it, too.McQueen is here today with his urology specialist Prof Suks Minhas and surgeon Ben Challacombe to talk about the nitty-gritty of the disease that is killing so many men. But he believes he might easily not have been. If he had known as little as his father had, he may well be dead. McQueen feels grateful and guilty, and is determined to make people more aware. After all, prostate cancer is eminently treatable. And yet more than 12,000 men die from it in the UK every year – well over one an hour. Simply unacceptable, he says.“I was always going to have prostate cancer. From the day I was born I was going to have prostate cancer.” There’s a degree of poetic licence in his statement, but not that much.Minhas prefers to put McQueen’s chances at incredibly high. “I would say he’s not just got a family history, he’s got a lethal family history. So, while it wasn’t inevitable, it was probably more than 50-50 for you.”His father, Philbert, was a tough man who had never taken a day off sick before he was diagnosed in 2000. “He had a couple of accidents, and that’s what triggered him to go to the doctor. My father sometimes wet himself. It was embarrassing for him. He wanted to get it sorted, and he went to his GP, and through that he discovered it was very advanced cancer.”View image in fullscreenMcQueen with surgeon Ben Challacombe (left) and urology specialist Suks Minhas (right)Never mind prostate cancer, the family hadn’t even heard of the prostate – a walnut-shaped gland in the pelvis that rests below the bladder and in front of the rectum. The prostate produces fluid that mixes with sperm to produce semen. Surrounding muscles help expel semen during ejaculation. “It was quite confrontational because Ididn’t know what prostate cancer was. I didn’t know where it was. I didn’t know anything about it. And my father had a difficult time with it.” The problem was, as it still is today for many men, this is a subject he didn’t feel comfortable talking about. And, when it came to his health, Philbert McQueen wasn’t a talker.“My dad was a very strong guy. He was a builder, a hard worker. He was always in work early, back at eight and went to bed. He lived for his friends at the weekend. He was never ill. He never had a cold once. Before my dad would go to hospital, he’d have to have a leg amputated,” McQueen says. “It’s a maleness that unfortunately leads you down the wrong path. And it’s an unnecessary path.” Was he genuinely never ill or just toughing it out? He smiles. “He was a bit headstrong. So when this happened it was like, oh Dad’s really not well. It was a shocker. The doctor got my dad to leave the room for something and then he told us. He said, ‘Your dad’s very strong, maybe he’s got about five years.’” Philbert was 61 at the time, and lived until he was 67. Did he know his diagnosis was a death sentence? “We never told him, but I think he knew.” What were those years like? “Not great. It was a struggle. The pain in the night because of the bathroom stuff, the difficulty trying to pee. It was horrible, actually.”Challacombe, who operated on McQueen in 2022, nods in recognition as he talks. “There was so much less awareness back in the day,” Challacombe says. “The generation then didn’t speak about it.” If they did talk, it was in euphemistic terms. “They spoke about having a problem; a problem going to the toilet or the bathroom. Often, their family, particularly their children, were not aware what the diagnosis was.Menwere not good at talking about it, and in many ways still aren’t.”McQueen, 55, who was knighted in 2020 for services to art and film, had a tricky relationship with his father – and talking, or rather not talking, was at the heart of it. He adored Philbert, but they didn’t chat much; about anything, never mind cancer. “My dad was a geezer; a bloke. Men of a certain age thought children should be seen and not heard. It was difficult. I wanted something more from my father than he knew how to give. It was a strange relationship. This is the kind of dad my dad was. People would say, ‘Your dad’s brilliant, he’s so funny.’ And I’d be like, ‘Is he?’” McQueen acts out his surprise at being told this. “He was always good with other people. We didn’t get that off him. It was always about the front. So with this prostate thing he never complained until the very last moment.”He and his father were very different men. While Philbert laboured with his hands all his life and found it difficult to talk about intimacies, McQueen was determined to be an artist communicating with his audience about all sorts of subjects – from the Troubles in Northern Ireland (Hunger) to sexual obsession (Shame), enslavement (12 Years a Slave), war (Blitz), the Holocaust (Occupied City) and black Britain (the wonderfulSmall Axe seriesmade for television).Another difference is that McQueen has been hugely successful. By the age of 30 he had won the prestigiousTurner prize for his short films, and, in 2014,12 Years a Slave won the Oscar for best feature film. He and Philbert moved in very different worlds, and there were tensions. “It was always a bit ‘There can only be one man in the house’ kind of thing.” Despite their difficulties, he was devoted to his father.McQueen says it was awful seeing this superhero of a man become weaker and weaker – physically and in spirit. “I remember him lying on the floor one night. And he said, ‘I’m done. This is it, I’m done.’ So I went down and picked him up, and he was a big guy. I picked him up and said, ‘No, no, no, no, come on, sit up, sit up, and we just started talking about football. To see my dad on his back saying, ‘I’m done’ was awful because my dad was tremendously strong. Dad could lift two suitcases with one hand. Oh God, I’m sorry.” He’s welling up. “It was just very difficult seeing this strong guy, who I always looked up to become weak. It was horrible.”I gave a speech in front of George Clooney, Julia Roberts, all of Hollywood. I’d been told that day I had cancerTowards the end they weren’t getting on well, he says. By then his father had been hospitalised. “I came to the hospital. The last time I’d seen him we’d had an argy-bargy, and he was very weak and I just burst into tears. That’s never happened to me before – like an eruption. A volcano of tears exploding. My goodness. And we came together after that. I just sat there and held his hand. I left that day because I had to go to the States. I came back a week later and he’d passed away.”Once Philbert had been diagnosed, McQueen found out everything he could about prostate cancer. He was appalled to discover that it affected black men so disproportionately. To this day, it’s not known why. Even Minhas and Challacombe – two leading experts – cannot explain. There is not a prostate cancer gene as such, though some studies show mutations in various genes play a role. But what they are certain about is that socioeconomic factors play a significant part in the prevalence of prostate cancer among black men.Take work, for example, Minhas says. “Are you going to do a PSA test if you’re working all the hours God sends?” A PSA (prostate-specific antigen) is a simple blood test used to check prostate conditions, which men can request from their GP. “And we know men are less inclined to approach GPs and medical professionals, especially black men. If you look at studies, there’s a concept that it’s feminising; a sign of weakness. Women take up screening far more than men.”A high PSA scorecanbe a sign of prostate cancer, but it can also indicate an enlarged prostate, a urine infection or recent prostate stimulation. Meanwhile, it’s also possible to have a low PSA and still have cancer.Minhas talks about his own father, who emigrated from India to Britain and was employed by a London sheet-metal factory. “When you’re working in a factory, you’re not going to be thinking, am I going to do a medical trial or go toProstate Cancer Researchif I get sick, you’re thinking, ‘Where am I going to get the next bit of money to feed my kids?’ We know the first-generation immigrants in this country were deprived and lived in deprived areas, and, to me, that is the issue at hand.”So is this to do with class or race? Both, Minhas says. “Look at the films Steve has made. They’re about oppression and suffering. It stems from slavery; the perception of a white establishment that doesn’t resonate with ethnic minorities in this country. That’s the problem. If you look at institutions, although they might not be overtly racist, the same issues are still there as when I was a kid and people would call you names in the street.”A report published last month by theNHS Race and Health Observatoryrevealed an alarming lack of trust among Britain’s ethnic minorities in NHS primary care providers – 51% of participants said they experienced some form of discrimination, with 38% of Asian participants and 49% of Black participants reporting that they felt they were treated differently due to their ethnicity.View image in fullscreenMcQueen with his mother, Mary, and father, Philbert, at the Turner prize awards ceremony in 1999.Photograph: Dave Benett/Getty ImagesFor example, Minhas says, we know black men are disproportionately affected by prostate cancer, so the obvious thing to do is research to find out why. But it hasn’t been done. Why? “The BMAdid a studyin 2022 and found there were disproportionately fewer people from ethnic minorities in leadership roles. Why is that important in terms of prostate cancer, you might ask?” Simple, he says – white people are less likely to see the problem, let alone do something about it. He looks at Challacombe and apologises for getting on his high horse. “I’m sorry Ben, but the medical establishment is run by white people.” Minhas says that decisions are by and large taken with a white British population in mind. He cites his mother, a first-generation migrant from India. “My mum died of breast cancer. She got a letter in the post that said ‘Come for your screening’. Did that happen? No. She couldn’t read or write. There is health inequality in this country. Fundamentally, it is racist.”Again, he apologises, this time to McQueen. “Steve is one of the kindest, nicest, most humble people in his position I’ve met in my life, but what drives me up the wall is the establishment.” Minhas is convinced that if it were white people who suffered disproportionately from prostate cancer by now we would know why and there would be a national screening programme in place.It is shocking that there isn’t a screening programme for a cancer that affects more than 50,000 people a year. On average, there are 3,200 cases of cervical cancer in the UK a year. Since the early 1970s, cervical cancer mortality rates have decreased by 75% in women in the UK, according toCancer Research UK. This is largely due to screening that detects and treats abnormal changes in the cervix before they can develop into cancer. By contrast,research has shownthat prostate cancer mortality rates have increased by 16% since the early 1970s.Prostate cancer screening guidelines are currently being reviewed, with recommendations expected by the end of the year. One reason why McQueen and the doctors are so eager to talk today is to encourage screening for high-risk groups to be set up, notably black men with a family history of prostate cancer.Challacombe points out the significant gender differences when it comes to cancer prevention – partly because of the availability of breast and cervical screening, and partly because women are generally more health-literate than men. “You’ve got a population of women who are used to going to the GP because they have kids and they’re often the ones who take them. Whereas men could easily go from 16 to 50 and never contact the GP unless they have a problem. And it’s political. There’s a women’s health ambassador in the government. You don’t have a men’s health ambassador, and there should be one.”And then there is the embarrassment factor. Few things challenge stereotypical notions of masculinity like prostate cancer. Infertility, erectile dysfunction, incontinence are all hard subjects areas for men to talk about. So many think it’s best to ignore the prostate. McQueen made a little-known short film calledEmbarrassed, which tackles this and begs black men to start talking about it. The message is clear: “Don’t let embarrassment stop you having this conversation. It may help you save someone’s life.” The film is fronted by four high-profile black male actors – Chiwetel Ejiofor, Morgan Freeman, Micheal Ward and Idris Elba. “I mention the film to people, and they say, ‘I didn’t see it,’” McQueen says. “The problem is, how d’you make people aware? I couldn’t have had better people.”After his father died, McQueen started getting tested regularly for prostate cancer. Again, it highlights a difference between him and his father. McQueen was a successful film-maker who could afford to go private and get the best treatment. And he knows it made a practical difference.He had been getting tested regularly for five years when he went for his checkup with Minhas. He had no symptoms and his PSA level wasn’t high but it was steadily rising, and the rate of change over time was higher than expected. Minhas sent him for an MRI scan and biopsy, and the results came back positive. McQueen had early-stage prostate cancer.It’s upsetting that so many men are dying, particularly black men. It’s upsetting that my dad and friend died“Thank God he’s a hypochondriac!” Minhas says. Many men in McQueen’s situation would not have gone to a doctor when they were symptom-free. And if they had, they probably wouldn’t have been referred for tests while still within the normal PSA range.This is another difficulty with prostate cancer. “Pretty much all the men with symptoms have got an enlarged prostate rather than prostate cancer,” Challacombe says. He apologises for getting technical. “It’s the middle of the prostate that grows and squeezes the pipe. Prostate cancer grows on the outside and doesn’t squeeze the pipe until it gets quite advanced. So if two blokes come to see me, and both have a PSA of four [considered high], and one has bad symptoms and one has no symptoms, I’m worried about the one with no symptoms, while everyone else thinks you’re going to be worried about the one with symptoms.

He remembers the date because he was in Los Angeles to receive the Academy Museum Vantage Award, an honorary Oscar for work helping to “contextualise and challenge dominant narratives around cinema”. He was hiking in the Hollywood hills with his wife and mother of his two children, Dutch writer and film-maker Bianca Stigter, when he received the call. How did he feel? “The only time I felt really low was when I was on the hike with Bianca, and I came back and was fine. That night I gave a speech about the industry in front of, you know, George Clooney and Julia Roberts and the whole of Hollywood, basically, and it was funny because I’d been told that day I had cancer. It was a beautiful high and low.”“That must have been pretty stressful,” Challacombe says. “You’ve got that all internalised, you can’t tell anyone, and you’ve got to get on stage and do a speech.”“No, I felt liberated,” McQueen says. “I felt very powerful.”He looked for a surgeon and was recommended Challacombe. He was making Blitz, about London in the second world war, and initially thought he’d wait until that was finished for the operation. Challacombe explained to him that the op would result in infertility.“I had no problems with that,” McQueen says. “I don’t want any more kids, so that’s fine.” He is a renowned workaholic and soon realised he couldn’t focus on the film with the operation pending, so he opted to have it mid-shoot, in November 2022. Amazingly, he was back at work two weeks later.Surely that’s not normal? “There was a bit of pressure to turn him around quickly enough so he could get on with doing his job because there was a lot of insurance money involved if they lost weeks of filming,” Challacombe says.“I was surprised he went back so soon,” Minhas says. “I remember nagging him and saying, ‘You’re being a bit crazy here!’” Did he listen? “Oh no!”McQueen didn’t tell anyone on the set that he had cancer or that he’d had an operation. “I was in hospital for two days, then I was at home doing things on my laptop. I didn’t want anyone to know about it at the time because you have 200 people on the set and if they’re asking how you are all the time …” He trails off. “Leave it out, would ya!” he says in his best mockney. “You just want people to be focusing on the work rather than on you. So nobody knew about it until two years later.”What operation did he have? Well, if you want the title in its full glory, Challacombe says, it’s a bilateral, nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy. “We were trying to remove multiple small tumours in his prostate while preserving what we call his ‘functional outcomes’, which is a nerdy way of saying trying to make sure he goes back to his erections and continence as quickly and as well as he could.”“The funny thing is, the day after the operation, I thought I’d better not get an erection, because I had the catheter in. But I could feel, ‘Oooh, I can!’ D’you remember?” McQueen asks Challacombe.View image in fullscreenDetermined to make a difference … McQueen with Challacombe and Minhas“I’m not sure that you want to put that in the Guardian,” Challacombe says. “But that was great. If that happens, that’s a really good sign you’re going to recover, so I love it when blokes say that.” He says that this becomes obvious surprisingly quickly. “Not everybody will know this, but when they go to sleep blokes get nocturnal erections. It’s just part of the physiology of being a bloke.”I ask McQueen if he is fully functional now. “Yes, thank God,” he says.Even if he hadn’t fully recovered, of course it would have been worthwhile, McQueen says. But, as it is, things could not have gone better. “The whole thing was a great experience,” he says. The two doctors laugh. “Oh, come on!” Challacombe says. “It wasn’t agreatexperience! It was the least bad it could have been!”The three of them talk about what we can do as a society to make men, and particularly black men, more aware of regularly checking their prostate.“We sent out about 5,000 letters in Southwark, Lambeth and Lewisham encouraging people to go for PSA testing, and the hospital was worried that we were going to be overwhelmed,” Minhas says. “We had about five people come.”“Five!’ McQueen repeats, horrified. Letters in the post are not the answer, they conclude. They mention a couple of people who have ingeniously raised awareness through their work – ex-car mechanicErrol McKellaroffered 20% off MOTs to any men who had had PSA tests, while hairdresser Mark Rayment launchedBarbers Against Prostate Cancer, realising that barbershops are ideal community spaces in which to promote testing. Then there is theMan Van, often stationed at football grounds offering PSA tests. “It has shown far higher engagement from ethnic minorities than if they’d just been sent letters by the GP,” Challacombe says.The more we know, the more we are in a position to demand action. Challacombe mentions a significant study in Malmö – while four is generally regarded as a high PSA score, thisresearch revealedthe risk of serious prostate cancer that has spread outside the gland is 10 times higher if the PSA is above 1.6 when men are in their 40s.It’s inspiring to see three men so determined to make a difference. McQueen tells me he has so much to thank the two doctors for. But, ultimately, and to his great sadness, he believes that he owes his life to his father. “My father saved my life because I wouldn’t have done anything if it hadn’t been for his cancer,” he says.Amonth after meeting McQueen I read that his great friendAlex Wheatle has died of prostate cancer. The novelist was 62. Wheatle had a remarkable life. He spent much of his childhood in the Shirley Oaks care home in Croydon where many children were abused, was jailed for his part in the 1981 Brixton riots, and was awarded an MBE for his services to literature in 2008. McQueen made him the subject of a Small Axe film, simply titledAlex Wheatle.View image in fullscreenAlex Wheatle at the 2022 Hay festival.Photograph: Robert Melen/Rex/ShutterstockMcQueen calls me. He is clearly devastated. “Alex was like a Zelig character. You could see the world through his eyes. He wrote for children because he always understood the full potential of children. He always went back to youth to say, ‘Look, this is what you can be!’ He was a beautiful man.” And he was another man insufficiently aware of prostate cancer and so was diagnosed too late. “The thing is Alex is dead and I’m alive. I knew to look out for it, and he didn’t. And that makes me upset. I was talking to a relative the other day and she said, ‘You’re lucky.’ And I hated hearing that.Hated hearing it.It really upset me. Because it’s just this stupid information that could have saved people’s lives. It’s upsetting that my dad died. It’s upsetting that Alex died, it’s upsetting that so many men are dying, particularly black men. People are dying unnecessarily, and it’s foolish.”He asks me when the article’s coming out. There’s a sense of urgency about him. “I just want to help save lives,” he says.Find out more atProactive for Your Prostate websiteExplore more on these topicsSteve McQueenProstate cancerCancerMen's healthMenHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Perhaps one of the more modern marketing slogans such as “skin longevity” or “positive age management”. But my commitment to honesty in beauty extends to not fooling myself or my reader: we all know what these terms mean, and I know which one consumers Google in their millions.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I turned 50 recently. I was and am delighted about it. To still be alive, healthy, loved and in love feels like a lottery win. I’ve no desire to return to my 20s or 30s, when I cared more, knew less and had greater insecurities around my appearance than now. I don’t believe many of us at any age wish to be mistaken for someone much younger. And yet we know that people of all ages would like to keep skin glowier, smoother, juicier, firmer and flexible for longer. It’s a fine thing to want, and I find any accusations that this signals shame and desperation around growing old to be hugely patronising and selective. If you don’t care about skin ageing, great. Carry on. If you do, the products here will help in a realistic way.There are deliberate omissions. There are no cleansers here. Cleansing is the second most important step after sun protection. But because creams, balms and washes are on our faces so briefly, their ability to do anything lasting to skin’s ageing process is limited. Cleansing is vital to healthy skin. So the key is todoit– whichever cleanser is a pleasure to use, effective in makeup, dirt and sunscreen removal, regardless of anti-ageing claims.Similarly, I haven’t included eye creams, which is perhaps controversial, given that brands – and consumers – believe them to be the magic bullet against signs of ageing. They aren’t. If you love them, or can’t tolerate your usual skincare around the eyes, get one. But you don’t need an eye cream if your facial products contain the right anti-ageing ingredients and can be worn comfortably all over (I know very few dermatologists who use eye creams). And no, I don’t believe any cream or serum will change the presence of loose eye bags – you’ll need to see an aesthetic doctor if that’s what is driving you crazy.I also haven’t covered makeup because it is dependent on skin type and aesthetic preference, and because I am more appalled by the term “age appropriate” than “anti-ageing”. If one feels the urge to wear neon-pink lipstick at 50 or glittery eyeliner at 90, then one should do so. Time is finite. Enjoy it.The best anti-ageing products and treatmentsTheKliraSpecialView image in fullscreen£59 a month for 15ml at KliraWhenever a reader asks me to recommend a dermatologist for a cosmetic (rather than a health) concern, I always suggest saving the consultation fee and tryingKlirain the first instance. Founded by Dr Emma Craythorne, one of beauty’s most respected and revered consultant dermatologists, Klira is a service offering a thorough skin analysis (comprising 51 questions), followed by home delivery of bespoke prescription skincare, freshly made for each customer and charged monthly. All common cosmetic complaints are treated – including the signs of skin ageing – with one simple, easy-to-use cream. So, while the service isn’t cheap, it may prove more affordable than the cumulative cost of a multi-step routine using over-the-counter products.Garnier Ambre Solaire SPF50+ sensitive advancedserumView image in fullscreen£14 for 125ml at Look Fantastic£20 for 125ml at BootsEveryone needs sunscreen; no one needs to spend a fortune on it. This one is gentle enough to use on even sensitive faces and necks, but I could just as easily have chosen almost any other SPF product from the excellent and pretty affordable Garnier Ambre Solaire lineup. Elegant in texture, quick to apply and fast to absorb.Byoma brightening tonerView image in fullscreen£9.60 at Sephora£11.99 for 150ml at Cult BeautyAs skin matures, cell turnover slows, which can cause buildup, making it appear duller than before. Exfoliants can be extremely beneficial, but a simultaneous decrease in oil production means that some may feel too harsh and drying. This is why my exfoliating acid of choice is lactic, which moisturises as it sloughs away dead skin. This very competitively priced product fits the bill, and because it’s a toner, it won’t overcomplicate your routine with yet another serum (one is quite enough). Stroke on to skin two to three mornings a week after cleansing. And always wear sunscreen too.Skin1004Hyalu-Cica blue serumView image in fullscreen£12.99 for 50ml at TK Maxx£14 for 50ml at SuperdrugWhen the upper layer of your skin is hydrated, it looks smoother, plumper, healthier, younger. I adore this Korean serum, combining glycerin (a humectant that draws and holds water in the skin) and hyaluronic and polyglutamic acids to give skin of any age a youthfully juicy appearance. Suitable for any skin type – use whenever and as often as you like.Medik8 Crystal retinalView image in fullscreenFrom £45 for 30ml at Medik8From £45 for 30ml at Cult BeautyYou’ll get bored of my mentioning them, but there can be no argument: retinoids, a class of vitamin A derivatives, are far and away the most proven ingredients (warning: not safe in pregnancy) for reducing several visible signs of ageing – including wrinkles, slackening and uneven tone. Consequently, they are still considered the gold standard in anti-ageing skincare. They haven’t always been pleasant to use, but modern derivatives such as retinaldehyde work faster, better and with less irritation than their predecessors. British brand Medik8’s Crystal Retinal range of retinaldehyde serums is, for me, the best in class. Its easy-to-understand “ladder” of concentrations makes it simple to choose the right one and climb up to suitably higher strengths as your skin becomes acclimatised and tolerant.The Ordinary retinal 0.2% emulsionView image in fullscreen£15.20 for 15ml at John Lewis£15.20 for 15ml at the OrdinaryNow that retinaldehyde is overtaking the mainstream popularity of retinol, more affordable brands are adding some excellent, more democratic products to their lineups. This is a terrific serum at a great price. Try using it two to three times in the first week, and if your skin is tolerating it well (some increased dryness is normal in the short term), graduate to nightly. It should then result in increased smoothness, glow and clarity in three to four weeks.No7 Future Renew damage reversal serumView image in fullscreen£34.95 for 25ml at No7 beauty£37.95 for 25ml at BootsAlthough I take issue with the arguably irresponsible “Don’t regret, just reverse” slogan of this product (the prevention of sun damage isn’t just preferable, it’s vital to overall health), the AI research behind No7’s formulation does impress some dermatologists I know. It certainly ticks several boxes: patented, cutting-edge peptides, plus vitamin C, hyaluronic acid and niacinamide (a form of vitamin B3) all go together to make this a good, multipurpose daily serum for any skin type. It addresses common concerns resulting from previous sun damage, such as uneven skin tone and sunspots, lines, wrinkles and loss of firmness.Ziip Halo nanocurrent and microcurrent facial toning deviceView image in fullscreen£379.99 at ZiipYes, it costs a fortune. But I am sent dozens of skin devices every year and this nanocurrent gadget is the only one in close to 30 years that’s stayed in regular use – and I bought a spare for travel. Why? Because after a four-minute treatment I see instant results that last all day – a noticeably tighter jawline and lifted cheeks and neck. I’m not convinced by any long-term claims by the manufacturers, but I feel I look better today, and that’s enough.Mecca Cosmetica To Save Face SPF50+ brightening sun serumView image in fullscreen£38 for 50ml at Mecca CosmeticaThe older I get, the more light I like on my face. A subtle glow without glitter, that catches the light to add lustre without shine, is hard to come by. This broad-spectrum (protecting against both UVA and UVB rays), high-protection sunscreen with niacinamide has exactly the finish I want, scattering light over past sun damage and preventing future harm. It sits beautifully under makeup and moisturises without grease (I apply it straight over my serum and don’t need a day cream, which better justifies the cost). The Australians really know how to make sunscreen.Ultra Violette SPF50+ Future Fluidsuperlight mineral skinscreenView image in fullscreen£38 for 50ml at Ultra Violette£38 for 50ml at SpaceNKAnother superlative Aussie sunscreen – this time, a mineral one. There are several reasons why a mineral UV filter may work better than a synthetic sunscreen. Synthetic filters can make sensitive skin react, cause eye-watering and sometimes pill under makeup. People with conditions such as melasma or eczema may also find mineral filters more helpful in the long term. This new ultra-fine, almost invisible option from Ultra Violette is here to serve, minus any of the usual cons associated with mineral products, like greasy texture and an ashy white cast.Yepoda The Glow Hero bakuchiol oil serum hybridView image in fullscreen£25 for 30ml at Yepoda£26 for 30ml at SephoraIf you’re lazy, time-poor or only notionally engaged with skincare, oil is your best friend. Instantly moisturising, a good oil will make most skins look immediately more healthy and glowy. This elegant and well-priced Korean oil is light (thanks to squalane), non-greasy, and absorbs well. It contains bakuchiol, a gentle retinoid alternative with similar, if milder, benefits. Suitable for vegans.Altruist sunscreen SPF50View image in fullscreen£27.95 for 1 litre at Victoria Health£27.95 for 1 litre at AmazonAltruist was founded by dermatologists on a mission to democratise sun protection, making what is an essential part of healthcare affordable to all. The price may seem high, but this enormous litre bottle represents, millilitre for millilitre, some of the best value high-quality, broad-spectrum sunscreen on the market. Using sun protection daily is the single most important thing we can do to prevent premature skin ageing from UV. Without sunscreen, every anti-ageing skincare product is pointless.First Aid Beauty ultra repair firming collagen cream£39.50 for 50ml at Sephora£39.50 for 50ml at Feel UniqueWe have become so obsessed with sophisticated anti-ageing treatments that we tend to overlook one of the most important: moisturising. As we age, oil production slows and the levels of ceramides (lipids or fats) decrease, leaving most skins drier. A richer moisturiser improves comfort, smoothness and the appearance of healthy skin. The brand isn’t hugely important, but this one from First AidBeautypacks in gentle, effective ingredients such as skin-repairing peptides, hydrating glycerin, soothing colloidal oats, multi-benefit niacinamide and moisturising ceramides and squalane. I’d ignore the collagen, having never seen any evidence that it does anything when applied topically. But there’s so much else here that it doesn’t matter.Goodal vegan rice milk moisturising creamView image in fullscreen£19.35 for 70ml at Korean Skincare£20 for 70ml at TescoThis is another ceramide-rich moisturiser, at a more affordable price, and suitable for even the most sensitive skin. Vegan friendly, simple in formula but sophisticated in texture, this extremely gentle Korean face cream is a pleasure to use – day, night or whenever skin feels dry or sore.Beauty Pie C-Wave rejuvenating LED treatment for handsView image in fullscreen£200 at Beauty PieLED masks have surged in popularity since lockdown, and they can help reduce redness and improve skin texture. But this version appeals to me and my prematurelyveryaged hands (because of a congenital skin condition). Expect to see some reduction in age spots, redness and crepiness in about six weeks. Remember that no gadget is worth your money if you’re not going to use it regularly, so be realistic about your commitment.Naturium vitamin C complex serumView image in fullscreen£22 for 30ml at SpaceNK£22 for 30ml at BootsIt feels as though vitamin C is somewhat out of favour. I believe this owes much to the surge in popularity of Korean skincare, which tends not to be focused on active anti-ageing ingredients, but on multi-layered hydration. There’s no reason to choose between them, though. Vitamin C, in the right formula, delivers instant glow and protection against skin-ageing free radicals. It can also build collagen, the depletion of which causes skin ageing. This vitamin C serum is a great price and easy to use. Apply after cleansing each morning and before moisturiser and/or sunscreen.Simple10% niacinamide (vitamin B3) booster serumView image in fullscreen£6.66 for 30ml at Boots£9.99 for 30ml at SuperdrugNiacinamide does many useful things for all skin types, but especially maturing ones. It helps reduce large, visible pores, soften fine lines, unify skin tone, improve dullness and foster a healthy skin barrier. But there’s no need to spend money on extra niacinamide. Anything that is 5% or over is effective, while a concentration as high as 15-20% may not be tolerated well by your skin. Just add a few drops of this handy serum to whatever you fancy.The Ordinary GF15% solution,30mlView image in fullscreen£13.50 for 30ml at John Lewis£13.50 for 30ml at BootsWhen growth factors (GF) – peptides that help firm and plump maturing skin – began to appear in skincare products 14 years ago, few could afford them. Prices remained prohibitively high until recently when democratic skincare brand the Ordinary brought out its own GF product for about a tenth of the usual cost. You’d never know. I love this thin, gentle, suitable-for-anyone serum, and during a period when an unrelated allergy stopped me from using lots of active ingredients for a few months, I applied it almost daily. Gives a smoother texture and a healthy look. Among the cheapest serums in my bathroom – and it’s staying.Paula’s ChoiceC15 super boosterView image in fullscreen£52 for 20ml at Paula’s Choice£52 for 20ml at Cult BeautyIf you’d like to use vitamin C but struggle to slot it into your usual routine, this can be mixed in with your serum or moisturiser. It combines the gold standard vitamin C, L-ascorbic acid – at a good concentration – with ferulic acid and vitamin E in a stable, lightweight formula that seems to be tolerated well by all skin types.Elizabeth Arden retinol + HPR ceramide rapid skin renewing water creamView image in fullscreen£75 for 50ml at Boots£77 for 50ml at Cult BeautyFor years, I applied a thick layer of bland cream on my face and neck before my retinoid, to stop sensitive areas from becoming irritated (a practice known as “buffering”). Since this light, hydrating cream launched, I’ve gone straight in neat and never looked back. It remains one of only three facial retinoids (the others areMurad Retinal ReSculpt overnight treatmentandKate Somerville Mega-A skin transforming serum) I can slather around my eyes and on my neck with no ill effects. One of my most popular recommendations in recent years, according to your messages.Medik8 bakuchiol peptidesView image in fullscreen£55 for 30ml at Sephora£55 for 30ml at Medik8I’m often asked by habitual retinol users for a safe alternative in pregnancy, and I usually suggest this. It is gentle, moisturising and delivers peptides, which send communicating signals to skin cells, telling them to perform specific actions depending on which of the almost infinite number of peptide combinations are present. The peptides here support even skin tone (melanin production can go haywire during pregnancy), and the bakuchiol smooths wrinkles. It should be noted that while British dermatologists are generally happy for bakuchiol to be used in pregnancy, your doctor may not be, especially if they are in the US, where advice is more cautious. The same applies to (non-pregnancy-safe) retinoids during breastfeeding: it’s typically a “yes, carry on” from dermatologists in the UK, a “no, better not” in the US. So speak to your doctor if you’re worried.Beauty Pie Super retinolhandcreamView image in fullscreen£21 for 75ml at Beauty PieIf you’re keen to address sun damage, age spots and other signs of ageing on your hands, deploy the same effective ingredients found in your facial skincare. This overnight hand treatment delivers encapsulated retinol and cushions it in rich, moisturising shea butter to deliver short- and long-term benefits in one dollop. Apply before bed.Go-ToVery Amazing retinalView image in fullscreen£52 for 30ml at Go-ToAnother retinoid (yes, I know), but this one is notable for several reasons. If you don’t fancy a prescription subscription – such asSkin+Me,Dermatica(both great) orKlira(see above) – this is the most potent retinoid (0.25%) available over the counter (or, in this case, online). The serum is a one-and-done night treatment (hallelujah) containing firming peptides, niacinamide for a more even skin tone and several soothing ingredients – just apply after cleansing and head to bed. Retinal is less likely to cause irritation than retinol, but nonetheless, this one is of such a high concentration that only seasoned retinoid users should use it.ToxininjectionsI don’t get filler (although I have tried it in the past), I’ve had no facial cosmetic surgery – unless you count my earlobes 25-odd years ago – I simply can’t be bothered with lasers, ultrasound or microneedling, and I rarely have time for facials. But I do get Botox injections every five months withDr Wassim Taktouk,and I’ve no intention of stopping. Love them or hate them – what you do or don’t choose to do to your own face is no one’s business but your own – toxin injections, when administered by an experienced, qualified professional, are the most effective way to relax deeper wrinkles, remove frown lines and lift moderately drooping eyes. I say this not to encourage anyone to get Botox unless they want to, but to let you know that nothing in a bottle, jar or tube will have the same effect – and if you see any marketing claim to the contrary, do not proceed to checkout. What Botox never does is improve the quality of skin. That’s where good skincare comes in, and why I would always prioritise that over any jab.Murad Vita-C glycolicserumView image in fullscreen£70.40 for 30ml at Debenhams£88 for 30ml at M&SI have a strong aversion to multi-serum routines – I don’t have the time in the morning or the inclination at night. This multipurpose serum provides heaps of bang for your (admittedly, not inconsiderable) buck. Glycolic acid gives glow to dull skin, vitamin C provides antioxidant protection and promotes a more even skin tone, while glycerin – my favourite humectant – provides stacks of plumping hydration and comfort. One of my all-time most used products and a staple in my travel bag. Apply in the morning, before sunscreen.The Inkey List ectoin hydro-barrier serumView image in fullscreen£15 for 30ml at Beauty Bay£15 for 30ml at SephoraI’ve always said it: there is little more ageing to the skin than inflammation, so it’s important not to overdo active ingredients such as retinol and vitamin C, which in high concentrations and quantities can cause irritation and redness. More is not always better. For times when you’ve been overzealous, restoring a comfortable, moist and protected skin barrier is key. This fairly priced serum can be used every day on dehydrated, sensitive skin, or as a course when otherwise calm skin flares up during a mild illness or in extreme temperatures.L’Oréal Paris Revitalift Laser tri-peptides age-correcting serumView image in fullscreen£31.99 for 30ml at Boots£31.99 for 30ml at Look FantasticIf you’re looking for a multipurpose serum, after which you can forget about the whole thing, this is a great option. It’s got an evidenced tri-peptide complex to soften lines and wrinkles, vitamin C for glow and pigmentation, and hyaluronic acid for plumping hydration. It’s all there in one easy-to-apply serum, to be slotted in between cleansing and moisturising.Dr Jart+Ceramidinectoin-infused cream£56 for 50ml at Boots£54 for 50ml at Space NK“Buttery” is an adjective that’s overused when it comes to cosmetics, but in this instance it’s accurate. This very thick, rich and yet somehow non-greasy face cream contains the same soothing, hydrating ectoin (an amino acid derivative that’s proved effective in calming inflamed and dehydrated skin) as the Inkey List serum above and can be layered over the top or worn with your usual skincare as a gentle buffer. Nonirritating, cosseting and soft, it’s like a hug for your rattled skin barrier. Surprisingly, all this still works well as a makeup base.Dove Body Love Pro-Age Care body lotionView image in fullscreen£7.99 for 400ml at Boots£7.99 for 400ml at SuperdrugI love everything about this affordable, easily absorbed body lotion, which is suitable for all skin types. Lactic acidsloughs away dead skin on limbs made flaky or ashy by slower cell turnover, niacinamide promotes healthy skin beneath, and glycerin hydrates skin back to plump, glowy health. It leaves skin smooth to the touch. I get through gallons of the stuff, especially in T-shirts‑and‑shorts season.Don’t forget your smileI strongly believe that restoring, straightening and whitening one’s ageing, often wonky teeth is the most valuable “anti-ageing” treatment available – more so than any skin treatment, injection or facial surgery. Healthy-looking, appealing teeth boost confidence, encourage wide smiling, and can restore lost structure to a maturing face. Just one course of whitening can take years off. I went (at my own expense) tothe abc Smilein London for my makeover, but there are now excellent, relatively affordable cosmetic dentistry and implant clinics in every town.Prices vary according to location, treatment and method.Explore more on these topicsBeautyThe FilterSkincareAgeingCosmetic surgeryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For milk chocolate, I like at least 40% cocoa solids, and for dark 60%. Anything much higher than that can be a bit intense for an Easter egg, and almosttoogrownup – after all, it still needs to be fun! Personally, I lean towards chocolate with a bit of texture and added crunch to keep things interesting, and good thickness is always a winner.The best chocolate Easter treatsBestall-rounderHotel Chocolat milk chocolate Big City Easter bunnyView image in fullscreen£11.95 at Hotel Chocolat, 150g£10.15 at John Lewis, 150g★★★★☆A smart-looking bunny with good-quality, silky, creamy milk chocolate. The ears are perfectly thick, and thin out towards the rest of the body, making this something you could quite happily work your way through on the sofa without feeling queasy afterwards.Best splurgeWaitrose No 1 the chocolate croissant Easter eggView image in fullscreen£15 at Waitrose, 275g★★★★☆Big points for the most unique shape (I don’t think I’ve ever seen a chocolate croissant). There’s a lovely thickness to it, but I’d prefer it if the pieces of feuilletine wafer were a little larger. Tastes like a grownup Caramac, but it isn’t nearly as sweet as you might expect.Best bargainChococo oat milk chocolate spring chickenView image in fullscreen£10 Chococo, 100g (currently out of stock)★★★★☆I adore the plastic-free packaging and tissue paper wrapping, while the coloured chocolate splatters make italmosttoo pretty to eat. There’s also something quite pleasing about the way it fits perfectly in the palm of your hand. There is a strong aftertaste of oat milk, which I actually don’t mind, but others may not love.And the rest…Choc on Choc golden chocolate squirrel and acornView image in fullscreen£12 at Choc on Choc, 90g★★★★☆I like that there are two pieces, not least because that makes it so much easier to share. They’re completely solid but small enough that they aren’t overwhelming.

There’s a slight graininess to the texture and it’s a touch too sweet, but I’d say this is a good plant-based option for those looking for something similar to white chocolate.M&S extremely chocolatey biscuity Easter eggView image in fullscreen£12 at Ocado, 370g★★☆☆☆As a big fan of the biscuits that inspired this egg, I had high expectations. The egg is smaller than you might expect, given the size of the box, but once it’s in my hands, I realise that’s probably for the best – it’s got such a weight to it! The crunch from all the biscuit pieces is great, but they get lost in the over-sweet, lower-quality chocolate.Montezuma’s milk chocolate henView image in fullscreen£14 at Montezuma’s, 200g★★☆☆☆A nice-sized hen with pretty specks of white and dark chocolate, but the shell is thinner than I’d like.

Share the story of your sex life, anonymouslyAs told to Olivia LadanyiSat 5 Apr 2025 07.00 EDTShareDoug, 35It was like we’d pressed a reset button on our relationshipWhen I met Maggie on a night out 10 years ago, I fancied her instantly. Even though she kissed my friend that night, I didn’t let that stop me pursuing her. I liked how different she was from everyone I’d known growing up. She was so kind. And hot. My friends would ask what it was like to have sex with someone so attractive – I felt validated by the fact she’d chosen to be with me. It was a rush. This strong physical attraction translated into the bedroom – I couldn’t imagine getting into bed with her and not wanting to have sex.Naturally, this initial intensity dulled over time. The lustful honeymoon period never lasts for ever – but then your relationship transforms into something else. We both have stressful jobs, and our periods of peak work stress are rarely aligned, so we almost take turns in the roles of the initiator and the rejected. At these times, sex can feel political, with us both thinking, “I initiated last time so I’m not doing it again.” New environments, like going on holiday, bring the energy back into our sex life, but then everyday stresses mean this doesn’t last when we return. We will be home for a day, and already sex will seem out of reach.We’re having sex much more frequently, but it’s also opened up communication around sexThere is a rare genetic condition in my family, which I’d mentally pushed aside until Maggie and I decided to have kids. If my dad had the gene, I probably would too, and so could my children. The day we found out that he didn’t, Maggie and I had incredible sex. It was as though an unbelievable weight had been lifted and we’d pressed a reset button on our relationship. We could start trying to get pregnant without worrying about passing it on, and my dad and I would not develop the disease.Trying for a baby has reinvigorated our sex life. We’re having sex much more frequently, but it’s also opened up communication around sex. Before, we wouldn’t acknowledge it if we hadn’t had sex for ages, but if that happens again, we’ll be able to talk more openly about it. Which, from what I’ve heard about the effect having kids has on your sex life, will come in useful.Share your experienceIf you’re keen to talk to us about your sex lives you can get in touch by filling in the form below.

I was trying for a promotion for two of those years, and when I’m feeling anxious, sex is the last thing on my mind. But instead of communicating that, I retreat into myself, shutting Doug out. There were also periods when Doug was stressed and didn’t feel like having sex, so I felt rejected. When he was worried about the genetic disease, we weren’t having much sex, which pushed us apart. It got to a point last year where we said, “We need to talk about this,” and since then we’ve got better at telling each other how we’re feeling.It’s not all about getting pregnant, although that excitement means the sex we’re having is more adventurousThe day we got the results was the best day. It’s the happiest I’ve ever felt. It brought us closer and we started spending more time together. Life suddenly felt stress-free. Eight months later, we started trying for a baby, which has improved our sex life. We now have sex twice a day when I’m ovulating. After ovulation, we don’t have sex for a few days, but we still have sex for pleasure. It’s not all about getting pregnant, although that excitement means the sex we’re having is more adventurous – in different rooms, at different times of day. We wake up and have morning sex, so ironically, even though sex is more organised, it’s encouraged us to step out of our routine.We’ve been trying for five months, and I do feel disappointed when I get my period. I worry that if we struggle to get pregnant this energy won’t last, or it could become a new source of anxiety. But I think having kids will make us even closer, and being a dad will bring out a whole new side to Doug that will make me fancy him even more.Explore more on these topicsSexThis is how we do itRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Later photograph: Pål Hansen/The Guardian. Styling: Andie Redman. Archive image: courtesy of Rob BeckettBorn in south London in 1986,Rob Beckettis a comedian and broadcaster. He started on the standup circuit in 2009, performing at the Edinburgh fringe in 2012 with his show Rob Beckett’s Summer Holiday. Television quickly beckoned – after hosting ITV2’s I’m a Celebrity spin-off series, he became a panel-show regular, appearing on programmes including 8 Out of 10 Cats and Taskmaster, as well as the travel series Rob & Romesh vs … . In 2020, he launched the hit podcast Parenting Hell with comedian Josh Widdicombe. He is married and has two daughters. His current tour, Giraffe, continues until April 2026.That’s my dad in the backgroundbut, aside from that, I’ve got no other details. It might have been on holiday, possibly at my dad’s mate’s place in Spain. We always went there – he gave it to us for cheap, but I’m not sure why. You don’t ask questions in my family.I don’t know why I was crying, either. As a parent myself, I do wonder if my first reaction on seeing my child upset would be: “That’s a good picture.” I’d probably be more likely to put the camera down and try to resolve it. I certainly wouldn’t want to document it at a time when taking a photo and getting it developed was a massive commitment.Maybe it’s a fundamental personality trait or being the middle child, but I’d describe my younger self as being a “shy attention-seeker”. I definitely liked making people laugh, and I got good at it because it was so competitive in my house. Everyone was loud and funny – I was just the only one who decided to do it in the formal setting of a comedy club.At first I used comedy as a tool to help with my self-worth. A bad gig would dictate my mood for the whole weekApart from when I was with my circle of friends, I didn’t make jokes at school. Where I was from in Mottingham, you got attention by being good at fighting or being good at football. There were no class clowns – the type of humour preferred at my school was essentially being naughty. It was kids screwing up balls of paper and throwing them at the teacher’s head, and then watching them implode, rather than someone getting up at the front of class and doing a couple of gags.I felt abit lost and alone when I was littlebecause I couldn’t learn in the same way as everyone else. I wasn’t very good academically – I recently found out that was because I was dyslexic. Being undiagnosed for so long, coupled with a teacher telling me aged four that I was not intelligent and wouldn’t amount to anything, meant I spent a lot of my younger years with no self-confidence.That insecurity, coupled with the working-class fear of having no money, made me very driven. So, when I found that I had the ability to do standup, I was like a dog with a bone. I thought: “Comedy is the only thing I’ve got. I’ve been told I’ve got nothing else, but they can’t tell me I haven’t got this!” It started out of fear and carried on out of ego, to prove the teachers wrong.As a teenager, I’d watch standup comics on TVand I realised I could predict the punchline. It made me think that I could probably write my own jokes. I was 23 when I finally got the courage to do it in public. My first gig was at Up the Creek in Greenwich. I don’t normally drink before a gig, but I had two pints to get my confidence up. Until that point, I had never done anything on stage; even in school plays I was mostly at the back. I remember the brightness of the lights – it was like the beam of 20 cars were on me. But I got through five minutes, I got a few laughs, and I survived. When I got home that night, I couldn’t sleep. I started kicking my feet with excitement and the covers came off me. I was so adrenalised and excited; it felt like I’d done a skydive.When I started gigging properly, I set myself a goal – I’d do four shows a week just to reduce the amount of fear I had. I was doing temp jobs in offices at the time, so, often, I’d finish my shift then go out and get dinner, which was always the £1 shit sushi from Tesco. I’d then sleep in a disabled toilet in the office before my gig. I’d curl up on the floor in the corner, normally by the shower.I hid the fact that I was doing standup comedy from my family for ages,just in case it went wrong. I knew my mum and dad would be OK with it, but I didn’t want my extended family to find out and go: “Oh, he’s tried to be funny on stage. What a wanker.” It’s very much a working-class mentality. There are certain people who don’t want anyone to do well – they’d rather drag you down than encourage you, because other people’s success shines a light back on their own unwillingness to try.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

You’d struggle to find anyone who does standup who isn’t a bit weird’Read moreAt first I used comedy as a tool to help with my self-worth, but that method quickly became toxic. A bad gig would dictate my mood for the whole week. Through therapy, I can now detach myself from who I am as a performer. If the gig goes well, that’s great, but it has no impact on me as an individual. That said, I am planning on taking a break. I’ve always loved standup, and always will, but I would like to have a hiatus from it after this tour. I want to focus on the girls, because they’ll be 11 and nine when it finishes. By the time they’re teens, I want to be regarded as the minicab dad. I want them to be so bored of me when I come through the front door that they don’t even so much as look up, as opposed to it being a big event.The Parenting Hell podcast was born out of the difficulties of raising kids during the pandemic, but it has become like an audio reality show of mine and Josh’s lives. People find it interesting because it’s relatable – we might both be on the telly, but that doesn’t stop your boiler exploding just before you take your kids to school in the morning.I do still relate to the boy in the picture.I feel a bit sorry for him – not because of the crying, but because of how confused he was about to be at school, and how long it took to find out why. I still cry a lot – I am pretty in touch with my emotions. Anything can set me off: if my kids say something really sweet, or if I have a sad thought. I’ve fully opened the doors now and I’m happy for the feelings to flow in and out. Plus, I’m just constantly tired. Everyone’s emotional when they’re tired. I got one of those health monitors recently, and it keeps telling me that I’ve only had three hours sleep. I’m like, tell me about it!Do I still define myself as a shy attention-seeker? In my personal life, I definitely struggle with being the centre of attention. I don’t ever want any big drama around me. If there’s a problem, I’m never the one to say: “Guys, we need to go for a drink and talk.” I don’t really do big birthday parties, either. But then my profession would suggest I am still desperate for a bit of the spotlight. Maybe a reluctant attention-seeker is a better phrase.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleFlashbackRob BeckettComedyTelevisionPodcastsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The new wave of non-opioid pain reliefPharma firms are developing drugs that avoid the brain’s opioid receptors to minimise the risks of dependence and overdoses, but not all experts are convincedAyisha SharmaSat 5 Apr 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 5 Apr 2025 08.01 EDTShareIn January, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)approvedthe first new type of painkiller in more than two decades. The decision roused excitement across the healthcare sector for a key reason: the drug, which is called suzetrigine and sold under the brand name Journavx, is not an opioid.Opioid painkillers such as oxycodone and morphine are still used to treat severe pain in the UK and US. But they come with an obvious downside: the risk of addiction.Between 1999 and 2017, the number of overdose deaths in the US involving prescription opioidssoaredalmost 400% from 3,442 to 17,029, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. In England and Wales the number of cases where opiates were mentioned on a death certificaterosefrom 1,332 in 1999 to 2,551 in 2023, according to the Office for National Statistics.Pharma companies have been trying to develop safer painkillers since the start of the US opioid crisis. But these efforts have proven notoriously difficult, with aless than 1% chancethat a novel pain drug will advance from phase 1 clinical trials to FDA approval.One reason for this is that pain is not a purely physical phenomenon, but is also influenced by psychological factors.The success of Journavx marks a welcome break from a long history of setbacks, but experts say it is just one piece of the puzzle. For starters, the medicine is only available for certain types of short-term pain, but there are many other kinds of pain that still need new treatments.Further, the science behind some of those other types of pain is not clear, which makes designing treatments for them challenging. And pain relief is itself a rewarding experience. So opioid or not, is there even such a thing as a non-addictive painkiller?What is pain?When you think of pain, you might picture someone stubbing their toe. This type of pain – when something damages bodily tissue – is called nociceptive pain. Sensory neurons at the site of damage called nociceptors get activated, says Grégory Scherrer, associate professor at the University of North Carolina’s department of cell biology and physiology. The nociceptors send signals to the spinal cord, where other neurons process them.Next, the signals travel through complex pathways into several parts of the brain. One of those parts, the cortex, is responsible for processing sensory information, says Anthony Dickenson, emeritus professor of neuroscience, physiology and pharmacology at University College London (UCL). It is only once this processing occurs that we “feel” the signal as pain.A second type of pain – called neuropathic pain – happens as a result of damage to or disease of the nervous system outside the brain and spinal cord, Dickenson says. Damaged or defective neurons fire off signals that go through the same process. One example is diabetic peripheral neuropathy, where high blood sugar damages blood vessels that transport blood to the nerves, resulting in nerve damage and, potentially, death in the extremities.One person could have a little wear and tear in their knees and feel significant pain, while another person with even more damage could feel no painIn general, then, pain perception involves two systems. This first is a network of nerves running through the limbs, organs and other tissues, also known as the peripheral nervous system. Then there is the central nervous system, made up of the brain and spinal cord.A third type of pain is less well understood. Nociplastic pain involves no obvious damage to tissues or neurons, but is thought to be driven by a problem with how the central nervous system processes signals. “Relatively normal stimuli produce pain when they shouldn’t,” Dickenson says. A key example is fibromyalgia, a disorder that mostly affects women.Some researchers believe nociplastic pain is simply a more subtle form of nociceptive or neuropathic pain where the tissue or nerve damage is harder to detect, says Jeffrey Mogil, professor at McGill University’s department of psychology in Montreal.In a medical setting, pain is treated according to how long it lasts, says Amanda Williams, professor of clinical health psychology at UCL. Pain that lasts for three months or less – after an injury or operation, for example – is generally classed as acute, while pain that lasts longer than three months is often considered chronic.The amount of pain a person feels does not always correlate with physical signs of damage, Williams says. For instance, one person could have a little wear and tear in their knees and feel significant pain, while another person with even more damage could feel no pain.Is pain relief addictive?Regardless of the type and length, people are wired to dislike pain. Besides the cortex, pain signals also travel to another part of the brain called the limbic system, which is responsible for processing emotions, Dickenson says.This triggers the feelings of fear, anxiety and depression that often accompany pain. Pain signals also switch off the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with feelings of reward, Dickenson adds. Relief from pain is “absolutely rewarding” in and of itself, says Mark Hutchinson, professor at the University of Adelaide’s school of biomedicine.But there are many experiences that are rewarding without being addictive, from eating to seeing friends, Williams says. The “switch point”, at which a reward becomes an addiction, is defined by detriment to a person’s broader health and wellbeing, according to Hutchinson. Opioid painkillers can flip this switch because of how they work.The resulting dopamine dump creates a feeling of reward or pleasure that can be over and above the inherently rewarding nature of pain reliefOpioids interrupt pain signalling by binding to and activating inhibitory opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord. These receptors form part of the body’s endogenous opioid system, which helps regulate pain and mood. But one of the receptors – the μ-opioid receptor – can increase dopamine signalling between certain parts of the brain when activated.The resulting dopamine dump creates a feeling of reward or pleasure that can be over and above the inherently rewarding nature of pain relief. The body can also build a tolerance to opioids over time, meaning that higher doses of the drugs may be required to experience the same feeling of pain relief or reward. This creates the basis for addiction.But there are lots of painkillers that do not operate on the reward system, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen, says Christopher Eccleston, professor of psychology at the University of Bath. “Is pain relief always going to be addictive? I think the answer is no.”What are the alternatives to opioids?Journavx was developed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals and belongs to a class of drugs that block voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs).VGSCs allow sodium ions to flow into certain cells of the body. Once inside the cells, the ions trigger electrical activity – or action potentials – that are responsible for a range of bodily functions, from heart beats to pain signalling.Journavx selectively blocks a VGSC called Nav1.8 that is predominantly found in pain-sensing neurons in the peripheral nervous system, says David Altshuler, chief scientific officer of Vertex. The drug does not act on the brain the way opioids do and instead acts outside the brain, meaning there is no addiction risk.Vertex has not applied for Journavx approval in the UK. In the US, the drug is only available for moderate to severe acute pain.View image in fullscreenNon-opioid suzetrigine is the first new painkiller to be approved by the FDA in more than two decades.Photograph: Wladimir Bulgar/AlamySome experts are sceptical about the need for a non-opioid in acute pain. It is relatively rare that someone taking an opioid for a few days after a surgery gets addicted to them, although it can happen, Scherrer says. There is also more communication about the risks of opioids these days and many patients request a minimal amount before switching to another medicine, he adds.But Altshuler says the need is clear, citing estimates that 80,000 people a year in the US develop an opioid addiction just because they were given one for acute pain.Experts agree that there is a significant need for non-opioid painkillers in chronic pain. There islittle evidenceof the effectiveness of opioids in treating chronic pain, according to the NHS, and using them long term only increases the risk of addiction.Chronic pain is treated with much less success than acute pain, says David Andersson, professor of neuroscience at King’s College London. Each chronic pain condition has a different cause and in many cases, the cause is not well understood, he adds. To introduce a further layer of complication, placebos have been performing increasingly well in clinical trials of pain in recent decades, Mogil says, citingresearchpublished in 2015 on which he appeared as an author.One potential explanation for this trend is the presence of a neural circuit in the brain that mediates people’s perception of pain based on their expectations of it, according toresearchco-written by Scherrer in 2024. People enrolled in clinical trials may expect to experience relief from pain. “When we’re expecting pain relief, we’re recruiting circuits in our brain that release endogenous opioids,” which itself suppresses pain, Scherrer explains.In a study of patients with a chronic condition called lumbosacral radiculopathy, Journavxproduceda level of pain reduction in the legs similar to that achieved by placebo. The drug did significantly reduce patients’ pain from their baseline level, which is what the trial was designed to show, according to Vertex. The company added that the placebo arm was included for “reference” and not for “statistical comparison”.But experts largely remain unconvinced. The idea that Journavx works for lumbosacral radiculopathy seems “farcical” in the face of evidence that it does not work any better than placebo, Mogil says. Vertex said it plans to design future trials in a way that better controls placebo response.Another new type of painkiller called cebranopadol is also angling for FDA approval after it succeeded in two late-stage clinical trials of acute pain after various surgeries. Cebranopadol activates the μ-opioid receptor, but also activates the nociceptin opioid receptor (NOP). The latter is structured very similarly to an opioid receptor but it behaves differently, says Scherrer.Activating the NOP significantly reduces the effects of reward, tolerance and respiratory depression (slowness or shallowness of breathing) associated with μ-opioid receptor activation, according to Tris Pharma, the company behind cebranopadol. The result is a painkiller with similar effectiveness to an opioid but with much lower risk, the company said.How opioid painkillers work, why they are addictive and how to avoid dependencyRead moreIn what is known as a human abuse potential study, non-addicted recreational opioid users were given two types of opioids – oxycodone and tramadol – and cebranopadol to see which one they preferred. Cebranopadol was the least preferred of the three active drugs and only marginally preferred to placebo, says Tris’s chief executive, Ketan Mehta.Another drug maker, Vertanical, recently reported phase 3 success for its non-opioid drug, VER-01, in patients with chronic back pain. The drug contains THC – the active ingredient in cannabis that causes a “high”. Patients in the trial did not experience intoxication because THC levels in their body were not high enough, the company said.Despite all these new pharmaceutical approaches, most experts agree that there is no such thing as a magic bullet for pain. “We’re going to have to treat pain with multiple drugs that act in the peripheral nervous system, in the central nervous system, in the brain and on emotions and cognition, and not just on sensory systems,” Scherrer says. He adds that other types of treatments such as neurostimulation and cognitive behavioural therapy will also play a key role.Explore more on these topicsScienceThe ObserverOpioidsDrugsPharmaceuticals industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Not only does the average mortgage rate start with a “5” but borrowers face hefty arrangement fees to secure the best deals. These are the fees paid to lenders purely to secure a certain rate, and come on top of any conveyancing or broker fees.Over the past five years the average product fee on a fixed-rate mortgage has risen by £81 to £1,121, according to the data firm Moneyfacts. At the same time, the proportion of deals available without a fee has fallen from 41% to 36%. There are also fewer deals offering sweeteners such as cashback.How looser affordability rules may widen home ownership in the UKRead moreThe highest fee Guardian Money found was £3,995 for products offered by Bespoke Bank of Ireland, although the lender specialises in “complex” cases. However, big high street lenders such as Santander, Halifax and Barclays all have deals with a hefty £1,999 price tag attached.The Moneyfacts finance expert Rachel Springall says borrowers who locked into a cheap fix back in 2020 and are hoping to refinance will find “mortgage fees have been on the rise. Outside headline-grabbing low rates, borrowers need to check the overall cost of any mortgage, which includes any fees or cost-saving incentives.”On top of the product fee, there could also be a valuation and legal costs to consider, especially if you are buying a home rather than remortgaging.With nearly 7,000 residential mortgages on the market there are lots of products to choose from but “many have higher product fees”, says Chris Sykes, the technical director at the mortgage broker Private Finance.“What lenders tend to do is offer a few tiers of product – perhaps there is a 4.25% with a £1,495 product fee, then a 4.5% with a £999 product fee, and a 4.75% with no product fee,” he says.View image in fullscreenOn top of the product fee, there could also be legal costs to consider when buying a house.Photograph: BrianAJackson/Getty Images/iStockphoto“Whether it is worth paying this product fee or not is just down to the maths of it, what the loan amount is and how the interest saving would offset that product fee. Product fees can often be added to the loan amount but then the interest payable on those added fees needs to be considered, too.”To illustrate the point, Sykes costed one lender’s range based on a £450,000 loan over 25 years, with a 75% loan-to-value. The two-year fix range is 4.33% (£1,495 fee), 4.38% (£995 fee) and 4.54% (no fee). For five years it is 4.24% (£1,495 fee), 4.29% (£995 fee) and 4.46% (no fee).The two-year deal at 4.33% has monthly repayments of £2,459 and total payments of £60,488. At 4.38%, monthly payments rise to £2,471 but the total repaid comes down slightly to £60,292. At 4.54%, the monthly repayments rise again to £2,512 but the overall paid falls to £60,275.“Some people could be attracted to the lower rates but then actually it would be better for them to pay slightly more monthly and save themselves the fee,” he says.On the same loan over five years, monthly and overall it works out cheaper to pay a big fee. At 4.24%, you pay £2,436 a month and £147,614 in total. At 4.29%, it moves up to £2,448 a month and £147,870 overall. For the 4.46% no-fee deal, it is £2,491 a month but the total repaid is much higher overall at £149,463.In a market where the average UK home costs about £270,000 – and nearly £530,000 in London – the best deal ultimately will depend on your individual circumstances.“There is often a trade-off between rate and fee,” says Mark Harris, the chief executive of the mortgage broker SPF Private Clients. He gives the example of two Nationwide five-year deals available to borrowers with a 60% loan-to-value: 4.02% with a £1,499 fee and a no-fee deal at 4.20%. “Essentially, if you borrow more than £250,000, you are financially better off taking the lower rate/higher fee combination,” he says. “For a smaller loan, the higher rate with a lower fee is a better deal.”View image in fullscreenOften building societies and other lenders offer two rates, one with a fee, one without. Often the higher rate offers have lower fees or no fee at all.Photograph: PhotoEdit/AlamyIt is estimated that, on average, 800,000 homeowners with a fixed-rate deal with a rate of 3% or below will see their deals end this year. This means many homeowners have not yet been exposed to higher borrowing costs. At the time of writing, the average two-year fix is at 5.33%, while a five-year deal is 5.18%, according to Moneyfacts. The average two-year tracker rate is 5.20%.Sykes gives the example of a client who bought their first home nearly five years ago with a £480,000 loan on a 25-year term. Their five-year deal at 1.39% meant monthly payments of £1,895.“We are assessing options for them to remortgage on to now, they have a current balance of about £397,000 and a remaining term of 20 years,” he says. “But with rates now we are looking more like 4.2% on a new five-year product and payments up to about £2,449, so an increase of £554 per month.”“Fortunately for these clients the property has increased in value over this time, and they’ve both had promotions at work, so can cover this substantial increase, but things will definitely be tighter for them,” he says. “They considered extending the mortgage term to help lower payments but decided against this.”David Hollingworth, an associate director at the broker L&CMortgages, suggests that lenders have introduced higher fee products to “try to squeeze the rate down a little further”.He says: “Bigger fee deals are really a result of a very competitive market and lenders looking to do something different. A big fee could work for those with a bigger mortgage, where a lower rate will outweigh the fee. But many will be better to focus on keeping fees down, even if that means taking a slightly higher rate.”Explore more on these topicsMortgagesMortgage ratesPropertyBanks and building societiesHousing marketFinancial sectorReal estatenewsShareReuse this content"

Musk is a “special government employee”, a designation that technically carries a 130-day term that, depending on how the administration chooses to log those days, could run out at the end of May. Vance made sure to say that Musk would remain a close “friend and adviser” to the administration even after leaving, further muddying the waters on how to mark Musk’s potential departure.The question of exactly when Musk may leave the White House, however, is less consequential than the circumstances of his exit. Rather than an explosive split that many commentators predicted, Trump hasrepeatedlydefendedMusk, and there has been little public indication from either man of anything acrimonious. Politico reported that Trump has been pleased with Musk’s performance even as the president forecasts the billionaire leaving. Musk instead appears set to keep his close ties with the president and retain the wealth, influence and intent to shape the country’s politics.Trump’s support for Musk has persisted even as his popularity has declined and Republicans have – often quietly and anonymously –expressed concerns to mediathat Musk is becoming a political liability. Apoll released this monthshowed that the majority of Americans hold an unfavorable view of Musk, and Democrats have been increasingly making him the face of the administration to capitalize on that. Musk’spublic and costly failureto secure a conservative victory inTuesday’s Wisconsin supreme court election, after he had funneled millions into the race and headlined a political rally in the state, showcased how divisive he can be with voters. Democrats focused their criticism on Musk and made the election a referendum on his politics. Trump, however, has continued to laud his efforts.“Elon is fantastic,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Thursday, saying that he wished Musk could stay as long as possible but would at some point return to focus on his companies.Musk’s time in government has oscillated between triumphant glee afterdecimating agencies such as USAID, the world’s largest single provider of humanitarian aid, toattacking judgeswho have ruled Doge violated laws and expressing outrage at the public backlash against him. But despite its erratic nature, his time in the White House has also frequently been mutually beneficial for Musk and Trump, whose relationship is now hard to disentangle.Since announcing his support for Trump last July, Musk has rapidly become a key pillar of Trump’s second term and the broader rightwing ecosystem. Creating a Super Pac and spending nearly $300m on the election made him a top megadonor, as well as set him up as a power broker for future Republican campaigns. Musk’s formation of Doge and rapid gutting of government agencies not only sent thousands of federal employees packing, but crucially now has alliesoccupying key positionsat federal agencies. His businesses, such as SpaceX and Starlink, already intertwined with government services like satellite communications, haveentrenched themselves furtherwhile laying the groundwork forlucrative contracts.Trump, meanwhile, gained his wealthiest supporter and at different times a public cheerleader, political enforcer and a human shield that would absorb the brunt of criticism for the administration’s mass layoffs. Musk has also turned X, the social media platform he owns, into a space for far-right politicians and pro-Trump influencers, thanks in large part to his own posting to his 200 million-plus followers. Trump has returned the adulation, praising Musk as a “patriot’ and using the White House lawn as a stage from which to sell Teslas.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He may no longer be a constant physical presence in government offices and at cabinet meetings, where Trump has defended himduring fights with other top officials, but it’s unclear what other power and privileges Musk is willing to give up now that he has attained them. Although Musk has often given off the energy of a guest that doesn’t know when to leave, Republicans may come to find it’s hard to kick out the person paying for the party.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsElon MuskDonald TrumpanalysisShareReuse this content"

As the Jamaica finalist for the My Caribbean essay competition, I joined more than 20 children from the region to form the youth delegation of the 24th Caribbean Tourism Conference in Bridgetown, Barbados.I spent days with peers from islands that, until then, I did not know existed, such as the small but brilliant Sint Eustatius and Saba in the Leeward Islands. What I remember most are the simple greetings and phrases the other children and I taught one another in our different Creoles. Every child had an official language they wrote in to win their national competition – English, French, Dutch etc – but as soon as we were comfortable enough, we ditched those and shared as much as we could in our everyday tongues.It was during the futuristic fervour of the new millennium, so the My Caribbean competition tasked us with writing about three things we would preserve from our country in a time capsule to the year 3000. In my memory box was the work ofLouise “Miss Lou” Bennett-Coverley, a poet, performer and advocate of Jamaican language. Like most other children in Jamaica, I first learned to recite poetry by Ms Lou in school. Her work developed in the vein of writers such asClaude McKay, who defied linguistic standards of the early 20th century and wrote for the Jamaican dialect.Miss Lou’s use of Jamaican Creole, called Patois (Patwa), brought new appreciation to the language from the 1940s onwards. Until then, English had been the language of education and art – Patwa was shunned in official settings. The independence era of the 1950s and early 60s coincided with the rise of Patwa in literature and music, and by the 1970s it was firmly embedded in reggae, writing and performance. Miss Lou went on to produce and host a Jamaican children’s TV show calledRing Ding,which broadcast from 1970-82.Despite this, there has been little national desire or governmental effort to recognise a formalised Jamaican Creole, and English remains the only official language of the island. Though Patwa is the first language of many Jamaicans,there is still a stigma associated with its use. This is unsurprising for a language formedas a medium for enslaved peoplefrom different parts of Africa and the Americas to communicate with one another and their enslavers on Caribbean sugar plantations.But Patwa is not “broken English”. While English was the lexifier (base language), Patwa finds much of its structure and vocabulary in the west and central African languages of the people who formed the majority Black population of the island. Whether or not the government recognises it, Jamaican Creole has consistent grammatical rules as well as generations of native speakers that qualify it as a language.View image in fullscreenMiss Lou’s use of Jamaican Patwa encouraged new appreciation of the language.Illustration: Alexis Chivir-ter Tsegba/The GuardianGullah Creoleis similar to Jamaican Patwa.The Gullah peopleare African Americans from the south-eastern coastal plain and Sea Islands of the US – through North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida. Also referred to as Geechee for their connection to the Ogeechee River,Gullah Geecheepeople retained many of the Africanisms adopted from enslaved people trafficked into the area. Gullah Geechee speakers report being asked if they are from Jamaica when others hear them talk, while Caribbean people might be shocked to hear African Americans use structures of grammar or patterns of intonation that they can understand. The link is not unfounded.Gullah people speak the only African-influenced English Creole in the US. It is connected to the English-speaking Caribbean through words that the Jamaican-born linguistFrederic Cassidy referred to as “virtually pan-African”;namin Gullah means “to eat”, just asnyamdoes in Patwa,nyanfor Suriname Creole speakers andnyamito Fula speakers of the Senegambian region. Additionally, anglophone Caribbean and Gullah Creoles use variations of the wordoono/unu/ona(“you lot” in British vernacular), a retention carried over by enslaved Africans from the Igbo language region.Like Jamaicans, Gullah speakers make plural nouns by adding “dem” to highlight more than one – so, youryeye demrefers to your eyes and thechair dempoints to multiple chairs. Gullah also uses reduplication for emphasis: a Gullah speaker might refer to a delicious meal asswit swit,while a Jamaican will similarly saysweet sweetornice nice. Both languages also follow the common conjugation style of English-based Creoles, where verbs remain in the infinitive and are modified by words such asah/dah/deh,did,fi/fuh,andbinto mark tense. For instance,him dah goandhim ah gowould be understood by Gullah Creole and Patwa speakers as “he is going”.There is merit in preserving Gullah culture by studying its Creole alongside the native tongues of the Caribbean. The US Sea Islands and the English-speaking Caribbean have vastly different political and social geographies, however a shared language and colonial history join the cultures in distinct ways.At the turn of the new millennium, Nickelodeon stopped airing a favourite TV show of mine: Ron and Natalie Daise’s children’s programmeGullah Gullah Island. Something I did not realise until sitting to write this article is that the name of the human-sized yellow frog on Gullah Gullah Island,Binyah Binyah, is how Gullah people say we’ve been here –we binyah, binyah. Jamaicans might say the same thing:wi bin yah,wi deh yah,wi bin deh yah!There’s an irony in this show ending just as I was becoming exposed to the variance and multiplicity of Caribbean language.But as we expand the body of knowledge on Creolisation in theAmericas, and the sociolinguistic impact of colonisation, we are likely to encounter new and surprising connections between our cultures – through these ties, and familiarity, we can hope to keep our languages alive."

They come from every walk of life: teachers, police officers, doctors, TV presenters. And the numbers are rising every year. How did this happen?Harriet GrantSat 5 Apr 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 5 Apr 2025 08.24 EDTShareAndy was enjoying a weekend away with his wife when it happened. “My neighbour phoned me and said, ‘The police are in your house. They’re looking for you.’” He didn’t need to wonder why. “You know. You know the reason. I was petrified when I got that call. It wasn’t just the thought of other people knowing what I had done; I also had to face myself, and that is a sick feeling – it is guilt, shame.”Andy had been watching and sharing images of children being sexually abused for several months before the police appeared at his door. He tried at first to keep it from his wife: “I was afraid she would ask me to leave. I wouldn’t have blamed her if she had.”When they got home, he told her his story: that a spiralling porn addiction had led him to ever darker places, chatrooms where people talked about sex and porn, and shared images and videos. “That was where someone sent me a picture of a child, in exchange for some porn I sent them.”I knew I had looked at lots of porn but I genuinely did not think there was anybody underage in thereUnlike Andy, Mark didn’t immediately realise why the police had come for him. “My then wife came in looking worried and said, ‘There are police at the door.’ We were living in a wealthy area, so I thought they were there about some recent burglaries. But then they told me they needed to speak to me alone. They said I was being arrested for having indecent images of children.”Mark claims he was shellshocked. “I knew I had looked at lots of porn but I genuinely did not think there was anybody underage in there. They said they had found 200 illegal images.” From the outside, Mark was a successful businessman, travelling regularly for work. His arrest was a public humiliation. “There were four of them, with body cameras on, in two cars. They told my boys, ‘Don’t worry, Daddy is just helping us out’ and put me in the back of one of the cars. In the picture the police took that day, I look suicidal.”In England and Wales,850 men a monthare arrested for online child abuse offences. They come from every walk of life: teachers, police officers, bus drivers, doctors. Those on the frontline are warning of another alarming trend: a significant shift towards younger offenders among those picked up for watching illegal material.The arrests are just one metric pointing towards a spiralling global crisis. Last year was the worst on record for instances of online child sexual abuse imagery, with the UK’sInternet Watch Foundationacting to remove content from 300,000 web pages,each containing at least one, if not hundreds or thousands, of illegal images and videos.Now, police, charities, lawyers and child protection experts are asking what is driving this tidal wave of offending, and finding one common thread: the explosion over the past 10 to 20 years of free-to-view and easily accessible online pornography. Material so violent it would have been considered highly extreme a generation ago is now readily available on iPads, desktops and the phones in teenagers’ pockets. A growing body of research is beginning to warn of how problematic porn habits can be a pathway into viewing images of children being abused.I have been writing about the online child abuse crisis for five years. Time and again I have heard warnings from those on the frontline that there is an unambiguous link between the two. Do the sites that profit from porn have questions to answer about this link? Can the connection be broken? And the big question: is the explosion of child abuse imagery online feeding a demand for this material, or creating one?The scale of the problem faced by the police was made clear to the public last year, when former BBC presenterHuw Edwards was given a suspended sentence, avoiding jail time, after being found guilty of accessing indecent photographs of children as young as seven. This highlighted the fact that most people –around eight out of 10– caught with images of children being sexually abused are not jailed. The National Crime Agency has called for more prison sentences, warning thatup to 830,000 adults in the UK, 1.6% of the population, pose a threat to children.View image in fullscreenFormer BBC news anchor Huw Edwards photographed after a hearing at Westminster magistrates court in London last year.Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty ImagesAndy was sent to prison for six months for watching and sharing images of child abuse. I spoke to him through theLeeds-based national agency Safer Lives, which works with men at every stage, from arrest to post-conviction counselling, to help them change their behaviour. Like many of the men they encounter, Andy argues that he has no intrinsic interest in children, but was led through a porn addiction to seek out ever more extreme images. “I am fully accountable,” Andy tells me on the phone. “None of this is an excuse. I look back at what I did with huge regret and shame. But I didn’t start out wanting to see kids. I was addicted to porn and I went down a road of being totally desensitised as I got further and further from what was normal.“I was using porn as a coping mechanism for all sorts of things – stress, loss, general life problems. When you masturbate to porn, you get an intense dopamine hit. Then those first videos start to become boring. Your brain starts to say, that’s not good enough. Soon you are watching rape fantasies – there are loads of categories like this on mainstream sites. Then it’s teenagers. The algorithms keep showing you more extreme stuff.”He argues that the mainstream porn sites encourage an interest in young girls. “They push the boundaries as much as they can, with content around young women dressed in school uniforms, for example; incest themes; old men paired with young women.”I ask where his own moral judgment was when watching videos of teenagers. “Yes, I could have wondered if those girls were really over 18. But you think, well, I’m on a site anyone can access, it’s legal. You can watch this on the bus, right? You are in an environment that is eroding your sense of responsibility.”As many offenders do, he moved to chatrooms where men shared images and videos from porn sites they liked. It was in this space, he says, that he was first sent a picture that was clearly of a child. “You know it’s wrong, but the dopamine hit from what you are doing overrides everything else. I think the pathways in my brain had been changed by all the porn I had watched.”Afterwards, he admits, “You feel sick and horrible. For years I didn’t talk about this. But now I want to stop other men continuing down the path I went down.”Mark has a similar story. He is open in saying his interest began with legal material of teen girls but says he was taken to images of children through hours of clicking on everything offered to him. “I have gone through about 40 sessions of counselling to try to understand why I ended up in a place where someone could knock on my door to arrest me. I was horrified and disgusted with myself, and I will be until the day I die.”Porn was a coping mechanism when he was away from his family, he says, and it quickly got out of control. “I worked abroad a lot and was bored and lonely. I was bringing up porn on my phone the moment I was travelling, watching it sometimes for five hours a day.My reaction should have been to turn off the computer when I was offered images of young girls. But you are in such a bizarre place … you are out of control“The police never found a single search for images of children: it was all from clicking through links – what the algorithms were offering me. Porn sites have a button that says ‘See more like this’. I was desensitised, I had looked at so much teen porn.”Mark was convicted of possessing images in categories A, B and C. The worst of these, A, involves the penetration of children under 18. “I understand now that my reaction should have been to turn off the computer when I was being offered images of young girls. But when you have been watching porn for three or four hours, you might have clicked 200 times. You are in such a bizarre place, your hormones are all over the place. You – your brain – are out of control.”As part of his counselling, Mark has written a letter to one of the young girls he watched, “not to send, but for therapy. She could, I suppose, have been 16 or 17. It was a long letter. I explained how I got to be there, I was hugely apologetic.”The idea that there is a path that for some people leads from legal porn to videos of children being abused is controversial. Many of the men being arrested for online child abuse offences pose a serious risk to children. But there is no doubt that the profile of offenders has changed in recent years.Michael Sheathworked with child abusers for more than 30 years and now advises police forces around Europe on offender profiling. When I speak to him, he has just returned from an Interpol conference on online child abuse. “I’ve been every year for 14 years and we have seen a shift over that time, from what we would call serious criminal paedophiles, the type who are organising the abuse of kids in the Philippines, and we still see those, to a huge number of lower-level offenders. It’s a huge burden on the police.”He is in no doubt that the change is linked to increasingly easy access to violent and extreme pornography. “I see men who have gone down what I call an ‘escalating pathway’. The link is unambiguous.”Sheath speaks powerfully about what he sees as a horrific impact of porn on societal taboos that have traditionally protected children. “The threshold for abusive behaviour is through the floor. It used to be that child abuse material was hard to find and looking at it was extremely risky. The mindset of someone searching for it would be ‘I am a total sex criminal’ - they knew they were leaving the norms of society.View image in fullscreenMichael Sheath, who has worked with child abusers for more than 30 years and advises police forces around Europe on offender profiling: ‘This is an experiment we are doing as a society and I think we can agree it’s going pretty badly.’Photograph: Sam Frost/The GuardianNow it is barely taboo to watch children being abused, and that is linked to porn. Look on a mainstream porn site and you’ll immediately see titles like ‘Auntie takes the boys’ virginity’ or ‘Stepdad and stepdaughter’. When I started working 30 years ago, that was really out-there outrageous, pervy and wrong. Now it’s seen as a laugh.”The videos he is referring to are legal content acted by adults, not hidden but watched by millions in the UK. “There is a slope and it is slippery, but that doesn’t mean men shouldn’t be held to account for being complicit in the abuse of the child.”Serious research is now being done into how this slippery slope works. In a groundbreaking two-yearproject, Finnish group Protect Children posted questionnaires on the dark web to reach people viewing illegal material in several countries, including the UK. They collected data from 4,549 anonymous child sexual abuse offenders. A third of respondents admitted that sexual interest in children was a key reason why they searched for child sexual abuse material. Nearly two-thirds reported a sexual interest in under-18s – mostly teens between 15 and 17. Heavy use of pornography is described as one of the “facilitating factors” that can play an important role in lowering the barrier to offending.More than 50%of those who admitted watching online child abuse said they were not seeking these images when they were first exposed to them. This did not mean they did not go on to search for violent and harmful images of children. The prevalence of this “accidental viewing” is underlined by the huge number of respondents – over two-thirds – who said they first saw child sexual abuse material when they were under 18. Of those, 40% were under 13.Along with other countries, the UK is bringing in tighter controls on the porn industry. Porn sites will be required to haveage verification processesin place by July to stop children viewing their content, a process that will be monitored by Ofcom under the newOnline Safety Act(OSA). But the OSA does not ban or control certain common practices in porn, such as strangulation, sexual fetishisation of incest or the abuse of children acted by adults. The government argues depiction of sexual strangulation is banned but a recentin-depth review of pornby Baroness Bertin, a Conservative peer, warned it is not, in reality, covered by case law. She called for tighter regulation of “legal but harmful pornography like choking, violent and degrading acts … even content that could encourage child sexual abuse”. While headlines picked out the call to ban strangulation, Bertin also demanded clearer rules around “incest, step-incest and ‘teen’ porn”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

In 2021, research professor Dr Fiona Vera-Gray and others atDurham University found thatone in every eight titles on the front pages of the most popular porn sites showed sexual violence against women and girls. They also found that videos tagged as “teen” were more likely to be linked to violence.In January, Pornhub’s owners, private equity firm Ethical Capital Partners (ECP), arrived in London from the US and Canada to lobby against the UK’s implementation of age verification. Sarah Bain, vice-president of public engagement for ECP, and Alexzandra Kekesi of Pornhub pushed for “device-based” age blocks instead of “site-based” checks – ie the phone would block underage users, not the website.Bain and Kekesi insist that Pornhub is an industry leader in ensuring content does not “cross the line” into abusive themes. They say they carefully monitor content to ensure all performers are over 18. “We have very strict protocols for the type of content that could potentially be harmful,” Bain says. She refers to the “constantly evolving” list Pornhub says it has of 34,000 banned words. “This would prevent anyone uploading content with these words, or commenting under a video with these words. We have banned terms that are legal. We make a decision not to monetise content on those themes. This is not always popular with content creators, but we are willing to be out there, modelling to other folks in the porn industry that you can be an ethical business.” They also argued that some fantasy themes can be “empowering” for those engaged in safe and consensual BDSM.In 2021, the anti-trafficking organisationCeasepublished a reportthat listed some of Pornhub’s banned terms next to words that are still allowed, to highlight what it says is a continuing presence of highly violent content themed around the abuse of children and teenagers. The word “rape” is banned, but permitted terms include “dazed”, “broken”, “degraded”, and interactions based on power abuses are common (“stepdad and stepdaughter”, where the stepdaughter might be “scared or trapped”). The word “incest” is blocked, yet permitted terms include “daddy and daughter, grandpa and granddaughter”. Words relating to “teen” (over 18) and “smallness” are common.Pornhub’s ownguidelinesstate: “We … prohibit content, including fictional, simulated, or animated, that features or depicts ... nonconsensual sexual activity, including coerced or forced sexual acts, rape, or sexual assault.”Pornhub says there are subtleties to certain words that they address through moderation. A spokesman said: “Some of the examples you listed that are not banned require context to understand. ‘Broken’, for example, has many different uses that would be perfectly within our terms of service. That’s why it’s so important that all content uploaded also undergoes our industry-leading trust and safety process as well.Just because a video uses the word ‘father’, or ‘daddy’, or any other word like that, does not mean the person featured is a relative of their co-performer“Even terms that are not banned on our platforms may be flagged by our internal system. Words like ‘daughter’ or ‘degraded’ or ‘scared’ are all flagged specifically to moderators and given higher scrutiny for contextual assessment.Just because a video uses the word ‘father’, or ‘dad’, or ‘daddy’, or any other word like that, does not mean the person featured is a relative of their co-performer. [There] are a number of scenarios where a person may be called ‘daddy’, or another title like that, that are certainly not incestuous.“Just because a word could, in certain contexts, be used in an abusive way, that does not mean that by ‘not banning it’, we are allowing content that violates our guidelines.”The company has also partnered with the UK’s Internet Watch Foundation and anti-child abuse charityLucy Faithfull Foundationtoadd warnings that pop upwhen users appear to be searching for child abuse content.Underlying all this is the question of whether porn can be seen as addictive in the way Mark and Andy describe. Unlike other behavioural addictions, such as gambling and gaming, pornography addiction is not included in theInternational Classification of Diseases, compiled by the World Health Organization. It is instead defined as a compulsive sexual behaviour.For at least a decade, mental health experts have warned that the release of the pleasure chemical dopamine during porn viewing means itimpacts the brainin the same way as addictive substances such as drugs.In 2013, the psychiatrist Norman Doidge warned, “The brain is ‘neuroplastic’ and not only can it change, but it works by changing in response to repeated mental experiences.” He describes how dopamine is released as we accomplish goals, so we gain the thrill that encourages us to do it again. “Dopamine is secreted at moments of sexual excitement and novelty. Porn scenes, filled with novel sexual ‘partners’, fire the reward centre. The images get reinforced, altering the users’ sexual tastes.”Last month,the Lucy Faithfull Foundation found thata fifth of adults reported their pornography viewing becoming gradually more extreme. Pornhub denies this is its intention and says users may “discover” new interests on porn sites but that they are not being deliberately pushed to extreme material.A Pornhub spokesman told the Guardian: “Our understanding … is that many of the studies that suggest that porn is harmful to society are methodologically flawed and/or ideologically biased. Most research finds more neutral or ambiguous results, and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders does not recognise porn addiction as a valid diagnosis.”What is clear is that problematic use is rising – including among young people. At the Lucy Faithfull Foundation, their clients are getting younger, so much so that in 2023 they launched aspecialist service for teenagers. DCI Tony Garner leads a team of online child abuse officers in Worcester. They carry out “the knock” three or four times a week and are increasingly finding teenagers behind the door. “We are seeing people who are turning 18 and have had 10 years’ exposure to hardcore porn. My officers are finding young people watching the most abhorrent material, including child abuse.” He is clear that the police cannot deal with this on their own. “As a country, as a society, it feels completely out of control.”A lot of my clients now are parents who have called me because their child has been arrestedMarcus Johnstone of PCD solicitors specialises in defending sex offenders. He says he represents “people of every age, from every background. Most of them have children, many are very intelligent. They are looking at or requesting and selling images and videos. Or they are chatting to children on gaming sites and apps. I often wonder if parents know how many of the people their kids are gaming with online are people like my clients.”But, like Garner, he is seeing an increasing trend towards younger offenders – often in their mid- or even early teens. “A lot of my clients now are parents who have called me because their child has been arrested. This is generation porn. They may have been looking for videos of teens their own age. Or they may have been talking to predatory adults online who shared material with them.”Johnstone mentions the case of a young teen who wanted to see videos of teens his own age, “but these are category A images, which is a serious crime with a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. The law is turning these young people into criminals at an alarming rate. I have seen young people banned from being in the same house as their younger siblings.”Sheath says his decades working with offenders has made him incredibly concerned about the way children are growing up with access to porn. “This is an experiment we are doing as a society and I think we can agree it’s going pretty badly. Before the smartphone, most people’s first experience of sex was with a living person and that included resistance, pushback, romance. Now young people are growing up with unfettered access to porn, and porn norms are not about consent. They are about ‘strangle the bitch’, ‘have sex with your stepmum’. It’s shaping their erotic templates.”Pornhub and ECP argue forcefully that they do not want children on their sites. “It’s shocking that we have to say this,” Bain says. “We want age verification. But the way we are seeing it approached – it’s not effective. They are targeting individual platforms. Louisiana, the first US state to implement this form of age verification, lost 80% of visitors to the site when they met the age check. Now, these people are not giving up on porn. They will go to other sites with no barrier.”In most US states, Pornhub has opted to shut down its site rather than comply with age checks. It won’t be drawn on whether it will do the same in the UK – its fifth largest global market – if asked to age-block its sites from July. Kekesi says only, “We will obey the law.”In the coming weeks, yet more men will wake up to a knock on the door and find the police outside. More images of children being abused will be taken and sent spiralling around the internet. Mark hopes some men might take a step back before it happens to them. At one point, he was prevented from being alone with his children but now he has unsupervised access again. His marriage ended and he began dating. He faced the difficult decision of how to tell his new girlfriend about his offences. “She was very kind, she let me talk. The natural reaction would be: urgh, you’re a paedophile. It’s worse than murdering someone. But I’m not a paedophile, I was just an idiot.”He believes men have an urgent role to play in supporting the men around them. “There are pressures on men in modern life, and porn is one of the outlets people seek. But it can lead you down a dark path. I’m more observant now of other men’s mental health. I work in a tough industry but I ask men I know, ‘Are you OK?’”Andy says he has learned he has an addictive personality. “You own your actions as an offender. You have to. But porn was what I went to when I had broken relationships, stress at work; porn made me feel better. And the hit is stronger if you know what you are doing is not legal or not right.”The knock that tears families apart: ‘They were at the door, telling me he had accessed indecent images of children’Read moreLike many offenders, he says he is glad he was caught. “Without the arrest, I don’t think I could have just stopped. Think about alcohol, gambling – you don’t just suddenly stop. You have to go to AA, you have to do the work. I’ve had help now and I realise how awful it is. These are real children.” He adds, “I’ve done courses with Safer Lives, with the Lucy Faithfull Foundation. I’ve got apps on my phone including one that links everything I do online to my wife as my accountability partner. I see a therapist once a month.”Jenny Greensmithis one of the lead practioners at Safer Lives working with men like Andy and Mark. She has a background as a probation officer specialising in sexual offending and has sat through countless hours of conversations with offenders. “What I’m concerned about is oversimplifying this problem,” she says. “We don’t want to remove personal responsibility or suggest porn is always a gateway to harmful behaviour. But we want men to seek help; it won’t help if we regard them as perverts. I meet a lot of men who are not able to recognise their feelings, let alone manage them. The internet is an easy way to switch off from emotions.”She is acutely aware of the real children hidden behind the words “category A, B and C”, particularly the teens whose videos the men say are easily confused with legal porn. “The CPS will often mention if pre-teen or young children are in the category A images because it’s an aggravating factor for sentencing. But it sometimes feels like an arbitrary line that diminishes the harm caused to people over 13 of having their most vulnerable experiences shared to millions online.”Whatever offences the men have carried out, she stresses that dismissing them as beyond help can have serious consequences. “I understand some people will feel that is all they deserve, but I disagree. I am also acutely aware they often have children and families who will be destroyed by this.”She would really like to reach people before they hear the knock at the door. “Men often tell us, ‘I wish I had known you were here earlier, I wanted to stop.’”If you or someone you know is worried about child sexual abuse, the confidential and anonymous Stop It Now helpline is available at 0808 1000 900, or you can use their live chat or secure email;stopitnow.org.uk.

And Barack Obama came to meet us,” Amadou told AFP in a 2024 interview.“We talked a bit. Barack Obama told us that he liked our music. Malian music, too. We were very, very happy,” Mariam added.Besides a Grammy nomination in 2010, Amadou & Mariam won prizes at the BBC radio awards and France’s Victoires de la Musique.Amadou Bagayoko is survived by three children.Explore more on these topicsAmadou and MariamMaliAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The fish can weigh 100kg and stretch the length of a dinner table.The first thing anglers will reach for when they land one is their camera or mobile phone, to capture the unique pattern of white spots ranged across each skate’s mottled brown back.These critically endangered members of the shark family are now the focus of one of the largest citizen-science projects in British waters, relying on hundreds of sea anglers who campaigned for a legally mandated marine protected area (MPA) off Oban and Mull specifically to protect the flapper skate, also known as the common skate.Once the skate is released alive into the seas off westernScotland, anglers upload photos to a conservation database that is powered by artificial intelligence and a new mobile phone app.Map showing location of Loch Sunart to the Sound of Jura marine protected area off the west coast of ScotlandMarine conservationists and anglers believe that as a direct result of the protection offered by the Loch Sunart and Sound of Jura MPA, the species is recovering, nearly 20 years after it was put on the International Union forConservationof Nature red list because of decades of overfishing.That, say its supporters, proves the value of marine protection zones. “The MPA and the conservation has definitely increased their numbers,” said Ronnie Campbell, a pioneering charter-boat skipper who introduced his own voluntary no-kill policy for skate landed on his boats in the early 1990s – 17 years before the EU banned the landing of skate in 2009.“They’re showing up all over, mostly in Scotland, but I think they’re also starting to move down south,” he said. “You can’t be wrong returning fish alive; that can never be wrong.”Up to 300 anglers are submitting data, converting their trophy photographs into scientific evidence; some have been trained to scan the identification tags implanted on many skate.That catch data, including the grid coordinates, is uploaded into a specially designed online database,known as Skatespotter, run by the Scottish Association for Marine Science (Sams) near Oban and the conservation agency NatureScot.Sams and NatureScot turned to AI technology in part because Skatespotter was a victim of its own success.The database now holds records of almost 2,500 individual flapper skate, with 5,000 images. Until the AI scanning became available, every photograph was personally scanned and matched by the researchers. Attempts to draft in volunteers to help foundered because, the volunteers admitted, the work was “really boring”.View image in fullscreenA flapper skate in Loch Carron, farther north along the Scottish coast.Photograph: Mike Clark/AlamyThe database also takes in skate identification data from as far north as Orkney and from a project in Northern Ireland. And this new AI technique could be applied to other fish conservation projects, greatly increasing their efficiency and speed.Dr Jane Dodd, a NatureScot operations officer involved in the project, said: “We had a backlog of about 250 photographs in Skatespotter that we hadn’t matched, and once we got the AI working, we managed to clear that in two weeks. That had been sitting there for probably six months or a year.”A recent scientific paper by Dodd, her project partner Dr Steven Benjamins from Sams, and two colleagues in the Scottish government’s marine directorate found that the MPA had helped the species to rebound rapidly. Catches increased by between 54% and 92% in different parts of the protected area.“Survival rates improved greatly,” it found, and suggested more MPAs might be needed to protect skate along other parts of the coastline.Benjamins said: “Flapper skate are large, long-lived top predators, part of this marine ecosystem. They are of a similar trophic level as large terrestrial carnivores. If these were lynx or wolves that we had had for centuries, and then suddenly they disappeared, there would be this massive outcry.‘We are resting on our laurels’: Scotland faces significant challenge to protect its environmentRead more“Instead, we have this enormous animal and very few people know anything about them, which is just extraordinary.”A group of conservation charities comprising Open Seas, the Our Seas coalition and the umbrella body Scottish Countryside Link are pressing ministers in the devolved government in Edinburgh to use evidence such as this to strengthen Scotland’s MPA network.In an open letter to Gillian Martin, Scotland’s acting net zero and environment secretary, they accuse the government of allowing the “continued degradation” of the inshore marine environment by failing to introduce promised controls on commercial fishing.The next Holyrood elections are a year away, giving little parliamentary time, but a spokesperson for Martin said those new measures were “a top priority”. “We will continue, as we have done from the very start of this process, to reach out and engage with all stakeholders to support our coastal communities working to ensure we find a balanced approach,” the spokesperson said.Explore more on these topicsFishingScotlandConservationMarine lifeWildlifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s really subhuman,” he said.Eastern DRC has long suffered from violence, and the camps in Goma, capital of North Kivu province, host people who have been displaced for years.View image in fullscreenBeatrice, whose husband and a child were killed in the war.

The Rwandan-backed group has managed toseize large parts of eastern DRC, including Goma and other key towns, since January.Egeland said the humanitarian situation had been complicated by M23 forcing displaced people to leave the camps, often giving them only 72 hours to move on. Many people had returned to their homes, where there was relative safety now that the M23 had taken control.He warned, however, that a political settlement was needed now as well as aid, especially in the form of cash, to ensure displaced people could buy food and rebuild their homes and livelihoods in placesdevastated by years of conflict.Mass burials and market looting in eastern DRC – in picturesRead moreEgeland said charities were struggling because they often had still not been paid for work done last year because of President Donald Trump’s freezing of US aid spending in January, and even projects that had been approved by Washington had not yet received money.He said that while support from Norway, which had fast-tracked pre-existing pledges, had allowed the NRC to continue working, other humanitarian organisations were struggling.“At a time of enormous needs – because of the recent increase in fighting – and of opportunity [to help] the many who can return, the money is not coming in,” he said. “It means people are not helped, they linger in camps with worsening conditions, that children cannot go to school.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentDemocratic Republic of the CongoRwandaConflict and armsAfricaHumanitarian responseAidnewsShareReuse this content"

The ensuing fallout has forced nearly8 million Venezuelansto flee their homeland, whether because of potential persecution or simply the impossibility of surviving without potable water, reliable electricity and other household basics.Although most Venezuelan immigrants and asylum seekers have settled elsewhere in Latin America, in recent years an increasing number have traveled farther north to the US. In recognition of their inability to safely return home, the federal government has allowed many of them to qualify for TPS.But after the outgoing Biden administration extended these protections for Venezuelans, the new Trump administration’s homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, quickly tried to revoke them once in office, rendering people who are legally in the country now vulnerable to deportation and, meanwhile, being unlawfully thrown into detention.A federal judge has since paused Noem’s attempt to terminate TPS for Venezuelans, providing a much-needed if temporary reprieve for350,000people who would have lost their legal status come 7 April. The judge wrote in his order that the secretary’s actions could “inflict irreparable harm on hundreds of thousands of persons whose lives, families, and livelihoods will be severely disrupted, cost the United States billions in economic activity, and injure public health and safety in communities throughout the United States”–the very opposite of the sort of warnings Donald Trump’s Make America Great Again (Maga) movement puts out.Yet even as a battle over the protections plays out in the courts, the Trump administration has been pre-emptively arresting Venezuelan TPS holders and keeping them in bleak US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) facilities. This is despite the lawsayingthat someone with TPS “shall not be detained” based on their immigration status. There are narrow exceptions, but attorneys who spoke to the Guardian say none of the myriad cases they’ve seen so far would apply.It’s unclear why immigration officers have been going after these legal immigrants, though one conjecture is that the Trump administration is preparing for mass deportations in case Venezuelans do end up eventually losing TPS.“To some extent, I think it’s hard to know whether what’s happening here is a concerted policy or instead just a lot of rogue activity,” said Ahilan T Arulanantham, co-director of the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) School of Law.“I think it’s possible that no Ice official was willing to write down that ‘we want to jail Venezuelan TPS holders in advance because we think that TPS will end soon’, because doing that would be illegal,” he continued, “but that nonetheless they were willing to sort of send the message out that this would be a useful thing to do in order to swiftly deport a lot of Venezuelan TPS holders, you know, if and when the TPS grant termination takes effect.”Venezuelans with TPS have faced immigration enforcement in Virginia, New York, Texas and New Mexico, with no changes in their cases that would explain why. In one instance, a man was complying with his supervision rules and attending an Ice check-in when he was handcuffed andheld in custodyin New Mexico for six weeks. He couldn’t work, was separated from his long-term romantic partner, and felt officials were provoking him to agree to leave the country despite his right to stay.The man has documentation proving he has no criminal record in Venezuela, and he has not committed any crimes in the US. But he has tattoos of his mother’s and daughter’s names.Tattoos seemingly put him on the US’s radaras a potential member of the transnational criminal organization, Tren de Aragua (TdA). The US government has been using the TdA label as carte blanche on multiple fronts to dragnet people accused of crimes as well as those who are not, and to often bypass due process, while employing abnormal procedures and abstruse legal arguments.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And though it isn’t working properly, he’s too afraid he’ll be detained again if he tries to go into a government-affiliated office to get it fixed.“This is mental anguish for him,” said Crystal Sandoval, director of cross-border strategies at Las Americas.Likewise, in the DC area, a couple was arrested twice – once at home, once in their car, both times in front of their children. The Trump administration accused them of crossing the border unlawfully in 2022, a criminal charge that Shebaya, of the National Immigration Project, said immigrants are suddenly being prosecuted for now, several years after they entered the country.Ice later tried to assert the couple was also connected to TdA, which was completely baseless, Shebaya said. At a hearing over their confinement, a judge ordered them released immediately, letting them freely walk out of the courtroom. “That is how little basis there was for their detention,” Shebaya said.“I think that what we’re seeing right now is just a blatant disregard for the law,” she added. “And it is going to be very much up to us as a community and the courts to really hold the administration accountable and say: ‘Even if you have an agenda that you’re trying to pursue, there are legal boundaries that cannot be crossed.’”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationLaw (US)Trump administrationVenezuelaUS domestic policyUS foreign policyUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Their hand-milled batches now ready for whisking with hot water, they will soon be rewarded for their patience.The foreign tourists attending amatcha-making experience in Uji, near Kyoto in westernJapan, are united in their love of the powdered, bitter form of green tea the Japanese have been drinking for centuries, and which is now at the centre of a global boom.Made from the leaves of theCamellia sinensisplant and originally served, in highly stylised fashion, at formal tea ceremonies by masters ofsado– the way of tea – matcha is the flavour profile of the times, the must-have ingredient in everything from lattes and chocolates toice-creamand boiled sweets.Global matcha Japan mapAfter the lean years of the Covid-19 pandemic, businesses in Uji, a town known for deep historical ties to the matcha trade, are cashing in.Buoyed up byrecord levels of tourism to Japan, restaurants take the matcha theme to its culinary extreme:gyozaandtakoyakidrizzled in matcha-infused dressing, and bowls of “stamina” ramen topped with the chlorophyll-rich green stuff. Every cafe is packed on an overcast, drizzly afternoon, as are the family-run shops doing a roaring trade in packets of locally produced tea, colourfully decorated containers and matcha-themed confectionery.AtChazuna, a park and museum devoted to the town’s tea culture, matcha workshops are fully booked for the next fortnight. Of the 60 people a day who come to make, and then drink, their own tea, about 90% are from overseas.“We opened in 2021 and for the first two years we didn’t have many visitors,” says Chazuna’s director, Naoto Sakayori. “Then everything changed in March last year and, since August, interest has rocketed. It’s all about matcha, matcha. People think that if they come to Kyoto on holiday, then they absolutely have to come here for a matcha experience. And then everyone posts their photos and videos online.”Stephen Blackburn, a tourist from New York, was among the first to ride the matcha wave. “I have more or less stopped drinking coffee and now just drink matcha,” says Blackburn, a former barista who started drinking the Japanese pick-me-up eight years ago. “I like the taste and the way it makes me feel. It’s not like coffee. It doesn’t leave me agitated … it makes me more focused.”But some visitors to Uji are still not convinced. “To be honest, we don’t really like matcha,” says Henrik Hantel, who is honeymooning in Japan with his wife, Tessa. “We tried it in Germany several times and disliked it, but we thought Japanese matcha might be different … and it’s everywhere here, so we don’t have much choice but to try it in its traditional home. We’re going to give it one more go and hope we won’t be disappointed again.”View image in fullscreenA small matcha plantation near Chazuna, a park and museum celebrating Uji’s historical links to the trade in green tea.Photograph: Justin McCurry/The ObserverHowever, the global appetite for all things matcha is a double-edged sword. Reports of a shortage emerged last autumn, prompting tea companies in Kyoto to impose unprecedented purchase limits on the powder, which has been consumed in Japan since the 12th century after it was introduced by Buddhist monks from China.Soaring demand in Europe, the US and Australia has prompted warnings of further shortages this year. While consumption of leaf green tea and matcha is declining in Japan, the rest of the world can’t get enough, with the global market in matcha alone expected tosurgefrom $2.8bn [£2.2bn] in 2023 to about $5bn by 2028.According to the agriculture ministry, Japan produced 4,176 tonnes of matcha in 2023, almost three times the quantity in 2010. Keen to exploit the growing commercial potential, Japan’s government is reportedly planning subsidies to encourage growers to move away from traditional leaf tea, orsencha, and produce moretencha– tea for grinding – the type of leaf that produces matcha.Official campaigns to spread the word about matcha have been wildly successful. The tea promotion account onInstagram, run by the Japan Food Product Overseas Promotion Centre, has almost 50,000 followers.This year’s tea harvest, which will start this month, will replenish the matcha supply, but relief will be temporary. Overseas consumption “reached a record high last year”, Fumi Ueki, chief of the Leaf Brand Group, a department of Ito En, one of Japan’s largest tea companies, told theJapan Times.Inevitably, social media has been a driver of interest.Matcha contentis hard to avoid on TikTok, with users pointing to evidence of the health benefits of regular consumption of antioxidant-rich green tea, whose caffeine levels are slightly lower than those in coffee.While he has been taken aback by the levels of interest in matcha – Chazuna will soon host large groups of British visitors – Sakayori appreciates its aesthetic, even spiritual, appeal.“It’s not like drinking coffee or English tea,” he says. “It’s about more than the taste… drinking matcha is an experience.”The march of the brilliant-green powder continues, winning unlikely converts along the way, including Henrik and Tessa Hantel. “We decided to try matcha along with a dessert and, to be honest, it was the best experience we’ve had so far,” they wrote in an email after speaking to theObserver. “I still don’t think we’ll order it back in Germany but it was a happy way to end our matcha experience in Japan.”Explore more on these topicsTeaThe ObserverAsia PacificFoodJapanSupply chain crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

But both leaders have confirmed that if this is not possible, they would forcibly acquire the port and take control from Landbridge.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterThis could be done through the federal government’s Land Acquisition Act or, if necessary, new legislation. But this would require paying Landbridge an undisclosed amount of money to compensate the loss of an asset.Albanese and Dutton have not outlined what this could cost taxpayers. The prime minister would not speculate on the cost, arguing this would undermine the federal government’s negotiating position should a buyback be required.“This is a commercial position,” Albanese said. “We want to protect taxpayers. Not to just engage in speculation.”View image in fullscreenPeter Dutton says he gave China’s ambassador Xiao Qia advanced notice of the Coalition’s decision.Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAPWhile Dutton has outlined a six-month deadline for a new commercial adviser to find a new leaseholder, Albanese has said “I’m not putting a timeframe on it”.“We are a mature government that does things in an orderly way and we’ll continue to conduct ourselves in that way,” Albanese said.On Friday, Albanese said his government had already begun searching for a private sector buyer and suggested superannuation funds may be willing to buy the lease.While campaigning on Saturday, both leaders were asked why their announcements had been made during an election campaign. They were also asked why the announcements were necessary, given a government review found there was no economic or national security threat posed by the lease.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said the nation’s strategic situation had deteriorated since that time, citing the recent circumnavigation of Australia by Chinese vessels.Dutton also said he had given China’s ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, advanced notice of the policy decision.When asked whether he had done the same, Albanese did not give a direct answer, but said Dutton had “obviously got better connections with the Chinese Ambassador”.“That’s a very strange thing for him to say,” Albanese said.Explore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025Australian politicsDarwinNorthern TerritoryChinaAnthony AlbanesePeter DuttonnewsShareReuse this content"

Protesters from Málaga on the Costa del Sol to Vigo in the Atlantic northwest chanted “end the housing racket” and “landlords are guilty, the government is responsible”.Valeria Racu, a spokesperson for the Madrid tenants’ union, called for rent strikes such as those mounted recently in some Catalan coastal towns.“This is the beginning of the end of the housing business,” Racu said. “The beginning of a better society, without landlordism and this parasitical system that devours our salaries and our resources.”The union says 1.4m Spanish households spend more than 30% of their income on housing, 200,000 families more than 10 years ago.Housing has become the number one social issue in Spain as a combination of property speculation and tourist apartments have driven the cost of rented housing beyond the reach of all but the most wealthy.Official statistics suggest there are at least 15,000 illegal tourist apartments in Madrid while in Barcelona the city council says it will not renew the existing 10,000 tourist apartment licences when they expire in 2028.What was initially a problem in areas with a high concentration of tourists, such as the Balearic and Canary Islands, as well as Barcelona, has become an issue across the country, with protests in Seville, Valencia, Santiago de Compostela, Burgos and San Sebastián, among other cities, where protesters rattled sets of keys in what has become a symbol of discontent over the lack of affordable homes.In the Balearics the average rent for a small apartment has risen by 40% in five years to about €1,400 (£1,190) a month, more than the average monthly salary of those working in the hospitality sector, the region’s main industry.The young have been hardest hit as housing costs have soared while salaries remain stagnant. A study published by the Spanish youth council showed that a lack of affordable housing meant that last year 85% of young people under 30 were still living with their parents.In Barcelona, where thousands gathered in the Plaça d’Espanya, protesters demanded a 50% reduction in rents, indefinite leases and an end to property speculation.According to the Catalan housing agency, rents in Barcelona have increased by 70% in the past 10 years. Salaries rose by 17.5% over the same period.“The housing game is rigged in favour of anyone with assets while tax incentives encourage them to acquire more and more property,” said Jaime Palomera of the BarcelonaUrban Research Instituteand the author ofEl Secuestro de la Vivienda(The Kidnapping of Housing).“The rich have got richer since the financial crash in 2008 and the Covid crisis and they have used this wealth to buy more and more property, constantly driving up prices and increasing inequality.“The fact is that property offers a better return than other investments. We have an economic model that encourages investment in assets that don’t create any value but simply use rent as a way of sucking money out of the middle classes.”The solution, Palomera says, is to tax those who own multiple properties.He cites the example of Singapore, where the state offers financial support to first-time buyers but imposes an ascending tax regime on second and subsequent homes.Explore more on these topicsSpainProtestHousingEuropeCommunitiesActivismnewsShareReuse this content"

        "Content": "10.50 EDTSummary of the day so farHere is a summary of the latest developments so far:Donald Trump on Saturday doubled down on the sweeping tariffs he unleashed on countries around the world, warning Americans of pain ahead, but promising historic investment and prosperity.“We have been the dumb and helpless ‘whipping post’, but not any longer. We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “This is an economic revolution, and we will win,” he added. “Hang tough, it won’t be easy, but the end result will be historic.”Trump’s 10% tariff on UK products came into force on Saturday, as global stock markets continued to fall in response to the imposition of import taxes.The FTSE 100 plummeted on Friday in its worst day of trading since the start of the pandemic, while markets on Wall Street also tumbled.Australia, Colombia, Argentina, Egypt and Saudi Arabia are also among the countries first hit with the 10% tariff.The initial 10% “baseline” tariff took effect at US seaports, airports and customs warehouses at 12.01am ET (0401 GMT). Many other countries will see their tariff rates increase above that next week – including the EU, which will be hit with a 20% rate. A 25% tariff imposed on all foreign cars imported into the US came into effect on Thursday.Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has confirmed it will “pause” shipments to the USin Aprilas it works to “address the new trading terms” of Donald Trump’s tariffs.The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, is expected to spend the weekend speaking to foreign leaders about the tariffs, after calls with the prime ministers of Australia and Italy on Friday in which the leaders agreed that a trade war would be “extremely damaging”.Downing Street said that Starmer had “been clear the UK’s response will be guided by the national interest”.A spokesperson said officials will “calmly continue with our preparatory work, rather than rush to retaliate”.Ralph Goodale, the high commissioner for Canada in the UK, told the BBC’s Radio 4 Today programme on Saturday that “action taken by the US government is completely illogical”.He added: “It will damage the United States itself.”TheItalian economy minister, Giancarlo Giorgetti, warned on Saturday against the imposition of retaliatory tariffs on the USin response to Trump’s announcement of sweeping tariffs on trade partners. Speaking at a business forum near Milan, Giorgetti said Italy was aiming for a “de-escalation” with the US. “We should avoid launching a policy of counter-tariffs that could be damaging for everyone and especially for us,” Giorgetti said.The stock market plunge has more to do with the emergence this year of China’s DeepSeek artificial intelligence tool than with Trump’s policies, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said in an interview released on Fridaythat signalled little concern about the ongoing nosedive. “For everyone who thinks these market declines are all based on the president’s economic policies, I can tell you that this market decline started with the Chinese AI announcement of DeepSeek,” Bessent told former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.Bangladesh’s interim leader called an emergency meeting on Saturday after textile leaders in the world’s second-largest garment manufacturing nation said US tariffs were a “massive blow” to the key industry.Trump on Wednesday slapped punishing new tariffs of 37 % on Bangladesh, increasing duties from the previous 16% on cotton and 32% on polyester products.The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is expected to visit the White House on Monday to discuss recently announced tariffs with Trump, three Israeli officials said on Saturday.As part of a sweeping new tariff policy announced by Trump, unspecified Israeli goods exports to the US face a 17% tariff.China has taken and will continue to take resolute measures to safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests, the foreign ministry said on Saturday,citing a Chinese government stance on opposing US tariffs. The US should “stop using tariffs as a weapon to suppress China’s economy and trade, and stop undermining the legitimate development rights of the Chinese people”, the ministry said.Nissan Motor is considering shifting some domestic production of US-bound vehicles to the US, the Nikkei reported on Saturday.As early as this summer, Nissan plans to reduce production at its Fukuoka factory in western Japan and shift some manufacturing of its Rogue SUV to the US to mitigate the impact of Trump’s tariffs, the business newspaper said, without citing the source of its information.The president of Taiwan,Lai Ching-te, met tech executives on Saturday to discuss how to respond to new US tariffs, promising to ensure Taiwan’s global competitiveness and safeguard its interests.Lai met the executives at his official residence to discuss the response to “the global economic and trade challenges brought about by the reciprocal tariff policy”, his spokesperson Karen Kuo said in a statement. She did not say which companies were present, only that there were several representatives from the information and communications technology, or ICT, industry.“Today, America is not only humiliating Iran, but also the world,” the Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, said on Saturday, in an apparent reference to recent policies adopted by Trump, including imposing tariffs on imported goods.Pezeshkian said his country was willing to engage in dialogue with the US as equals, without clarifying whether Tehran would participate in direct talks.China has said “the market has spoken” in rejecting Trump’s tariffs, and called on Washington for “equal-footed consultation” after global markets plunged in reaction to the trade levies that drew Chinese retaliation.Trump introduced additional 34% tariffs on Chinese goods as part of steep levies imposed on most US trade partners, bringing the total duties on China this year to 54%.Away from tariff news, left-leaning organisations in the US say that more than 500,000 people are expected to take to the streets to protest in Washington DC, Florida and elsewhere around the country on Saturday to oppose Donald Trump’s “authoritarian overreach and billionaire-backed agenda”.MoveOn, one of the organisations planning the day of protest they’re calling Hands Off along withdozensof labour, environmental and other progressive groups, said that more than 1,000 protests are planned across the US, including at state capitols.ShareUpdated at11.37 EDT"

The feat will be achieved using a special radar scanner that has been fitted to a probe, named Biomass, that will be fired into the Earth’s orbit later this month.For the next five years, the 1.25-tonne spacecraft will sweep over the tropical rainforests of Africa, Asia and South America and peer through their dense 40m-high ­canopies to study the vegetation that lies beneath. The data collected by Biomass will then be used to create unique 3D maps of forests normally hidden from human sight.Less than 2% of sunlight reaches the forest floor in these regions, yet Biomass will study them in unsurpassed detail from a height of more than 600km. More importantly, the mission will allow scientists to calculate how much carbon is stored in the forests and measure how levels are changing as humans continue tocut down trees in the tropicsand increase carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere.View image in fullscreenThe 1.25-tonne spacecraft will sweep over the tropical rainforests of Africa, Asia and South America.Photograph: GettyTim82/Getty ImagesIn addition, Biomass – which has been built by a consortium led by Airbus UK and funded by theEuropean Space Agency(Esa) – will map the sub-surface geology and topography of forest floors while it will also provide data about the rate at which biodiversity is being lost as forests are cleared for mining and agriculture.“We need to know the health of our tropical forests,” Simonetta Cheli, director of Earth Observation Programmes for Esa, told theObserverlast week: “We need to know the quality and diversity of its vegetation and the amount of carbon stored there. To get that information we are going to create 3D images of them – from the top of the forest canopy to the roots of its trees.”Tropical forests play a crucial role in protecting the planet from some of the worst effects of global warming because they absorb so much carbon dioxide from the atmosphere: estimates suggest they take up about eight billion tonnes and are often described as the Earth’s green lungs.But deforestation and environmental degradation are now reversing this effect. Carbon, once stored in vast amounts, is being put back into the atmosphere, adding to growing levels of greenhouse gases. Hotspots include northern regions of South America, sub-Saharan Africa, south-east Asia and the Pacific where increased production of beef, soya, coffee, cacao, palm oil and timber aretriggering widespread deforestation.Quantifying the problem is essential for forecasting what is going to happen to Earth’s climate in coming years, said Bjorn Rommen, mission scientist for the Biomass project: “We don’t properly understand what changes are now taking place, partly because we do not have accurate estimations of carbon levels in these forests. Biomass is going to help us to get a better grip on those numbers.”Biomass is scheduled to be launched from Esa’s spaceport near Kourou in French Guiana on 29 April on aVegaC rocketand will carry a radar known as a P-band synthetic aperture radar. Its use of long wavelength signals will allow it to peer down through canopies in order to assess how much carbon is stored on the floor and branches of the trees in the world’s tropical forests and to assess how levels are changing. This type of radar has never been flown in space before and has required Biomass to be fitted with a giant 12m antenna which will be deployed as the spacecraft begins its sweep over the Earth.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

So we are going to be able to weigh the carbon content of the world’s tropical forests from space and, crucially, work out how much these are changing over time. We will then know the balance of carbon that is flowing to and from the atmosphere. That is enormously important.”This point was backed by Cheli. “We need to be able to predict what the Earth will look like as temperatures rise. So we are going to integrate its data with AI and with other digital elements of machine learning and that will tell us what is likely to happen in future. It will tell us what we are up against.”Explore more on these topicsSpaceThe ObserverTrees and forestsBiodiversityClimate crisisEuropean Space AgencyAirbusConservationnewsShareReuse this content"

Forty remain in hospital, including two children in critical condition and 17 in a serious condition.“The missile struck an area right next to residential buildings – hitting a playground and ordinary streets,” Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram.He blamed the daily strikes on Russia’s unwillingness to end the war: “Every missile, every drone strike proves Russia wants only war,” he said, urging Ukraine’s allies to increase pressure on Moscow and bolster Ukraine’s air defences.“The United States,Europe, and the rest of the world have enough power to make Russia abandon terror and war,” he said.“There can never be forgiveness for this,” said Oleksandr Vilkul, the head of the city’s defence council. “Eternal memory to the victims.”The UK’s Europe minister, Stephen Doughty, said attacks on civilian infrastructure were “a sobering reminder that Putin continues to wage his barbaric war against Ukraine”.He added: “Our thoughts are with the families and loved ones of the victims. As the prime minister has said,Russiacould choose to accept a ceasefire but instead continues to bombard Ukraine and its population.”Local authorities said the strike damaged about 20 apartment buildings, more than 30 vehicles, an educational building and a restaurant.The Russian defence ministry claimed on Friday it had carried out a high-precision missile strike with a high explosive warhead on a restaurant where a meeting had taken place with unit commanders and western instructors.Russian military claimed the strike had killed 85 military personnel and foreign officers and destroyed 20 vehicles. The military’s claims could not be independently verified. The Ukrainian General Staff rejected the claims.A later drone strike on Kryvyi Rih killed one woman and wounded seven other people.The head of the British armed forces, Adm Sir Tony Radakin, met Zelenskyy on Friday alongside the leader of the French armed forces, Gen Thierry Burkhard.“Britain and France are coming together and Europe is stepping up in a way that is real and substantial, with 200 planners from 30 nations working to strengthen Ukraine’s long-term security,” Radakin said.The UK and France have been at the forefront of planning for a “coalition of the willing” made up of nations that could help to keep Ukraine secure in the event of a peace deal with Russia.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropeVolodymyr ZelenskyynewsShareReuse this content"

Even members of the Base mused that he was a spy andgrew wearyof the source of his cash flow.View image in fullscreenAn early photograph of Rinaldo Nazarro, dated 1994.Photograph: The Villanovan“Given Russia’s connections to the leadership of the Base, including offering sanctuary to its leader Rinaldo Nazzaro, there is a strong chance that this could very well be a Russian intelligence operation,” said Colin Clarke, a geopolitics expert anddirector of research at the Soufan Center.“Supporting and directing violent non-state actors, including racially and ethnically motivated violent extremists, is just another tool in the Kremlin’s hybrid warfare toolkit, and one which Moscow hasrepeatedly demonstratedthat it’s willing to use.”In posts on Telegram, the Base is offering cash for volunteer operatives and recruits to carry out attacks on, “electric power stations, military & police vehicles, military & police personnel, government buildings, [Ukrainian] politicians”, specifically in Kyiv and other cities inUkraine.The Base previously demonstrated it can obtain funding fromcryptocurrency vectorsand allegedly fromNazzaro’s own unknown funds.“The remnants of the Ukrainian authorities understand their weakness, we understand it too,” said the Base. “The time is now.”The plan was unveiled online last week and is in support of a wider bid to carve out a white nationalist enclave in the Zakarpattia region of Ukraine, something the Base describes as having “rugged mountainous terrain which is a force multiplier for an unconventional paramilitary force”.Uploaded alongside several of the posts were approximately 50 videos, beginning in late March, captured using an automatically generated geotagging app. They generally show assumed members capturing spray-painted symbols of Ukraine’s Base cell on various walls in urban locales, the first sets being in Kyiv and in the port city of Odessa on the Black Sea.A recent set of videos shows eight from the southern city of Mykolaiv and ten showing locations in Kharkiv, a city close to the frontlines and where Ukrainian intelligence has kept a particularly close eye on Russian saboteurs.View image in fullscreenAn elderly woman stands on a destroyed balcony after a Russian drone attack.Photograph: Global Images Ukraine/Getty Images“A financial reward for successful action is possible,” said the caption with the Kharkiv post.The latest post from the Base’s Ukraine cell is now soliciting donations to an anonymous Monero wallet.The Guardian reviewed all of the videos for their authenticity and they appeared to be recently taken in each of the cities.The Base’s Ukrainian ambitions fall in line with a major Kremlin talking point since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine: casting aspersions on the government of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, himself a Jewish man, as a sort of new Third Reich. While Russia has long sought to portray Ukraine as a bastion for the far right – even though it harbors Nazzaro, usesa neo-Nazi militia alongside its militaryandmakes allianceswith European fascists.Emails to the Russian Foreign Ministry, asking about the Base and Nazzaro’s presence inside Russia, went unanswered.How real the Base’s actual presence in Ukraine currently is, remains unclear and is unlikely to be significant. In 2019, Ukrainian security servicesdeported one of the Base’s membersfor his neo-Nazi activities and trying to enlist in their military. Thoughthey have tried and failed, it is rare for stateside far-right groups to export any real influence into Ukraine.Nazzaro has repeatedly maintained that he is not affiliated with any spy agencies, even making an uncanny appearance on Kremlin state television in 2020, telling a reporter that he “never had any contact with any Russian security services”.But, curiously, the posts calling for attacks on Ukraine first appeared on the Base’s VK account, which is hosted in Russia and run by Nazzaro. The chief recruitment email for the Base is also a Mail.ru address – the email provider of a well-knownally of Russian president, Vladimir Putin.No public charges have been laid against Nazzaro, but he was the subject of an FBI investigation and was once called a justice department “matter” by a US government official.“I think this means that Nazzaro remains under the thumb of Russian intelligence,” said Clarke, about Nazzaro’s latest ploy in Ukraine. “Russia likes to collect these kinds of ‘useful idiots’ that it can then employ to do its dirty work.”Clarke continued: “Nazzaro simply must do what Russian intelligence makes him do, as he has extremely limited options given his role as the head of a transnational neo-Nazi organization.”Reached on Telegram, Nazzaro said the Base’s Ukrainian operations are “not directed by the Russian government” nor is he.“I have never had any contact with the security services of Russia,” he added.View image in fullscreenA photo taken from the Base’s Telegram propaganda channel.Photograph: TelegramThis isn’t the first time the Base, which has made recent strides in rebuilding its American membership, started appearing in Europe. Last year, members were arrested in Belgium, the Netherlands, and in Italy where authorities cracked down on a Base cell thatit saidhad ties to a network of Russian far-right terrorists recruiting from Telegram.“While neo-Nazi accelerationists often exaggerates their reach, there is no denying the Base’s resurgence,” said Steven Rai, an analyst at theInstitute for Strategic Dialoguewho monitors global extremism for the watchdog organization who spotted the Base’s Ukraine posts online.Rai pointed out the Base is “not bluffing” and that since 2023, it has shown itself in nearly 10 countries, including in February when UK counterterrorism police arrested a 15-year-old boy for plotting attacks on synagogues.“The Base’s operations in Ukraine need to be taken seriously,” said Rai, “as they have repeatedly demonstrated an ability to attract new recruits who then proceed to plan acts of catastrophic violence”.Explore more on these topicsUS newsFar right (US)Trump administrationRussiaUkraineEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

On Friday afternoon passengers travelled along the coast, passing the seaside towns of Santa Severa and Santa Marinella before gliding through the countryside of Tuscan, where by early evening they could sip locally made Brunello wine as part of theaperitivo. As an option, they could disembark and be taken to the hilltop town of Montalcino before returning to the Dolce Vita for their evening meal and entertainment. The train, which also passes through Florence and Pisa, completes its loop back to Rome on Saturday morning.View image in fullscreenThe train comprises a bar, a lounge and a restaurant serving haute-cuisine by the Michelin-starred chef, Heinz Beck.Photograph: Patrick Locqueneux“You eat, you sleep, and you party on board,” said Paolo Barletta, who dreamed up the idea for an experience that combines slow tourism with Italy’s landscape and its diverse regional cuisine. “It’s kind of like the experience of a cruise ship, but instead of being a boat cruise it’s a rail cruise.”The first trip sold out, with 38 passengers partaking. Trips are also fully booked for the rest of April and most of May, with itineraries involving Venice, Portofino, Matera, the Unesco-listed town in Basilicata known for its ancient cave dwellings, and Sicily. On a trip scheduled in November, passengers can explore the Monferrato truffle region in Piedmont, while tasting said truffles and drinking barolo wine.The vast majority of those who have booked so far are Americans, followed by Europeans and visitors from the Middle East. Needless to say, a voyage on the Dolce Vita does not come cheap, with prices starting at €3,500 (£2,982).View image in fullscreen‘A rail cruise’: the itinerary covers 14 Italian regions, from Veneto and Liguria in the north to Basilicata and Sicily in the south. A voyage starts at €3,500 (£2,982).Photograph: Patrick LocqueneuxBy comparison, a one-way trip from Rome to Pisa, on a standard Italian fast train will cost about €45 (£38), even cheaper if you book early. For those wanting to replicate the Dolce Vita feeling, the onboard bar sells half-bottles of prosecco for €12 (£10).Barletta said the Dolce Vita experience is not just the preserve of the super-rich. “A lot of people are booking for the one-time experience,” he said. “Perhaps they are retired and want to spend some of their retirement savings doing something special, or it is an anniversary or they are celebrating a wedding. It’s not only about experiencing the train … people really want to see Italy, and in a slow, relaxed way. The Dolce Vita won’t just take them to famous places like Venice, but also areas that are less well-known, for example Abruzzo.”Explore more on these topicsItalyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It shows a red fire engine and clearly marked ambulances driving at night, using headlights and flashing emergency lights.The vehicle stops beside another that has driven off the road. Two men get out to examine the stopped vehicle, and then gunfire erupts before the screen goes black.The Israeli military has said its soldiers “did not randomly attack” any ambulances, insisting they fired on “terrorists” approaching them in “suspicious vehicles”.Lt Col Nadav Shoshani, a military spokesperson, said troops opened fire on vehicles that had no prior clearance to enter the area, and were driving with their lights off.The IDF said on Saturday that the incident was still under investigation and that “all claims, including the documentation circulated about the incident, will be thoroughly and deeply examined to understand the sequence of events and the handling of the situation”.Late on Saturday, Reuters cited an anonymous Israeli military official as telling journalists that the initial account of the vehicles not having emergency lights on was mistaken.Fifteen Palestinian paramedics and rescue workers, including at least one UN employee, were killed in the incident in Rafah on 23 March, in which the UN says Israeli forces shot the men “one by one” and then buried them in a mass grave.View image in fullscreenEmergency vehicles are seen with their lights and sirens flashing.Photograph: APAccording to the UN humanitarian affairs office (Ocha), the PRCS and civil defence workers were on a mission to rescue colleagues who had been shot at earlier in the day, when their clearly marked vehicles came under heavy Israeli fire in Rafah’s Tel al-Sultan district.

This must never happen againMalak A Tanteshin Gaza andJulian BorgerSat 5 Apr 2025 02.00 EDTShareGaza is one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a civilian now that Israeli forces have resumed their military campaign with even more ferocity, but for the first responders who rush towards the wreckage of bombed buildings, the risks are multiplied many times over.The15 paramedicsand rescue workers whose bodies were found last weekend in a bulldozed pit outside Rafah knew they were putting their lives in peril to try to save others, but they could not have been prepared for what awaited them in the early hours of 23 March.The Gaza paramedic killings: a visual timelineRead moreSaleh Moamer, a 45-year-old Red Crescent ambulance officer and paramedic, had already come close to death twice, his brother, Bilal, recalled. Earlier in the war Saleh was assigned to transport patients between hospitals when his vehicle came under Israeli army fire. The driver was killed instantly and a bullet lodged in Saleh’s chest near his heart. Administering first aid on himself he slid below his seat and steered the vehicle out of the line of fire by following directions given over the radio by his colleagues.Saleh spent three months in hospital then returned to work. Not long after, on a rescue mission near Rafah, his ambulance was shot at again and he was wounded in the right shoulder. He and Bilal talked about how he had used up all his luck and the third time would be fatal. It was half-joke, half deadly serious, and turned out to be prophetic.“He said that whatever was intended for him, would happen,” Bilal said.Before he went out on his night shift on 22 March, Saleh bought bulk quantities of household goods for his wife, their six children, and his brother’s two children who they had been looking after since their father was killed in the conflict.“He said it would benefit them in the future. It was as if he had a feeling he would not return,” Bilal said.View image in fullscreenThe eight Red Crescent ambulance crew members and paramedics killed in Hashashin.Photograph: PRCSSaleh joined the Red Crescent during the 2008-09 Israeli invasion ofGaza. He had studied business administration at Al-Azhar University, but his urge to do something immediate to help people amid the turmoil and bloodshed led him to train as a paramedic.“What kept him going, despite the dangers, was his drive to save innocent lives,” Bilal said, describing his older brother as cheerful and friendly but profoundly dedicated.“He was deeply passionate about his work and spent most of his time in the ambulance and emergency department,” he said. “When he finished his work in the ambulance, he would head to the vehicle maintenance department at the Red Crescent, fixing any electrical problems. He even formed a team to visit the homes of the injured to check on them. If he had any medicine or medical supplies, he would seek outpatients in need.”When the dispatch call came early on Sunday 23 March that people had been injured in an airstrike on the Tel al-Sultan area of Rafah, Saleh took an ambulance to the scene. Seeing the extent of the damage he called for more ambulances, collected the wounded he could find and returned to base, according to his brother.On arriving back he learned that radio contact had been lost with another ambulance also dispatched to the site. That ambulance, which was being driven by Saleh’s colleague, Mustafa Khafaja, had come under intense Israeli fire and by the time he heard they were missing at about 4.30am, Khafaja and his fellow paramedic Ezz alDin Shatt were already dead, according to the third man in the ambulance,Munther Abed, who had survived but was detained by Israeli soldiers. Abed later described them as special forces.Before dawn, Saleh drove back to the scene and could only see the empty ambulance in an area of sandy dunes in Tel al-Sultan known as Hashashin, Bilal said. He drove back to the ambulance station in al-Mawasi, a few miles up the coast, and organised a rescue convoy of Red Crescent ambulances, a bright red civil defence fire truck and a UN vehicle. In all, 13 paramedics and rescue workers drove to Hashashin to look for their missing colleagues, and that was the last time they were seen alive.Bound and made to lie on the ground, Abed, the detained paramedic from the first ambulance, saw one rescue vehicle after another ambushed by waiting Israeli forces. Later he saw a military digger excavate a pit and the vehicles being thrown in before a bulldozer covered it over.The families of the missing first responders spent a whole week in agony before receiving the call that bodies had been found. Bilal, his surviving brother and his parents rushed to the Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, hoping Saleh would not be among the remains, but that hope was quickly smashed.“When the bodies arrived, they were wrapped in white shrouds with their names written on them. I was the one who uncovered my brother’s face, and I began to wonder if it was really him,” Bilal said. The bodies had been in the ground for a week. They confirmed it was Saleh by the ring on his finger.“There were marks from restraints on Saleh’s wrists where the Israeli army had bound him. His fingers were also broken,” he said. Two other witnesses have told the Guardian that some of the victims had had their hands or feet bound.Israel’s military has said its “initial assessment” of the incident found that its troops had opened fire on several vehicles “advancing suspiciously toward IDF troops without headlights or emergency signals”, and has claimed, so far without evidence, that Hamas fighters and other militants had been using the ambulances for cover.For Bilal, the Israeli claim that the ambulances were carrying terrorists, was a further insult. “These paramedics were providing humanitarian services. They did not pose any threat or carry weapons. What was their crime for them to be killed like this?” he asked.Among the other families who dashed to the morgue at Nasser hospital was a 63-year-old father, Sobhi Bahloul, searching for his son, Mohammad, a volunteer Red Crescent paramedic.View image in fullscreenA bulldozer recovers a crushed vehicle from the pit.Photograph: PRCSFinding his body, Sobhi said he went into shock and could not cry. “Perhaps I wasn’t fully conscious of what was happening,” he said. “[The dead] were still in their uniforms, covered in blood and dirt. I was able to recognise Mohammad’s features with difficulty. I moved closer until my face was right in front of his, and only then was I certain it was him. Then we pulled his ID from his trouser pocket.”Sobhi said: “The gunshot wounds were clear–shots to the chest and his wrist. It looked like he had raised his hand to shield himself, and the bullets went through his hand into his chest and out of his back. There were more than four bullets, all in the chest and heart area. I believe he died instantly.”Like Saleh, Mohammad was passionate about his work as a paramedic. He graduated from Al-Azhar University with a degree in nursing, then took a series of intensive courses, obtained an ambulance driving licence, trained as a paramedic, and had continued studies in health administration at Al-Quds Open University. He had been volunteering since 2018 and had hoped it would become a paid job, but the absence of a salary did not dim his commitment.“We hardly saw him at home,” his father recalled. “He was constantly at the hospital, with the ambulance teams. He was courageous and proactive, never waiting for instructions –always taking the initiative.”“I raised my children to love goodness and to do good deeds,” Sobhi said. “We had a principle in our home: do good without expecting thanks or praise. Mohammad lived by this principle.“We never expected this to happen–not even in our worst nightmares,” Sobhi added. “They went to save lives, only to become victims themselves.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaAidIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

One appliance from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) is at the scene.Another wildfire had been reported in around the same area on Thursday and covered about 1.5 miles (2.4km).On Wednesday, crews in Scotland tackled a large grass fire at Gartur Moss in Port of Menteith, Stirling.The National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC) has warned it needs “long-term and sustained investment” to cope with the climate crisis and “increased demand” on its services, after firefighters battled wildfires across the UK this week.This year has seen 286 wildfires hit the UK, according to the NFCC, more than 100 above the number recorded in the same period in 2022, a year that had record-breaking temperatures and unprecedented wildfire activity.The NFCC warned the government that it could not continue to cope with “significant increases in wildfires” with current budgets “already under strain”.Phil Garrigan, chairman of the NFCC, said: “There is no getting away from the fact that climate change is driving increases in extreme weather events, such as wildfires.“Responding to wildfires requires a lot of resource, and often over long periods of time, which puts pressure on other fire and rescue service activities.“Rising resilience threats mean there is an increased demand on fire and rescue services and that has to be met with long-term and sustained investment. This is really crucial to ensuring we can continue to keep our communities safe.”Fire services in Scotland, Wales and England have all warned against barbecues and campfires in open spaces this weekend, as well as urging people to dispose of cigarettes properly.Explore more on these topicsScotlandFirefightersnewsShareReuse this content"

He became mayor of the west of England in 2021.His constituency website said he trained with the NSPCC and worked as a teacher and child protection officer.Avon and Somerset Police said: “A man aged in his sixties was arrested on Friday on suspicion of sexual offences against a girl (under the Sexual Offences Act 1956), rape (under the Sexual Offences Act 2003), child abduction and misconduct in a public office.“He’s been released on conditional bail for enquiries to continue. This is an active and sensitive investigation, so we’d respectfully ask people not to speculate on the circumstances so our enquiries can continue unhindered.“In December 2024, we received a referral from another police force relating to alleged non-recent child sex offences having been committed against a girl.“Most of the offences are alleged to have occurred in the 2000s, but we’re also investigating an alleged offence of rape from the 2020s.“An investigation, led by officers within Operation Bluestone, our dedicated rape and serious sexual assault investigation team, remains ongoing and at an early stage.“The victim is being supported and given access to any specialist help or support she needs.”A Labour party spokesperson last night said: “Dan Norris MP was immediately suspended by the Labour party upon being informed of his arrest.“We cannot comment further while the police investigation is ongoing.”He has also had the Labour party whip in the House of Commons removed.Norris, 65, is also embroiled in controversy over his role as chair of the anti-hunting charity the League against Cruel Sports after being accused of victimisation of a former employee.He stepped down from his role at the charity in May last year.Explore more on these topicsLabourRape and sexual assaultCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

A spokesperson for YWAM said the organisation was “heartbroken” by the claims and was “deeply committed to the safety and wellbeing” of everyone in its care.The allegations span two decades and include claims that young missionaries were publicly shamed, subjected to rituals to “cure” their homosexuality, and told that leaving was against God’s will.Young British adults who signed up for training schools and overseas mission trips – many during their gap years – described regular confession sessions where they were pressured to admit their “sins” in a group.These included perceived moral transgressions such as homosexual thoughts, sexual activity, abortions and watching pornography, as well as other “sins” such as disobeying a leader or having “rebellious thoughts”. Those who confessed could be questioned and made to give public apologies, according to former missionaries. They could be prayed for or could face punishment, including being removed from volunteer roles. In some cases, interventions were more extreme. Former YWAM volunteers described the use of rituals similar to exorcisms to banish demons from people who acknowledged having sex outside marriage.Another former British YWAM worship leader described a “casting out” at a base in Australia, arranged after a man revealed that he had sexual relations with other men. Leaders placed their hands on him before chanting prayers to “banish the spirit of homosexuality”, and he reportedly convulsed. The British man was himself struggling with his sexuality and said he was left feeling as though a “demon” was living inside him.Others described how people disclosed being victims of assault or sexual abuse, as well as transgressions such as speeding fines.The “repentance and forgiveness” rituals are alleged to be part of a wider picture of control at some bases, which also included restrictions on romantic relationships, clothing and when missionaries could visit family.Commands were often communicated by leaders as though they were instructions from God. “They were always changing what other people wanted to do by saying: ‘I reckon, God is saying this.’ It was used to manipulate,” one former missionary said.YWAM operates in about 180 countries and sends about 25,000 people on short-term missions each year. It was founded in 1960 by the American missionary Loren Cunningham and has key bases in the US, Australia, Switzerland and the UK, where it is a registered charity.A spokesperson for YWAM England said it was committed to “continuous improvement in safeguarding practices” and that each location was responsible for upholding standards. It said it was “strongly opposed” to forced confessions. “While confession of sin may occur, the person should never be publicly shamed or pressured to apologise.”Last year, YWAM’s base in Perth, Australia – one of the biggest in the world – faced scrutiny over its handling of alleged historic sexual misconduct, including claims that its leaders told alleged victims to apologise to their alleged attackers for “leading them on”. A YWAM base in the UK was recently closed amid claims of spiritual abuse.The allegations come as a prayer movement linked to YWAM – which aims to recruit the next generation of Christian missionaries – sweeps through Britain.The Send UK & Ireland, an initiative by a coalition of Christian groups, which is legally controlled by the YWAM branch in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, launched with a show last July at Ovo Arena Wembley. It has since held pop-ups at churches and concert halls across the UK.Its aim is to recruit 100,000 young British adults to do missionary work in the UK and abroad and reverse the trend of decline among western missions.After the Wembley event, hundreds of people signed up via QR code to serve as missionaries through YWAM and the Send’s other partner organisations.The allegations, made by former missionaries whose experiences span two decades and 18 countries, raise questions about culture and safeguarding within YWAM, which has a decentralised structure that critics say leads to insufficient oversight. The organisation defers power to leaders on bases around the world, who say they take safeguarding seriously.YWAM has underlying statements of principles and runs discipleship training schools which have a similar structure across all bases, with lectures on topics such as “sin, repentance and restitution”, “spiritual warfare” and “discipling nations”.The code of conduct for the University of the Nations, YWAM’s unaccredited Christian university, which oversees YWAM training schools, says “any moral violation”, including “sexual immorality”, is grounds for disciplinary action. Other bases list fornication and homosexuality as immoral behaviours alongside incest and bestiality.In 2020, Lynn Green, one of YWAM’s most senior leaders and the founder of YWAM England, published a blog post urging the human race to “repent for ignoring the laws of God”, blaming abortion and “the homosexual agenda” for “bringing destruction”.Felicity Davies, 34, a designer from Yorkshire who spent six years in YWAM after joining at the age of 18, said the “purity culture” and alleged controlling behaviour at a base in South Africa left her feeling “suffocated” and “not good enough”.“I constantly had to do certain things in order for God to love me or to be accepted,” she said. “People should be aware that this isn’t all happy-clappy. A lot of people get traumatised.”Lena Stary, 26, from Bristol, who joined YWAM aged 18, said her experience in Switzerland left her suffering panic attacks and had taken years to untangle. It had made it “very difficult to trust other people”. She is no longer religious. “I just found it so difficult to believe that God is a loving being if all of what I was being told was true,” she said.A YWAM spokesperson said: “Although a high number of individuals have had a positive experience in YWAM, we are aware and deeply regret that some have had harmful experiences of spiritual abuse and manipulation.” They said each base was responsible for safeguarding and was held to account by leadership teams overseeing specific regions.In England, a YWAM spokesperson said leaders had “implemented stricter oversight mechanisms” after claims of spiritual abuse at a base which has since closed. They said YWAM held “traditional Christian views on sexuality and marriage” but was reviewing how it communicated those beliefs to prevent “shame or rejection”, and that it condemned any practice that traumatised people or associated their identity with demonic influence.“We are deeply grieved to hear reports that spiritual practices intended for healing were instead used in coercive or shaming ways,” they said.Green stood by his comments on abortion and homosexuality and said he sought to approach the matters “with both grace and faithfulness”, adding that he, “like others in YWAM”, condemned any form of spiritual abuse.A YWAM Perth spokesperson said any comment that an alleged victim had “led on” their alleged attacker or must apologise to them did not reflect the views of leadership.Explore more on these topicsChristianityThe ObserverYoung peopleReligionMental healthnewsShareReuse this content"

Today, numerous falls and clashes have resulted in two lives hanging in the balance. These horses deserve better.“ITV’s cowardly refusal to replay the 25th fence where Broadway Boy fell, while commentators gushed over racing’s welfare standards, shows the depths to which the industry will sink to save itself. When the public sees the grim reality and suffering within horse racing, they rightfully recoil.”The organisation Animal Aid said it was “disgusted and appalled that Broadway Boy suffered a horrific fall in the Grand National race, and that the racing industry – rather than give the public an update on his wellbeing – had the gall to spout empty rhetoric about the ‘welfare’ of race horses.”The statement added: “The lack of information provided about the welfare of these horses is despicable and demonstrates the sheer lack of care the industry has towards these horses. This is ‘welfare-washing’ at its most insidious.”Spectators posted on social media criticising the event as “shameful” and “disgusting”. They also hit out at the official broadcaster, ITV, for how slow it was to provide information in the aftermath of what appeared to be the death of a horse on live television, though the picture cut away immediately after the fall.One person described it as “one of the most unsettling things I’ve ever seen”, while another said they were “sat breaking my heart over that fall from Broadway Boy”.Viewers were updated half an hour after the race’s finish, with ITV racing presenter Ed Chamberlin revealing that both horses were being assessed by vets.Explore more on these topicsGrand NationalHorse racingAintreeAnimal welfareAnimalsHorsesnewsShareReuse this content"

Successive prime ministers have used the king’s long track record on campaigning for climate action to help promote Britain’s leadership on combatting the challenges.In December 2023, for example, the king told the Cop28 UN climate change conference in Dubai that more urgent action was needed to bring the world towards a zero-carbon future. “After all, ladies and gentlemen, in 2050 our grandchildren won’t be asking what we said, they will be living with the consequences of what we did or didn’t do,” he said.At that point, the main UK political parties were agreed on the issue. Now the monarch runs the risk of becoming embroiled in a party political dispute. In addition to the change in the Conservative view, Reform wants to scrap net zero completely.Craig Prescott, a constitutional expert at Royal Holloway, University of London, suggested the king must be less specific about his own views on the target. “I think if you take the view that the monarchy has to be ‘two or three steps away’ from party politics then, as party politics changes, the monarchy should change,” he said.Charles, who flies to Italy tomorrow with Queen Camilla for a state visit that lasts until Thursday, will still put tackling the climate crisis and other environmental challenges at the heart of his monarchy.The work to create a more sustainable future will be a feature of the trip. In Rome, the king will join a meeting chaired by the foreign secretary, David Lammy, and attended by business leaders to hear how Britain and Italy are working together on the transition to clean energy. In Ravenna he will meet farmers whose land and crops have been severely affected by devastating floods in the region in the past few years.He and Camilla, who celebrate their 20th wedding anniversary at a state banquet in Rome on Wednesday evening, will visit the Colosseum and celebrate close defence ties between the two countries, in spite of the political differences between Keir Starmer’s Labour party and Italy’s rightwing leader, Giorgia Meloni.The need to avoid involving the king in party political controversy has been highlighted after documents released on Friday revealed that the monarch secretly met Prince Andrew to discuss his future and was twice briefed about plans for him to be involved in a £2.4bn investment fund run by an alleged Chinese spy, Yang Tengbo. Buckingham Palace insisted Yang, since banned from Britain despite protesting his innocence, was not specifically mentioned.Prince William is likely to attend the Cop30 UN climate conference in Belém, Brazil, in November and may also be more guarded than before about his views on achieving net zero, although royals may still be expected to reflect on government policy on the international stage.Any silencing of the monarch and his heir threatens to weaken Britain’s voice abroad, according to some environmental groups. Shaun Spiers, executive director of the environmental thinktank Green Alliance, said Charles might be unable to speak out specifically on the 2050 target but could talk generally about the need for climate action. “The king is a well-respected leader and it would be a shame if he didn’t speak on it, particularly internationally,” he said.Reshima Sharma, deputy head of politics at Greenpeace UK, pointed to popular support for green policies. “King Charles has long been an important advocate for action to clean up our environment and tackle climate change. While the monarchy must remain politically neutral, thankfully climate action continues to receive the kind of popular support that politicians can only dream of. This is reflected across voters of all stripes,” she said.Buckingham Palace declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentThe ObserverMonarchyKing Charles IIIKemi BadenochConservative leadershipnewsShareReuse this content"

The town hall event was punctuated both by celebratory shouts of “Cory, Cory” as well as at least a half-dozen interruptions by protesters.It was Booker’s first in-person event in his home state since his speech this week, where he held the Senate floor for 25 hours and 5 minutes in opposition to Trump’s policies. In doing so, hebroke the record for the longest floor speech, which was set by the segregationist senator Strom Thurmond in opposition to the Civil Rights Act of 1957.Questioner after questioner asked what they could be doing to show their disagreement and worry over the president’s policies. Booker told them it only takes a little bit more – could they afford a trip to Washington to lobby against budget cuts? One of the loudest moments of applause came after he addressed a woman who said she worried about what potential Medicaid cuts could mean for her son with autism.“A gathering like this can’t be the end of our activism,” Booker said. “This has got to be a moment in America where all of us begin to say, what more can I do?”The questions and Booker’s response mirror what voters and otherDemocratshave been hearing during town halls. He said he didn’t want to focus on the Democratic party, which has struggled to find a message since losing the 2024 election. Instead, he said, he would focus on “the people of our country”.“I think the Democratic party lost a lot of elections because people didn’t believe that they cared about them. So let’s stop worrying about the politics and get more focused on the people,” Booker said.After the event, Booker said he was reluctant to tell people the exact tactics to use, citing civil rights activists like the late John Lewis. He said creativity has a role to play.“I know one thing it’s not, is sitting down and doing nothing and just watching on TV and getting stuck in a state of sedentary agitation,” he said. “Everybody has to be taking measures to put the pressure on to change.”Booker, who ran unsuccessfully for president in 2020, said after the event that he was focused on running for re-election to the Senate in 2026 and that 2028 “will take care of itself”.Booker, 55, is in his second full term in the Senate. He chairs the Strategic Communications Committee, his party’s messaging arm. His team is focused on boosting Senate Democrats’ presence across social platforms through more frequent and casual content.Booker himself has amassed one of the largest followings on social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok and X, where his commentary appears to connect with the party’s base. But staffers are now focused on how to transfer that success to Booker’s fellow senators, who are often less digitally fluent and face different political landscapes in their home states.That has involved turning the communications committee into a nerve center for testing and coordinating the easiest-to-use formats for lawmakers looking to boost their digital brands.Booker hopes to double the engagement that senators receive with their content directly online and increase the caucus’s appearances with online digital media personalities.The start of Saturday’s event included six disruptions, including by several people who decried the treatment of Palestinians. Police in the gymnasium escorted them from the arena.“I hear you and I see you,” Booker said.Explore more on these topicsCory BookerNew JerseyDemocratsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

We’ve got the right to read the books we want … We’ve even got the right to call the president deranged from crashing our economy, destroying $6tn of wealth … and the press has the right to call the Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf of Mexico.”Maxwell Frost, Florida’s Democratic representative, also addressed the crowd inWashington DC, saying:“This insidious rise of authoritarianism is fueled by corrupt billionaires and mega corporations who believe that they have the right to control every aspect of our lives.”Demonstrators from as far afield as New Hampshire and Pennsylvania gatheredat Washington DC’s national monument.In overcast conditions, protesters displayed a vast array of placards and, in some cases, Ukrainian flags, expressing opposition to administration policies.In addition to large US cities, anti-Donald Trump proteststook place throughout the US’s smaller towns, including in red counties.Photos posted on Bluesky showed demonstrators in St Augustine, a small town in Florida of 14,000 people in a red county. Many waved signs that read: “The king of corruption!” and “Make lying wrong again!”About 600 people registered foran event, billed as a “Hands Off” rally, at the Ventura Government Center onin Ventura, California.Signs indicated protesters were worried about a range of issues: racism, national parks, healthcare, the environment, veterans’ benefits, grocery costs and more.Several hundred vociferous anti-Trump demonstrators converged on a traffic circle in Florida’s Fort Lauderdale suburb of Hollywood Saturday morning to vent their rejection of the 47th president’s policies and myriad executive orders.Chanting “hey, hey, ho, ho, Trump and Musk have got to go”, the predominantly white protesters jeered motorists in Tesla Cybertrucks and hoisted a variety of colorful placards that left little doubt as to where they stood on the topic ofDonald Trump.ShareUpdated at19.41 EDT"

We want them to stand up and protect the norms of democracy and want them to see that there are people out there who are willing to do that. The goal of this is building a message.”The largest event was at the National Mall in DC, where demonstrators numbered in the tens of thousands. Members of Congress, including the Democrats Jamie Raskin of Maryland, Maxwell Frost of Florida and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, spoke to the crowd.“They believe democracy is doomed and they believe regime change is upon us if only they can seize our payments system,” said Raskin, a Democratic representative from Maryland who is the party’s top figure on the House judiciary committee.He added: “If they think they are going to overthrow the foundations of democracy, they don’t know who they are dealing with.”View image in fullscreenA rally at the statehouse in Columbia, South Carolina, on Saturday.Photograph: Sean Rayford/Getty ImagesKelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign advocacy group, criticized the administration’s treatment of the LBGTQ+ community at the rally at the National Mall.“The attacks that we’re seeing, they’re not just political. They are personal, y’all,” Robinson said. “They’re trying to ban our books, they’re slashing HIV-prevention funding, they’re criminalizing our doctors, our teachers, our families and our lives.”“We don’t want this America, y’all,” Robinson added. “We want the America we deserve, where dignity, safety and freedom belong not to some of us, but to all of us.”The scene in Hollywood, Florida, about an hour south of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, was lively as well. Referring to the White House’s billionaire business adviserElon Muskand the government cuts he has overseen, predominantly white protesters chanted: “Hey, hey, ho, ho, Trump and Musk have got to go.They jeered motorists in Tesla Cybertrucks manufactured by Musk’s electric vehicle maker – and wielded colorful placards that left little doubt as to where they stood with theTrump administration.“Prosecute and jail the Turd Reich,” read one. Some reserved special ire for the world’s richest person: “I did not elect Elon Musk.” Others emphasized the protesters’ anxieties about the future of democracy in the US. “Hands off democracy,” declared one placard. “Stop being [Vladimir] Putin’s puppet,” enjoined another, referring to Russia’s dictator.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Broward county was one of only six counties in Florida that voted for Kamala Harris in November – she defeated Trump there by 16 percentage points – and it is host to one of the US’s most vibrant LGBTQ+ communities.“This is an assault on our democracy, on our economy, on our civil rights,” said Jennifer Heit, a 64-year-old editor and resident of Plantation who toted a poster that read: “USA: No to King or Oligarchy.” She added: “Everything is looking so bad that I feel we have to do all we can while we can, and just having all this noise is unsettling to everyone.”Heit attended a protest outside a Tesla dealership in Fort Lauderdale recently, and she has been outraged by the Trump administration’s frontal assault on the rule of law and the judiciary – including with respect to people who have been deported without due process. “We’re supposed to be a nation of laws and due process,” she said.Public health researcher Donna Greene, 62, came dressed as France’s beheaded queen Marie Antoinette and carried a placard that said: “Musk and Trump Say Let Them Eat Cake.”She said she is proud of the 65 missions that her father Sam Ragland flew for the US military during the second world war.

Friedman said she was worried about her social security, remarking: “I worked my whole life and so did my husband. Now I’m afraid Trump will take it away.”Harlow held up a sign reading: “Save my future.”The protests come after the stock market plummeted this week following Trump’s 1 April announcement of tariffs. Despite the economic fallout, Trump said on Friday: “My policies will never change.”Trump’s approval rating this week fell to 43%, his lowest since taking office, according to aReuters poll.Explore more on these topicsUS newsProtestDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Multiple messages denounced the two men for shuttering government agencies, cutting jobs and services and – in often graphic terms – for threatening the survival of US democracy.“Resist like it’s 1938 Nazi Germany” and “Fascism is alive and well and living in the White House”, read two slogans at the Hands Off gathering, organized by the civil society group Indivisible and featuring speeches from a host of other organizations as well as Democratic members of Congress.The rally, which coincided with roughly 1,000 other similarly themed events across the country, was punctuated by a fusillade of barbs aimed at Trump as well as Musk, whose infiltration into government agencies through the unofficial “department of government efficiency”, or Doge, without congressional approval, and cash-fueled interventions in election races have been seen as anti-democratic affronts.View image in fullscreenThe protest in DC.Photograph: Roberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty Images“They believe democracy is doomed and they believe regime change is upon us if only they can seize our payments system,” said Jamie Raskin, a Democratic representative from Maryland who is the party’s top figure on the House judiciary committee.He added: “If they think they are going to overthrow the foundations of democracy, they don’t know who they are dealing with.”Saturday’s events followed weeks of anxiety among anti-Trump forces that the president had railroaded through his agenda in the absence of adequate resistance from congressional Democrats and minus the displays of popular mass opposition that appeared early in his first presidency.But they also came days after the Democratsdrew encouragementfromvictory in a racefor a vacant supreme court seat in Wisconsin into which Musk had unsuccessfully ploughed $25m ofhis own moneyto support the Trump-endorsed Republican candidate.It also followed the roll-out of Trump’s flagship policy of import tariffs, which triggeredmassive plungesin international stock markets and fueled fears of an economic downturn.Multiple speakers and attendees said they hoped the rallies would embolden other American disillusioned by Trump’s policies to join future rallies, giving a fledgling protest movement much-needed momentum.View image in fullscreenProtesters in DC on Saturday.Photograph: Roberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty Images“We want to send a signal to all people and institutions that have been showing anticipatory obedience to Trump and showing they are willing to bend the knee that there is, in fact, a mass public movement that’s willing to rise up and stop this,” said Leah Greenberg, Indivisible’s executive director.“If our political leaders stand up, we will have their backs. We want them to stand up and protect the norms of democracy and want them to see that there are people out there who are willing to do that. The goal of this is building a message.”Robert Weissman, co-president of Public Citizen, a consumer-rights advocacy group, told the crowd: “There’s only one thing that can face down the authoritarian moment we are facing, and that’s the movement we see here today.”Asked by the Guardian whether the mass demonstrations were sufficient to stop Trump, he said: “It’s not a one-time thing. It’s got to be a sustaining phenomenon. There’s been a lot of criticism of the Democrats for not standing up in Congress, so an event like this will stiffen their spine.“It’s about making the Democrats better and giving them courage – and it will. That’s also true for ordinary people, because Trump’s authoritarian playbook is designed to make people think it’s useless to resist. This demonstrates power and it will bring in more people.”Several congressional Democrats predicted the rally would inspire more protests, ultimately fueling an electoral triumph in next year’s congressional midterms, when control of the House of Representatives and the Senate will be up for grabs.“This is what freedom fighting against fascism looks like,” said Eric Swalwell, a representative for California. “This is not the last day of the fight, it’s the first day. When it all comes to [be] written about, you will see that April 5 is when it all came alive. Energy and activism beget energy and activism.”View image in fullscreenProtesters at the Washington monument on Saturday.Photograph: Ken Cedeno/ReutersSeveral members acknowledged that protests were rarely enough to supplant authoritarian governments, as demonstrated in countries like Turkey and Hungary, whose strongman leaders, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Viktor Orbán respectively, have survived in office despite repeated episodes of street protests.“We invited some historians in to discuss that question,” said Raskin. “They said, in some countries there was just a legislative parliamentary strategy, and that only succeeded about one-third of the time.“In other countries, there was just a popular-resistance strategy, and that succeeded a little bit more than a third of the time. But when you have a popular-resistance strategy and an effective legislative strategy, it wins more than two-thirds of the time. It’s not a guarantee, but you need to have national mass popular action at the same time that you’ve got an effective legislative strategy, too.”Representative Don Beyer, whose northern Virginia district – home to 75,000 federal workers – has been disproportionately affected by Musk’s assault on government agencies, compared the effect of Trump’s actions to the upheaval wrought by Mao Zedong in the Chinese cultural revolution.But, he said, Trump would be derailed by next year’s election, which he said he was “somewhat confident” would be ‘“free and fair”.“They’re not perfect [but] the people do have a chance to speak,” Beyer said. “Elections are very much decentralized and organized precinct by precinct. There are lots of chances to push back. We just saw that in Wisconsin.”Explore more on these topicsWashington DCProtestDonald TrumpElon MuskUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

TheTrump administrationis seeking to deport him under a provision in federal immigration law that permits the state department to deport non-citizens considered to be a threat to US foreign policy.Federal officials have said that Khalil, who has not been charged with any crime, led activities “aligned to Hamas”, which the US designates a terrorist organization.In anop-ed published Friday in the Columbia Spectator, dictated to his attorney, Khalil accused Columbia’s leadership of suppressing student dissent over Israel’s war in Gaza, which it launched after the 7 October 2023 terror attack by Hamas.“Since my abduction on March 8, the intimidation and kidnapping of international students who stand for Palestine has only accelerated,” Khalil said, pointing to the arrest of three other students, the self-deportation of a fourth and another who is fighting similar orders but without arrest.“The situation is oddly reminiscent of when I fled the brutality of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria and sought refuge in Lebanon,” Khalil continued. “The logic used by the federal government to target myself and my peers is a direct extension of Columbia’s repression playbook concerning Palestine.”Khalil also accused the university of suppressing student dissent under the auspices of combating antisemitism and bowing to pressure from Congress to turn over student disciplinary records and creating a taskforce on antisemitism “that broadly categorized anti-Israel sentiment as hate speech to condemn protests”.He urged students to continue their protest efforts. “It is incumbent upon each of you to reclaim the University and join the student movement to carry forward the work of the past year,” he wrote.The US secretary of sate Marco Rubiosaid last monththat the state department had revoked roughly 300 students visas. “Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visas,” Rubio said at a news conference in Guyana.Khalil mentioned other students who had been arrested and are facing deportation, including the Tufts University doctoral studentRümeysa Öztürk, whom the Department of Homeland Security has said “engaged in activities in support of Hamas”.Judge rules Mahmoud Khalil’s deportation case must continue in New JerseyRead moreKhalil said that Öztürk, whose deportation has been temporarily blocked by a judge, and others have been “snatched by the state”.Öztürk was a signatory to an opinion piece in the Tufts University student newspaper that called on the university to label Israel’s war in Gaza a “genocide”. Tufts has said the op-ed is consistent with speech permitted under its policies of free expression.Khalil’s letter comes a month after Columbia University’s president, Katrina Armstrong, resigned as the universityacceded to administration demandsto crack down on what the administration deemed acts of antisemitism at the campus.Trump threatened to withdraw $400m in federal funding to Columbia if the university did not agree to a series of changes including banning face masks on campus, empowering security officers to remove or arrest individuals, and taking control of the department that offers courses on the Middle East from its faculty.Explore more on these topicsMahmoud KhalilColumbia UniversityTrump administrationUS campus protestsUS politicsUS immigrationIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

No one should have been surprised,the US president said.The announcement of 10% to 50% tariffs on US trading partners tankedstock marketsafter Trump unveiled a “declaration of economic independence” so drastic it drew comparison with Britain’s exit from the European Union –Brexit.ButTrump, who won re-electionpromising that tariffs would make America great again, has advocated for the return ofwidespread tariffswith “great consistency” for decades. “I’ve been talking about it for 40 years,” he noted in the White House Rose Garden.Manybusinesses,economistsandpoliticiansbelieve Trump’s trade plan is wrongheaded,flawedand risky. Some have even suggested it might have beenwritten by ChatGPT.But he is unquestionably right when it comes to the number of decades he has argued for it.Wall Street selloff caps brutal week for markets as Trump tariffs rattle investorsRead more“This is so unusual for Trump. He’s a conventional politician in one way: he doesn’t believe in much deeply,” Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia.Tariffsare different. “This one thing, he seems to deeply believe in.”As far back as 1987, when a fame-hungry real estate tycoon took outfull-page ads in newspapers, the now president called for such a strategy. Other major economies are the “greatest profit machines ever created”, he argued way back when. “‘Tax’ these wealthy nations, not America.”Eight years after the start of his first term and just 10 weeks into his second, he has finally set about seriously delivering that dream – and cast aside warnings it may deteriorate into a nightmare.On the campaign trail last year, Trump made no secret of his vision: tariffs would unshackle theUS economy, he promised, revitalize its industrial heartlands and unlock a gigantic financial windfall for the federal government.But after pitching this big, beautiful and bold reconstruction of the global economic order, the early actions of the second Trump administration were strikingly smaller, messier and altogether more hesitant than trailed.The focus, at first, narrowed dramatically from the world to just a handful of nations: China, Canada and Mexico. While China was hit hard, sweeping tariffs on Canada and Mexico were interrupted by a dizzying array of deadlines, delays and dispensations.Tariffs wereincreased on steel and aluminum. But Trump’s trade agenda was largely characterized by threats and spats: rhetoric, but not reality.On Wednesday, dubbed “liberation day” by Trump and his aides, he did his best to draw a sharp line under weeks of wavering, doubt and confusion – and imposed the universal and “reciprocal” tariffs he pledged so many times to introduce while fighting to regain the White House.Defying the stark forecasts and concerns of mainstream economists and corporations, Trump went with his gut. “That was true of the Brexiteers, was it not? They really believed it deeply from the core of their souls,” said Sabato.At one point during his address, Trump switched from president to historian. “In 1913, for reasons unknown to mankind, they established the income tax,” he said, setting the stage for a sharp reduction in tariffs on foreign goods. “Citizens, rather than foreign countries, would start paying the money necessary to run our government.”Decades of US prosperity “came to a very abrupt end” with the Great Depression from 1929, Professor Trump opined before his class of aides, cabinet secretaries and supporters. “It would have never happened if they had stayed with the tariff policy,” he claimed. “It would have been a much different story.”Actual historians took issue with this account. “It’s what we would call a lie. False. Not true,” said Andrew Cohen, professor of history in the Maxwell School at Syracuse University. “He’s wrong. No one thinks that. Even conservative economists don’t think that. Even protectionist economists don’t think that.”Months into the depression, theSmoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930– which hiked tariffs on hundreds of imports in a bid to boost the US economy – iswidely consideredto have prolonged, and even deepened, the crisis. No other president has tried the same tactic again – until now.The swift rebuttal to Trump’s analysis of the past was surpassed only by the response to his ambitious predictions for the future.The president has promised a new Golden Age, with millions of new jobs, billions more dollars’ worth of US exports and trillions of dollars in tariff revenues. Outside his administration, skepticism is high.“TheTrump tariffsmark a liberation from the benefits of free trade for American businesses and consumers,” said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University, and a former official at the International Monetary Fund. “Trump has taken the hatchet to trade with practically every major US trading partner, sparing few allies or rivals,” he added, with action that will be “severely disruptive to the US economy, with the effects felt by American consumers and businesses in practically every industry”.Who pays the price? The rest of the world, according to the president and his aides. But import tariffs are paid by the companies and consumers that import the goods from the rest of the world – in this case, US companies and consumers – rather than the overseas companies exporting them.Trump’s tariffs will increase the average US household’s costs by $3,800, according to theYale Budget Lab.“These tariff increases are likely to be some of the biggest tax increases in US history and will result (if fully implemented) in some of the highest tariff rates the US has ever seen,”wroteJeremy Horpedahl, adjunct scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute, who noted that they could exceed the post-Smoot-Hawley levels of 1930.“Like all tariffs, some large portion of these new levies will be paid by US consumers and businesses in the form of higher prices,” added Horpedahl.If Trump is right, and his decades-old dream revives the world’s largest economy, enriching its citizens and transforming its industrial base into a manufacturing powerhouse, his administration will be one of the most successful in modern memory.But if he’s wrong, the very Americans who elected him to rapidly bring down the cost of living are likely to be hit hardest.“It’s either going to be Trump and his team or it’s going to be a large majority of experienced mainstream economists,” said Sabato. “I know where my bet is.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTariffsUS economyanalysisShareReuse this content"

A fifth this year already looks to be a tall order as the team swing from a period of undisputed dominance to being left impotent by a car they cannot tame and in no little disarray, so much so that Verstappen may be considering his options.In Japan, all eyes have been on the home hero Yuki Tsunoda, promoted to Red Bull from the sister team, Racing Bulls, with indecent haste, afterLiam Lawson was sent packingthe other way after two races. Even by F1 standards it was a brutal decision but indicative of the disorder that embroils Red Bull.The fans here could not be happier, with their man in one of the top cars engendering a febrile atmosphere. Those who had fashioned elaborately tailored Yuki tribute costumes in the Racing Bulls livery had barely a week to upgrade it all to match theRed Bullcolours but they managed it, the heaving fan areas in the shadow of the ferris wheel bustling with celebratory Yuki attire.This was a positive at least after another week when Red Bull were left looking almost rudderless. The former driver Giedo van der Garde described the Lawson sacking as a “panic move” in an Instagram post that was pointedly liked by Verstappen and which the Dutchman confirmed in Suzuka included sentiments with which he concurred.View image in fullscreenChristian Horner has been embroiled in power struggles at Red Bull.Photograph: Mark Thompson/Getty ImagesChristian Horner, the Red Bull principal, said his engineers had been concerned about Lawsons’s ability to cope, while Helmut Marko, the team’s motorsport adviser responsible for their young drivers programme, came out last week to justify the decision. His arguments lacked cohesion and felt more like retroactively attempting to account for it, but one thing he said was impossible to ignore. “We have this huge motivation to achieve this fifth title,” he said. “We also know that if we don’t deliver for Max, all the top drivers have performances clauses in their contract.”Other teams, not least Mercedes and Aston Martin, are more than aware of this and have been circling Verstappen for some time. The performance clause means Red Bull need to produce a strong car for Verstappen and they have not.From winning 21 of 22 races in 2023 a victory at this point would be very welcome and Verstappen’s remarkable securing of pole for Sunday’s Grand Prix serves only to further underline the Dutchman’s talent. Still, it is hard not to draw comparisons with the similarly perplexingdecline at Manchester City. At Milton Keynes, as at the Etihad Stadium, this is not the time for panic.The Lawson decision, was not an isolated event, but rather the latest in what has been almost relentless tumult. Before the season began last year there was the furore around Horner being investigated for alleged inappropriate behaviour after a complaint made by a female employee of the team, charges he strongly rejected. Horner was exonerated by an independent inquiry but it exposed frailties at the heart of the organisation.There was an internal power struggle between Horner and the team’s parent company, Red Bull GMBH, and between Horner and Verstappen’s father, the former F1 driver Jos, who was openly calling for him to be sacked. Marko was under threat of suspension, prompting Verstappen in turn to threaten to leave. It was a power struggle worthy of the machinations of the Roman senate but not quite as bloody.Even as they rode out the storm the team have since been battered on many levels. They have played it down but senior key figures leaving are serious blows. The first was the departure of Rob Marshall as chief engineering officer at the end of 2023 to become chief designer at McLaren. He was followed in 2024 by Adrian Newey, the team’s genius designer,joining Aston Martinand then Jonathan Wheatley, the sporting director, moving to Sauber and Will Courtenay, the head of strategy, alsoleaving for McLarenthough being held to see out his contract by Red Bull for this year.View image in fullscreenLiam Lawson has been jettisoned after just two races.Photograph: Kym Illman/Getty ImagesThrough it all Verstappen has remained stoic, focused on the job in hand and the world champion eased through the opening part of last season when the car looked every bit as dominant as it had for the previous two years. But six races in, at the Miami GP, the wheels came off. McLaren brought upgrades that moved them to the front, while every development Red Bull applied to try to keep pace only set them back, to the extent Verstappen declared the car undriveable.There was no quick fix and none in the longer term; the anticipated step up over the winter has not been produced. Meanwhile, McLaren and Mercedes have moved forward as Red Bull have made the car all but unmanageable.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The design philosophy for the regulation change of 2022 was rightly focused around having the car suit Verstappen and the extremely pointy front-end he prefers. For two years their performance advantage over the opposition, in Verstappen’s hands at least, was such that all was well, but when the other teams began catching up and Red Bull had to develop, the negative traits of the car and its increasingly narrow performance window only became more and more severe.The pursuit of extreme performance at the expense of driveability was based on Verstappen’s capability to manage a demanding ride. Now it has reached the point where even Verstappen is barely managing, despite his performance in qualifying at Suzuka.Newey has said he had identified problems in the car toward the end of 2023 and that as 2024 went on they became more acute. “It’s something I was starting to become concerned about,” he says. “But not many other people in the organisation seemed to be very concerned about it.”He was right but the team, now under the technical director, Pierre Waché, continued in the same developmental direction even as the car became harder to drive, to the point where Verstappen was publicly demanding changes.All of which suggests a level of questionable decision-making, of which the Lawson-Tsunoda switch is only the public tip of the iceberg. That particular call is a no-win for Red Bull. If Tsunoda smashes it on Sunday it only demonstrates their decision to overlook him for Lawson was flawed; if he fails then not giving Lawson a better shout also looks like an error, that it is not the drivers at fault but simply that Verstappen’s talent has concealed a fundamental problem.Red Bull are 20 years on from their debut and still a formidable force. Yet there are no guarantees in F1. In the 80s and 90s the idea that teams such as Williams and McLaren might find themselves languishing as also-rans would have seemed fanciful. Yet Williams know only too well how far the mighty can fall while McLaren have only just emerged from more than a decade in the doldrums.Past success counts for nothing when the slate is swept clean every season; the challenge is perhaps not so much how Tsunoda comes through this but how Red Bull themselves fare.Explore more on these topicsRed BullThe ObserverChristian HornerMax VerstappenFormula OneMotor sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Everton denied Arsenal victory courtesy of a controversial penalty, effectively ending their forlorn pursuit of the leaders in the process. Mikel Arteta did not rage against the dying of the light on his return to Goodison Park. The game is up and he knows it.Arsenal took the lead through Leandro Trossard’s fine first-half finish, dominated possession and edged the chances, but never performed with the conviction or quality of serious title contenders. They paid the price when Myles Lewis-Skelly was adjudged to have fouled Jack Harrison inside the area, presenting Iliman Ndiaye with the penalty that earned Everton a fifth draw in six games.Everton 1-1 Arsenal: Premier League – live reactionRead moreThe upshot is that Liverpool need 11 points from eight games to seal their 20th league title and Arsenal may have to form a guard of honour at Anfield when they return to Merseyside on 11 May.Arteta complained about the penalty, but cannot legitimately take issue with the destiny of the championship. “We deserved more,” he said. “The referee decides to give a penalty and that changes the course of the game.“I’ve seen it 15 times. There’s no way that’s a penalty. Because if it is, then [Jake] O’Brien has to be out andEvertonhas to play with 10 men. After that we dominated the game.”David Moyes chose the diplomatic option about the penalty that edged Everton closer to guaranteed safety. “I’ve watched it zero times so couldn’t tell you,” he said. “But I’m really satisfied. It’s been a difficult week against the teams first and second in the league and we’ve given both of them decent games.”Arteta attributed a changed team selection to fitness problems after thewin over Fulham on Tuesday. There was no doubt, however, that Tuesday’s Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid was on his mind and his priority with Bukayo Saka, Martin Ødegaard, Gabriel Martinelli and Thomas Partey all on the bench.The finest moment of a scrappy opening was the tribute to the former Arsenal and Everton forward Kevin Campbell. The whole crowd stood to applaud when the late striker’s face appeared on the giant screens in the ninth minute. Members of Campbell’s family were in attendance to witness the affection both sets of supporters have for a much-missed character, whodied last year aged 54.View image in fullscreenJordan Pickford saves from Gabriel Martinelli at Goodison Park.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty ImagesTrossard decided this fixture in Arsenal’s favour last season and carried their main threat again in a central role. The Belgium international was denied by a superb Jarrad Branthwaite challenge when breaking into the area after a James Tarkowski mistake. Ten minutes later, he profited from a mix-up between Branthwaite and Idrissa Gueye to drive the visitors into the lead.Everton were on the attack when Gueye, under pressure from Declan Rice, miscued a header straight to Raheem Sterling, who had been left by Branthwaite. Sterling sprinted through the Everton half unchallenged before finding Trossard, who swept a low shot between the legs of Jake O’Brien and inside the unsighted Jordan Pickford’s far corner.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Everton were donated an equaliser when Lewis-Skelly tumbled into Harrison as they contested a Pickford clearance.The offence, if it could be called that, commenced outside the area with the full-back leaning into Harrison and briefly grabbing his shirt. The pair went down inside the area and the referee, Darren England, after a brief pause, pointed to the spot. England’s decision was backed up by the video assistant referee to allow Ndiaye, Everton’s brightest outlet on his first start in over seven weeks, to send David Raya the wrong way with a cool, confident penalty.Raya saved at his near post from Abdoulaye Doucouré as Everton pressed for a swift second, but it was Arsenal who created the better openings. Pickford pushed away a powerful free-kick from Rice, tipped over brilliantly from Trossard, who was then penalised for a push on Branthwaite, and made another fine save when Martinelli skipped inside O’Brien and aimed for the top corner. Ødegaard and Mikel Merino also missed decent chances as Arsenal faltered, uniting both sides of the Merseyside divide in relief.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueThe ObserverEvertonArsenalmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Gretzky should be there on Sunday at the New York Islanders when the 39-year-old Ovechkin has his next chance to make history.Alex Ovechkin’s career goals.The home crowd cheered wildly when Ovechkin equalled the record, and the player blew kisses to his family, who were also in attendance. At the next stoppage in play, the video screens showed footage from the star’s path towards the record.Ovechkin’s teammates later mobbed him as the horn sounded to end the game. Blackhawks captain Nick Foligno led his team to congratulate the Capitals legend before heading off the ice. Ovechkin also skated around the ice and pounded his chest as he looked out at the fans.“It means a lot,” he said on the team’s postgame show. “Right now, I’m so emotional. You never [think] you can reach that milestone.”Gretzky had spoken to the crowd during the game’s first intermission and paid tribute to Ovechkin.“I’m so proud of the fact that I’m here tonight,” Gretzky said. “The commissioner I talked to the other day, and Alex said don’t come here until I get to two. I thought yesterday, ‘Gosh, we better get on the plane and get up there because he might get three tonight.’ When he scored four minutes in I thought, ‘Oh my God, we might be able to leave after the first period.’”Gretzky, considered the greatest hockey player of all time, held the record for 31 years since scoring his 802nd goal, breaking Gordie Howe’s mark, against the Vancouver Canucks in March 1994. In 20NHLseasons, Gretzky needed 1,487 games to tally 894 goals. Ovechkin matched him in the 1,486th game of his career.Ovechkin remains an elite scorer in the league even as he nears 40. Only two players (Edmonton’s Leon Draisaitl with 52 and Toronto’s William Nylander with 42) entered Friday with 40 or more goals this season, Ovechkin has now reached that mark too. He has played in just 60 games this season, having missed 16 in November and December due to a broken leg.Explore more on these topicsNHLWashington CapitalsCanadaUS sportsIce hockeyShareReuse this content"

UConn, meanwhile, will be looking for their 12th NCAA Tournament championship, and first since the last of that run in 2016.It’s a rematch of the 2022 championship game, which the Gamecocks won 64-49. The teams met in February and UConn shocked South Carolina with a 29-point road victory.UConn, who played the late game on Friday, built a big lead early on v UCLA and never let it go en route to an 85-51 win over the Bruins. Sarah Strong and Azzi Fudd didn’t even need much help from superstar Paige Bueckers to propel UConn into the national title game, leading the Huskies to a remarkably easy victory over UCLA on Friday night to set up the Huskies’ 13th trip to the title game.Strong finished with 22 points and Fudd scored all of her 19 points in the first half for the second-seeded Huskies, whose eight-year title drought is the longest for the Huskies since they won their first in 1995. Bueckers finished with 16 points after topping 30 in each of the previous three games for the Huskies (36-3).Star center Lauren Betts scored 26 points for the top-seeded Bruins (34-3).View image in fullscreenUConn will face the defending champions in the championship.Photograph: John Raoux/APIn the earlier game, South Carolina got 14 points from Te-Hina Paopao and overwhelmed Texas 74-57.Freshman Joyce Edwards added 13 points, 11 rebounds and six assists for South Carolina (35-3), which used its experience and poise to weather an early deficit and took control with its depth at both ends of the floor.Three South Carolina players finished in double figures – Bree Hall had 11 points – and the Gamecocks dominated Texas in the post with 40 points in the paint to the Longhorns’ 22.Madison Booker had 11 points and three fouls for the Longhorns (35-4), who were trying to reach their first championship since 1986. They were in the Final Four for the first time since 2003 after a dominant season, which was their first in the Southeastern Conference after coming over from the Big 12.USC’s JuJu Watkins wins AP women’s player of the year awardRead moreTexas went 15-1 against the SEC in the regular season and shared the conference title with the Gamecocks.South Carolina broke open the game in the third quarter with an 11-0 run started by Edwards’ driving layup, and Texas never got closer than 10 the rest of the way.The Longhorns could not match South Carolina’s pace as the game went on. They only scored nine points in the third, including bad mid-range misses from Booker and Harmon. Harmon, a senior who returned this season from an ACL injury last year, finished with eight points. Jordan Lee led Texas with 16 points off the bench.South Carolina went undefeated during a dominant championship run last year that featured a physical roster no opponent could match up with. This year’s journey to the final has been slightly more challenging.Without a star like A’ja Wilson, Aliyah Boston or 6ft 7in center Kamilla Cardoso – who led the Gamecocks on their previous title runs – they’ve relied on a dynamic rotation to reach their third championship game in four years.South Carolina leads the nation in bench points and got 35 points from its reserves on Friday, including nine points from Tessa Johnson and seven from Milaysia Fulwiley. Former South Carolina greats Wilson, Boston and Allisha Gray cheered them on from the stands.Will a fifth year become the norm for women’s college basketball stars?Read moreBooker went to the bench with about three minutes left in the first quarter after picking up two fouls. That allowed South Carolina to climb out of a 12-4 hole before the SEC player of the year came back late in the second, made a free throw and checked back out after picking up her third foul. The Gamecocks outscored Texas by 13 with Booker on the bench and took a 38-35 half-time lead.This was the teams’ fourth meeting this season – the 17th time two women’s teams have faced each other that many times in a single season, according to Stats Perform. As first-time conference opponents, they split the regular-season series, with each team winning on its home court, before the Gamecocks blew out Texas in the SEC Tournament championship.Explore more on these topicsCollege basketballBasketballCollege sportsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Three weeks on from first sight of the conceptual drawings forSir Jim Ratcliffe’s stately pleasure dome, also known as the proposed Manchester United Stadium Soccer Product Hub, there is still a sense of double-take about the whole thing.Early impressions of the new ground ranged from a defunct Venusian mercury mine, to Dubai Butlin’s, to a pointed corporate monument to our divided world. Welcome to the Staff Lunch Arena, embodiment of the 21st-century conviction that if you just stopped buying so many sandwiches and also fired the tea lady you could probably afford a vast and unattainable house.Manchester United’s post-Ferguson strikers: 12 years, 19 players, few triumphsRead moreThe stadium project has at least brought into sharper focus the transient world in whichManchester Unitedmust now exist, shadowed not just by ghosts of the past but the ghost of the future too. This is already an entity engaged in a constant struggle with itself. For now the new development will remain just another zone of conflict, another front on which the club must lobby and balance competing interests, confirmation that the state of unresolvable civil war has now spread to the ground beneath its feet. And that there is, as ever, something rotten in the state of Denmark.With this in mind it feels appropriate the first home Premier League game of the post-plans era should be a derby visit fromManchester Cityon Sunday afternoon. Who are Manchester United’s biggest rivals these days anyway? For so long the answer to this was Liverpool. City have inserted themselves into this dynamic by sheer weight of success. Otherwise the real enemies at Manchester United are now within, a roster of internecine battles that have tracked the past decade.So much so that trying to understand the current tensions at Manchester United is like being asked to provide a complete structural read-out of the causes of the Syldavian war of independence, a blur of factions, ancestral claims, popular dissent, moustachioed emperors in exile.Everyone has a side here. Supporters against Glazers. Supporters against Ratcliffe. Glazers against Ratcliffe (dormant but watch this space). And beyond this an endless arm-wrestle of stadium fans against internet fans, MUFC plc legal dept against the planning authorities, dissident squad members versus incumbent manager, exiled loanees with a grudge, agents, hangers-on, parasites.Step further out and you’re into the drowned world of online fanaticism, Ronaldo loyalists, Ole ultras, Sheikh Jassim stock photo nostalgists, Nemanja Matic truthers, and every other strain of grudge and unscabbed wound. All of it soundtracked by the wailing Easter Island heads of the United legends punditry lineup, constantly reasserting their own relevance by saying things on podcasts, trotting out the Great Roy Keane Of History theory, a self-fuelling industry in themselves.At the end of which those noises off are so persistent that the arrival of some people in sky blue shirts from down the road wanting an actual game of football almost feels like an interruption. Do you mind? There’s an unceasing battle for local supremacy going on here.But there are also some handy things about civil wars. First, not everyone can lose, or at least not at the same time. And this has so far been a good thing forRuben Amorim. United’s latest manager may have overseen an appalling run of form, driven by the obvious mismatch of evangelically stubborn tactics and an ill-tailored squad, but he is in effect bulletproof right now.View image in fullscreenSir Jim Ratcliffe has made plenty of changes and plans since joining Manchester United.Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty ImagesFor a start he can lose himself in the fog of other people’s failure. Nobody is actually ready to blame the last man in through the door for any of this. It may have been illogical to hire a tactical ideologue in mid-season, then ask him to fudge something up out of your existing bits and bobs. But this is hardly his fault. When someone comes through the door wearing a hat that saysI really like wing-backs, there’s a chance they might just really like wing-backs.For now Amorim’s greatest attribute is his easy, sleepy charisma, the ability to laugh and seem a little detached, the smile, jawline, wardrobe, the cinematic qualities. United in this state really don’t need another hollow-eyed prisoner, another sad dad. They need a cool uncle. How long can that last?The answer to this is of course: probably not much longer. The sense of a derby happening by default won’t come again for Amorim. And there are at least three good reasons why this isn’t actually a dead game.First it’s a chance to lob a grenade into City’s season, which has now narrowed to the unlikely but still slightly jaw-dropping prospect of missing out on Champions League football next year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionWith this in mind it seems significant that Amorim’s record against Pep Guardiola is relatively good. This may mean very little on Sunday. That record spans two different clubs and City teams in various states of convulsion. But there is also perhaps a tactical element.Three years ago Amorim’s Sporting Lisbon werethrashed 5-0 by City, having set up in a defensively pitched 5-3-2. In three meetings since Amorim has fielded a 3-4-3 with slightly more advanced flank players. This has coincided with a second leg 0-0 andvictories this season by 4-1and 2-1. City were in a swoon against Sporting in the first of these. The second was the Miracle of Amad. But there is perhaps evidence that shape is well tailored to finding spaces behind City’s full-backs. Guardiola will clearly react to this. But making Guardiola react is also a note of honour.This is the second thing Sunday offers, a chance to show some kind of actual progress beneath the results, because at some point Amorim will have to barter for his future. Right now there is only a vague sense of what a Ruben-shaped team might look like. United look better with Leny Yoro and Patrick Dorgu in the team. Theloss at Nottingham Forestin midweek followed seven games without defeat.If there is a positive underlying metric here it is that United have been at their best against the better teams. Some might suggest this is a function of the players dusting off their best efforts for the big day. There is perhaps a tactical element here too. Amorim’s rigid shape is more effective as a reactive way of playing. When the shirt weighs you down like a Victorian diving suit it is a little easier to play if you don’t have extra pressure to keep the ball, define the game, to be Manchester United in the abstract.This is the final key note before Sunday. Everything United do now is basically prep for the only live element in their season, the Europa League and the possibility of a gateway back to the big stage. Winning the competition isn’t impossible. It will require passage past Lyon, then two more rounds, with Athletic Bilbao, Eintracht Frankfurt and Lazio the stronger teams still in the draw.It is hard to overstate the importance of this opportunity, not just to Amorim, but to the club generally. In the new Champions League format teams can make £80m just for reaching the quarter-finals. This is money this unstoppable cash-sluicing machine actually needs. The brand needs it, the brand which is, despite evidence to the contrary, far from indestructible.For the age of Amorim this feels like a potential Mark Robins FA Cup moment, the thing that might still generate momentum, budget, a restraightening of the ship. Manchester United has always been a saga of collapse and rebuild, right back to the first big stadium rebuild after the Luftwaffe had bombed Old Trafford into the ground. The next few weeks are, if nothing else, an opportunity; one that starts on Sunday.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedThe ObserverRuben AmorimManchester CitycommentShareReuse this content"

An overall total of seven goals in 55 games indicated why he left, for Lyon, in January 2015. Now at Corinthians and, with spells at Barcelona and Atlético Madrid, plus 47 goals in 100 Netherlands games, on the CV, he might have prospered under Ferguson.Zlatan Ibrahimovic (2016-18)Games51Goals29Assists10Mins4,025Arrived as a free agent in July 2016; he turned 35 that October and may be the finest United No 9 of this era.

One era does not yield easily to another. What constitutes an era changes over time. While history is happening it’s often hard to make sense of it; patterns seem to emerge that, from the perspective of 20 years later are meaningless, or culs-de-sac. That seems particularly true this season. As theChampions Leaguereaches its quarter-final stage this coming week, it feels that one age has ended and another has yet to materialise.The past was a simpler place. First there was the age of dominance byReal Madridand Benfica, teams from the capitals of Iberian nations under right-wing dictatorships, packed with great individuals. Then came systematisation,catenaccioand the Italian ascendancy, followed, with a brief period of crossover, by the era of domination by the northern European industrial powers, skipping swiftly over Celtic and Manchester United to the Dutch and Total Football and then Bayern Munich. Then came the long period of English superiority before the Heysel ban, after which everything gets more complicated.Real Madrid win Champions League final as Dortmund rue missed chancesRead moreThere were the one-off champions – Porto, Steaua, PSV Eindhoven, Red Star Belgrade, Barcelona and Marseille – around the mighty Milan of Arrigo Sacchi, who in 1990 were the last side successfully todefend the title for 27 years. As the Champions League began, and began making the rich richer, the nature of the pattern changed. As increasing number of sides were admitted from the bigger leagues, so the level of competition increased. It became harder and harder for one club or one country to dominate.There was a period when it was clear Italian sides were the teams to beat, but that resulted in more defeats in finals for Serie A clubs than successes. Then Real Madrid won three titles in five years. Porto beating Monaco in the 2004 final in 2004 felt like the end of an era, the last time a team from outside the big four European leagues won the competition.What has followed has been the era of the super-clubs, 20 years in which the prize has been passed around nine teams from four countries. Include losing finalists and you only add five more clubs and one country. Real Madrid, with six titles in that time, have clearly been the dominant club, while the Premier League, with six titles shared out, has probably underperformed given its financial dominance. This is not about the domination of a single country but the domination of capital. Finance is all.View image in fullscreenBukayo Saka celebrates scoring against Fulham on his comeback. The winger’s return to fitness offers Arsenal some hope against Real Madrid.Photograph: Josh Smith/PPAUK/ShutterstockBeyond that, it’s very hard to isolate more precise themes, although there is a clear irony in that the spell from Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona beating Manchester United in the 2009 final to the present day has been the most theory-driven period of football’s history, and yet the most successful side has been essentially pragmatic, a team based on brilliant individuals with a remarkable knack of doing something brilliant just when it is needed.It was the era of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, but it was also the era, at least more recently, of huge swings and turnarounds. Which made for great entertainment, but perhaps suggested teams unused to defending in domestic leagues in which they were dominant finding themselves unable to scrap and shut games down when they came under pressure.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A new age is coming into being, may perhaps already have begun, but what will it look like?In one obvious way, it seems a lot like the old age, in that there’s every chance Real Madrid win a 16th Champions League, their seventh in 12 seasons, despite an unconvincing campaign – they lost three times in the group stage – and, more remarkably, despite consistentlylobbying against the Champions Leagueand its structures, and being at war with their own federation. This feels a very modern fable, the serial winners sickened by being unable to win quite enough, or at least lucratively enough, the establishment outraged by challenge.Arsenal’s chances of upsetting them were diminished byGabriel’s hamstring injury,but they have the best defence in the Premier League and that, plus the return of Bukayo Saka and his delivery from corners, gives them at least a glimmer of a chance. The other Premier League hope, Aston Villa,have enjoyed their European campaignbut neither they nor Arsenal seem on the verge of starting a dynasty.View image in fullscreenOusmane Dembélé has been one of Europe’s best players this season and has inspired Paris Saint-Germain to the quarter-finals.Photograph: Jean Catuffe/DPPI/ShutterstockThere could be a first-everclásicofinal, which would be enticing both from a historical and footballing point of view, although Barcelona are also at war with the Spanish federation and are one of the other holdouts against Uefa in the campaign for a Super League. It’s hard to imagine Dortmund, after their miserable season, presenting much opposition. Bayern have dominated other German opposition, but there have been times, notably against Feyenoord and Celtic, when they have seemed inexplicably slow. Inter, meanwhile, have gradually improved over the season to top Serie A.Which leaves Paris Saint-Germain, who have developed radically since a tame defeat by Arsenal in the group stage, andbeat Liverpool with verveand energy. Victory for them would be the first for a league outside the big four for two decades and would represent vindication for their move away from celebrity. That leaves the potential for a semi-final, between PSG, tool of the Qatari state, suddenly representing a progressive team-based ethic, and the old money of Real Madrid and their star system.But there is no clear pattern. Madrid appear the default winners but there are possibilities for a mix of familiar big names, plus one upstart newcomer. The environment is different, but as around the turn of the century, there is a slightly messy sense of an age coming into being – which reflects the scrappiness of the Premier League this season, itself probably a function of accumulated fatigue amid the absurd new calendar.It’s likely Real Madrid will win the Champions League again because that’s just what happens. But there is a chance amid the uncertainty of the interregnum for a less-fancied side to nick a fragment of history for themselves.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueInside footballReal MadridParis Saint-GermainArsenalAston VillacommentShareReuse this content"

At least the manner in whichNottingham Forestswarmed their goal as they pushed for a second-half equaliser may prove a decent dress rehearsal for Wednesday’s Champions League quarter-final first leg at Paris Saint-Germain.Forest pulled a goal back through the half-time substitute Jota Silva and then dialled up the pressure but the visitors, determined to emulate Villa by gatecrashing Europe’s elite, were beaten by early goals from Morgan Rogers and Donyell Malen. For Villa, who cut the gap to third-placed Forest to six points, attention will quickly turn to analysingthe Ligue 1 champions.Aston Villa 2-1 Nottingham Forest: Premier League – live reactionRead moreSimon Hooper officiated a 5-5 Championship draw between these teams in November 2018, when Tammy Abraham scored four and John McGinn and Matty Cash were on opposing sides, and while this time the fixture did not throw up six goals like last season, this was another watchable feast.Murillo smacked the crossbar from 30 yards in stoppage time. Then there was a slice of argy-bargy between Emiliano Martínez and Jota. Forest peppered Villa in the second half, with Neco Williams and Elliot Anderson both blasting inches wide, and Nuno Espírito Santo will wonder how his side, who registered 19 shots but only three on target, left empty-handed.There were no glaring misses but Forest felt the absence of Taiwo Awoniyi and Chris Wood, because of hamstring and hip problems respectively. Anthony Elanga, who predominantly operated centrally, was withdrawn at half-time with an unspecified injury, adding to Nuno’s problems, with Ola Aina also sidelined because of a calf issue. “For me, football is [about] strikers,” Nuno said. “We miss Chris and we miss [Taiwo] because the way we play, the way we do things, we need a reference player. We tried to find solutions.”View image in fullscreenDonyell Malen doubles Aston Villa’s lead from close range.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/ReutersEmery has almost the opposite problem and made eight changes from aresounding victory at Brightonon Wednesday. Martínez, Rogers and Youri Tielemans were the trio who retained their starting spots. Approaching the half-hour, a gaggle of Villa players – Pau Torres, Ezri Konsa, Jacob Ramsey and Boubacar Kamara – gathered close to the touchline. A few minutes later McGinn and Marcus Rashford joined them.This was Villa’s strength in depth hiding in plain sight. On the day those aforementioned players represented plan B, though plan A went so swimmingly that Emery did not need to worry about changes until the 62nd minute, when Rashford, Ramsey and Kamara entered, tasked with trying to disrupt Forest’s groove. Villa were tense in possession, vulnerable out of it.It was a stark contrast to the first half, particularly the opening 15 minutes, at which point Villa led 2-0. Forest were floored by Villa’s boundless energy. Ian Maatsen, who did not feature in Villa’s previous two matches, enjoyed stretching his legs and registered Villa’s first shot after latching on to a Rogers back-heel. Then Marco Asensio prodded wide.Villa’s first goal spoke to the confidence flowing through a team still fighting on three fronts. Tielemans floated a ball over Morato and Rogers, surely one of the stars of the season, did the rest. He took the ball down with the outside of his right boot and then whistled a left-foot finish through the legs of Matz Sels.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Villa were drowning under pressure and Jota pulled a goal back approaching the hour. Williams pushed the ball inside to Anderson, who recorded a swing and a miss, but Jota swivelled and sent a shot through the legs of Konsa, another half-time arrival.Forest went for the jugular. Anderson put his hands on his head in disbelief after dispatching another effort wide. Up the other end Rogers missed a chance to kill the game after seizing on a mistimed jump by Murillo. Forest kept coming. Morgan Gibbs-White volleyed wide and Williams tried his luck from the opposite wing. Murillo cracked the frame of the goal. Then, eventually, the final whistle and Emery’s mind switched to PSG. “We are motivated, excited, but they are favourites,” he said.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueThe ObserverAston VillaNottingham Forestmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The last occasion they were able to celebrate doing the double over Brighton in the 1932-33 season in the old Division Three South, the two clubs weren’t even rivals and it would be another 14 years before Roy Hodgson was born.But with an FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa to come later this month, Daniel Muñoz’s winner made it another memorable afternoon for Oliver Glasner’s side after Danny Welbeck had cancelled out Jean-Philippe Mateta’s 13thPremier Leaguegoal of the season. Not even late red cards for Eddie Nketiah and captain Marc Guéhi could dampen the celebrations in south London as Palace moved to within four points of Fabian Hürzeler’s side with a game in hand.Aston Villa v Nottingham Forest: Premier League – liveRead more“It’s a massive win but I’m really exhausted because there was so much going on,” said a relieved Glasner after his side held out with nine men for 12 minutes of stoppage time.Brighton, who have now lost three times in the space of seven days and also had Jan Paul van Hecke sent off in a bad-tempered finish to the game in which substitute Yasin Ayari was denied a late equaliser by the outstanding Dean Henderson, can see their opportunity of qualifying for Europe again slipping away.“It was a very emotional end and that didn’t help us,” admitted Hürzeler. “We weren’t aggressive enough, the hunger wasn’t there. Why? We have to analyse.”The Brighton manager had attempted to fire up his players beforehand by acknowledging that they “didn’t give the fans what they deserve” in the 3-1 home defeat to Palace in December. But he looked on in disbelief as they made an awful start that immediately handed the initiative to their opponents. His captain, Lewis Dunk, was guilty of playing a sloppy back pass to Bart Verbruggen that he had no option but to kick out of play, with Mateta firing just wide from the resulting throw-in.View image in fullscreenEddie Nketiah is shown a red card by the referee, Anthony Taylor.Photograph: Isabel Infantes/ReutersLess than a minute later, the hosts were ahead as the Frenchman received the ball from Eberechi Eze on the edge of the area after a strong run from Guéhi before leaving Verbruggen with no chance with a left-foot shot that took a slight deflection on its way in. Henderson has been one of Palace’s standout performers this season and, with England head coach Thomas Tuchel watching from the stands, showed why he must be breathing down Jordan Pickford’s neck with contributions at both ends. First it was his long pass that was controlled effortlessly by Eze before he forced Verbruggen to tip his shot around the post. Then Henderson produced a stunning double save to keep out efforts from Carlos Baleba and Welbeck on the follow up.It was a warning that Palace did not heed. When Matt O’Riley pinched the ball off Eze, it was worked wide to Yankuba Minteh and Welbeck – who is now Brighton’s highest scorer in the Premier League with 31– found space at the back post to tap home his superb cross.The last five of these fixtures at Selhurst Park had ended 1-1 and another would have set a new record for the longest sequence of the same result in Premier League history. So it was something of a surprise when Palace went back in front 10 minutes after half-time when a driving run from Eze played in Muñoz. His shot took the slightest of deflections off Pervis Estupiñán’s backside and flew into the net.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But it proved to be the spark for a frantic finale that brought back memories of their FA Cup tie in 1989 when five penalties wereawarded in the space of just 25 minutes. Nketiah thought he had won a penalty when he burst into the box less than 60 seconds after coming off the bench and seemed to be caught by Estupiñán’s trailing leg but the referee, Anthony Taylor, instead showed him a yellow card for diving. Things went from bad to worse for Nketiah when he was shown a second yellow 10 minutes later that perhaps could have been worthy of a straight red after he caught Van Hecke with a high boot.Guéhi was also shown a second yellow after he badly mistimed a tackle on Brajan Gruda but Van Hecke’s dismissal only made things easier for Palace to wrap up their historic victory.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueThe ObserverCrystal PalaceBrighton & Hove Albionmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The visitors came from behind to extend the gap between the two clubs to 12 points with seven games remaining. Ipswich took the lead through Liam Delap after 16 minutes but Pablo Sarabia equalised in the 72nd minute and Jørgen Strand Larsen completed the turnaround with six minutes remaining.Kieran McKenna said of his team’s defeat: “I think it was a really competitive first half, the players gave absolutely everything to the first half and second half. If you don’t manage to get a second goal then they [Wolves] are going to go and put some pressure on and we probably weren’t able to maintain our energy levels.”Crystal Palace 2-1 Brighton, West Ham 2-2 Bournemouth, Ipswich 1-2 Wolves: football – liveRead moreWolves’ midfielder João Gomes came close to opening the scoring with a rasping shot which went just over Alex Palmer’s bar, following a one-two with Rayan Aït-Nouri. Palmer then got down to deflect a shot from Strand Larsen for a corner after 10 minutes, and Ipswich took the lead six minutes later.Axel Tuanzebe drifted a pass out to Dara O’Shea, who beat Aït-Nouri in the air and headed the ball into the danger area for Delap to poke home from close range for his 12th goal of the season. There was a delay before the goal was allowed, after the video assistant referee checked for a possible offside.View image in fullscreenJørgen Strand Larsen scores the winner from close range.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PAMoments later Aït-Nouri’s corner from the right evaded everyone and was going in until O’Shea made a superb clearance on the line under pressure from Toti.An error by Palmer in the 36th minute resulted in the ball going under his foot following a back pass from O’Shea but the goalkeeper recovered and managed to claw the ball away at the last moment. Peter Bankes awarded a free-kick on the six-yard line with all 11 Ipswich players on the goalline but Emmanuel Agbadou’s shot struck the blue wall and was cleared to safety.There were appeals for a penalty when the ball appeared to strike the arm of André and the visitors equalised with 18 minutes remaining through Sarabia. Strand Larsen controlled the ball in the penalty area and clipped it back to the edge of box.

The wear and tear on a talented but brittle squad is enveloping European ambitions. With them winless in sixPremier Leaguematches, Champions League horizons have lowered to outside hopes of the Europa League now dropping down to the Conference League as an outside chance if form does not improve. In east London they almost fell victim to dozing opponents.Graham Potter had lately suggested that the West Ham players he inherited in January are now playing for their futures. Relegation has been averted but the Hammers are in danger of finishing their joint lowest since relegation in 2010-11.Nine-man Crystal Palace savour rare double over Brighton after chaotic winRead moreA decisive summer awaits. Potter has a more ruthless, sharper edge than his public persona might suggest. A dreadful first half was followed by a marked improvement in which changes of personnel and tactics brought about a revival. A crashing header from the forgotten summer signing Niclas Füllkrug lifted a cat-napping London Stadium, attentions switched away by the Grand National, and when Jarrod Bowen scored his own equally good header,Bournemouthappeared sunk only for Evanilson’s poached second to rescue a draw of little practical use to the visitors.“We have to value the point, playing away, but we are not very happy with a point,” said Andoni Iraola. “It was not what we wanted.”Whether Lucas Paquetá is part of Potter’s future plans depends on the verdict of an independent Football Association panel onfour counts of spot-fixing. The Brazilian is playing under a shadow that either lifts or descends in the coming days. If this was farewell, he signed off with a forgettable performance.Potter said of his team’s overall showing: “The good, the bad and the ugly. It’s a tough situation for everybody. We need to acknowledge that we are not where we want to be.”With Füllkrug and Evan Ferguson on the bench, Bowen began centrally. The club captain had not scored or assisted at home for five games; his goal came once he was restored to his usual place on the right.“It’s really frustrating. It’s a point but it feels like a loss,” said Bowen, far more annoyed than his manager. “I’m focused on trying to score and trying to help the team. It’s been a really difficult and disappointing season. Every week I focus on what I can do and try not to listen to the noise.”Not that there was much noise at a becalmed London Stadium. Tomas Soucek had initially played close to Bowen, in what time-honoured Hammers may recognise as the Teddy Sheringham role, though the Czech came far closer to scoring at the wrong end when the ball bounced from his midriff.View image in fullscreenJarrod Bowen heads West Ham in front in the 68th minute.Photograph: John Walton/PAThat was saved by Alphonse Areola, less convincing when palming Antoine Semenyo’s effort into Evanilson’s path for the opener, the Brazilian’s fifth in six. The video assistant referee briefly intervened but Evanilson was level with Maximilian Kilman. “A bit cheap,” said Potter, lamenting the defending. Bournemouth had upped a gear against opponents who appeared to be running through holiday brochures in their mind’s eye.After swapping Emerson for Ollie Scarles at the break, Potter waited 10 minutes to throw on Füllkrug and Carlos Soler, the Soucek experiment abandoned. From James Ward-Prowse’s corner, Füllkrug powered in his first London Stadium goal, the type of header that made his reputation. “We should have defended much better,” said Iraola. “We know the threat [Füllkrug] is.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If we can get him fit and firing he can be a success here.”Potter is an adept in-game manager, often far more acute in amending mistakes in his starting XI than his initial selections. Those changes paid quick dividends.

The manager who oversaw that success, in the 2019-20 season, Ole Gunnar Solskjær, sought a cultural reset when taking over at Old Trafford, buthis reign ended in October 2021after a number of marquee transfers, including Cristiano Ronaldo andJadon Sancho, misfired.De Bruyne’s perfectly timed departure marks tipping point in Guardiola era | Jonathan LiewRead moreSolskjær was heavily criticised for sanctioningthe return of Ronaldoand Amorim has suggested United must become far smarter in the market. The club’s recent financial troubles have been well-documented, with the co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe cutting costsand admitting the club had overspenton transfers. It is expected a limited budget will be available to Amorim, given his favoured 3-4-3 formation requires a number of bespoke signings.Patrick Dorgu, a specialist left wing-back, wasUnited’s only additionin the January window for an initial €30m (£25.1m) from the Italian side Lecce. The 20-year-old has started every game for which he has been available and has largely impressed.Amorim said United were “trying to see gaps we have in our squad” and searching for the right mental and physical characteristics in possible targets. “I want to focus on our strengths and try to use our club to bring [in] one or two players, big players,” he said. “When I say big players, it’s not players from Real Madrid, it’s big players in the way I see the game.” He joked it would help if those players came without a hefty fee.Amorim believes he is developing an understanding with Jason Wilcox, United’s technical director, having enjoyed a close relationship with Hugo Viana – now City’s director of football – when the pair worked together at Sporting. Wilcox is a former City academy coach and director.“It’s a different context, a different league. The competition is completely different,” Amorim said when asked to compare working with Viana and Wilcox. “I was so lucky to work with Hugo and I find more or less the same relationship with Jason. In that department I’m completely relaxed. We need to be really good in recruitment, we need to know our system and the players have to be perfect for that.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tom Banton’s astonishing 344 not out againstWorcestershireeclipsed them all, the highest score by aSomersetplayer – and marks the revival of a blazing young gun, whose star had dimmed but is now aflame.It was also an innings that will have gladdened the hearts of the England selectors, with Banton said to be in their thoughts for Tests this year as they look to build a small pool who play across all formats. It wasn’t all cider and sausages, at 39 for three on Friday afternoon, concentration had been crucial. But by the penultimate ball yesterday, Langer’s 342 in sight, Banton threw caution to the wind and flat-packed a boundary to rapturous applause and handshakes all round.“It’s a weird feeling,” he said, “and I was a bit emotional up there in the dressing room. This is the best day I’ve had in cricket and will probably be the best day I’ll ever have.“These days don’t come along very often and you have to make the most of them. I won’t lie, I was pretty tired out there and I kept saying to myself: ‘Just keep batting, keep going’. There were a few moments when I felt I wanted to be back in the dressing room, but I wanted to go for it [the record] tonight, so I tried to play my shots when possible.”If he was dropped in the 300s by a tiring Worcestershire, it was an aberration – this was a innings of power but also finesse. He didn’t hit a six until he had passed 200 – quite a display of discipline for a man who has graced the Big Bash, the Indian Premier League and the Pakistan Super League. He is also now the joint owner of the earliest triple in Championship history, sharing the record notched up by Sam Northeast on 5 April last year.Banton’s partner in a record fifth-wicket stand of 371 was James Rew – whose second season last year was a more crunchy experience than the first. But his 152 was gloriously heady – and his and Banton’s efforts leftSomersetfans walking away from the ground in disbelief, the scoreboard reading 637 for six.There were runs galore at Chelmsford, whereEssex’s centurions Matt Critchley and Michael Pepper tucked intoSurrey– Dan Lawrence whisking down 35.2 overs against a club where he barely bowled.

Today, numerous falls and clashes have resulted in two lives hanging in the balance. These horses deserve better.“ITV’s cowardly refusal to replay the 25th fence where Broadway Boy fell, while commentators gushed over racing’s welfare standards, shows the depths to which the industry will sink to save itself. When the public sees the grim reality and suffering within horse racing, they rightfully recoil.”The organisation Animal Aid said it was “disgusted and appalled that Broadway Boy suffered a horrific fall in the Grand National race, and that the racing industry – rather than give the public an update on his wellbeing – had the gall to spout empty rhetoric about the ‘welfare’ of race horses.”The statement added: “The lack of information provided about the welfare of these horses is despicable and demonstrates the sheer lack of care the industry has towards these horses. This is ‘welfare-washing’ at its most insidious.”Spectators posted on social media criticising the event as “shameful” and “disgusting”. They also hit out at the official broadcaster, ITV, for how slow it was to provide information in the aftermath of what appeared to be the death of a horse on live television, though the picture cut away immediately after the fall.One person described it as “one of the most unsettling things I’ve ever seen”, while another said they were “sat breaking my heart over that fall from Broadway Boy”.Viewers were updated half an hour after the race’s finish, with ITV racing presenter Ed Chamberlin revealing that both horses were being assessed by vets.Explore more on these topicsGrand NationalHorse racingAintreeAnimal welfareAnimalsHorsesnewsShareReuse this content"

Souttar headed clear a long throw-in from Jack Iredale and it fell to the Wales international Levitt, who took a touch before rifling in a shot from 25 yards which Butland, culpable for several goals conceded in recent games, allowed to squirm into the net.View image in fullscreenHamza Igamane of Rangers and Mykola Kuharevich of Hibernian battle for the ball.Photograph: Alan Rennie/ShutterstockRangers’ response was weak. Hibs shuffled back behind the ball and the home side struggled to break them down which brought the inevitable groans from the stands. In the 28th minute, a fine move involving Cerny, James Tavernier and Cyriel Dessers ended with the Rangers striker’s shot blocked by the Hibs keeper Jordan Smith for a corner which came to nothing.Then Dessers drove high over the bar under pressure from the Easter Road defender Rocky Bushiri after being sent through by Hamza Igamane before a free-kick from Tavernier just cleared the bar as did a wayward shot from Dessers, who was having another off day.Just before the hour mark, Dessers raced clear before hitting Smith with an unconvincing effort but was well offside. Rangers substitute Nedim Bajrami, on for Cerny, smacked the bar with a drive.Campbell then ran through into acres of space but drove wide of the target and when Boyle raced on to a Jordan Obita pass in the 69th minute, he put the ball through the legs of Butland but was ruled offside – only for VAR to confirm the goal and Hibs celebrations.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Details of the amounts reportedly donated have not been disclosed. However, it is understood the Russell family have not received any money from the donation.“Following the coroner’s inquest into Molly’s death, we have decided that we will pursue the aims we share with Meta and Pinterest through the Molly Rose Foundation to help ensure young people have a positive experience online, instead of pursuing legal action,” the Russell family said in a statement. “We, Molly’s family, have always made clear that we would never accept compensation consequent upon Molly’s death.”The reported donations come as social media companies face increased criticism over the impact of online platforms on children’s mental health.In January, as part of sweeping changes to its policies, Meta’s boss, Mark Zuckerberg, said the company wouldscrap factcheckersin order to boost free speech and reduce “censorship”, and would rely on users to report content.The Molly Rose Foundation previously warned that Meta’s changes could place young people at greater risk of encountering harmful content online. It has launched campaigns urging the government to strengthen the Online Safety Act and place more responsibility on technology companies for content promoted through algorithms.According to the BBC, the charity has recruited a chief executive officer, two public policy managers, a head of communications and a fundraising manager within the past nine months.Ian Russell, Molly’s father, remains an unpaid trustee of the foundation and continues to be a prominent internet safety campaigner.Meta and Pinterest have been approached for comment by the Guardian.Explore more on these topicsInternet safetySocial mediaMetaPinterestDigital mediaChildrenYoung peoplenewsShareReuse this content"

They come from every walk of life: teachers, police officers, doctors, TV presenters. And the numbers are rising every year. How did this happen?Harriet GrantSat 5 Apr 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 5 Apr 2025 08.24 EDTShareAndy was enjoying a weekend away with his wife when it happened. “My neighbour phoned me and said, ‘The police are in your house. They’re looking for you.’” He didn’t need to wonder why. “You know. You know the reason. I was petrified when I got that call. It wasn’t just the thought of other people knowing what I had done; I also had to face myself, and that is a sick feeling – it is guilt, shame.”Andy had been watching and sharing images of children being sexually abused for several months before the police appeared at his door. He tried at first to keep it from his wife: “I was afraid she would ask me to leave. I wouldn’t have blamed her if she had.”When they got home, he told her his story: that a spiralling porn addiction had led him to ever darker places, chatrooms where people talked about sex and porn, and shared images and videos. “That was where someone sent me a picture of a child, in exchange for some porn I sent them.”I knew I had looked at lots of porn but I genuinely did not think there was anybody underage in thereUnlike Andy, Mark didn’t immediately realise why the police had come for him. “My then wife came in looking worried and said, ‘There are police at the door.’ We were living in a wealthy area, so I thought they were there about some recent burglaries. But then they told me they needed to speak to me alone. They said I was being arrested for having indecent images of children.”Mark claims he was shellshocked. “I knew I had looked at lots of porn but I genuinely did not think there was anybody underage in there. They said they had found 200 illegal images.” From the outside, Mark was a successful businessman, travelling regularly for work. His arrest was a public humiliation. “There were four of them, with body cameras on, in two cars. They told my boys, ‘Don’t worry, Daddy is just helping us out’ and put me in the back of one of the cars. In the picture the police took that day, I look suicidal.”In England and Wales,850 men a monthare arrested for online child abuse offences. They come from every walk of life: teachers, police officers, bus drivers, doctors. Those on the frontline are warning of another alarming trend: a significant shift towards younger offenders among those picked up for watching illegal material.The arrests are just one metric pointing towards a spiralling global crisis. Last year was the worst on record for instances of online child sexual abuse imagery, with the UK’sInternet Watch Foundationacting to remove content from 300,000 web pages,each containing at least one, if not hundreds or thousands, of illegal images and videos.Now, police, charities, lawyers and child protection experts are asking what is driving this tidal wave of offending, and finding one common thread: the explosion over the past 10 to 20 years of free-to-view and easily accessible online pornography. Material so violent it would have been considered highly extreme a generation ago is now readily available on iPads, desktops and the phones in teenagers’ pockets. A growing body of research is beginning to warn of how problematic porn habits can be a pathway into viewing images of children being abused.I have been writing about the online child abuse crisis for five years. Time and again I have heard warnings from those on the frontline that there is an unambiguous link between the two. Do the sites that profit from porn have questions to answer about this link? Can the connection be broken? And the big question: is the explosion of child abuse imagery online feeding a demand for this material, or creating one?The scale of the problem faced by the police was made clear to the public last year, when former BBC presenterHuw Edwards was given a suspended sentence, avoiding jail time, after being found guilty of accessing indecent photographs of children as young as seven. This highlighted the fact that most people –around eight out of 10– caught with images of children being sexually abused are not jailed. The National Crime Agency has called for more prison sentences, warning thatup to 830,000 adults in the UK, 1.6% of the population, pose a threat to children.View image in fullscreenFormer BBC news anchor Huw Edwards photographed after a hearing at Westminster magistrates court in London last year.Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty ImagesAndy was sent to prison for six months for watching and sharing images of child abuse. I spoke to him through theLeeds-based national agency Safer Lives, which works with men at every stage, from arrest to post-conviction counselling, to help them change their behaviour. Like many of the men they encounter, Andy argues that he has no intrinsic interest in children, but was led through a porn addiction to seek out ever more extreme images. “I am fully accountable,” Andy tells me on the phone. “None of this is an excuse. I look back at what I did with huge regret and shame. But I didn’t start out wanting to see kids. I was addicted to porn and I went down a road of being totally desensitised as I got further and further from what was normal.“I was using porn as a coping mechanism for all sorts of things – stress, loss, general life problems. When you masturbate to porn, you get an intense dopamine hit. Then those first videos start to become boring. Your brain starts to say, that’s not good enough. Soon you are watching rape fantasies – there are loads of categories like this on mainstream sites. Then it’s teenagers. The algorithms keep showing you more extreme stuff.”He argues that the mainstream porn sites encourage an interest in young girls. “They push the boundaries as much as they can, with content around young women dressed in school uniforms, for example; incest themes; old men paired with young women.”I ask where his own moral judgment was when watching videos of teenagers. “Yes, I could have wondered if those girls were really over 18. But you think, well, I’m on a site anyone can access, it’s legal. You can watch this on the bus, right? You are in an environment that is eroding your sense of responsibility.”As many offenders do, he moved to chatrooms where men shared images and videos from porn sites they liked. It was in this space, he says, that he was first sent a picture that was clearly of a child. “You know it’s wrong, but the dopamine hit from what you are doing overrides everything else. I think the pathways in my brain had been changed by all the porn I had watched.”Afterwards, he admits, “You feel sick and horrible. For years I didn’t talk about this. But now I want to stop other men continuing down the path I went down.”Mark has a similar story. He is open in saying his interest began with legal material of teen girls but says he was taken to images of children through hours of clicking on everything offered to him. “I have gone through about 40 sessions of counselling to try to understand why I ended up in a place where someone could knock on my door to arrest me. I was horrified and disgusted with myself, and I will be until the day I die.”Porn was a coping mechanism when he was away from his family, he says, and it quickly got out of control. “I worked abroad a lot and was bored and lonely. I was bringing up porn on my phone the moment I was travelling, watching it sometimes for five hours a day.My reaction should have been to turn off the computer when I was offered images of young girls. But you are in such a bizarre place … you are out of control“The police never found a single search for images of children: it was all from clicking through links – what the algorithms were offering me. Porn sites have a button that says ‘See more like this’. I was desensitised, I had looked at so much teen porn.”Mark was convicted of possessing images in categories A, B and C. The worst of these, A, involves the penetration of children under 18. “I understand now that my reaction should have been to turn off the computer when I was being offered images of young girls. But when you have been watching porn for three or four hours, you might have clicked 200 times. You are in such a bizarre place, your hormones are all over the place. You – your brain – are out of control.”As part of his counselling, Mark has written a letter to one of the young girls he watched, “not to send, but for therapy. She could, I suppose, have been 16 or 17. It was a long letter. I explained how I got to be there, I was hugely apologetic.”The idea that there is a path that for some people leads from legal porn to videos of children being abused is controversial. Many of the men being arrested for online child abuse offences pose a serious risk to children. But there is no doubt that the profile of offenders has changed in recent years.Michael Sheathworked with child abusers for more than 30 years and now advises police forces around Europe on offender profiling. When I speak to him, he has just returned from an Interpol conference on online child abuse. “I’ve been every year for 14 years and we have seen a shift over that time, from what we would call serious criminal paedophiles, the type who are organising the abuse of kids in the Philippines, and we still see those, to a huge number of lower-level offenders. It’s a huge burden on the police.”He is in no doubt that the change is linked to increasingly easy access to violent and extreme pornography. “I see men who have gone down what I call an ‘escalating pathway’. The link is unambiguous.”Sheath speaks powerfully about what he sees as a horrific impact of porn on societal taboos that have traditionally protected children. “The threshold for abusive behaviour is through the floor. It used to be that child abuse material was hard to find and looking at it was extremely risky. The mindset of someone searching for it would be ‘I am a total sex criminal’ - they knew they were leaving the norms of society.View image in fullscreenMichael Sheath, who has worked with child abusers for more than 30 years and advises police forces around Europe on offender profiling: ‘This is an experiment we are doing as a society and I think we can agree it’s going pretty badly.’Photograph: Sam Frost/The GuardianNow it is barely taboo to watch children being abused, and that is linked to porn. Look on a mainstream porn site and you’ll immediately see titles like ‘Auntie takes the boys’ virginity’ or ‘Stepdad and stepdaughter’. When I started working 30 years ago, that was really out-there outrageous, pervy and wrong. Now it’s seen as a laugh.”The videos he is referring to are legal content acted by adults, not hidden but watched by millions in the UK. “There is a slope and it is slippery, but that doesn’t mean men shouldn’t be held to account for being complicit in the abuse of the child.”Serious research is now being done into how this slippery slope works. In a groundbreaking two-yearproject, Finnish group Protect Children posted questionnaires on the dark web to reach people viewing illegal material in several countries, including the UK. They collected data from 4,549 anonymous child sexual abuse offenders. A third of respondents admitted that sexual interest in children was a key reason why they searched for child sexual abuse material. Nearly two-thirds reported a sexual interest in under-18s – mostly teens between 15 and 17. Heavy use of pornography is described as one of the “facilitating factors” that can play an important role in lowering the barrier to offending.More than 50%of those who admitted watching online child abuse said they were not seeking these images when they were first exposed to them. This did not mean they did not go on to search for violent and harmful images of children. The prevalence of this “accidental viewing” is underlined by the huge number of respondents – over two-thirds – who said they first saw child sexual abuse material when they were under 18. Of those, 40% were under 13.Along with other countries, the UK is bringing in tighter controls on the porn industry. Porn sites will be required to haveage verification processesin place by July to stop children viewing their content, a process that will be monitored by Ofcom under the newOnline Safety Act(OSA). But the OSA does not ban or control certain common practices in porn, such as strangulation, sexual fetishisation of incest or the abuse of children acted by adults. The government argues depiction of sexual strangulation is banned but a recentin-depth review of pornby Baroness Bertin, a Conservative peer, warned it is not, in reality, covered by case law. She called for tighter regulation of “legal but harmful pornography like choking, violent and degrading acts … even content that could encourage child sexual abuse”. While headlines picked out the call to ban strangulation, Bertin also demanded clearer rules around “incest, step-incest and ‘teen’ porn”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

In 2021, research professor Dr Fiona Vera-Gray and others atDurham University found thatone in every eight titles on the front pages of the most popular porn sites showed sexual violence against women and girls. They also found that videos tagged as “teen” were more likely to be linked to violence.In January, Pornhub’s owners, private equity firm Ethical Capital Partners (ECP), arrived in London from the US and Canada to lobby against the UK’s implementation of age verification. Sarah Bain, vice-president of public engagement for ECP, and Alexzandra Kekesi of Pornhub pushed for “device-based” age blocks instead of “site-based” checks – ie the phone would block underage users, not the website.Bain and Kekesi insist that Pornhub is an industry leader in ensuring content does not “cross the line” into abusive themes. They say they carefully monitor content to ensure all performers are over 18. “We have very strict protocols for the type of content that could potentially be harmful,” Bain says. She refers to the “constantly evolving” list Pornhub says it has of 34,000 banned words. “This would prevent anyone uploading content with these words, or commenting under a video with these words. We have banned terms that are legal. We make a decision not to monetise content on those themes. This is not always popular with content creators, but we are willing to be out there, modelling to other folks in the porn industry that you can be an ethical business.” They also argued that some fantasy themes can be “empowering” for those engaged in safe and consensual BDSM.In 2021, the anti-trafficking organisationCeasepublished a reportthat listed some of Pornhub’s banned terms next to words that are still allowed, to highlight what it says is a continuing presence of highly violent content themed around the abuse of children and teenagers. The word “rape” is banned, but permitted terms include “dazed”, “broken”, “degraded”, and interactions based on power abuses are common (“stepdad and stepdaughter”, where the stepdaughter might be “scared or trapped”). The word “incest” is blocked, yet permitted terms include “daddy and daughter, grandpa and granddaughter”. Words relating to “teen” (over 18) and “smallness” are common.Pornhub’s ownguidelinesstate: “We … prohibit content, including fictional, simulated, or animated, that features or depicts ... nonconsensual sexual activity, including coerced or forced sexual acts, rape, or sexual assault.”Pornhub says there are subtleties to certain words that they address through moderation. A spokesman said: “Some of the examples you listed that are not banned require context to understand. ‘Broken’, for example, has many different uses that would be perfectly within our terms of service. That’s why it’s so important that all content uploaded also undergoes our industry-leading trust and safety process as well.Just because a video uses the word ‘father’, or ‘daddy’, or any other word like that, does not mean the person featured is a relative of their co-performer“Even terms that are not banned on our platforms may be flagged by our internal system. Words like ‘daughter’ or ‘degraded’ or ‘scared’ are all flagged specifically to moderators and given higher scrutiny for contextual assessment.Just because a video uses the word ‘father’, or ‘dad’, or ‘daddy’, or any other word like that, does not mean the person featured is a relative of their co-performer. [There] are a number of scenarios where a person may be called ‘daddy’, or another title like that, that are certainly not incestuous.“Just because a word could, in certain contexts, be used in an abusive way, that does not mean that by ‘not banning it’, we are allowing content that violates our guidelines.”The company has also partnered with the UK’s Internet Watch Foundation and anti-child abuse charityLucy Faithfull Foundationtoadd warnings that pop upwhen users appear to be searching for child abuse content.Underlying all this is the question of whether porn can be seen as addictive in the way Mark and Andy describe. Unlike other behavioural addictions, such as gambling and gaming, pornography addiction is not included in theInternational Classification of Diseases, compiled by the World Health Organization. It is instead defined as a compulsive sexual behaviour.For at least a decade, mental health experts have warned that the release of the pleasure chemical dopamine during porn viewing means itimpacts the brainin the same way as addictive substances such as drugs.In 2013, the psychiatrist Norman Doidge warned, “The brain is ‘neuroplastic’ and not only can it change, but it works by changing in response to repeated mental experiences.” He describes how dopamine is released as we accomplish goals, so we gain the thrill that encourages us to do it again. “Dopamine is secreted at moments of sexual excitement and novelty. Porn scenes, filled with novel sexual ‘partners’, fire the reward centre. The images get reinforced, altering the users’ sexual tastes.”Last month,the Lucy Faithfull Foundation found thata fifth of adults reported their pornography viewing becoming gradually more extreme. Pornhub denies this is its intention and says users may “discover” new interests on porn sites but that they are not being deliberately pushed to extreme material.A Pornhub spokesman told the Guardian: “Our understanding … is that many of the studies that suggest that porn is harmful to society are methodologically flawed and/or ideologically biased. Most research finds more neutral or ambiguous results, and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders does not recognise porn addiction as a valid diagnosis.”What is clear is that problematic use is rising – including among young people. At the Lucy Faithfull Foundation, their clients are getting younger, so much so that in 2023 they launched aspecialist service for teenagers. DCI Tony Garner leads a team of online child abuse officers in Worcester. They carry out “the knock” three or four times a week and are increasingly finding teenagers behind the door. “We are seeing people who are turning 18 and have had 10 years’ exposure to hardcore porn. My officers are finding young people watching the most abhorrent material, including child abuse.” He is clear that the police cannot deal with this on their own. “As a country, as a society, it feels completely out of control.”A lot of my clients now are parents who have called me because their child has been arrestedMarcus Johnstone of PCD solicitors specialises in defending sex offenders. He says he represents “people of every age, from every background. Most of them have children, many are very intelligent. They are looking at or requesting and selling images and videos. Or they are chatting to children on gaming sites and apps. I often wonder if parents know how many of the people their kids are gaming with online are people like my clients.”But, like Garner, he is seeing an increasing trend towards younger offenders – often in their mid- or even early teens. “A lot of my clients now are parents who have called me because their child has been arrested. This is generation porn. They may have been looking for videos of teens their own age. Or they may have been talking to predatory adults online who shared material with them.”Johnstone mentions the case of a young teen who wanted to see videos of teens his own age, “but these are category A images, which is a serious crime with a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. The law is turning these young people into criminals at an alarming rate. I have seen young people banned from being in the same house as their younger siblings.”Sheath says his decades working with offenders has made him incredibly concerned about the way children are growing up with access to porn. “This is an experiment we are doing as a society and I think we can agree it’s going pretty badly. Before the smartphone, most people’s first experience of sex was with a living person and that included resistance, pushback, romance. Now young people are growing up with unfettered access to porn, and porn norms are not about consent. They are about ‘strangle the bitch’, ‘have sex with your stepmum’. It’s shaping their erotic templates.”Pornhub and ECP argue forcefully that they do not want children on their sites. “It’s shocking that we have to say this,” Bain says. “We want age verification. But the way we are seeing it approached – it’s not effective. They are targeting individual platforms. Louisiana, the first US state to implement this form of age verification, lost 80% of visitors to the site when they met the age check. Now, these people are not giving up on porn. They will go to other sites with no barrier.”In most US states, Pornhub has opted to shut down its site rather than comply with age checks. It won’t be drawn on whether it will do the same in the UK – its fifth largest global market – if asked to age-block its sites from July. Kekesi says only, “We will obey the law.”In the coming weeks, yet more men will wake up to a knock on the door and find the police outside. More images of children being abused will be taken and sent spiralling around the internet. Mark hopes some men might take a step back before it happens to them. At one point, he was prevented from being alone with his children but now he has unsupervised access again. His marriage ended and he began dating. He faced the difficult decision of how to tell his new girlfriend about his offences. “She was very kind, she let me talk. The natural reaction would be: urgh, you’re a paedophile. It’s worse than murdering someone. But I’m not a paedophile, I was just an idiot.”He believes men have an urgent role to play in supporting the men around them. “There are pressures on men in modern life, and porn is one of the outlets people seek. But it can lead you down a dark path. I’m more observant now of other men’s mental health. I work in a tough industry but I ask men I know, ‘Are you OK?’”Andy says he has learned he has an addictive personality. “You own your actions as an offender. You have to. But porn was what I went to when I had broken relationships, stress at work; porn made me feel better. And the hit is stronger if you know what you are doing is not legal or not right.”The knock that tears families apart: ‘They were at the door, telling me he had accessed indecent images of children’Read moreLike many offenders, he says he is glad he was caught. “Without the arrest, I don’t think I could have just stopped. Think about alcohol, gambling – you don’t just suddenly stop. You have to go to AA, you have to do the work. I’ve had help now and I realise how awful it is. These are real children.” He adds, “I’ve done courses with Safer Lives, with the Lucy Faithfull Foundation. I’ve got apps on my phone including one that links everything I do online to my wife as my accountability partner. I see a therapist once a month.”Jenny Greensmithis one of the lead practioners at Safer Lives working with men like Andy and Mark. She has a background as a probation officer specialising in sexual offending and has sat through countless hours of conversations with offenders. “What I’m concerned about is oversimplifying this problem,” she says. “We don’t want to remove personal responsibility or suggest porn is always a gateway to harmful behaviour. But we want men to seek help; it won’t help if we regard them as perverts. I meet a lot of men who are not able to recognise their feelings, let alone manage them. The internet is an easy way to switch off from emotions.”She is acutely aware of the real children hidden behind the words “category A, B and C”, particularly the teens whose videos the men say are easily confused with legal porn. “The CPS will often mention if pre-teen or young children are in the category A images because it’s an aggravating factor for sentencing. But it sometimes feels like an arbitrary line that diminishes the harm caused to people over 13 of having their most vulnerable experiences shared to millions online.”Whatever offences the men have carried out, she stresses that dismissing them as beyond help can have serious consequences. “I understand some people will feel that is all they deserve, but I disagree. I am also acutely aware they often have children and families who will be destroyed by this.”She would really like to reach people before they hear the knock at the door. “Men often tell us, ‘I wish I had known you were here earlier, I wanted to stop.’”If you or someone you know is worried about child sexual abuse, the confidential and anonymous Stop It Now helpline is available at 0808 1000 900, or you can use their live chat or secure email;stopitnow.org.uk.

It must be guided more by its progressive values rather than political expediencySat 5 Apr 2025 14.30 EDTLast modified on Sat 5 Apr 2025 16.28 EDTShareThe market reaction to Donald Trump’s announcement last Wednesday that he would be levying punitive tariffs on imports from the rest of the world was immediate: US stock markets experienced theirworst single-day decline since Covid. The long-term implications will depend on how permanent Trump’s reshaping of the global economic order turns out to be. At the moment, his administration is sending contradictory signals as to whether these tariffs are here to stay, or whether they are intended to be used to in effect blackmail other countries into doing the bidding of the US. But the global recession they could trigger raises huge strategic headaches for a British government already struggling to square the fiscal circle and deliver its pledge to boost growth.There is no logic to Trump’s trade populism: contrary to his claims, the US has done immensely well out of being the dominant economy in the global free trade system of recent decades. If Trump doesn’t change course quickly, his act of economic self-sabotage will reverberate around the world, harming not just Americans, but triggering increasing poverty in America’s poorer trading partners, generating even more of the global instability that has become synonymous with Trump’s presidency.In the UK, much of the focus is on whetherKeir Starmerwill be able to negotiate a trade deal that reduces or even eliminates the 10% tariffs imposed on British exports to the US. While this goal is entirely legitimate, it comes with some nasty traps. Trump is unpredictable and self-interested when it comes to negotiations. That the UK has escaped relatively lightly compared with the EU, which faces 20% tariffs, or China, with 34%, is likely to be because of the formula Trump used to calculate tariffs, as opposed to any diplomatic strategy from the British government. The US has a trading surplus in goods with the UK, which accounts for the minimum baseline tariff being applied.The direct impact of these tariffs, given our relatively limited volume of exports to the US compared with a closer market like the EU, will be painful for those exporters it affects hardest, but more manageable for the UK as a whole compared to some other countries. The biggest risk is a more macro one: first, that British producers will face competition from the UK being flooded with cheaper imports that would have been once been destined from the US, and second, that the global recession and ongoing trade war could trigger what would inevitably have ahuge knock-on impacton British economic growth.There is no logic to Trump’s trade populism: the US has done well out of the global free trade systemThere is a risk that theTrump administrationwill make unsustainable or intolerable demands of the UK – such as lowering our regulatory standards, or lifting VAT on American imports – in exchange for a deal that might offer us little protection from the broader effects of a trade war. Such a deal could make it harder for us to do business with the EU, with whom we trade in far greater volume than with the US. Ministers cannot have too much riding on a potential deal with the US.The bigger global consequences of a trade war – which no trade deal with the US can protect us from, even if one were to be forthcoming – raise two urgent questions for the government. The first is what it can do to reset our trading relationship with the EU, which remains our biggest and closest trading partner – that is more aligned with our regulatory standards. A stronger relationship with the EU will provide more economic resilience than a trade deal with the US and should be a priority.The government has taken important steps to align with EU regulations through theProduct Regulation and Metrology Bill, but there is no substitute for rejoining the customs union and single market in terms of eliminating trade barriers, and ministers should be working to achieve this as a longer term goal. An EU reset and a trade deal with the US may, or may not, be achievable at once: if there is a trade off between the two, economic good sense dictates that Starmer should look east to our more reliable European allies than across the Atlantic to Trump.The second problem is what a global recession means for the chancellor’s fiscal arithmetic. Labour’s strategy to transform the country is entirely contingent on economic growth – promised during the election to revitalise the economy and generate the tax revenues needed to reduce rising rates of child poverty and improve Britain’s creaking public services and infrastructure.But with the UK’s growth forecast slashed in the weeks before Trump’s tariff announcement, Rachel Reeves faced a choice between cutting spending, raising taxes or relaxing her fiscal rules to allow her to borrow more.She decided to cut disability benefitsby several billion, a move that will only serve to increase disability and child poverty, instead of opting for alternative solutions that would have shared the burden more fairly, such as freezing income tax and national insurance thresholds for two years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Starmer’s pledge to transform Britain’s growth prospects withinfive years was never realistic but Trump’s election has made a set of infelicitous circumstances far worse. We are living through a new age of sharp global insecurity characterised by damaging economic shocks and increasing levels of war and conflict. Starmer faces the greatest test of his premiership so far.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionTrump tariffsDonald TrumpKeir StarmerInternational tradePovertyEuropean UnioncommentShareReuse this content"

Better now than laterPhillip InmanThere is already arguably too little flexibility in the chancellor’s budget plan. Trump’s tariffs chaos makes a rethink inevitableSat 5 Apr 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 5 Apr 2025 10.57 EDTShareCritics ofRachel Reevesare enjoying another “told you so” moment. It was never realistic, they say, to formulate a budget plan with virtually no leeway to accommodate for unforeseen events.Less than £10bn of headroom on a budget of £1.2tn was asking for trouble. It is clear there are just too many events that could be put on a list of “known unknowns” for a UK chancellor to almost wilfully wish away their potential impact on the economy and the public finances.One of those was the prospect of Donald Trump winning the US presidency and, once installed in the White House, pulling every lever at his disposal to create the uncertainty, if not chaos, he believes gives the US supreme bargaining power over whatever issue he wants to tackle. Theglobal tariff warunleashed by the mobster-like president last week is a case in point.At last month’sspring statement, Reeves rejected another opportunity to inject more flexibility into her budget rules to accommodate the almost inevitable swings in economic forecasts that, in turn, affect the public finances.TheOffice for Budget Responsibility(OBR), the body that produces independent forecasts for the Treasury, has shown in charts how Reeves is one of the worst offenders since the OBR was created in 2010.Previous chancellors have tended to leave themselves a bigger buffer to absorb changes to the forecasts. The implication is that they offered more certainty about the direction of travel.What the OBR’s analysis must ignore, though, is the political imperative behind maintaining a significant buffer in the public finances and why the largest can be traced to George Osborne’s time as chancellor.Osborne’s agenda was to reduce the size of the state. It meant that a buffer of about £30bn was part of the overall austerity message.Any chancellor who wants to energise government to boost economic growth, as Reeves wants to do, is going to find it difficult to leave tens of billions of pounds unspent, sitting in a reserve fund, just to accommodate a budget rule, albeit one that is self-imposed.View image in fullscreenDespite the UK only being hit with 10% tariffs by Donald Trump, its economic prospects will suffer from a wider global trade war.Photograph: Carlos Barría/ReutersThat leaves the UK in an unenviable situation. Unless the budget rule is ditched, the situation will persist. There is already speculation that the autumn budget willneed to raise taxes againto cope with the fallout from Trump’s tariff regime. A10% tariffmight have left the UK relatively unscathed compared with the EU’s 20%, but Trump’s trade war will hit global growth and, with it, the UK’s economic outlook.A downgrade to the prospects of growth over the next few years will reduce tax receipts and government income.On the plus side, a slowdown in the world economy means the Bank of England will want to cut interest rates at a faster pace – or at least it ought to. And international investors will lend to governments at a cheaper rate.A decline in borrowing costs will be a boon for Reeves, who inherited a debt-to-GDP ratio of close of 96%, and little room for manoeuvre after the Liz Truss debacle.How these cross-currents affect the budget deficit is not clear. Lower growth will increase the deficit, while cheaper debt will reduce it.Even if the result is a positive number, it leaves businesses to wonder whether there will be higher taxes or not. And what we know about business sentiment is that it is very sensitive to the government’s tax and spending plans.Most business people don’t like to take risks, whatever they say in public. They want the reassurance of solid government backing for projects that enhance growth.What are Rachel Reeves’s fiscal rules and could they be changed?Read moreInvestment decisions often take at least five years before they make a return, during which time businesses will want a settled economic outlook. The UK can look back on a disastrous decade of low business investment largely because Tory infighting overBrexitmeant the direction of travel was a subject of constant debate.What can Reeves do? She needs to end the speculation – and soon. Waiting for the next budget creates another six months’ more uncertainty. It also ties the summer spending review to austerity-lite spending limits. If the need to protect welfare payments and for higher defence spending was not enough to justify rewriting the budget rules before the spring statement, surely Trump’s tariffs provide the green light now.Loosening the deficit rule would allow the government to protect businesses from the worst of the downturn and intervene in industries that are essential to the UK’s independence, such as steel. Cuts to police numbers could be avoided and cash-starved bodies, such as further education colleges, could be given a new lease of life.Otherwise, there is the prospect of perpetual debate about what more pain each budget will bring, killing consumer and business confidence and the growth the UK desperately needs.Explore more on these topicsEconomicsThe ObserverRachel ReevesTax and spendingSpring statement 2025Autumn budget 2024Office for Budget ResponsibilityTrump tariffscommentShareReuse this content"

I don’t have any direct evidence of this conspiracy to rob us of the pleasure of the open road, other than the cacophony of beeps, blips, bloops and blops that greet us in the latest models. Oh, and the screens. Every year, they try to find a new place to glue a touchscreen in a car, like Pizza Hut hunting for more orifices to stuff cheese into one of their pies.Everything is computerized, automated or impossible to turn off. According to surveys of new-car buyers by the market research firm Strategic Vision, satisfaction with car controlsplummeted by 23 percentage pointsin the last nine years. The whiz-bang gizmos foisted on the North American car buyer have devolved from the glorious, life-saving back-up camera to gesture controls that allow you to turn an invisible knob to crank up the volume onEspressowithout touching a single thing in your vehicle.Elon Musk could be the Democrats’ best hope | Moira DoneganRead moreBack in January of this year, BMWditched gesture controlin their cars after a decade-long run of forcing adults to poke and prod the air like a mime drunk on cheap wine. Gesture control was cheaper for the automaker because they could cut back on making actual knobs, plus it’s just funnier to watch while stuck in traffic.Here’s what you had to dotomake your car work, according to the company:Turn the volume up: circle your finger in a clockwise direction.Turn the volume down: circle your finger in a counter-clockwise direction.Accept a call: point to the BMW iDrive touchscreen.Select navigation/custom setting: use two fingers to point to the touchscreen.Change rearview camera angle: draw a circle using your forefinger and thumb.Regret your life choices: look in the mirror for 10 seconds.When do I have time to learn this? You want me to draw a circle with not just one, buttwoof my fingers? What do I do if I lost a digit in a particularly gruesome lathe accident? Drive an Audi, that’s what.If carmakers aren’t trying to ruin driving, then I’m pretty sure they’re just bored. After decades of the industry claiming an electric car wasn’t commercially viable, the Toyota Prius came along and realigned our expectations of what could be under the hood of a car. The hybrid engine – part gas, part electric – was the first baby step toward the fleets of all-electric vehicles from Chevrolet, Volkswagen and that one used car you are desperately trying to sell butno one would dare drive in it any more.In an effort to solve problems that don’t exist, carmakers are creating more problemsCar companies have solved the greatest problem in the history of automobiles: that these vehicles emitactual poisonwhenever you operate them. So the ennui has set in: “And Alexander wept, seeing as he had no more worlds to conquer.” Yes, but what if Alexander could remove some knobs from the console of your Mini Cooper? Perhaps aretractable door handlethat you constantly have to be reminded how to use? Hey Alexander, quit weeping andstart playing Cat Quest in your car.The Volkswagen ID.4 electric car was designed withelectronic sensors inside the door handles. VW alleged that this helped with “drag reduction”: the handles were flush with the car, making it less wind resistant, or something. This “innovation” barely registered with me. The only drag I care about is banned in Tennessee. Of course, the ID.4 went through a massive recall because water was getting into the door handle sensors and corroding the electronics. Also, drivers reported the doors would open on their ownwhile the car was in motion. At last, I can do a barrel-roll out of my car,hands-free.In an effort to solve problems that don’t exist, carmakers are creating more problems. Ambient lighting to make your car look like an airport lounge. Touchscreens in the passenger seats. Cameras so you canwatch your child pick their noseinstead of looking at the road. Driving is frequently a frustrating pursuit as it is. You have road hazards, aggressive drivers and gridlock to contend with.But, the auto industry says,what if it was worse?I guess that’s why Elon Musk, the world’s least popular car company owner, got into politics. It’s yet another endeavor we all have to suffer through that’s pretty bad, but could be significantly more painful with just a bit of tinkering. Firing countless government workers, gutting entire departments and withholdinglegally appropriated fundsisn’t too far from looking at a car and saying: “What if the door had no handles?”Cars and governments are necessities of modern life. They are because we, the people, designed life to need them. We are hopelessly intertwined with the car, with democracy, with a massive, heaving bureaucracy that does annoying stuff like ensuring we don’t alldie of plagueand our food isn’triddled with rat droppings. To Musk, getting rid of vital government services is just like replacing your air conditioner with an entire video game system.A fun thought experiment! What if you had to solve a series of increasingly complex word games in order to unlock your car? Would you just give up and walk to work?I’m old enough to remember when things got better, not worse. Televisions got bigger, cars became more efficient, movie special effects dazzled us andPizza Hut was still discovering new places to put cheese. Someone decided to put a water dispenser on a refrigerator door and we all rejoiced. Now, technology is solving for issues that don’t exist. AI has finally fixed the problem of …summarizing emails that are a couple paragraphs. Praise the Lord, technology has rid us of the scourge of reading comprehension. And, as an added bonus, now I can turn a photo of myself into aSimpsons character. I can die fulfilled.I contend that things do not have to be worse. In fact, allow me to be so bold as to suggest they could bebetter. When the president of the United States says he “couldn’t care less” if foreign automakers jacked up their prices because of his tariffs, he is saying very plainly that things must be worse for some reason. If we just allow the knobs to be taken out of our cars that now cost twice what they used to, some vague good thing will happen. We’ll be happier. We’ll be richer. We’ll have fewer knob-related injuries, I suppose. Imagine telling someone that you’re about to do a thing that will deeply inconvenience them and then expecting them to be thrilled about it. America used to be a place to value convenience above all else. Today, it feels like what we actually expect is to be harassed, put out and given a screen in our face to shut us up.Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsTechnologyOpinionAutomotive industryElon MuskcommentShareReuse this content"

But the president’s instrument of revenge – massive tariffs – is going to do serious damage to the US and global economies. Stock market investors are convinced that’s the case, with Wall Street and world stock markets losing trillions of dollars in value in recent days as a result of Trump’s obsession.The president has escalated his risky, vengeful trade war even though the US economy was in strong shape when he took office – the jobless rate was just 4.1%, inflation was below 3% and US economic growth was the strongest in the industrial world, with its stock market at record levels. So it’s unclear whether the US economy needed the shock treatment that Trump is inflicting. The price increases resulting from his tariffs – which are a tax on imports – will cost the average American family$3,800 a year, according to the Budget Lab at Yale.Are Trump’s tariffs for real or an AI hallucination? I’m afraid the answer is both | Marina HydeRead moreTrump is right that the number of manufacturing jobs is down substantially from decades ago, and he is intent on getting that number back up. But he’s taking a very high-stakes bet that he can significantly increase the number of factory jobs, even as many economists say the horses have left that barn, and it is too late or will be too painful to do much about it. In 1979, the US had a record 19.5m factory jobs. That number fell to17m in 2001 and to 12.7m today(having risen by 600,000 during Joe Biden’s presidency).Trump’s new tariffs result from a combination of impulsiveness, impetuousness and ignorance, although some economists say that idiocy and economic illiteracy also play a big part. Paul Krugman says that Trump’s tariffs reflect the“whims of a mad king”, adding that the administration’s case for tariffs is “completely incoherent”, as it insists that the tariffs won’t raise prices but will still raise hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue.The tariffsthat Trump announced on Thursday are staggering – 50% on tiny Lesotho, 49% on Cambodia, 46% on Vietnam, 34% on China, 32% on Taiwan, 24% on Japan and 20% on European Union countries. These percentages were arrived at not by careful, probing analysis that took months, but by someslapdash, Keystone Kops math.It would be generous to say it’s the one-eyed leading the blind. Rather, it’s an economically blind, impetuous president leading a mum, intimidated Republican-controlled Congress. One of the tragedies here is that many congressional Republicans see the grievous damage Trump is doing, but they’re too craven to speak out and risk Trump’s andElon Musk’s social media wrath.Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, is predicting disaster. He says that as a result of Trump’s tariffsa recession “will hit imminentlyand extend until next year”. Zandi says that economic growth could fall by 2 percentage points, while the jobless rate could leap to a very painful 7.5%. On Friday, the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, also sounded the alarm, saying that Trump’s tariffs could causeeven slower economic growthand higher inflation than originally expected.The tariffs are bad, but Britain should remember this: Trump will be gone in four years | Simon JenkinsRead moreWith Trump’s 50% tariff rate on Lesotho, 46% on Vietnam and 37% on Bangladesh, those countries – with their export-dependent apparel industries – will suffer terribly. There will be huge layoffs and no doubt an increase in hunger and immiseration – just as Trump-Musk’s tremendous foreign aid cuts at USAID have already resulted inincreased hunger and deaths. And one has to wonder: by pummeling poor, apparel-producing countries such as Lesotho, Cambodia, Vietnam and Bangladesh, what is Trump trying to achieve? Does he want to bring back to the US low-paying, garment-industry jobs making jeans and sneakers?Carefully crafted tariffs can be helpful. They can be used to help build important industries or prevent the wholesale destruction of industries due to other countries’ bad behavior, like China’s improperly subsidizing its industries or dumping goods on the world market far below the cost of production. Unfortunately, Trump’s so-called “liberation day” tariffs are not a scalpel designed to help specific industries, but rather a blunderbuss mess, hitting everyone and everything, including US consumers and industries. Let’s not forget that the tariffs will raise costs at many US manufacturers and make them less competitive by, for instance, greatly increasing the price ofimported steelandauto parts.The tariffs that Trump is imposing are even greater than the infamous Smoot-Hawley tariffs, which are widely seen as having worsened the Great Depression. Krugman noted that Trump’s tariffs could also do serious damagebecause “imports as a share of the [US] economyare three times what they were in the 1920s”.Even if Trump’s tariffs were to do what he hopes – create another million or two factory jobs – the cost would be immense. A recession. Millions of families hurt by higher prices. Trillions and trillions in lost stock market value. Far worse relations with our close allies and other countries. Opening the door to Trump’s adversary, China, significantly improving its trade and economic relations with other countries. Plus, a severe economic shock to many poorer nations.And it’s not at all certain that Trump’s tariffs will create a million or more manufacturing jobs: US economic growth and jobs will be hurt by a possible tariff-induced recession, trade retaliation from other countries, a long-term loss of markets as traditional trading partners turn away from the US, and a possible long-term decline in US industrial competitiveness as tariff protections enable inefficient companies to succeed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

They’re not blind to how capricious and unpredictable Trump is, and they know that he loves to play master dealmaker and win concessions from other countries and then immediately slash their tariffs. Trump’s team says these tariffs will be here for the long haul, but can corporate CEOs count on those claims when they’re deciding to spend $400m on a new factory?The Guardian view on Trump’s tariffs: a monstrous and momentous act of folly | EditorialRead moreIn announcing his huge new tariffs last Thursday, Trump proclaimed: “April 2, 2025 will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America’s destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make America wealthy again.” As usual, Trump failed to note some extremely important things.Although he won’t admit it, the US is already very wealthy. If he were truly serious about fixing the economy and making it fairer, he wouldn’t be rushing to give massivetax cutsto the ultra-rich andsparking fearsof vast cuts Medicaid and food stamps that struggling American families rely on.What Trump and his team will never admit is that 2 April 2025 may for ever be remembered as the day theUS economytook a grievous, Trump-induced tumble toward recession and higher prices. And not that Trump cares, but 2 April 2025 may also be remembered overseas for creating tremendous pain for struggling workers from Bangladesh to Lesotho to Honduras.Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author focusing on labor and the workplace, as well as economic and legal issuesExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionTariffsUS politicsDonald TrumpUS economyEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

As tariffs kick in, how can we adjust to not having a great superpower as our protector?Sat 5 Apr 2025 16.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 5 Apr 2025 21.59 EDTShareProf Hugh White, the esteemed yet critical analyst of Australian defence policy, took a deep breath, surveyed the men he had spent a lifetime debating, and said: “Donald Trump is doing us a favour.” He is proving that our old assumptions are “all wrong”.White knew this was a provocation, but maybe one whose time had come. Malcolm Turnbull agreed that this was a debate we needed to have. As the shopping list election campaign sidesteps the changed world order, the 29th prime minister used his convening power tohost a forumat the press club about the bigger underlying issues.‘There are no winners’: global companies respond to Trump tariffsRead moreThe room was full of men, most greyer than in their last official photographs – retired ministers, ambassadors, diplomats, generals, departmental heads, professors – and a smattering of younger analysts, businessmen, politicians – and even a few women.Most resumed their old positions, armed with memories of a time when Australia had a more independent foreign policy, put Asia first and occasionally said no to America. They recognised that, over the past decade, policies shaped in response to the 500kg Chinese panda in the room had drawn Australia closer than ever to America, a willing deputy sheriff with money, land, people and ports to share. There was widespread agreement that this needed to be recalibrated as the American eagle unlocks its talons and hovers overhead.For years, White has been arguing that the assumptions that the United States would long be the dominant global power, lead in Asia and be guaranteed to come to Australia’s defence needed to be challenged.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsNow with a man in the White House who promises to punish friends and foes who he wrongly claims have “looted, pillaged, raped and plundered” the greatest power on Earth, the once unthinkable is edging towards the new normal.Donald Trump understands that the cold war mindset is irrelevant, White said. The new world order will be very different. America will make decisions based on a narrow assessment of self-interest, as the tariffs announced on “liberation day” demonstrate. Or as aformer Trump staffer once quipped: “Globalism means to sacrifice the nation to save the empire. ‘America first’ means to sacrifice the empire to save the nation.”Security analyst Dr Heather Smith took it astep further and coolly declared: “The fragmentation of the international economic system is now a fact. The post-cold war order isn’t collapsing, it has collapsed. The US is dismantling the foundations of its global hegemony, along with the norms and values that have underpinned the US-Australia relationship. And this dismantling cannot be reversed by a change of administration … To say that Australia is not well positioned is an understatement. It’s a dog-eat-dog world. But our political and some of our bureaucratic class are largely admiring the problem. So the biggest challenge to overcome is the inability of our political class to position Australia for this new world.”White’s protege Sam Roggeveen, the Lowy Institute analyst and author of The Echidna Strategy, argued that recalibrating the relationship needed to be done “not out of spite, animus or nationalism, but because we must and can”.But how to recalibrate a relationship that, on balance, has been productive for 80 years? Geopolitics does not lend itself to easy memes and soundbites. As even the reliably lacklustre defence minister, Richard Marles, said in 2023: “Defence capability is a key factor in sovereignty. It does not define sovereignty.”The topic of Turnbull’s seminar was sovereignty and security, but the shortcomings of Aukus gobbled the agenda. Turnbull is fuelled by righteous outrage, but is not the only former prime minister who thinks that agreement is not in Australia’s interests. Not only because of the cost, or because a US president reserves the right not to provide the Virginia-class submarines, or because the massive upgrade of Australian defence facilities to better host the American military may create new targets, or because the defence budget is skewed by it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

But that seems unlikely.As Dennis Richardson, one of the most eminent retireesin the room, said: “It depends upon … our preparedness to pursue it as a national enterprise, not as a defence project.”Spending more on defence first demands a more expansive conversation about what sort of nation Australia wants to be; about non-negotiable values; about how the economy can be diversified and made more productive; how social supports can better protect all; about how climate change and AI will change the world; about our comparative advantages in a world very different to the one that began the century.What does our sovereignty mean? How do we exercise and protect it? How for the first time since 1788 can we adjust to not having a great superpower as our protector?Sometime after 9/11 we stopped debating these questions.

The “manfluencer” in question, Ashton Hall, spends the rest of his day dunking his face in ice water, rubbing banana peel on his skin and chugging down “Saratoga Water”. This is apparently the modern western definition of hardcore masculinity.Friends, maybe – just maybe – we should restart that conversation about western manhood because if it involves banana peel, you are not demonstrating what it means to be a human adult; you are culturally appropriating a clown.Hall has nearly 11 million followers on Instagram. We had a good run as a species for a while, didn’t we? Although it is slightly embarrassing we had less time on Earth than a bunch of giant lizards that never even invented the internet.I’m so old that I remember when the definition of masculinity was taking responsibility for yourself and others around you. Chainsaw-wielding billionaires like Elon Musk and his president-of-somewhere sidekick, Donald, are most insistent on their role as champions of Western Civilisation™, so I wondered how they missed the instruction that one should “not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment”. These are the words of the Apostle Paul in the Bible, so I guess the source is pretty niche.Adolescence: what teen boys really think of girls, influencers and porn – podcastRead moreHow great that Maga identities have Project 2025 to explain to them the gender roles they’re so rigorously policing. Should we be concerned that the campaign to politically erase trans people – so en vogue both in America and among America’s political lemmings in the Australian right – is a symptom of their endgame of reducing “men” and “women” to binary 1950s stereotypes that didn’t even reflect the reality of their time?Yes. Obviously, my brain works different because I was raised a girl; studies suggest I am thereforemore likelyto be burdened with evidence-based research and scholarship. That’s how you discover that before the postwar baby boom, a consistent 20% of western women livedchild free, and – even during the boom, in the 50s – 47% of married American women alsoheld down jobs.As a feminist, I yearn for those ancient sunny days of … 2019, when we merely worried that young men were consuming so much misogynist porntheir junk had stopped working. I miss being concerned that Tucker Carlson was influencing mento shove their dicks in a toaster– three years and at least three Andrew-Tate-rape-allegations ago.Tate is a manfluencer who once had nearly 5 million Instagram followers himself before achieving the unimaginable and actually getting kicked off the platform for hate speech. The former professional kickboxer denies all allegations of violence that have brought him legal trouble. “All of it is a lie,” he said of an ex-girlfriendwho accused him this week of choking and beating her.He doesn’t deny calling women “a man’s property”, of course. Or claiming girls are out to “steal [men’s] power” – that’s in his book “The Tate Bible II: The New Testament”. Stick that up your apostle, Paul. Confronted with similar proselytised woman-hating in the classroom, Australia “risks losing a generation of school leaders without urgent reforms”,a world-leading educational psychologist said this week, in a story about primary school principals referred to as “bitch dogs”, slut-shamed and threatened with having their throats slit.‘Teachers are describing something different’: the escalating culture of misogyny in Australian classrooms | Jess HillRead moreOne can stay in a comforting bubble of ignorance, or instead choose to read newspapers, watch the critically acclaimed TV drama series Adolescence, or – God help you – pretend to be a feminist on Elon’s bespoke propaganda channel X for five entire minutes to see the extent of the problem. To explain it, you could consider that inthe monetised attention economyof the internet, extremity is incentivised, that grifters gonna grift anda lot of money from rightwing gender-binary fantasistshas been funding this hot, hateful garbage for years.You could also claim that a generation of gen-X men who are now parents have, perhaps, abrogated conversations about manhood and sexuality they might feel cringe or squeamish about having to an online cult of male toxic nutjobs more than eager to instruct their sons for them. It’s extraordinary that the heterosexual western gen-X men who reaped the economic rewards of dual incomes and planned parenthoods, the pleasure of liberated sexuality and the instant social status gain of knowing how to bring a woman to orgasm – to actual orgasm, not the mimicking of poses and sounds from porn girls have been culturally coerced to watch – would not share these insights with the generations that follow them.The popularity ofAdolescencehas provided an icebreaker for these conversations, but having them is not a responsibility women can shoulder towards boys who’ve already been convinced that we’re “bitch dogs” by the time they go to freakin’ primary school.You know the internet’s a lie.

Over a period of two years, he sent her inappropriate messages and tried to isolate her from friends and family as part of a “predatory” plan to have a sexual relationship with her.There followed seven years of failings, in which further complaints were ignored, the Met told external agencies she was making up her claims, and a senior officer attempted to contact her GP, informing social services that he thought she had mental health problems. A letter from the directorate of professional standards now concedes decisions may have been influenced by these beliefs, which had “no basis in fact”.“Surely predators are more drawn to vulnerable people with mental health issues,” Lorraine told the BBC. “Surely they would investigate that more, not less, had it been true?”Criticism has rightly focused on the Met and the way they deal with victims of rogue officers. But there is also a wider pattern here. Although mental health stigma is broadly declining, there are pockets in which it still runs rampant. This is perhaps no better illustrated by the way diagnoses are weaponised against victims of abuse.People with severe mental health problems are particularly vulnerable to abuse in the first placeThat can happen at scale. It recently emerged that hundreds of female members of the armed forces who accused their colleagues of rape were misdiagnosed with personality disorders – a difficult-to-treat pattern of maladaptive behaviour – that meant they would be no longer able to serve. When seeking help for sexual assault from heath professionals within the military, they had beenin effect “written off”: slapped with a stigmatised label and then medically discharged.According to thecharity Salute Her UK,which supports veterans struggling to adjust to civilian life, some 133 of the 393 female referrals they received in a year had been diagnosed with a personality disorder. This echoesan earlier US scandal, reported in 2012, whereby rape victims in the Marine Corps and other branches of the armed forces said they were being discharged with these diagnoses. As they are pre-existing conditions, the military is not obliged to pay disability benefits.Then, too, there is a long history of the courts using the mental health records and counselling notes of crime victims to attack their credibility – although recent legislation has made this harder.This lingering pattern has severe consequences. Framing a victim as mentally ill shifts the focus away from the abuse, placing the onus on their disordered mind rather than the perpetrator of the crimes, who can more easily convince others that the victim is delusional.Agencies and the justice system may disbelieve or ignore their testimony; meanwhile, their trauma is never validated, causing further distress. There may be unnecessary medication, and their medical history is for ever altered, which might mean changes to insurance, and barriers to employment.This is compounded by the fact that people with severe mental health problems are particularly vulnerable to abuse in the first place: they are five times more likely to be a victim of assault, three times more likely to be a victim of household crime, and four times as likely to be preyed upon by relatives or acquaintances than the general population. Trauma can also trigger and exacerbate mental health conditions. Aware of the stigma, those suffering from these disorders areless likelyto report crimes.Where to start with addressing the issue? Part of it must involve a reassessment of the use of personality disorder diagnoses when treating victims of trauma. Psychiatrists are divided on whether these definitions help or harm. Borderline personality disorder is seen by some clinicians as asexist and stigmatising labelthat can get in the way of treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, which some believe is often the true cause of symptoms.But there is a broader issue here. Despite a plethora of mental health campaigns that seek to reduce stigma, and raise awareness, discrimination is still very hard to shift in places.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They often do so by making these problems relatable: after all, everyone has experienced feeling anxious or low.This has been a great success: the taboo over seeking help has significantly decreased. The Time to Change campaign that ran from 2007 to 2021 was shown to havereached its aimsof decreasing stigma. In the largest recent survey, three quarters of Britons say we need to adopt amore tolerant attitudeto mental health, and 68% say seeing a mental health professional is a sign of strength.Yet amid all this, vulnerable people are being squeezed out of the picture. As more are “made aware” of possible mental health issues at the milder end of the scale, resources are diverted away from the smaller number who really need them. There is evidence that stigma against severe conditions like schizophrenia is not shifting, even as sufferers from depression become more widely accepted.Media coverageof psychosis still tends to associate it with violence.Is it time for a more targeted approach to mental health stigma? The public are more aware of loneliness, anxiety, depression and body image issues, and Britain is kinder for it. But we also need to root out discrimination in workplaces, in the justice system, the armed forces and the police, and against those with more severe conditions.

But as consumer society evolved, we moved on to symbolic benefits: identities, lifestyles. Finally, we began selling values: an ideology that hit its zenith between 2015 and 2022 in the era of “brand purpose”.It’s here we started to lose the plot. Brands no longer sought to be loved – they demanded to besupported, treated as movements rather than commercial entities. Do you stand with Nike against racial injustice? Do you support Hellmann’s in thefight against food waste?By making purchasing decisions moral declarations, we sold the idea that we could self-correct through consumption. And brands were our champions at the centre of it all: ourprofitable agentsof social reform.And yet a decade on from the start of this period, in every conceivable domain, from the environment, to LGBTQ+ protections, to women’s bodily autonomy, to immigration and multiculturalism, it seems we’re skirting closer and closer to the fascist ideology we claimed to have defeated in 1945.Every week, we’re met with news of brands adjusting to that new order, either scaling back their DEI or environmental, social and governance (ESG) commitments orabandoning them all together.How did it come to this?It’s easy to blame the Trumps, the Tates, the podcasters,the broligarchy. Less easy is to examine the conditions that created them – and our own complicity within the professional class.The contradictions of the brand purpose era are most apparent when looked at from the view of the average person. Social progress once came hand-in-hand with economic progress. Now, instead, social progress has been offered as asubstitutefor economic progress.For the better part of the last decade, both consumers and employees have observed a marked contrast between multinational brands promoting wholesale social transformation, with bold proclamations for equity and justice for marginalised communities, while simultaneously being some of the single greatestcontributors to the decline in living standardsacross the vast majority of the western world.They’ve seen messaging grow increasingly heavy-handed, couched in shame, or used as a tactic for plain obfuscation. And they’ve asked the consumer to bear the cost of transition, often charging more for objectively worse products (hello, paper shopping bags).It’s this contradiction that’s been so effectively exploited by the far right.The appropriation and weaponisation of “woke” was supercharged by the narrative that leftist thinking had infiltrated the highest echelon of corporations. Painting the two as bedfellows has allowed a new breed of conservatives to occupy the position of “counter-cultural” – the net effect being large swathes ofyoung people supportingauthoritarian or ethno-nationalist political movements. In a bizarre inversion of reality, it’s somehow become punk to champion the same power structures that have dominated society for centuries.What is saddest about this turn of events is that it was entered with good intentions. The brand purpose era was, in many ways, marketers trying to reconcile their roles such that they could feel they were effecting positive change even while playing the corporate game. Instead, it became yet another cautionary tale in capitalism’s ability to absorb its critiques and repackage them as aesthetics to be sold on a supermarket shelf.Through the rear window it’s easy to see that the backlash was inevitable: if progressive values could so easily be commodified as a tool for selling mayonnaise, why shouldn’t those values be treated with the same fickleness as condiment preferences?This piece isn’t intended as a call out to any individual. We all live under this system. To make a living means we are all in some way complicit. But as marketers, we must reckon with how we’ve trivialised activism by turning it into comms strategy, how we’ve co-opted movements only to abandon them when the winds changed.The responsibility we bear now is undoing the lesson we inadvertently taught consumers over this era. Structural reform can’t be achieved through consumption choices – unfortunately, we’re all going to have to get dirt under our fingernails.If this all sounds a bit doom and gloom, let me provide a reason to be optimistic. After two decades of misplaced optimism, we have entered a period the writer and “luxury memeologist” Edmond Lau has termed“the dark mode shift”. In this “mask-off” era, everyone’s true intentions have come to light. Your boss is back to looking like your boss, not Adam Sandler on a coffee run; your office is back to looking like an office, not a college common room.And brands are back to their true role: creating fiction and spectacle to grease the wheels of consumption. Done right, I believe that fiction can still produce moments ofextraordinary clarity and beauty.But there’s a line to be drawn between what we do and where meaningful progress really comes from: grassroots movements, political organising, policy reform. Brands’ swift exit grants oxygen for more authentic acts of resistance to return to centre stage.And if we’re not prepared to sacrifice profit in support of those causes, then perhaps our most radical act is one of humility–wielding our influence with greater care and consciousness than before.Here’s to proclaiming: the revolution will not go better with Pepsi.Eugene Healey is brand strategy consultant, educator and creatorDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

A new method of confrontation is neededIndigo Rumbelow is co-founder of Just Stop Oil. She is currently on remand in HMP StyalSat 5 Apr 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 5 Apr 2025 03.23 EDTShareAfter three years, Just Stop Oil is ending its campaign of non-violent civil disruption: we arehanging up the high-vis. But this does not mean the resistance is over. Sitting here in a prison cell in HMP Styal, I am still demanding an end to oil and gas. Every prison key that rattles, every door that is bolted shut, every letter that is read by the prison staff – it all reminds me that 15 Just Stop Oil supporters are currently locked up for refusing to obey governments whose climate inaction is frankly murderous.There has been some progress. The Labour government was elected last year on a manifestoincluding the pledgethat they will “not issue new licences to explore new [oil and gas] fields”. This is a victory for civil resistance and the climate movement. To everyone who donned an orange high-vis, who leafleted on the streets, who got arrested for their actions, ran a social media page, gave a talk in a community centre, or answered a phone call from someone in custody, I say: you are part of this change.But the new government is falling far short of what needs to be done in order to avert catastrophic climate change. In order to fulfil their legally binding commitments to limit warming, Labour needs toend the extraction and burningof oil, gas and coal by 2030 and push for international action. In fact,in responseto Just Stop Oil’s victory announcement this week, a government spokesperson said: “We have been very clear when it comes to oil and gas that it has a future for decades to come in our energy mix.”Continuing with oil and gas for decades is an act of violence that will unfold over the coming years; it is the ultimate betrayal of the people. They are telling us they do not care.The government spokesperson went on,saying: “When it comes to Just Stop Oil, they succeeded in creating a significant amount of disruption and public nuisance … I’m sure there will be plenty of members of the public happy to hear that they will be causing less disruption in the future.”When we look back to past civil resistance movements, the truth is that we do not think about protestors as a public nuisance, but as a public service.We do not remember the shopkeepers who could not open their stores on Oxford Street after thesuffragetteshad smashed their windows, or the people who could not watch rugby matches as anti-apartheid demonstratorsstormed the pitch. Instead we remember and value the disruptive message and the change those actions spurred on.Our message, “Just Stop Oil”, was truly disruptive. It means an end to the fossil fuel era, it means an end to profiteering from death and destruction. It means rearranging wealth and power, and transforming global politics.In a world where it is legal – and profitable – to extract and burn oil, gas and coal, it is unsurprising that attempts to disrupt this system have led to imprisonment. Supporters of Just Stop Oil have court trials listed well into 2027.The state continues to put in the dock the students, doctors, vicars, scientists, teachers, the ordinary peoplewho support Just Stop Oil, while letting the fossil fuel bosses off the hook; it must abandon these show trials and invest these resources into investigating the real criminals.Five years in prison for nonviolent protest: it’s plain wrong, and Keir Starmer knows it | Caroline LucasRead moreWe are living in a different world from the one in which we founded the Just Stop Oil campaign. We have passed through1.5C of warming. Fascism and authoritarianism sweep across the globe and the threat of war has obscured our view of impending climate collapse. The Institute and Faculty of Actuariesrecently reportedthat the global economy could see a “50% loss in GDP between 2070 and 2090” unless immediate policy action on the climate crisis is taken.It does feel bittersweet that this chapter of the climate movement is closing while I am sitting in prison. But it is our duty to adapt our resistance to this new reality, and to follow Gandhi’s concept ofsatyagraha– “noncooperation with evil is as much a duty as cooperation with good”. It is time to consider a new design for a mass movement capable of confronting the many intersecting crises that we face. As we head to the drawing board, I invite you to join us.Indigo Rumbelow is co-founder of Just Stop Oil and Insulate Britain.

The agonising week-long wait – silence after our colleagues went missing, as we suspected the worst but hoped for something different? Or the confirmation, seven days later, that bodies had been found? Or, since, the ghastly details ofhowthey were found, and killed?Their ambulances were crushed and partly buried. Nearby were their bodies – also buried, en masse,in the sand. Our dead colleagues were still wearing their Red Crescent vests. In life, those uniforms signalled their status as humanitarian workers; they should have protected them. Instead, in death, those red vests became their shrouds.Ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath, and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al-Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were good people. Alongside fellow Palestine Red Crescent Society ambulance officer Asaad Al-Nasasra – who is still missing – and medical and humanitarian workers from other organisations, they were in emergency vehicles, rushing in to do what they do.Post-ceasefire Gaza is dangerous, of course. But these men were not cavalier. They believed their Red Crescent-marked vehicles would make it clear who was inside and their purpose. They believed international humanitarian law meant something; that healthcare workers would be protected. They assumed that meant they would not be a target. But they were wrong. Tragically, horrifically wrong.‘I heard them take their last breath’: survivor recounts Gaza paramedic killingsRead moreSo I’m writing with a plea. Make that assumption right again. Those deaths in Gaza – while especially awful – were part of a growing trend. More and more humanitarian aid workers are being killed around the world. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Helping people prepare for crisis and then dealing with it when it hits is what our people do. Right now, thousands of colleagues from the Myanmar Red Cross are helping people with their immediate post-earthquake needs. In Russia and Ukraine our members are helping people affected on both sides of the conflict.Our teams can help people deal with trauma. But they should not be subjected to it because of what they do. International humanitarian law requires that. Health and humanitarian aid workers must be protected. They wear emblems for a reason. Yet according to theAid Worker Security Database, they are being killed in growing numbers. In 2023, that number was 280. Our network lost 18 that year on duty – including six from our national society in Israel, Magen David Adom, on that awful day in October. Last year, a record 382 humanitarians are known to have been killed. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. A further eight were killed while working in Sudan. This year is looking even worse.We cannot allow these deaths – any of these attacks – to become normalised. We must reject any narrative that they are inevitable, or part of the risk of the job. I’m grateful for the political, media and online outrage over the deaths of our workers last month. I share it. But we must all go further.First, we must see the same whenanyhumanitarian is killed, wherever and whenever. Too often when a worker is local to the community they serve, there is far less attention than when an “international” worker dies.Second, we must demand that governments change their behaviour and that of those who answer to them. Whatever the circumstances, states have a legal responsibility to protect all civilians, including humanitarian workers. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. Neutrality and impartiality are at our core – constitutional, fundamental principles of our organisation. Straying from them could impede our work. Our job is to manage consequences, not point fingers at causes. Even in circumstances as horrific as those of last month, or 18 months ago in Israel, neither I nor my organisation assign blame towards people, groups, institutions or governments. You’ll notice I don’t in this article, even as others on this website and elsewhere do exactly that.Why? Because we believe in sticking to our principles just as we demand others stick to laws, especially international humanitarian law. We hope our commitments to neutrality and impartiality mean our voice carries even more weight when we demand justice.And demand justice we do. In Gaza, independent investigators must be allowed access and given full details of what happened two Sundays ago, however uncomfortable for those who have them. There must be respect for those who died through consequences for those who killed them. Impunity in any place breeds impunity in every place. That can never stand.Last week the IFRC’s president and I sent letters of condolence to the families of three of our network’s members in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Syria. We mourned their loss and, through an EU-supported Red Family Fund that we wish we didn’t need, offered token financial contributions. Similar letters will be sent soon to grieving families in Gaza.But letters of condolence, of course, are far too little, far too late. What will make a difference is if the tide of disrespect for international humanitarian law is turned.I am outraged. But I’m also tired of being outraged. Humanitarian aid workers must be protected. For the sake, quite simply, of humanity.Jagan Chapagain is secretary general of the IFRC (International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies)Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Now she’s back with a show about motherhood in her 40s – but don’t expect any cute parenting storiesSat 5 Apr 2025 06.55 EDTShareMy favouriteSara Pascoejoke is her imaginary riposte to people asking if she’s going to have kids. They mean well, these prying parents – they just don’t want her to miss out on a life-enhancing experience. The thing is, the comedian has had some life-enhancing experiences of her own. “But I have never, ever said to anybody: ‘Oh, have you been on QI? Ahhh, you should go on QI!’” she insists, settling into her archly patronising pep talk. “No I didn’t think I wanted to be on QI until I wasonQI, and then it was like I looked back and my entire life had been leading up to me being on QI. Yes it’sverytiring being on QI, but it’s so worth it. I just wouldn’t want you to leave it too late and they’ll have stopped making it!”As a skewering of smug, insensitive acquaintances foisting their own ideas of fulfilment on a child-free woman in her 30s, it’s a gratifyingly clever joke. In reality, however, Pascoe wasn’t laughing. During the period she was doing that routine on stage, she was actually “quite sad about not being able to have children”, she says over coffee in a north London cafe near her home. She’d long suspected she had fertility issues after unsuccessfully trying for a baby with an ex-boyfriend.“So I wanted to pre-empt the audience feeling sad for me. I didn’t want to admit the vulnerability of: it looks like I’m not going to have children. Or even – after Igot married to Steen[Raskopoulos, who is also a comedian] – my husband wants children and I don’t think we’re going to be able to have them, because that felt so raw. Instead I was like: ugh, children – stupid bastards!”Things couldn’t be more different now. Pascoe did have fertility issues, but thanks to IVF is now “completely flattened and eroded by having two children in two years in my 40s”. This – to my delight as a fellow depleted mother – is the subject of her new tour, I Am a Strange Gloop. The title is a play on I Am a Strange Loop, philosopher Douglas Hofstadter’s book about the formation of the self, as well as a reference to the stage of butterfly metamorphosis when caterpillars’ bodies melt into goo. Before our interview, I watch her relay this information to Rylan and Scott Mills during a BBC video segment, but Pascoe’s trademark erudition is utterly lost on the pair, who side-eye each other in camp incomprehension. “That was the first time I ever described the tour. I remember thinking: well, don’t say all that again!” she laughs. “Obviously I adore him, but Rylan’s little face was like: what babe?”View image in fullscreenJust kidding … Sara Pascoe performing on Live at the Apollo earlier this year.Photograph: Ben Gregory-Ring/BBC/Optomen TVPascoe’s fans will understand. Over the past decade, the 43-year-old has achieved household name status by delivering bracingly confessional comedy with a scholarly twist, extrapolating brilliant observations about humanity from her reading on biology, sociology and anthropology (she’s also the author of two heavily researched nonfiction books,AnimalandSex Power Money). Combined with a breathless, just-let-me-finish-this-thought delivery, Pascoe’s persona is quirky and a bit dorky. Yet this doesn’t translate into real-life awkwardness. In fact, she’s so easy to talk to that at times the interview strays dangerously close to a fully reciprocal conversation.You don’t feel like: I’m going to write some genius jokes, after you’ve been wiping up sweet potato all dayThat’s partly because Pascoe is as unguarded in person as she is on stage: she immediately admits, for instance, to having second thoughts about that tour title. When she came up with the name, the strains of motherhood were drowning out her sense of self, so “rather than calling it something like ‘I’m having a breakdown, please come and laugh’” she went with some intellectual wordplay. A better title, she thinks now, would be hypnagogia, the term for that kaleidoscopic state between sleep and waking. Another of the show’s themes is “what happens to your brain if all of your thinking is done at night-time. I find that memories that come up at night are really different, and things are very emotionally raw. I’m doing standup about stuff like Paula Radcliffe doing a poo in the marathon, because I suddenly started thinking about it all the time at night – I’m still processing it 19 years later.”There is a reason Pascoe is doing so much nocturnal musing. Well, two. Her three-year-old is being “bribed massively” with Paw Patrol toys to stay in his bed. “But every night he decides it’s not worth it and comes in to chat.” Her 18-month-old’s sleep is touch and go due to “turbo teething, where his teeth come through in clusters”. He also wakes up at three in the morning demanding a bottle.I feel slightly guilty about rubbernecking at Pascoe’s sleep deprivation, which is significantly worse than my own. But then that is precisely the appeal of comedy about parenthood: it acts as a form of consolation for those with children and – Pascoe believes – those without. She sees her current role as “the opposite to an influencer” for people struggling to decide whether to have kids. “I’m a putter-offerer. I think, how great to have someone make you go: no, no, no – looks rubbish!”View image in fullscreenMum’s the word … Sara Pascoe.Photograph: Alexandra CameronFor those who have already taken the plunge, Pascoe is here with all the relatable domestic drudgery material. “I know no one likes housework, but I’m affronted by the amount of washing and wiping up I have to do. I’m trying to write a bit about Sisyphus” – whose punishment from the gods in Greek mythology involved him eternally pushing a boulder up a hill, only for it to roll back down when he approached the summit – “and how actually he’s really lucky: he’s outdoors, he’s buff, he doesn’t have a husband dropping his shoes in front of the rock.”Cleaning up after children means doing the “same thing over and over again. And it’s not good for your brain. You don’t feel like: I’m going to write some genius jokes, after you’ve been wiping up sweet potato all day. So the world is giving us these mixed messages of: go out, express yourself, live your life to its full potential, but the drudgery is this unfair tax on it. Who’s going to do that? Either I do it or I pay another woman to do it. It does have to be part of the discussion. Even if it’s just whinging to feel better about it – I don’t have a solution!”When we meet, Pascoe is about to travel to Australia for a series of shows (yes the whole family are coming, and yes she expects the flight to be “24 hours of hell”). That will be followed by a 52-date UK tour – a run that cements her position as one of the most in-demand comics in the country. It’s quite an achievement for someone who didn’t grow up with a knack for performance. Born in Dagenham and raised in Romford, Pascoe vividly recalls deciding she wanted to be an actor aged 12, but she was far from a natural. “I wasn’t shy, but I want to say the word frigid, if that makes sense? Like physically not good at expressing myself. I had none of the skills needed for acting.” Her motivation was solely affirmation. “Even by that age, I didn’t feel very cool or popular. And I realised that you could get a lot of attention for pretending to be someone else.”She wasn’t making people laugh, either – according to her mother, at least. “My mum loves to tell people: ‘She wasn’t funny as a child and she’s not funny now.’ But she means in real life, not on stage.”View image in fullscreenFunny business … Pascoe and her husband, Steen Raskopoulos.Composite: Getty Images/SuppliedPascoeisfunny in person and on stage – yet she’s more than happy to admit that her path to fame has been almost surreally smooth. So smooth, in fact, that during her previous show,2022’s Success Story, she posited the theory that she was actually “in an asylum, doing all this to the wall. And the nurse is like: ‘Oh, that’s nice, she’s at one of her gigs again.’” Success “felt like mental illness because I wanted stuff and then it happened to me and it felt like: how can this actually be true?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Well, I write 20 words a dayThese days, Pascoe is unpicking her luck with more logic. She started doing standup on a whim – initially as character comedy, viewing it as acting-adjacent – despite having barely witnessed any before. “I was arrogant. I think if I’d actually seen the masters of their craft I would have known my place. Instead, I was having a glass of wine and going out with the energy of a mad woman at a bus stop.” She was, however, “really, really, really addicted from the beginning”, finding the idea of commanding a packed room with opinions and a microphone far less intimidating than walking into a pub on a Friday night as a punter (it’s a comedian thing).Serendipitously, this was 2007, a time when women were hugely underrepresented in comedy and the industry was “desperate for them”. This meant female comics “were constantly getting recommended for gigs” which created a fast track to success. It was also the brief era – now over – when the glut of panel shows meant you could earn good money and better exposure as a comedian on TV. Pascoe marvels at the fact that all her peers from her early days on the circuit – including Josh Widdicombe, James Acaster, Katherine Ryan and Ed Gamble – have found mainstream success: “Everyone I knew from that time is famous now.”Yet as her profile skyrocketed, Pascoe struggled to hone her skills quickly enough to keep up. Just a few years into her career, she was asked to appear on the BBC’s flagship standup show, Live at the Apollo; immediately afterwards she did a small Edinburgh preview show where “nobody laughed at me for an hour. I remember thinking: crikey, should I do Apollo? And I thought, do you want to be the worst person who’s ever done Live at the Apollo, or not do Live at the Apollo? I’d rather be the worst person. And so you have to make your peace with it.”View image in fullscreenRoar power … Pascoe on her Animal tour in 2016.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianI find it impossible to believe the hyper-thoughtful and always entertaining Pascoe is the least funny person in Live at the Apollo history – but brutal self-deprecation is her default mode (“I’ve never let being bad at things stop me doing them,” she says at one point, “which is how I’ve had a career”). She seems similarly sanguine about abandoned projects, including a nonfiction book about murder, which her publishers decided was a project for a criminologist rather than “a clown”. She is, however, working on her second novel, a follow-up to her compellingly idiosyncratic debut,Weirdo. But progress is understandably slow. “You know how people are like: ‘I write 800 or 2,000 words a day.’ Well I write 20 words a day.” Between childcare and preparing for the tour, she is fitting in work in “tiny windows. I parent, parent, parent, parent, all the way up to the edge of working.”Sara Pascoe: ‘I got told not to wear skirts on stage – but you can be hysterical and wear a nice dress’Read moreDespite the grind, Pascoe radiates joy when she talks about her children, who are “at the stage when they just think you’re amazing”. When she took her eldest to a show, he “was so into the fact that there are bowls of sweets in the green room. Now whenever I leave the house, he’s like: jelly snakes? Fruit chews? I’m in such a cute phase of my life.”Pascoe’s existence may now be dominated by cartoon canines and a kitchen encrusted with root vegetables but, in some of the most essential ways, this high-achieving comedy obsessive hasn’t changed at all. Deep down she still identifies “as an infertile childless woman”, she says. “I don’t know if it’s because I didn’t have children until I was 40.” And while the context of that QI joke is different now, the message – that work and other achievements are just as valid as having kids – remains evergreen.“I think that cliche of telling someone who doesn’t have children that there’s this amazing love that they will never understand is really unhealthy and actually wrong. I still stand by that routine, because I’ve had my babies, but they are not the only thing I will achieve.”Sara Pascoe’sI Am a Strange Glooptours 21June to March 2026.Explore more on these topicsSara PascoeComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He had no symptoms, was perfectly fit, at the peak of his game. Yet the Oscar-winning film-maker and artist believed it was inevitable. After all, his father had died from it, and he is a black man. The statistics speak for ­themselves. They are as overwhelming as they are bleak. One in eight men will get prostate c­ancer. They are two and a half times more likely to get it if their father or brother had it. They’re twice as likely to get it if they’re black – and they’re two and a half times more likely to die from it, too.McQueen is here today with his urology specialist Prof Suks Minhas and surgeon Ben Challacombe to talk about the nitty-gritty of the disease that is killing so many men. But he believes he might easily not have been. If he had known as little as his father had, he may well be dead. McQueen feels grateful and guilty, and is determined to make people more aware. After all, prostate cancer is eminently treatable. And yet more than 12,000 men die from it in the UK every year – well over one an hour. Simply unacceptable, he says.“I was always going to have prostate cancer. From the day I was born I was going to have prostate cancer.” There’s a degree of poetic licence in his statement, but not that much.Minhas prefers to put McQueen’s chances at incredibly high. “I would say he’s not just got a family history, he’s got a lethal family history. So, while it wasn’t inevitable, it was probably more than 50-50 for you.”His father, Philbert, was a tough man who had never taken a day off sick before he was diagnosed in 2000. “He had a couple of accidents, and that’s what triggered him to go to the doctor. My father sometimes wet himself. It was embarrassing for him. He wanted to get it sorted, and he went to his GP, and through that he discovered it was very advanced cancer.”View image in fullscreenMcQueen with surgeon Ben Challacombe (left) and urology specialist Suks Minhas (right)Never mind prostate cancer, the family hadn’t even heard of the prostate – a walnut-shaped gland in the pelvis that rests below the bladder and in front of the rectum. The prostate produces fluid that mixes with sperm to produce semen. Surrounding muscles help expel semen during ejaculation. “It was quite confrontational because Ididn’t know what prostate cancer was. I didn’t know where it was. I didn’t know anything about it. And my father had a difficult time with it.” The problem was, as it still is today for many men, this is a subject he didn’t feel comfortable talking about. And, when it came to his health, Philbert McQueen wasn’t a talker.“My dad was a very strong guy. He was a builder, a hard worker. He was always in work early, back at eight and went to bed. He lived for his friends at the weekend. He was never ill. He never had a cold once. Before my dad would go to hospital, he’d have to have a leg amputated,” McQueen says. “It’s a maleness that unfortunately leads you down the wrong path. And it’s an unnecessary path.” Was he genuinely never ill or just toughing it out? He smiles. “He was a bit headstrong. So when this happened it was like, oh Dad’s really not well. It was a shocker. The doctor got my dad to leave the room for something and then he told us. He said, ‘Your dad’s very strong, maybe he’s got about five years.’” Philbert was 61 at the time, and lived until he was 67. Did he know his diagnosis was a death sentence? “We never told him, but I think he knew.” What were those years like? “Not great. It was a struggle. The pain in the night because of the bathroom stuff, the difficulty trying to pee. It was horrible, actually.”Challacombe, who operated on McQueen in 2022, nods in recognition as he talks. “There was so much less awareness back in the day,” Challacombe says. “The generation then didn’t speak about it.” If they did talk, it was in euphemistic terms. “They spoke about having a problem; a problem going to the toilet or the bathroom. Often, their family, particularly their children, were not aware what the diagnosis was.Menwere not good at talking about it, and in many ways still aren’t.”McQueen, 55, who was knighted in 2020 for services to art and film, had a tricky relationship with his father – and talking, or rather not talking, was at the heart of it. He adored Philbert, but they didn’t chat much; about anything, never mind cancer. “My dad was a geezer; a bloke. Men of a certain age thought children should be seen and not heard. It was difficult. I wanted something more from my father than he knew how to give. It was a strange relationship. This is the kind of dad my dad was. People would say, ‘Your dad’s brilliant, he’s so funny.’ And I’d be like, ‘Is he?’” McQueen acts out his surprise at being told this. “He was always good with other people. We didn’t get that off him. It was always about the front. So with this prostate thing he never complained until the very last moment.”He and his father were very different men. While Philbert laboured with his hands all his life and found it difficult to talk about intimacies, McQueen was determined to be an artist communicating with his audience about all sorts of subjects – from the Troubles in Northern Ireland (Hunger) to sexual obsession (Shame), enslavement (12 Years a Slave), war (Blitz), the Holocaust (Occupied City) and black Britain (the wonderfulSmall Axe seriesmade for television).Another difference is that McQueen has been hugely successful. By the age of 30 he had won the prestigiousTurner prize for his short films, and, in 2014,12 Years a Slave won the Oscar for best feature film. He and Philbert moved in very different worlds, and there were tensions. “It was always a bit ‘There can only be one man in the house’ kind of thing.” Despite their difficulties, he was devoted to his father.McQueen says it was awful seeing this superhero of a man become weaker and weaker – physically and in spirit. “I remember him lying on the floor one night. And he said, ‘I’m done. This is it, I’m done.’ So I went down and picked him up, and he was a big guy. I picked him up and said, ‘No, no, no, no, come on, sit up, sit up, and we just started talking about football. To see my dad on his back saying, ‘I’m done’ was awful because my dad was tremendously strong. Dad could lift two suitcases with one hand. Oh God, I’m sorry.” He’s welling up. “It was just very difficult seeing this strong guy, who I always looked up to become weak. It was horrible.”I gave a speech in front of George Clooney, Julia Roberts, all of Hollywood. I’d been told that day I had cancerTowards the end they weren’t getting on well, he says. By then his father had been hospitalised. “I came to the hospital. The last time I’d seen him we’d had an argy-bargy, and he was very weak and I just burst into tears. That’s never happened to me before – like an eruption. A volcano of tears exploding. My goodness. And we came together after that. I just sat there and held his hand. I left that day because I had to go to the States. I came back a week later and he’d passed away.”Once Philbert had been diagnosed, McQueen found out everything he could about prostate cancer. He was appalled to discover that it affected black men so disproportionately. To this day, it’s not known why. Even Minhas and Challacombe – two leading experts – cannot explain. There is not a prostate cancer gene as such, though some studies show mutations in various genes play a role. But what they are certain about is that socioeconomic factors play a significant part in the prevalence of prostate cancer among black men.Take work, for example, Minhas says. “Are you going to do a PSA test if you’re working all the hours God sends?” A PSA (prostate-specific antigen) is a simple blood test used to check prostate conditions, which men can request from their GP. “And we know men are less inclined to approach GPs and medical professionals, especially black men. If you look at studies, there’s a concept that it’s feminising; a sign of weakness. Women take up screening far more than men.”A high PSA scorecanbe a sign of prostate cancer, but it can also indicate an enlarged prostate, a urine infection or recent prostate stimulation. Meanwhile, it’s also possible to have a low PSA and still have cancer.Minhas talks about his own father, who emigrated from India to Britain and was employed by a London sheet-metal factory. “When you’re working in a factory, you’re not going to be thinking, am I going to do a medical trial or go toProstate Cancer Researchif I get sick, you’re thinking, ‘Where am I going to get the next bit of money to feed my kids?’ We know the first-generation immigrants in this country were deprived and lived in deprived areas, and, to me, that is the issue at hand.”So is this to do with class or race? Both, Minhas says. “Look at the films Steve has made. They’re about oppression and suffering. It stems from slavery; the perception of a white establishment that doesn’t resonate with ethnic minorities in this country. That’s the problem. If you look at institutions, although they might not be overtly racist, the same issues are still there as when I was a kid and people would call you names in the street.”A report published last month by theNHS Race and Health Observatoryrevealed an alarming lack of trust among Britain’s ethnic minorities in NHS primary care providers – 51% of participants said they experienced some form of discrimination, with 38% of Asian participants and 49% of Black participants reporting that they felt they were treated differently due to their ethnicity.View image in fullscreenMcQueen with his mother, Mary, and father, Philbert, at the Turner prize awards ceremony in 1999.Photograph: Dave Benett/Getty ImagesFor example, Minhas says, we know black men are disproportionately affected by prostate cancer, so the obvious thing to do is research to find out why. But it hasn’t been done. Why? “The BMAdid a studyin 2022 and found there were disproportionately fewer people from ethnic minorities in leadership roles. Why is that important in terms of prostate cancer, you might ask?” Simple, he says – white people are less likely to see the problem, let alone do something about it. He looks at Challacombe and apologises for getting on his high horse. “I’m sorry Ben, but the medical establishment is run by white people.” Minhas says that decisions are by and large taken with a white British population in mind. He cites his mother, a first-generation migrant from India. “My mum died of breast cancer. She got a letter in the post that said ‘Come for your screening’. Did that happen? No. She couldn’t read or write. There is health inequality in this country. Fundamentally, it is racist.”Again, he apologises, this time to McQueen. “Steve is one of the kindest, nicest, most humble people in his position I’ve met in my life, but what drives me up the wall is the establishment.” Minhas is convinced that if it were white people who suffered disproportionately from prostate cancer by now we would know why and there would be a national screening programme in place.It is shocking that there isn’t a screening programme for a cancer that affects more than 50,000 people a year. On average, there are 3,200 cases of cervical cancer in the UK a year. Since the early 1970s, cervical cancer mortality rates have decreased by 75% in women in the UK, according toCancer Research UK. This is largely due to screening that detects and treats abnormal changes in the cervix before they can develop into cancer. By contrast,research has shownthat prostate cancer mortality rates have increased by 16% since the early 1970s.Prostate cancer screening guidelines are currently being reviewed, with recommendations expected by the end of the year. One reason why McQueen and the doctors are so eager to talk today is to encourage screening for high-risk groups to be set up, notably black men with a family history of prostate cancer.Challacombe points out the significant gender differences when it comes to cancer prevention – partly because of the availability of breast and cervical screening, and partly because women are generally more health-literate than men. “You’ve got a population of women who are used to going to the GP because they have kids and they’re often the ones who take them. Whereas men could easily go from 16 to 50 and never contact the GP unless they have a problem. And it’s political. There’s a women’s health ambassador in the government. You don’t have a men’s health ambassador, and there should be one.”And then there is the embarrassment factor. Few things challenge stereotypical notions of masculinity like prostate cancer. Infertility, erectile dysfunction, incontinence are all hard subjects areas for men to talk about. So many think it’s best to ignore the prostate. McQueen made a little-known short film calledEmbarrassed, which tackles this and begs black men to start talking about it. The message is clear: “Don’t let embarrassment stop you having this conversation. It may help you save someone’s life.” The film is fronted by four high-profile black male actors – Chiwetel Ejiofor, Morgan Freeman, Micheal Ward and Idris Elba. “I mention the film to people, and they say, ‘I didn’t see it,’” McQueen says. “The problem is, how d’you make people aware? I couldn’t have had better people.”After his father died, McQueen started getting tested regularly for prostate cancer. Again, it highlights a difference between him and his father. McQueen was a successful film-maker who could afford to go private and get the best treatment. And he knows it made a practical difference.He had been getting tested regularly for five years when he went for his checkup with Minhas. He had no symptoms and his PSA level wasn’t high but it was steadily rising, and the rate of change over time was higher than expected. Minhas sent him for an MRI scan and biopsy, and the results came back positive. McQueen had early-stage prostate cancer.It’s upsetting that so many men are dying, particularly black men. It’s upsetting that my dad and friend died“Thank God he’s a hypochondriac!” Minhas says. Many men in McQueen’s situation would not have gone to a doctor when they were symptom-free. And if they had, they probably wouldn’t have been referred for tests while still within the normal PSA range.This is another difficulty with prostate cancer. “Pretty much all the men with symptoms have got an enlarged prostate rather than prostate cancer,” Challacombe says. He apologises for getting technical. “It’s the middle of the prostate that grows and squeezes the pipe. Prostate cancer grows on the outside and doesn’t squeeze the pipe until it gets quite advanced. So if two blokes come to see me, and both have a PSA of four [considered high], and one has bad symptoms and one has no symptoms, I’m worried about the one with no symptoms, while everyone else thinks you’re going to be worried about the one with symptoms.

He remembers the date because he was in Los Angeles to receive the Academy Museum Vantage Award, an honorary Oscar for work helping to “contextualise and challenge dominant narratives around cinema”. He was hiking in the Hollywood hills with his wife and mother of his two children, Dutch writer and film-maker Bianca Stigter, when he received the call. How did he feel? “The only time I felt really low was when I was on the hike with Bianca, and I came back and was fine. That night I gave a speech about the industry in front of, you know, George Clooney and Julia Roberts and the whole of Hollywood, basically, and it was funny because I’d been told that day I had cancer. It was a beautiful high and low.”“That must have been pretty stressful,” Challacombe says. “You’ve got that all internalised, you can’t tell anyone, and you’ve got to get on stage and do a speech.”“No, I felt liberated,” McQueen says. “I felt very powerful.”He looked for a surgeon and was recommended Challacombe. He was making Blitz, about London in the second world war, and initially thought he’d wait until that was finished for the operation. Challacombe explained to him that the op would result in infertility.“I had no problems with that,” McQueen says. “I don’t want any more kids, so that’s fine.” He is a renowned workaholic and soon realised he couldn’t focus on the film with the operation pending, so he opted to have it mid-shoot, in November 2022. Amazingly, he was back at work two weeks later.Surely that’s not normal? “There was a bit of pressure to turn him around quickly enough so he could get on with doing his job because there was a lot of insurance money involved if they lost weeks of filming,” Challacombe says.“I was surprised he went back so soon,” Minhas says. “I remember nagging him and saying, ‘You’re being a bit crazy here!’” Did he listen? “Oh no!”McQueen didn’t tell anyone on the set that he had cancer or that he’d had an operation. “I was in hospital for two days, then I was at home doing things on my laptop. I didn’t want anyone to know about it at the time because you have 200 people on the set and if they’re asking how you are all the time …” He trails off. “Leave it out, would ya!” he says in his best mockney. “You just want people to be focusing on the work rather than on you. So nobody knew about it until two years later.”What operation did he have? Well, if you want the title in its full glory, Challacombe says, it’s a bilateral, nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy. “We were trying to remove multiple small tumours in his prostate while preserving what we call his ‘functional outcomes’, which is a nerdy way of saying trying to make sure he goes back to his erections and continence as quickly and as well as he could.”“The funny thing is, the day after the operation, I thought I’d better not get an erection, because I had the catheter in. But I could feel, ‘Oooh, I can!’ D’you remember?” McQueen asks Challacombe.View image in fullscreenDetermined to make a difference … McQueen with Challacombe and Minhas“I’m not sure that you want to put that in the Guardian,” Challacombe says. “But that was great. If that happens, that’s a really good sign you’re going to recover, so I love it when blokes say that.” He says that this becomes obvious surprisingly quickly. “Not everybody will know this, but when they go to sleep blokes get nocturnal erections. It’s just part of the physiology of being a bloke.”I ask McQueen if he is fully functional now. “Yes, thank God,” he says.Even if he hadn’t fully recovered, of course it would have been worthwhile, McQueen says. But, as it is, things could not have gone better. “The whole thing was a great experience,” he says. The two doctors laugh. “Oh, come on!” Challacombe says. “It wasn’t agreatexperience! It was the least bad it could have been!”The three of them talk about what we can do as a society to make men, and particularly black men, more aware of regularly checking their prostate.“We sent out about 5,000 letters in Southwark, Lambeth and Lewisham encouraging people to go for PSA testing, and the hospital was worried that we were going to be overwhelmed,” Minhas says. “We had about five people come.”“Five!’ McQueen repeats, horrified. Letters in the post are not the answer, they conclude. They mention a couple of people who have ingeniously raised awareness through their work – ex-car mechanicErrol McKellaroffered 20% off MOTs to any men who had had PSA tests, while hairdresser Mark Rayment launchedBarbers Against Prostate Cancer, realising that barbershops are ideal community spaces in which to promote testing. Then there is theMan Van, often stationed at football grounds offering PSA tests. “It has shown far higher engagement from ethnic minorities than if they’d just been sent letters by the GP,” Challacombe says.The more we know, the more we are in a position to demand action. Challacombe mentions a significant study in Malmö – while four is generally regarded as a high PSA score, thisresearch revealedthe risk of serious prostate cancer that has spread outside the gland is 10 times higher if the PSA is above 1.6 when men are in their 40s.It’s inspiring to see three men so determined to make a difference. McQueen tells me he has so much to thank the two doctors for. But, ultimately, and to his great sadness, he believes that he owes his life to his father. “My father saved my life because I wouldn’t have done anything if it hadn’t been for his cancer,” he says.Amonth after meeting McQueen I read that his great friendAlex Wheatle has died of prostate cancer. The novelist was 62. Wheatle had a remarkable life. He spent much of his childhood in the Shirley Oaks care home in Croydon where many children were abused, was jailed for his part in the 1981 Brixton riots, and was awarded an MBE for his services to literature in 2008. McQueen made him the subject of a Small Axe film, simply titledAlex Wheatle.View image in fullscreenAlex Wheatle at the 2022 Hay festival.Photograph: Robert Melen/Rex/ShutterstockMcQueen calls me. He is clearly devastated. “Alex was like a Zelig character. You could see the world through his eyes. He wrote for children because he always understood the full potential of children. He always went back to youth to say, ‘Look, this is what you can be!’ He was a beautiful man.” And he was another man insufficiently aware of prostate cancer and so was diagnosed too late. “The thing is Alex is dead and I’m alive. I knew to look out for it, and he didn’t. And that makes me upset. I was talking to a relative the other day and she said, ‘You’re lucky.’ And I hated hearing that.Hated hearing it.It really upset me. Because it’s just this stupid information that could have saved people’s lives. It’s upsetting that my dad died. It’s upsetting that Alex died, it’s upsetting that so many men are dying, particularly black men. People are dying unnecessarily, and it’s foolish.”He asks me when the article’s coming out. There’s a sense of urgency about him. “I just want to help save lives,” he says.Find out more atProactive for Your Prostate websiteExplore more on these topicsSteve McQueenProstate cancerCancerMen's healthMenHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I was born into the sound. My dad [radio presenter John Peel] used to make these mixtapes. We had three TDK 90s and we would drive around France in our battered, crappy Peugeot 505 estate, travelling the world musically through these cassettes.As teenagerswe used to get called crusties – we had long hair. It was that grunge era, early 90s. And then rave culture started and me and my friends got really into hardcore and jungle, and we got called ravers, but as an insult. I look back at that with great pride.I always wanteda shell suit, but my mum wouldn’t let me have one, because they were highly flammable.It’s a physical instinct,finding new music. It’s not conscious. I hear a noise – a bit like smelling something in the air you like – and I follow it on its journey to see what it does next.My dad would takeall four of us to festivals, then he would just disappear, and we’d be left to our own devices. We grew up running wild. This was before festivals were nice. There was no food, everyone was crapping outside, there were fires everywhere.I remember beingtaken to a Nirvana gig in London’s King’s Cross when I was very young and it being a terrifying experience. The whole family lived in my dad’s world, everything we did fitted around his work, we were his entourage. I was born into the radio community, and I’ve been in it ever since. People would stare at us, wanting to know: why is there a child here?Music was Dad’s thing– we felt we couldn’t be involved. But after he died I suddenly realised it’s what I wanted to do. I don’t know if I was filling a hole that was now in our lives. But I grabbed it and thought, I’m not going to let you go.I’m a domestic god.I do all the cooking, all the cleaning, all the laundry. My wife admitted the other day she’s never used the vacuum cleaner. I usually get back about one in the morning and before I go to bed, I put the first wash on.Life is pretty nuts,but when you throw four kids into it, too, it’s absolutely insane. I love the chaos of having four kids. I mean, frankly, I’d have more.I have the mostastonishingly bad memory. I don’t know any of my children’s or my wife’s birthdays. I don’t know any phone numbers. The advantage is that I can’t remember enough to regret anything.My dad drilled intohis children not to have any ambition, which at the time seemed fun, then later in life, we’re like, “Oh that’s not very useful!” There was almost no competition at all. There still isn’t.Dad was a verykind man and incredibly generous. Kindness was, for him, the most important thing. My brothers and sisters are all the same. We’re all sort of soft, slightly pathetic creatures.I’ll still be goingto festivals in my 80s. I mean, you go to some festivals and you’re like, this is nicer than my house.

I can’t see my boys playing rugby and soccer, and it has been a very stressful time because I’m used to soaking it all up. It’s distressing.“You get emotional, but you have to get used to it because I’m lucky to have the life I have. I still have my wonderful family, and I can still see something out of here,” he said, pointing to his left eye.He added: “You say to yourself, just get on with it.”John has previously said his eye issues have affected his ability to record music and have left him feeling “stuck”.However, he recently recorded Who Believes In Angels?, a collaboration with the US singer Brandi Carlile, which involved working with the producer Andrew Watt and his long-term songwriting partner Bernie Taupin.Elton John and Brandi Carlile: Who Believes in Angels? review – a true meeting of mindsRead moreLast month, and before the album’s release on Friday, John and Carlile hosted an evening of performance and storytelling at the London Palladium.His headline set at Glastonbury in 2023 had previously been his last UK performance, as part of his 330-date Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour, which ended with an emotionally charged show in Stockholm, Sweden.John reflected on how he used to do “120 shows a year” but said having children had made him entirely shift his perspective.“I always said I wanted to die on stage,” he said. “Now I want my gravestone to read: ‘He was a great dad.’ My career has been wonderful, but the kids are what matters.”Reflecting on his career he said he was “riddled with music” and it was the “greatest gift” he had ever been given. “Here I am at 78, feeling better than I have ever been,” he said.Gesturing to his eyes, he added: “This is a bastard, but we’ll get over it.

As his book about the case comes out, he talks to the Colombian novelist about literature and justiceAlex ClarkSat 5 Apr 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 5 Apr 2025 09.21 EDTShareWhat do law and literature have in common? Do they represent similar impulses towards understanding human motives and behaviour, or are they fundamentally different systems? In his new book,38 Londres Street, lawyer and writer Philippe Sands revisits the attempts to extradite and prosecute former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, beginning in 1998, in which he was involved. He also finds himself on the trail of Walther Rauff, a former SS officer featured in Sands’s award-winning book East West Street, who went on to seek refuge in Chile, later becoming involved in the Pinochet regime’s arrangements for the detention, torture and murder of its opponents. The Colombian novelist Juan Gabriel Vásquez, who trained as a lawyer but decided instead to write journalism and fiction, has addressed political violence and its legacy throughout his work, including in his acclaimed novelThe Shape of the Ruins. The two friends met to discuss excavating the past, the limits of law and the potential of art.Philippe Sands:We’ve known each other for quite a few years, and you’re one of those rare people who straddles the worlds that I’ve fallen into: you understand the world of law with your legal qualification, and understand far better than I do the world of literature. But you’re also from the region I’m writing about. Having been to Chile for this book six or seven times, and about to head off again, I’m conscious of being an outsider. It’s a Chilean story, and this Brit has stumbled across it in various ways. It’s a local story for you.Juan Gabriel Vásquez:Yes, in a sense, but I was wondering as I read the book if the fact that you are not an insider did mean that you could write about things that maybe Chileans haven’t been able to discuss. A certain distance allows you to enter this story with a kind of objectivity. There’s a wonderful sentence at the very end of the book in which someone says: it is a fine thing to investigate for a personal reason. And I think your personal reasons might be different from those a Chilean might have, and thus bring a new approach, maybe more capacious. Would you like to discuss that a little bit?PS:Sure: it is personal. As you know, I discovered [in researching East West Street] that Walther Rauff’s involvement in the gas vans touched my grandfather’s family very directly [Rauff had overseen the Nazis’ use of mobile gas chambers in which to exterminate Jews and others; Sands’s great-aunt Laura and other relatives are likely to have been killed in this way]. And I discovered, almost miraculously – I didn’t know it when I was involved in the Pinochet case – that a member of my wife’s family was the catalyst for the Spanish prosecutor, Carlos Castresana, to start the case. And so there’s a deep personal involvement, but your bigger point is interesting. The book has a number of revelations, things that have never come out before, and I’ve been able to speak to people who have never spoken to anybody before: the judge who signed Pinochet’s arrest warrant, because he happened to be my nextdoor neighbour, but probably most significantly, the Chilean civil servant Cristián Toloza, who led the negotiations for Chile; negotiations which many of us had suspected had happened, but for which there has never been any proof until this book came out. I think I was able to speak to Cristián because I was an outsider, because I didn’t have any skin in the game, and because he’d read my other books and came to understand that I’m able to be with people who I disagree with and represent them fairly.Do I spend my time arguing cases at the International Court, or writing books? What is the most useful thing I can do?Philippe SandsI was surprised that a number of people spoke to me as openly as they did: Jonathan Powell, for example. Of course, I had my conversation with him in March 2024, before he returned to government and became the national security and principal foreign policy adviser to the prime minister today,involved at the heartof the Russia-Ukraine negotiations. He’s a remarkable person, and he said, I’m happy to talk about it with you, because it was 25 years ago. And this is consistent with the work that I do in many other cases, and with my own family experience: it takes a generation or two to pass before people feel they can speak. I think this story could not have been told 20 years ago.JGV:I was born in 1973, in January, the year of the coup [in Chile]. And the coup, the death of deposed president Salvador Allende, and Pinochet’s coming into power are the single most influential events in my lifetime in South American history. It’s all part of the same world in which the Cuban Revolution took place in 1959 – the dictatorship was a reaction to Allende, who was inheriting, in a sense, the worldview of the Cuban revolution and the idea of bringing a certain kind of democratic socialism to Chile. So these events have shaped my world and Latin American literature. And since I’m a novelist, I have to speak about that too. I  remember perfectly where I was and what I was doing when Pinochet was arrested: I was in Paris, reading a novel by Flaubert and just thinking about becoming a novelist. I remember it as having happened just the day before yesterday: this is part of the same world in which we are living right now, because the debates and the discussions are alive. Gabriel Boric has to carry out the same debates every day of his life as president of Chile because the ghosts are alive and because he won the presidencyagainst a supporter of Pinochet. So this is very Latin American for me – the ongoing wheel of political life that we never seem to be able to leave. We never seem to be able to reboot the political life of the continent, and we are living under ideas and emotions produced by those ideas that have been valid for 50 or 60 years. We are the direct inheritors of that world.PS:It raises another question: how was a writer from a far away place able to make more progress on some of these issues than a public authority, an investigator, a judge from the local community? Why has nothing happened for 50 years in relation to these things?View image in fullscreenJuan Gabriel Vásquez.JGV:These things are so charged emotionally and socially in these societies that you enjoy a certain kind of impunity. But if you live there in the middle of things, every opinion you give publicly will brand you in a way, will be either provocative or put you in a bad place with friends or workers, or prevent you from getting a job, or cause a fight with your in-laws. And so there are pacts of silence.Can I ask you about something that has interested you for a long time, and that is very evident in the book – a concern with what you call the line that is said to separate truth and fiction?PS:Having been immersed in this now for 10 years, one of the things that I noticed was that the gap left by the legal system opened a space for writers to step in. There is, on your continent and in Chile, a remarkable literature in relation to many of these matters, from Pablo Neruda to Roberto Bolaño. These accounts have created not just mythologies, but a basis for people in the community to understand what has happened. And this has caused me to ask: could it be that in delivering justice, literature has a more profound role than the judgment of a court? Which of my endeavours – lawyer, teacher, writer – is actually the most socially useful in contributing to that which I care about? Which is a form of accounting and reckoning? I’m beginning to wonder.JGV:In a very important sense, law and literature are opposed, contradictory worldviews. The law pursues certainty, and novels on the contrary thrive in ambiguity. There’sthis wonderful letter by Chekhovto somebody who was criticising him for not taking clear moral or political stances in his stories: Chekhov says, You are confusing two things, answering the questions and formulating them correctly. Only the latter is the aim of the artist. I think, as a lawyer, you have to come up with the answers. Novelists are trying to formulate the questions correctly, and these are two different endeavours.PS:Could we not think of the law as operating in a different way? It’s simply another form of storytelling. I stand up before the International Court of Justice. What am I doing? I’m doing what you do in another form. My audience is the judge rather than the reader, but the process bears similarities. I used to talk about this a lotwith John le Carré, and it was he who explained to me the importance when you’re writing of complex matters not to impose upon the intelligent reader the perspective, the viewpoint, the conclusions of the writer, but leave it to the reader to form their own view. And I said to him, but that’s exactly what we do in court. We would never say to a judge, this is what you must do. We lay out the material. We do it strategically. We do it as advocates to perhaps lead the judge to a conclusion in which the judge says to herself or himself, this is the right answer, but it hasn’t been imposed upon me, and I’m acting with autonomy as a judge. Is that not, in a sense, what you want your readers to do as they read your works?Paradise for a novelist is where history has to shut up because it doesn’t have the proofJuan Gabriel VásquezJGV:I do feel that there’s an opposing impulse between the judge and the novelist. The law is about establishing guilt or innocence, whereas good literature follows the impulse to create a space when we go beyond judging.PS:I think we do agree. But for me, it’s very personal, because with limited days, limited time, you ask yourself the question, what is the most useful thing I can do? Do I spend the time that is available to me arguing cases at the International Court, or do I spend the time that’s available to me writing books?The next book I will do will be on ecocide, but in parallel, I’m writing a novel about a place called Vittel, and the story of the women who were locked up in an internment camp between 1940 and 1944. They included Elsie Tilney, an evangelical missionary who saved my mum and many others, and Sylvia Beach, the founder of Shakespeare and Company. And I’ve long been fascinated by this place, so I’m going to give it a go. But the idea of writing something with no endnotes is terrifying!JGV:The novel is a very stubborn genre. It wants to devour every kind of approach to the human experience and contain it. And it’s capable of doing it, that’s what is fantastic. My novel The Shape of the Ruins turns around two murders that shaped Colombian history in the 20th century, the murder of a Liberal presidential candidate in 1948, Jorge Eliécer Gaitán, and the murder of a Liberal congressman, Rafael Uribe Uribe, in 1914. These are two dark places in Colombian history. We know who the murderers were, but we all agree that they didn’t work alone. There are forces behind them that shaped and that decided those murders. So we know that there are conspiracy theories and shadows in the narration of these events that have shaped Colombian history and this is paradise for a novelist, the places where history has to shut up because it doesn’t have the proof, it doesn’t have the documents, it doesn’t have the facts. These are the places through which a novel enters and tries to shed a little light.View image in fullscreenThere’s a beautiful line in your book, where you say, I’m interested in continuities and connections. Can I ask you about this? Because I know you have a fascination with coincidence. And the fact that your two characters led parallel lives with all these amazing symmetries: what you have done as a writer is to seek out a shape, a figure, and impose it on these lives. What was that like?PS:It was wondrous. I haven’t enjoyed writing anything as much as I’ve enjoyed writing this. It was a 10-year journey. I started with an instinct when I came across the letter from 1949 in the Otto Wächter archive when I was researchingThe Ratline[about the Nazi Brigadeführer’s life on the run]: three pages, from Rauff to Wächter, saying don’t come to the Arab world, go to South America. I didn’t know who this Rauff was. Then I find that he goes off to Ecuador and ends up in Chile, in Punta Arenas, as the manager of a king-crab cannery. And my brain is saying, wouldn’t it be amazing if there was a connection with Pinochet? Is this coincidence, or is this the litigator’s or some other instinct?But of course, the bigger question on continuities is, could the man who disappeared people in 1941 have played a role in disappearing people in 1974? I had no evidence. As I began to dig, I heard lots of rumours and myths and stories but no hard evidence. But there was something there. We’ve talked about this: you have it when you’re writing and exploring something. I have it when I’m pursuing a case. There was something there, and I chased it and chased it and chased it.JGV:There are so many things in common between the two disciplines. There’s a moment in which you say legal deliberations take place over time, and as days go by, some sort of shape emerges. This is exactly what I do. The same thing that happens when you are deliberating, apparently, is what happens when you write novels. You’re waiting for a figure to come out of the chaos.38 Londres Street: On Impunity, Pinochet in England and a Nazi in Patagonia by Philippe Sands is published by W&N (£25).

For the latest edition of Blue Note’sRe:imaginedseries, in which the jazz label invites artists to produce cover versions of its back catalogue, 15 R&B, pop, soul and jazz artists have been given the unenviable task of interpreting Baker’s repertoire – with often surprising results.The trumpeter-vocalist’s supple take on jazz standards is well reflected in singerDodie’s delicate version ofOld Devil Moonas she emphasises the original’s swaying Latin percussion. British singer-songwriter Matt Maltese’sMy Funny Valentineadds a beautifully elegiac guitar line to the well-worn melody. Other approaches work less well, with US singerMxmtoon’s clean vocal tone overpoweringI Fall In Love Too Easily’s sense of wistful romance.But for every misstep there’s another gem.Ezra Collectivetrumpeter Ife Ogunjobi’s bass-heavy version of the swingingSpeak Lowis a revelation, while Puma Blue’s It’s Always You is unsettlingly dark and reverb-laden.

Its experimental form of creative nonfiction – a memoir that ditches linear narrative, yet races along like a thriller – was hailed as groundbreaking, the book an instant classic. It sold hundreds of thousands of copies, won a swathe of prizes and became one of the most borrowed books in libraries across France when it was published in 2023. The Nobel prize-winning French authorAnnie Ernauxwas so impressed that she made a public appearance in conversation with Sinno, saying: “Reading Sad Tiger is like descending into an abyss with your eyes open. It forces you to see, to really see, what it means to be a child abused by an adult, for years. Everyone should read it.”Now published in English, Sad Tiger – the title is a reference to William Blake’s poem The Tyger – veers between the little girl’s memories of her stepfather blasting French rockerJohnny Hallydayfrom a cassette player as the hippy family restores a house in an Alpine village, and his attacks on her, during a period when he is scratching a living taking on part-time jobs. Sinno combines the inner world of an abuse survivor with a portrait of life in the French mountains. The book is also a study in society’s denial. The stepfather eventually faces trial, serves a prison sentence, remarries and has four more children after his release.Sad Tiger is Sinno’s own story. She invites me into the living room of her rented house in the Basque countryside. Now 47, she is visiting from her home in Michoacan in Mexico, where she has worked as a translator and writer for many years. She is poised and thoughtful and grateful to the#MeToo movementfor forcing space for victims’ voices on child abuse. “It’s great to prove wrong the false idea that no one would be interested in this story,” she says.The forces of denial are enormous. It’s easier to isolate a victim than condemn a perpetratorGiven the book’s massive success in France, it seems bizarre that it was rejected by several publishing houses. One – sorely misjudging French readers – said the public had no interest in another story of family abuse. “In fact we’re just at the start of all there is to analyse and deconstruct around this issue in society,” Sinno continues. “Reflecting on abuse is very intense, very hard, but at the same time … I tried to show the kind of joy, the sense of power that arises when we allow ourselves to talk about it.”The book tells of Sinno’s birth – unassisted – in a remote barn in the Alps to two young drop-outs whose fairytale choice of name for her (Neige means snow) was seen as so strange that the local paper ran a news story on it. Her parents had another daughter, Rose, then separated. Her mother was still grieving the sudden death of a later boyfriend in an avalanche when she met a charismatic 24-year-old on a training course for mountain guides.This charming mountain hero, good in rescue emergencies, swiftly became Neige’s stepfather, showing a different side at home, where he’d have meltdowns if he lost at Monopoly or smash tennis rackets they couldn’t afford to replace. They were poor and he was often in painting overalls doing up the old stone house while the family – which later included two new half-siblings – had to sleep in the damp basement for years. From the age of around six or seven to about 14, Neige, “a little scrap of a thing with scabby knees”, was raped by him. Years later, to protect her younger siblings, she finally spoke out. He partially confessed and was convicted in court.But Sinno does not tell it in that order.“Our memories aren’t linear, our existence isn’t linear,” she says. “I didn’t want to write a straight testimony where you’d only hear a horrible story built on the dread of when the violence would happen.” Instead, she puts the gut-punch of horror at the start to avoid any false suspense. “I say it all in the first page, so we know straight away what it’s about, there’ll be no anxious waiting,” she says.If she built the narrative as more of a “spiral” than a chronological line, it was to convey how child abuse forever circles in an adult survivor’s mind and body. “I can be invaded by the topic for several days and have several conversations with friends, and then it disappears and I think: ‘Oh, I’m done with it now’,” she says. “And then it comes back. And I wanted that to be felt.”The book pairs Sinno’s experiences with an illuminating critique of Vladimir Nabokov’s Lolita, a story which, she says, “overlaps with my own grim history”. Sinno likes Nabokov’s novel for its unusual “deep dive” into the mind of a child rapist. The “narcissistic literary pervert” Humbert Humbert’s “utterly delusional” and completely absurd account of his supposed relationship with a young girl is, she says, a brilliant demonstration of the “mental scaffolding” child-rapists construct to justify themselves. For her, Lolita exposes the true horror of child sexual abuse: a man’s manipulation, coercion and annihilation of a voiceless child.Sinno’s own book begins with an attempt at a portrait of her abusive stepfather. After all, society feels a fascination with trying to understand rapists and serial killers, she says, though she thinks evil, having experienced it, is ultimately “incomprehensible”. These men who “resolve their own profound suffering by dominating a person who is even weaker than they are” never really reveal much about their motives, she says. Even if, like him, they love talking for hours about themselves in front of an audience in court.View image in fullscreenSpeaking out … Sinno.Photograph: Céline Levain/Mirage Collectif for the GuardianHer stepfather – never named in the book – grew up in the Paris suburbs to working-class parents from the northern French coast, left very young for military training in the Alps and stayed for the mountain life, working in “acrobatic labour” on dangerously high construction sites, roped together with other climbers. Later in the book, a lawyer remembers of the trial that he was egotistical, “not uncommon in men with a certain status in the mountaineering world”. Sinno gives a child’s description of him that is chilling in its precision: his skin, his feet, his genitals.He was always charismatic and in prison, before his trial, he received letters and visits from women he didn’t know. He had confessed to parts of his abuse of Neige (though not to every attack) and the women seemed to want to help or save him. As soon as he came out of prison aged about 40 – after serving five years of a nine-year sentence – he went on the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage, where he met a woman he quickly married and they went on to have children.The absurd things he says to manipulate Sinno as a child, and his excuses for what he did, are an unsettling thread through the book. He told the court that she didn’t accept him as a stepfather so this was his only way to get close to her. “He was an expert manipulator, you find that type of personality in violent men in general,” Sinno says. “Their reasoning is not logical, not convincing, doesn’t stand up to analysis, can be completely deconstructed, but, because they have power in your life, when they speak you believe them. They can convince everyone – even if they’re talking rubbish. And a child is at the mercy of an adult’s discourse.”In the book, she recalls what he used to convey to her: “You don’t love me, so I rape you; you’re a good girl, so I rape you; you’ve been naughty, you’ve annoyed me, so I rape you as a punishment; I love you, so I rape you.”At the trial, she writes, his arguments seem surreal. He claims that the poo costume he once wore to Sinno’s school fair was a message to the outside world, telling the court that dressing up in brown with a toilet seat around his waist “was an SOS” and it wasn’t his fault that “no one stopped to wonder why I thought I was a shit!” He blames Neige’s mother, who knew nothing of the abuse, for not picking up on the subliminal message.When Sinno told her mother, years later as a student, that her stepfather had raped her for years, it took her a while to leave her husband, but she eventually did and joined Sinno in legal action against him – their handwritten letters to the state prosecutor are included in the book. “I think that in cases of sexual violence against children, the central problem is denial,”Sinno says. There was denial in the village, where she felt shunned after speaking out. “Everyone wants to shield themselves from the blaze,” she writes.“The forces of denial are enormous, and it’s easier to isolate a victim than to condemn a perpetrator,” Sinno says now. “Even pity is a strategy of exclusion: ‘Oh poor little thing, it’s terrible what happened to her.’ That stops us questioning ourselves, thinking about other aspects, like how we didn’t notice what was going on.”Her book is essentially about the silence of a small child and how that silence is broken. There is a scene when, as a teenager, she’s standing washing dishes at the sink while her mum has tea with a friend. She thinks she could just shout out: “He’s been raping me since I was little.”It is a mistake and a source of suffering to believe in the myth of the survivor like you see in the moviesSinno says, “You’re a child, and gradually as you get a bit older things go click. At the start, you don’t know what it is, that it’s rape, but one day you understand what that word you hear in society means … and it gives you a sense of power – and in that scene where I’m doing the washing up, I can’t say it yet, I’m still oppressed by something that’s too big for me, still forced into silence. But I have that power of understanding. I know what’s been happening to me and one day I’ll say it.”She has never had any kind of psychotherapy – “with my social background, it wasn’t what you did at that time” – which makes her unfiltered account of her mind’s workings very raw, and at times darkly humorous. There are positive moments – such as her sensitive, matter-of-fact way of telling her own daughter her story, including one conversation while they are building a sandcastle at the beach.“Why didn’t you tell your mum?” the child asks.Sinno replies: “I couldn’t. When something like that happens, you can’t tell your mum if she doesn’t ask. It’s very odd. It’s like the words get stuck in your throat, they can’t get out. I think I was scared.”“You were scared he’d kill you?”“Yes.”Child sexual violence is not only about sex, she says, but ultimately about power: using sex “as the most extreme form of domination”, the absolute humiliation of a human being. “It has consequences in every aspect of our being, the deepest parts of ourselves,” she says. “I wanted to show that magnitude.”She knows that her story – with a trial and conviction – is extremely rare in France, and elsewhere. But even so, there is no resolution. “That classic story: a little girl is raped as a child, reports it to police, there’s a trial and conviction and it all ends in court with a kind of victory and resilience, I deconstruct that. That story does exist, it’s my story, but it’s not enough as a narrative, because after the trial, life goes on and behind that story, there are many other stories. It’s not wrong, but it’s insufficient. There is no resolution,” says Sinno. “The trial happens, we think the world has exploded and nothing in society will ever be as it was before. And then it’s back to the usual inertia.”Sinno never moved back to the village, or indeed France. After her stepfather’s trial, surrounded by supportive friends, she returned to her studies in the US, then moved to Mexico, completed a doctorate in literature, worked as a translator and writer, met a “nice man”, and had a daughter. But, as she writes in the book, there can never be a happy ending for someone who was abused as a child: “It is a mistake and a source of suffering to believe in the myth of the survivor like you see in the movies.” She likens surviving child sexual abuse to constantly walking a tightrope, wavering, unsteady, but not quite falling.In Sad Tiger she describes a ghost-like, spectral double world which seems like existing in two universes at once. Some survivorssee it as being akin to the living dead. She says now: “There’s a kind of dissociation … you try to build a reality that would be normal, where you can be functional and live, and that world is incompatible with the other world where you don’t feel alive.”Writing and speaking out can bring some respite. “Shame is a big part of what stops us speaking out,” she says. “But there was this anger inside me which became bigger than shame. The moment you sit down to write, to create, you have no more shame, nothing left to fear, nothing to lose.”Sad Tiger by Neige Sinno, translated by Natasha Lehrer is published by Seven Stories (£14.99).

He presented an award at the Brits, and was part of ITV’s Oscars coverage last month, bemusing viewers with his refreshing honesty. “Whoever at ITV decided to get Jason Isaacs as part of their coverage is a genius,”one fan commented.The intensity of the spotlight has surprised even Isaacs himself, who called it “completely bizarre”. With each of his comments comes a new headline: “Jason Isaacs reveals lost friendships among White Lotus Cast”; “Jason Isaacs calls out double standard for men after prosthetic penis debate” – and shortly after – “Jason Isaacs is sorry about those vulva comments”. “I made a joke about Meryl Streep playing me in a TV series and suddenly it’s been picked up by a hundred thousand websites as if it was a genuine suggestion!” the actorsaid recently.Isaacs plays the southern American patriarch Timothy Ratliff in the third season ofThe White Lotus, Mike White’s Emmy-winning anthology about the psychosocial dysfunctions of guests and staff at a luxury hotel chain. Holidaying in Thailand with his maladjusted family, Ratliff discovers the FBI has raided his office due to his shady business dealings. Cue his agonising psychological breakdown as he pops his wife’s (Parker Posey) lorazepam and fantasises about killing himself with a stolen gun.View image in fullscreenJason Isaacs has played roles such as Lucius Malfoy in the Harry Potter film series during a 30-year career.Photograph: Entertainment Pictures/AlamyIsaacs’ versatility can be traced back to his youth. Born in Liverpool, the third of four sons in a tight-knit Jewish family, he found himself moving through different sociocultural environments – and often adopting the accents of those around him. After moving to London, he attended what was then Haberdashers’ Aske’s boys’ school (alongside David Baddiel, Sacha Baron Cohen and Matt Lucas) before going to the University of Bristol and drama school, where “everyone sounded like Hugh Grant and Liz Hurley”.His career began on television (Capital City, Civvies, Dangerous Lady) and on the stage, where he played the gay Jewish office temp Louis Ironson in Tony Kushner’s Angels in America at the National Theatre, opposite Daniel Craig. “Jason already had the makings of a really extraordinary actor,” the play’s director, Declan Donnellan told the Guardian this week. “His presence was always electric, and his tremendous vitality enabled him to live in the moment with extraordinary spontaneity.”Isaacs landed his first big Hollywood feature film role alongside Laurence Fishburne in the 1997 horror film Event Horizon. After that, he appeared in the Bruce Willis blockbuster Armageddon (1998) as a planet-saving scientist. Despite initially being called upon to play one of the film’s young astronauts, Isaacs chose to honour a previous commitment to Divorcing Jack, the comedy-thriller he was making with David Thewlis. “They go, ‘Jason, you have to understand something: this is a Bruce Willis project. I went, ‘Well, you know, this is a David Thewlis project’,” he recalled.This desire to take on roles that interest him over the most obvious ones has become something of a modus operandi. “I’ve been to Sundance with eight films, and only one of them came out,” hesaid in 2018. Christopher Anthony, the writer and director of the upcoming indie film Heavyweight, which features Isaacs as a boxing promoter, said “having an actor of Jason’s calibre still willing to do a film for the love of the craft and the writing on the page” was a gift to the whole industry.Isaac’s big-screen breakthrough came a few years after Armageddon in Roland Emmerich’s revolutionary war drama The Patriot, where his turn as the villainous British colonel who kills Mel Gibson’s character’s son made him a go-to bad guy for casting directors. He went on to join the Harry Potter cinematic universe as Lucius Malfoy and played the dual roles of Captain Hook and Mr Darling in Universal’s Peter Pan movie.View image in fullscreenJason Isaacs in the 2003 Peter Pan film, in which he played Captain Hook and Mr Darling.Photograph: Universal/AllstarAfter Peter Pan bombed Isaacs returned to TV, playing the lead in the Showtime series Brotherhood, and receiving his first Golden Globe nomination for the BBC’s The State Within. There was also Netflix’s The OA and Paramount+’s Star Trek: Discovery. It was his small-screen performances that led to him being cast as Field Marshal Georgy Zhukov in Armando Iannucci’s 2017 political satire, The Death of Stalin.“I first remember seeing Jason in Brotherhood, and I had no idea he was English – his character felt so real,” Iannucci said. Though the writer had Isaacs down “as a gangland leader in 90s America”, he was pleasantly surprised to find him funny too. “You can come across the most brilliant actor in the world and give them some comedy to do and they freeze. Whereas Jason has that innate ability. He could improvise, stay in character, and came up with 101 different suggestions.”The actor has also charmed people with his dad-like posts on Instagram, where he shares behind-the-scenes photos of the cast like a family vacation album. And his onscreen sons in The White Lotus have paid tribute to his fatherly manner during filming. Patrick Schwarzenegger, who plays Saxon, said Isaacs “became a mentor and quite literally a father figure for me … he helped me work through scenes when I felt stuck and he spent a lot of time building the father relationship to us kids”.View image in fullscreenThe Death of Stalin director Armando Iannucci’s praised Isaacs’ ‘inate ability’.Photograph: Nicola Dove/Panache ProductionsAnd Sam Nivola, who plays younger son Lochlan, called Isaacs “an exemplary actor and role model” and “truly family”. “He was our imaginary family’s glue, always funny, never took himself too seriously despite his inspiring and infectious talent, and was always a generous and caring scene partner,” Nivola said. “He made me feel supported at my lowest, but wasn’t scared of busting my balls at my highest!”Ahead of its finale on Sunday, the internet isawash with speculation about how season three of The White Lotus will end. A lot of it revolves around Ratliff: that he will be shot by a member of his own family; that he will find spiritual enlightenment. It is presumed the series, which has become renowned for reviving actors’ careers – Jennifer Coolidgehas spoken often about her newfound fameafter the first two seasons – will finally cement Isaacs’ place in the spotlight.But whether the actor wants that is another question. As hetold Vanity Fairrecently: “I like to be out in the world amongst people, and – this sounds perverse – I don’t like being looked at. Certainly as myself.”Explore more on these topicsJason IsaacsThe White LotusfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And Barack Obama came to meet us,” Amadou told AFP in a 2024 interview.“We talked a bit. Barack Obama told us that he liked our music. Malian music, too. We were very, very happy,” Mariam added.Besides a Grammy nomination in 2010, Amadou & Mariam won prizes at the BBC radio awards and France’s Victoires de la Musique.Amadou Bagayoko is survived by three children.Explore more on these topicsAmadou and MariamMaliAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Perhaps there’s an alternative out there, a sharper, smarter, funnier version of aMinecraftmovie. One with actual jokes. Or, God forbid, there may even be a worse iteration, although that’s hard to imagine. What becomes clear is that one of the key elements in the game’s popularity – the latitude it affords gamers to create their own experience – is a big stumbling block for any film adaptation ofMinecraft.In the absence of a single fixed storyline the screenplay can follow,A Minecraft Moviehas a cobbled-together feel, borrowing a device fromJumanji: Welcome to the Jungle–and, in Jack Black, a star – and superimposing an all-purpose quest-for-an-artefact structure on to a colour-saturated backdrop of cube-shaped vegetation, pink sheep and lax building regulations.Directed byNapoleon Dynamitefilm-maker Jared Hess (delivering a watered-down version of the nerdcore quirkiness of hisGentlemen Broncos-era work), the picture follows four misfits: orphaned siblings Henry (Sebastian Hansen) and his older sister, Natalie (Emma Myers); Dawn (Danielle Brooks), an estate agent with a mobile zoo; and debt-ridden Garrett (Jason Momoa), an arcade game champion whose glory days are long past. The four are sucked through a portal to the Overworld, where they meet Steve (Black) – inMinecraft,one of the main playable characters; in the film, a purveyor of exposition and overacting. The villain, a piglin called Malgosha who hates creativity and is obsessed with hoarding wealth, provides an inadvertently neat allegory for the studio bosses who greenlit this egregious IP cash-in.In UK and Irish cinemasWatch a trailer for A Minecraft Movie.Explore more on these topicsFilmThe ObserverGamesMinecraftJack BlackAnimation in filmAction and adventure filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

We’re just two tracks in; Tempest assures us that if the electronics are not back up soon, they’ll do the whole show a cappella.They could, too. The teenage Tempest cut their teeth battle-rapping in south London, turning to slam poetry when more direct avenues into hip-hop refused to open easily to a young, blond slip of a thing. You suspect they have never wasted the opportunity when handed a mic. Given Tempest’s extended output over more than a decade of albums, works of fiction, poems, plays and nonfiction, with prizes and accolades for many of them – you can’t imagine them ever being at a loss for words either.In the end, the cult classic 2025 Tempest a cappella set doesn’t materialise. But throughout the remainder of their show the primacy of words is never in doubt, even as a trio of backing vocalists coo and sway, and instrumentalist Pops Roberts eventually conjures up slick, big-stage sounds from their rig.Displayed on the screens is Tempest’s key message: ‘I’d be more worried if we weren’t disturbed’Tonight’s intimate set concludes a short run of gigs; there’s also a recent new track – the hard-hitting Statue in the Square, out three weeks ago – Tempest’s first new music since 2022. If the signals all point to a new album campaign, five new tracks tonight confirm that Tempest’s emphasis on more personal writing continues. It’s a direction of travel that crystallised post-pandemic with their last musical outing, 2022’sThe Line Is a Curve, then swerved into the 2023 poetry collection,Divisible By Itself and One,and came to its most public fruition in a revealing BBCArenadocumentary. A career overview,Being Kae Tempest(2023) also featured candid mentions of hormones and surgery – not least the effect testosterone might have on Tempest’s voice.Their work has always examined where the personal and the political intertwine; how, as per the pithy takedowns of their 2017 trackPerfect Coffee, “the squats we used to party in are the flats we can’t afford”. Their discomfort in, and dismay at, the world has been a constant feature. Butsince coming out as non-binary in 2020, Tempest’s pen – previously given to vignettes about other people – has increasingly taken on their evolving selfhood.“This is how the new album begins,” says Tempest, launching unaccompanied into a new lyric about the pain of keeping their gender identity a secret for fear that their career would be over; and the relief at finally becoming themselves, an unburdening despite the “bitterness” they encounter when “using the facilities”. Tempest doesn’t mention it, but this gig takes place on International Transgender Day of Visibility. They start the gig in a boxy suit and eventually reveal a white vest top. “I adore us,” they rhyme, “I do everything for us.”Watch the video for Statue in the Square by Kae Tempest.A sense of community is the stated upside to the many difficulties Tempest details in these new tracks. Statue in the Square is more direct still, about how LGBTQ+ figures, denigrated now, will be memorialised in the future, the murky sense of threat in the music (the track was co-produced by A-lister Fraser T Smith) matched by the flames licking Tempest’s words. A fast-paced rap at the heart of the track feels like a throwback to those squat party, mic-passing days.Identity is not Tempest’s only theme, of course. Many of tonight’s lyrics remain furious and despairing of the state of the nation. Another new song remembers someone who is gone; a third, both tender and chilling, finds Tempest wishing they could go back in time to guard a child’s door overnight.View image in fullscreen‘Additional vocal texture’: Kae Tempest at Village Underground.Photograph: Andy Hall/the ObserverBut yet another track reels off a set of conditions and acronyms – “PTSD, ADHD, OCD” – before slyly noting that, with so many letters flying around, it’s handy Tempest turned down their OBE. Displayed on the screens is Tempest’s key message: “I’d be more worried if we weren’t disturbed.” On this evidence at least, Tempest’s forthcoming fifth album is shaping up to be very timely indeed – a mainstream-courting record with a lot to say.Direct, plain-speaking art has a long and powerful history, particularly at times when standing up to be counted against hatred feels like an imperative. And Tempest is a brave artist who does not mince their words. But there are times in the set where Tempest and the choir do a little elegant call and response, or when fellow south Londoner Tawiah – whom Tempest credits with tonight’s vocal arrangements – comes onstage with some additional vocal texture, where space and musicality take over from the laser focus on words.Fortunately, too, there are tracks such asGrace– fromThe Line Is a Curve,set against an arpeggiating guitar line – that don’t just plug into love, joy and suffering as universals; they do it a little more obliquely, a little more surreptitiously. It all ends with People’s Faces, Tempest’s 2019 track, and an invocation that is hard to disagree with: “More empathy, less greed, more respect.”Explore more on these topicsKae TempestKitty Empire's artist of the weekSpoken wordRapreviewsShareReuse this content"

This lacerating, exhilarating debut novel, written almost entirely in South Yorkshire dialect, spans nearly 20 years in the lives of its protagonists Kel, Shaz and Rach, from the Spice Girls to the drug spice. It manages to be both boisterous and bleak, life-enhancing and life-denying, familiar and yet wholly original. It feels essential. You will probably read nothing else like it this year.“Remember when we thought Donny wut whole world? Before we knew we wa Northern, when we seemed to be central, when we carved countries out ut farmers’ fields, biking through neck-high rapeseed, cutting tracks … ask anyone non-Northern, they’ll only know Donny as punchline of a joke, or place they changed trains once ont way to London.” The novel begins as a chorus, musing and retrospective, forcefully acerbic. Each chapter relays a separate, nonlinear, intensely involving incident. Sometimes a rueful, omniscient plural “we” is used; more often second- and first-person narratives spill out from one of the trio. In one chapter the girls’ names are changed to the characters they play in a school production of Romeo and Juliet, without identifying who is who.It’s heavy reading, and yet in Brown’s hands the material somehow spins lighterIt’s impossible to know where these stories will lead, and that is what makes the book fresh and exciting; just as it is occasionally unclear who is speaking. Where does the group end, and individual autonomy begin? One moment the three are loyal to the death, a tight-knit gang; the next fractured, angry and isolated. Brown lays bare what it is like to grow up a working-class girl in a small northern English city that has seen decades pass with little notion of “levelling up”.We first encounter the girls at 15, queueing to get into a nightclub in nearby Sheffield. It is 2002. Later, we learn they’ve been clubbing since the age of 11, so-called Nappy Nights at their local in Donny. Sheffield is the big night out and they’ve dressed up accordingly: “us three stomped in doors in stripper heels … we arrived shoulders back, tits out, ready for the rave of our lives”.At 6am, hungover and more (“Shaz had a little baggie of Es … Pills slipped down us throats”), the three dodge the fare for the 20 miles back to Doncaster by hiding in a train toilet. It’s here that the implicit hierarchy that marks their bond becomes clear – Rach is the better-off one, with a traditional family, house, car; Kel and Shaz are from single-parent homes, scraping by. Kel never knew her dad; Shaz grieves over the early death of hers. Shaz lives in the “rougher” end of town. Rach and Kel are firmly set on getting out, away, to university. For Shaz, the options are narrower. Brown, who now lives in the US, writes starkly about the lack of dignity for those forever trapped in the gig economy or worse. It’s these subtle differences, and the terrible secret one of the girls withholds from the others, that will determine their life choices and the gripping course of the novel.Brown’s language is poetic and rhythmic, physical and distinct; it rarely falters apart from one or two very un-Donny-like Americanisms. Misogyny is ingrained from the off, and ugly. In the first chapter, Victory, a sadistic male sports teacher makes the girls play the boys at football in a snowstorm; this is not a game, rather a battle, ancient and bloody. The sense of danger and conflict rages throughout: Kel’s first boyfriend calls her “munter”; at the book’s centre is a serious sexual assault. It’s heavy reading, and yet in Brown’s hands the material somehow spins lighter. While the novel ends ambiguously, it’s also a reminder that in that long-ago football match, the girls’ side triumphed: “We said, fuck this!”Catherine Taylor’s memoir The Stirrings is published by Weidenfeld & Nicolson.We Pretty Pieces of Flesh by Colwill Brown is published by Chatto & Windus (£16.99).

Plus, heartfelt Mahler and a star mezzo’s WinterreiseFiona MaddocksSat 5 Apr 2025 08.00 EDTShareAt a talk about Pierre Boulez (1925-2016) at the Barbican last Sunday, one of the speakers dared suggest that the BBC is no longer the cultural beacon it was in the French composer-conductor’s lifetime. The exhalation of oufs and pffs from the audience – reminiscent of one of those short, avant-garde pieces consisting only of outbursts of breath that Boulez himself might have written – was indicative: part you’re stating the obvious, part how can you say the unsayable in a discussion being broadcast on BBC Radio 3. After some hasty throat clearing, the matter was clarified: other platforms now exist, from YouTube to Spotify to TikTok to all the rest. We are our own curators. The very next day, tacitly acknowledging its changed status, the BBC admitted it faced anunprecedented financial challenge, with an annual income drop of £1bn compared with 15 years ago. Its chair, Samir Shah, said (among other things) that the BBC still had a vital role as “the place where people come together for unforgettable shared moments”.Later this month, the new season of Proms, the biggest coming together for classical music, will be announced. The BBC orchestras and BBC Singers, endangered for as long as anyone can remember, will play a central part. However sceptical we may be about aspects of Radio 3, or its new sibling,Classical Unwind– designed to awaken the senses and simultaneously relax you into sleep – their very presence is still remarkable. This thought pressed constantly, and urgently, atTotal Immersion: Pierre Boulez, an all-dayBBC Symphony Orchestratribute to the brilliant and paradoxical maverick who, in his time as the ensemble’s chief conductor (1971-74), shook up concert life – including the Proms, with hisRoundhouse series.Always radical, he celebrated intellectual rigour and scorned anything out of line with his thinking: famously, at one time, opera houses he wanted to burn down and Tchaikovsky, whose music he claimed to hate. As a conductor, his quest was for transparency and precision, and an avoidance of any emotion that did not grow directly from the music. His own works, glittering and complex yet more sensuous than he himself might have realised, came only after long struggles and endless revisions.View image in fullscreen‘Crystalline’: Tamara Stefanovich.Photograph: Mark AllanThe BBC SO day, which included the pianistTamara Stefanovich’s crystalline accounts of12 Notations(1945) andIncises(1994, revised 2001), culminated inPli selon pli, a 70-minute epic that, withLe Marteau sans maître, is Boulez’s acknowledged masterpiece. Here it was conducted by Martyn Brabbins and performed with consummate skill by all. The title translates as Fold Upon Fold, from a poem by Boulez’s favourite poet, Mallarmé, in which mist recedes to reveal the city of Bruges.Boulez revised it six times between 1957 and 2003. It requires us to rethink what an orchestra is, making it expensive to perform: instead of the usual forces, each instrument is, in effect, hand-picked. A soprano soloist – here the pure-toned Anna Dennis – sings brief texts, scaling an ensemble that jangles and shimmers with multiple harps, guitar, mandolin, celesta, tubular bells and 30 types of percussion. “That was fantastic, but when will it ever happen again?” someone asked me, noticing my programme as I got off the tube. I have no idea. It felt like stepping back in history, to a period of stern but invigorating musical cubism that liberated younger generations, among them the British composersHarrison Birtwistleand George Benjamin. Who will now take the Boulez legacy forward is an unanswered question.View image in fullscreenMezzo-soprano Jennifer Johnston, Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and Choirs perform Mahler 3.Photograph: Gareth JonesOne of his passions was Mahler, especially the later symphonies. Through concerts and recordings he was a pioneer in sparking the modern reappraisal. Boulez’s particular interest was in Mahler’s expansion of symphonic form – a bit of an understatement as a phrase, since none of the nine (complete) is short, and the Third is reckoned the longest in standard repertory, lasting up to 110 minutes. Given that it self-confessedly embraces all the world, it could be deemed a bit brief. No watch-checking was required in theRoyal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra’s heartfelt performance in the Philharmonic Hall, under the baton of their charismatic chief conductor,Domingo Hindoyan.The occasion, with the sopranos and altos of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Choir and the Liverpool Philharmonic Youth Choir, had heightened emotion, since it marked the retirement, after 16 years as chief executive, of one of the most admired orchestral administrators around,Michael Eakin. Tempos tended towards the broad, but atmosphere and detail shone out, ebbing and flowing through the six movements, from rustic dance to Nietzschean nocturne. The soloistJennifer Johnston, herself a Liverpudlian, is the mezzo-soprano of choice for the glowing intensity of O Mensch. The big trombone solo, menacing, low and insistent in the huge opening movement, was impeccably played. So too was the offstage post horn, calling as if from a distant Austro-Bohemian peak.View image in fullscreenSeizing the narrative… Joyce DiDonato and fortepianist Maxim Emelyanychev perform Schubert's Winterreise at Wigmore Hall.Photograph: Darius WeinbergFrom massed orchestra and chorus to one singer and one pianist is less of leap than might appear: Schubert, admired (mostly) by his fellow Austrian Mahler, also explored long form, in his late piano sonatas, and especially in the song cycleWinterreise.Joyce DiDonatorecorded it with theconductor-pianist Yannick Nézet-Séguinin 2021. At Wigmore Hall she sang it – twice in one evening – with another regular collaborator, conductor and keyboard virtuosoMaxim Emelyanychev, here playing a fortepiano.This earlier instrument transfigured the piano part, now more clipped, alert, imperative. DiDonato has, lightly and unobtrusively, with use of a small desk and book, suggested a historical setting for these 24 songs of loss and love, written for male voice. The shifts in feeling, as well as the deepening and whitening of vocal colour, could have a column to themselves. As only she could – whoever utters anything afterWinterreise? – the “Yankee Diva” spoke a few words and gave us an encore: Richard Strauss’s Morgen! Nothing to add to that.Star ratings (out of five)Pierre Boulez★★★★Mahler Symphony No 3★★★★★Joyce DiDonato and Maxim Emelyanychev★★★★Explore more on these topicsClassical musicThe ObserverBBC Symphony OrchestraRoyal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestralive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Before becoming a published novelist in her 50s, she worked a variety of odd jobs including bricklayer, technical writer and secretary, also running a postpunk zine. In 2014, with the help of Jonathan Franzen, she published her debut novelThe Wallcreeper, followed closely byMislaid,which was longlisted for a National Book Award. Her seventh novel,Sister Europe, out 24 April, charts the unravelling of a Berlin high-society party – Vogue called it “a worldly hangout novel of 21st-century manners”. Zink, a committed birder, lives outside Berlin.View image in fullscreen1. BookHope Against Hope by Nadezhda MandelstamThis is the book that’s keeping me cheerful. It is just impossible to feel sorry for yourself if you’re reading the memoirs of Nadezhda Mandelstam, whose poet husband Osip died in the transit camp to the Siberian gulag in 1938. She is incredibly wise and stoical on dealing with this Stalinist terror of the 1930s, and writes about it really beautifully, with a deep belief in humanism and a constant critique of using people as means to an end. Reading about what it was like to be on the run from Joseph Stalin, you think, wait a second, I don’t have it so bad.2. OperaTristan und Isolde at Staatstheater Cottbus, Germany, until 4 MayView image in fullscreenTristan und Isolde at Staatstheater Cottbus.Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/AlamyI have seen three different productions of this Wagner opera in three different places in the past year or so, and the hands-down winner was the production in Cottbus, because they took it seriously. It was a straight-up production, which the Brechtian ones in Dessau and Berlin were not. The finale was so beautiful and moving that the audience had tears in their eyes. And the theatre in Cottbus is a beautiful art nouveau building – a real destination – where the best seats in the house are €32. It’s worth a trip, andTristan und Isoldeis playing again soon.3. ArtVaginal Davis: Fabelhaftes Produkt at the Gropius Bau, Berlin, Germany, until 14 SeptemberView image in fullscreen‘She has that ironic, pop-cultural, intertextual aesthetic down cold’: Vaginal Davis.Photograph: Catherine Opie, Courtesy of Regen Projects, Los Angeles and Lehmann Maupin, New York, London, Hong Kong and SeoulVaginal Davis is a queer drag performer from LA who absolutely has that ironic, pop-cultural, intertextual aesthetic down cold and walks a tightrope over punk and drag, combining the two while always annoying somebody on either side. She’s also a photographer and film-maker, and just somebody who is very creative and constantly churning out material that’s funny and beautifully pointed. She moved to Berlin 20 years ago and now there’s a solo show of her work – including some large-scale installations – at the Gropius Bau in Berlin. I haven’t seen it yet but it’ll be extremely interesting.4. FestivalLit Link, CroatiaLit Link is the most brilliant literary festival put on by two Croatians. They invited me to speak years ago and then again in 2023. They pick different countries each year – this time it’s Sweden and Norway – inviting not only writers from those countries but also editors and translators. They rent a van and go from Zagreb down to Istria, and it’s just insanely pretty. Last time we stopped in Labin, a jewel of a hill town with an adorable little theatre looking out over the Adriatic. It’s fun to ride around in a van and go to these unbelievably beautiful places and then read to the Croatians.5. BirdNightingaleView image in fullscreen‘It’s important to have nightingales pestering you every night.’Photograph: AlamyIt’s the time of year to hear nightingales, but they are threatened because people keep their gardens and public parks too tidy. A nightingale needs thick underbrush in which to build a nest where no one can see it. The nightingale’s song is never what people think it is. It’s great by the standards of the Romantic era when people sang in an incredibly sappy way that today we’d probably find unbearable. He’s super-horny and whiny, like, “Pleeeease, baby, please”. But it’s important to have nightingales pestering you every night, starting in April, so don’t rake up the leaves or trim the hedges; let things get a bit chaotic.6. ObjectNebra Sky Disc at the Landesmuseum für Vorgeschichte, Halle, GermanyView image in fullscreen‘The oldest depiction of the night sky that we have on Earth.’Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PAThis is one of these precious artefacts found by accident by guys with metal detectors in Germany and it’s apparently the oldest depiction of the night sky that we have on Earth, dating back to 1800-1600BC. I saw it for the first time recently and it’s really gorgeous – a blue-green bronze disc with gold symbols of sun, moon and stars. They went out of their way to give it a dramatic setting in the Halle prehistory museum, with beautiful lighting and really good information. Halle is a nice town with an art academy that’s worth a visit. Having art students in a town improves it, I think.Explore more on these topicsCultureOn my radarBirdsOperaArtMuseumsFestivalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She recommendsCamping Trevélezin the Alpujarras, Granada. “Surrounded by the snowy peaks of the Sierra Nevada and at around 1,550 metres above sea level, this is the highest campsite in mainland Spain and has extraordinary stargazing,” she says. “It is a great base for hiking to mountain villages or snowy Mulhacén, peninsular Spain’s highest peak, with several mountain lakes known as the Siete Lagunas.” There are 100 shady pitches (as well as wooden cabins and rustic houses) to stay in over winter, plus a pool, shop and bar/restaurant.From€6 for a tent plus €6 adults, open year-round,campingtrevelez.comLake swimming, AustriaView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Michael RudolfKerry Walker and Luke Waterson, the authors ofUnder the Stars Europe, have unearthed some of the best camping and glamping spots across 22 countries. One of their favourite finds isPetzen Camping and Glamping, which “occupies a “dreamy spot on the shores of Pirkdorfer See … where the wooded mountains of southern Carinthia ripple into Slovenia.”Campers have views of Petzen (2,125 metres), the highest of the eastern Karawanks, and can swim in the lake’s “warm, placid waters” or the natural swimming pool. There is a restaurant serving regional food, a tree sauna, campfire area and playground; paddleboards and pedal boats are available to rent.

And, say Walker and Waterson, state campsites are free. Thesesites, run by RMK, the Estonian body for forest management, are pretty wild, so they don’t have showers, electric hook-ups or flushing toilets, but they usually have fire pits, picnic tables and compost loos. There are hundreds of sites to choose from in amazing locations, butHirmuste Telkimisalaon Hiiumaa, Estonia’s second-biggest island, is hard to beat. Campers can pitch their tents on a beach backed by pine forests, and watch the sun set over the sea.Free, open year-round,rmk.eeWilderness camping, SwedenView image in fullscreenAnother area loved by Walker and Waterson is theGlaskogennature reserve in Värmland, south-central Sweden, a forest with more than 80 lakes. Wild camping is allowed (you can stay up to two days in the same spot) but there is a “wilderness campsite” offering a few more comforts at the tiny settlement of Lenungshammar. They describe it as “a lush plot bounding two lakeshores”, with tent pitches separated by trees. There are also more than 60 pitches for caravans and motorhomes in forest groves, all with their own fire pits and many next to the lake. The site has a sauna, shop, cafe and canoe/kayak rental, and there are nature trails to explore.From about£7.70, open year-round,glaskogen.seIsland escape, FranceHuttopia campsites are in locations by lakes, forests, rivers, seas and mountains, mainly in France. Its experts have selectedHuttopia Noirmoutieras one of the best places to reconnect with nature. This beachfront campsite, on the Isle de Noirmoutier in the Vendée, is between sea, forest and salt marsh. The site stretches for nearly a mile along Sableaux beach, and it is 1.2 miles to the village. Onsite there is a food truck selling ice-creams and pizzas, a small shop, and bikes and paddleboards for hire.

Campers can pitch their own tents or small campervans (no motorhomes) or book a tipi, covered wagon, tree tent or even a bed in the forest. The owners describe the camp as “wild, romantic and rustic”, with furniture made from tree trunks, a large communal fire pit and an upcycled sauna. There are signposted trails to viewpoints, a swimming lake, a 12-mile walk, and workshops such as herbal foraging.From€9adults, plus from€3a tent, open30 April-6 Octoberfor camping, year-round for some glamping,waldcamping-thalheim.deEurope’s highest campsite, SwitzerlandView image in fullscreenCamping Arollain the Val d’Hérens lays claim to being Europe’s highest campsite, at 1,950 metres above sea level. The view, as you might expect, is sensational. “Meadows lift the gaze to pine and larch forests and the ragged, glacier-snared summits of the Valais Alps,” say Walker and Waterson. “The eco-aware site makes the most of its natural surrounds and grandstand vista, with grassy pitches elevated above the glacial stream of Borgne d’Arolla.” There is a choice of camping or glamping (including tents suspended between the trees), a shop selling organic local produce and fresh bread, and a help-yourself herb garden. Hiking is the name of the game here, from short walks to alpine huts for lunch, to long-distance trails such as the Chamonix to Zermatt Haute route or the Matterhorn tour.Fromabout £6.40 for tents, plus £7.70 adults, open1 June-26 October,en.camping-arolla.chSurf camp, PortugalView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Pedro PereiraTheSalema Eco Campis a short walk (or a free transfer) from a surfing beach, Praia da Salema, on the Algarve’s south-west coast. Walker and Waterson recommend pitching your tent under the “lofty pines”, while glampers can choose from tipis, safari tents and lodges. There is a shop selling picnic and barbecue food, a restaurant serving local dishes and a rental service for surf gear and mountain bikes. The camp is a regenerative tourism project helping to restore the local ecosystem and is working towards zero waste: it has its own wastewater treatment plant and composting system. There are weekly butterfly tours and workshops on topics such as plant propagation.From€7 for tents, plus €6 adults, open year-round,salemaecocamp.comCamping in a fortress, DenmarkFor a campsite with a difference, Love recommendsCamping Charlottenlund Fort– 65 pitches within a 19th-century fortress. The fort is on the Øresund (strait), with a beach on one side and a forest on the other, and only 25 minutes by bike into Copenhagen. The kitchen and bathrooms are in the old casemates (chambers from which guns were fired), and there is a cafe selling bread and pastries. The fort was built in 1887 and was part of Copenhagen’s sea fortification until 1932. It is now a protected monument. From a bench at the highest point, visitors can see Sweden across the water.About £7 for a tent, plus £13.50 for adults,open11 April-19 October,campingcopenhagen.dkExplore more on these topicsCamping holidaysTop 20sEurope holidaysSelf-cateringSummer holidaysFamily holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And when her son was born she couldn’t wait to share the Iraqi Jewish food of her ancestors. Unfortunately, he had other ideas …Samantha EllisSat 5 Apr 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 5 Apr 2025 05.02 EDTShareMy family takes food very seriously. So seriously that when my mother’s family leftIraqin 1971, limited to 20kg of luggage each, they found room for not one but two rolling pins. The truth is that, having used the rolling pins, I think they were right. Born in England, I grew up on my father’s stories, too, of going to a Baghdadstreet stall to buy hotsamoon, Iraqi bread shaped like a teardrop, with a puffy middle and a crunchy crust, withamba(mango pickle) oozing out of it. But he left Baghdad even earlier, in 1951, in a mass airlift along with most of Iraq’s Jews. I grew up in Britain, homesick for a place I’ve never been to, and will probably never see. There are now just three Jews left in Iraq.Scattered across the world, we didn’t have much from Iraq, but we did have the recipes, which we clung to like a life raft. We didn’t just eat together but often cooked together, too. One of my earliest, happiest memories is of sitting under the Formica table in my grandmother’s kitchen at maybe three or four, and pulling the stalks off parsley so my mother and aunt could maketabbouleh. When, decades later, I was finally about to become a mother myself, I was excited about sharing Iraqi Jewish food with my son. Maybe he’d even want to be my tiny sous chef! Maybe he’d liketabboulehas much as I did. We make itvivid green with barely any bulgur in it (I was confused when I first saw the pots of beige in the supermarket because they looked nothing like the salad I’d grown up with). Maybe he’d loveingriyi(fried aubergine slices layered with fried lamb or beef and sliced tomato, and simmered with turmeric, lemon juice and date syrup); andtbeet, which just means “overnight” because it was an ingenious dish developed to get around the restrictions on lighting fires or turning on ovens on Shabbat. The flame was kept very low, and chicken and rice were cooked through the nightwith cardamom, cinnamon and cloves, with eggs tucked around the chicken till they went a deep brown. I imagined if I made himkitchri, rice with red lentils, garlic, turmeric, cumin, tomato, melting onions, so much butter and melting slabs of halloumi, and thick yoghurt spooned over the top, he’d sayashteedek(long live your hands) in our language, Judeo-Iraqi Arabic, and understand me when I repliedawafi(to your health).I wish I’d known when he was born that it was an old Iraqi tradition to put a date in a baby’s mouth so their first taste of life was sweet. Maybe this was where I first went wrong. Because for a long time we didn’t have theashteedek/awaficonversation, not just because he doesn’t know the language, and not even because it is going extinct, but because, to my chagrin, he would not eventrymost of my favourite dishes.It was about relishing big flavours and the complexity of sweet and sour, hamedh-helu, which is the Iraqi flavourThis hurdle was unexpected. Before I became a mother, I secretly judged parents who let their children subsist on white bread and pea-and-pesto pasta. It served me right, because my son – now eight years old – won’t even eat pesto. I have to dredge his spaghetti with cheese (not even parmesan; cheddar) and he’ll have the peas but only on the side. Like Sally in When Harry Met Sally, on the side is a very big thing for him.He rejects tomatoes except on pizza and in ketchup, and, with the same exceptions, anything he calls “sauce”. Aubergines and courgettes are a hard no. I thought all children liked the Middle Eastern staples, hummus and yoghurt, but not mine. And, because for a long time he also had a blanket ban on soup, I could not get him to eat my ultimate comfort food: lentil soup, made with red lentils, onion, lemon, cumin and turmeric. I really tried with that soup. When he complained it had “bits” in, I blitzed it smooth. I tried making it without a lemon, then without an onion. I even sacrilegiously added cheese and called it “sunshine soup”. Still no.View image in fullscreenSamantha Ellis’ grandfather’s family in Basra, c1930.Photograph: courtesy of Samantha EllisMeanwhile, he showed an early fondness for fish fingers and Marmite (not together), foods I have never been able to get my head around. Of course, I didn’t mind him eating food thatwasn’tIraqi. I wanted him to honour that side of his heritage, too, to fit in in England, and I didn’t want him to find school dinners as alien as I did. And I am happy if he eats (almost) anything because, it turns out, I’m horrified to admit, that I am not just a mother but that sitcom cliche, a Jewish mother. However, it satisfied me in another, deeper way when he enjoyed something Iraqi.It wasn’t about nutrition – he ate a healthy-ish diet – but about other kinds of nourishment, which I could hardly name. It was about feeling part of a story, about belonging. It was about relishing big flavours – and maybe also big feelings – and the complexity of sweet and sour,hamedh-helu, which istheIraqi flavour. (It’s tempting to make a link between this complexity, its bittersweetness and the country’s complicated history, but not everything has to be a metaphor.) My son’s rather limited, bland diet reminded me of a joyless time in my own life, when I didn’t eat Iraqi Jewish food either. After girls at school made fun of my packed lunches (of pitta bread, eggs, fried aubergine slices, hummus and tomato), like a coward I switched to white bread and cream cheese, which I ate every day for years – is this why I am only 5ft 3in? My parents gave me a rice cooker to take to university, but like a fool I let it gather dust due to embarrassment and impostor syndrome. How could I cook the food when I was born in England not Iraq, couldn’t belly dance, wasnota demon at backgammon, and couldn’t stammer out more than a few phrases in the language? There was a psychic cost to denying myself proper rice, and I felt more and more disconnected until, eventually, in my 20s, I found my way back to cooking Iraqi food, and something shifted. I started unfurling, feeling more at home, more like me. I wanted this for my son, too. So I kept on trying.View image in fullscreen‘When my mum told me she was making my six-year-old sonkubba shwandar, I thought,“Good luck with that”.’Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The ObserverI tried, even though Iraqi food is incredibly labour-intensive, and more experienced parents warned me that the more effort you put into cooking for your child, and the more desperate you are for them to like it, the more likely it is that they’ll reject it. I madezangoola, dough rosettes deep-fried and dunked in syrup scented with rosewater and orange flower water, which he deemed “too sticky”. I baked “black eggs”, as we called them, although they were actually brown from being baked overnight, and he found them “weird”. For years I chased a fruitIhadn’t even tasted, thenabug(a variety of jujube), which grows everywhere in Baghdad but is almost impossible to get in the UK. When I managed to get my hot little hands on a small punnet of them, my older relatives went into nostalgic raptures, but my son said he’d rather have a Haribo. It was hard not to take it personally.I didn’t want to pass on every single dish. There is a recipe that involves stuffing raw cow intestines with meat and herbs and then sewing them up before cooking them. Having done the sewing once, I don’t think I could cook or eat them again, still less inflict them on my child. And I’ll confess there is another delicacy I have never enjoyed: pickled turnips. But the thought of him never learning to love mango pickle kept me up at night.Ambais my community’s sticky, DayGlo yellow essence, a permanent fixture on our kitchen tables, in tall bottles marked with green “Ship Brand” labels warning us to “BEWARE OF IMITATIONS”. As a child I was convinced that the ship pictured on the label was Sinbad the Sailor’s. And this was another reason I wanted to pass on the food – because with the food came the stories. But it wasn’t Sinbad’s story that made me anxious; it was Siegfried Sassoon’s. Becauseamba’sorigin myth is that it was invented by Sassoon’s great-grandfather David Sassoon who was born in Baghdad in 1793,loved Indian mangoes so much that he wanted to find a way of exporting them to Baghdad, had the brainwave of pickling them, and madeambathe iconic Iraqi Jewish pickle. And the tragedy is that his poet great-grandson probably never tasted it. Siegfried grew up in England, almost totally deracinated, a stranger to his Iraqi Jewish family, and arguably also to himself. Throughout his life he wrestled with his identity, coming across as quintessentially English – his autobiographical novel was even called Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man – but worrying on the page and in private about who he was and where he came from. Would Sassoon have had an easier time if he had known more about his culture, if he had tastedamba? Could you truly beIraqi Jewish if you didn’t love it?Although I groaned when he told me I had to make enough makhboose that same evening for his whole class, I was proud tooAll wasn’t totally lost. When I made a list of all the foods my son would eat and stuck it on the fridge, I was encouraged by how many were Iraqi or at least Iraqi-adjacent. He loves dates, and velvety black date syrup (from Basra, of course), which he drizzles perhaps slightly too enthusiastically on pancakes, leaving sticky puddles on the table. He only agreed to try pomegranate seeds because he was going through a pirate phase and I served them in his Playmobil treasure chest and claimed they were edible jewels – but they’re still on the list. Olives were an early hit, too. He claims that he doesn’t eat nuts but he does lovemasafan, chewy almond macaroons. And watermelon has been a stalwart fruit. As a toddler he liked nothing more than to lounge in his pushchair, clutching a fat pink triangle in each hand, chin and coat spattered with sticky juice. I allowed myself to feel quite smug about this situation until the day a stranger stopped us, literally blocking our path, to exclaim, affronted, that watermelon was very exotic for a child. She was furious. She didn’t move. I had to manoeuvre the pushchair awkwardly around her to get past. And, to be honest, years on, I still haven’t got over the way she othered me and my child. Because that was what she was doing – who could object to a child eating fruit (fruit!) unless they had another, meaner agenda? And she wasn’t even right. Watermelons have been grown in England since 1597, which makes you wonder how long it takes for something to stop being “exotic”.Although I’m still arguing with that woman in my head, I’m also grateful because she prompted me to try to learn whether Iraqi and English food are as opposed as she seemed to think. They are not. As early as the 12th century, a cookbook by the 11th-century Baghdad pharmacologist Ibn Jazla was translated into Latin, and the recipes shared across Europe. If Watermelon Woman had been in England in the middle ages, she would have eaten food that, according to food historian Kate Colquhoun, was closest to Moroccan food now. Because this is a culinary conversation that has been going on for centuries, Middle Eastern ingredients are at the heart of some of the most indelibly English foods, like Christmas pudding and brown sauce. It doesn’t have to be either/or. Certainly this Iraqi Jew has enjoyed making (and eating) things like yorkshire puddings and mince pies. My son could surely love both fish fingers andkubba(the Iraqi version ofkofta).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Maybe being a generation removed helped, or maybe it’s because she’s a much better cook, but it’s because of her that he eats the dense, cataclysmically cheesy omelettes calledajjat b’jeben(cheese storm); andbeidh b’laham(egg burgers made with herbs and – her secret ingredient – ketchup);sambusak bel tawa(crescents of dough filled with chickpeas, turmeric and cumin, and deep-fried so the dough puffs up and goes golden); andkubba burghul(beef or lamb mixed with pine nuts and sultanas, stuffed into a dough made from more minced meat and bulgur, first boiled then fried). This felt quite a triumph but when she told me she was making my six-year-old sonkubba shwandar, I thought,“Good luck with that.”Kubba shwandaris spiced beef or lamb in a shell made out of ground rice and pounded meat, and simmered in a sweet and sour sauce with beetroots that stain thekubbaruby red. I love it, but I did not believe in a million years that my son, who said he was “allergic to sauce”, would touch it. I packed a cheese sandwich just in case.But when we got to my mother’s he sat down and atetwelve. He declared it his new best food. He triumphantly wrote in his diary “I ATE KUBBA” and drew one, in cross-section so you could see the meat inside.Obviously this was terrible news. I wanted him to eat things I could sling together in five minutes, not laborious, time-consuming, multiprocess dishes. It didn’t even make sense for him to likekubba shwandarwith its intricacy of flavour, its many textures, its sauce. But, although this development clearly doomed me to hours of labour, I also felt – just slightly – thrilled.View image in fullscreenSamantha Ellis’s grandfather and mother at Luna Park, Baghdad, in the early 1950s.Photograph: courtesy of Samantha EllisWhen his school asked him to bring in a food that represented his heritage, he chose another recipe my mum had introduced him to: the date-stuffed pastries some Iraqi Jews callmakhboose(which just means “baked”) and others callbaba bit tamar(balls with dates). I am addicted to these. They’re my Desert Island food. Now, at eight, my son loves makingmakhboosealmost as much as he likes eating it; pummelling the dough, and testing he has kneaded it enough by touching his earlobe and then seeing if the dough feels similar – an old Claudia Roden trick. Squidging the dates together in his hands, and rolling the balls of dough, and stuffing them and sealing them tight, and then flattening them with his palms, and messily painting them with egg. He draws the line at sprinkling the tops with sesame seeds – which he doesn’t like – but perhaps one day. Back then, he was excited when we read one of the only picture books about Iraqi Jews, Sarah Sassoon’s Shoham’s Bangle, and he saw a picture of the small heroine makingmakhboose, too, cutting out circles of dough with a gold bangle that matched my mother’s and mine. And although I groaned when he told me I had to make enough for his whole class that same evening – because, unlike my mum, I don’t always have a stash in my freezer, and they are a faff to make – I was proud, too, that he knewmakhboosewere special and that he wanted to share them with his friends. Somehow, it seemed, he had developed both a taste for Iraqi Jewish food and the instinct to feed people, to find a part of himself in food and to express love by passing it on.The next morning he was up at six shoutingmataboose! –because he couldn’t pronounce it properly yet – and my whole family says it that way now, too. When he grabbed one and bit into it and grinned, I felt more connected than I have ever been. As he ate it messily, with joy, I didn’t need him to tell me my hands would live on. I knew mymakhboosewould, connecting us back to my many great-grandmothers in Baghdad – and forward, too, to the dishes my son might make for his children one day, and they might make for their children, in a future I will never see. “Awafi,” I told him, and he sneaked another, brazenly, right in front of my face.Samantha Ellis is the author of Chopping Onions on My Heart: On Losing and Preserving Culture (Chatto & Windus, £16.99).

Usually, that’s bumping into a friend on the school run, spottinga cheeky green parakeet in the tree-topsor lighting a few candles at dinner in the evening. When it comes to food and today’s recipe, however, I rather childishly like to say the words “noodle soup” out loud, as if my mouth is pursing in anticipation of the noodles. I love using a whole butternut squash in a dish – that is where a cook’s satisfaction lies. And, for my sins, I adore slurping the noodles out of the bowl.Aromatic butternut squash and coconut noodle soupFeel free to tone down the chillies, if you prefer. You can buy fresh makrut lime leaves from most big UK supermarkets or cheaper, frozen ones from Chinese and south-east Asian specialists.Thai Tastemakes the best vegan fish sauce.

Put the squash chunks on a large oven tray lined with reusable baking paper, drizzle over the oil and toss to coat. Spread out into a single layer, then roast for 25 minutes. Set aside about 20 pieces of the roast squash, and tip the rest into a blender with 800ml water. Blitz smooth, then pour into a jug.Without rinsing the blender, drop in the garlic, lime leaves, lemongrass, onion, chillies, sun-dried tomato paste and salt with about 150ml of the coconut milk and blitz to a smooth paste. Put a large saucepan on a medium heat and, once it’s hot, add the paste and cook, stirring regularly, for 10 minutes. Add the liquidised squash, the remaining 250ml coconut milk and the agave syrup, then bring to a brief boil. Add the fish sauce to taste – I used two and a half tablespoons – then take off the heat.Cook the noodles according to the packet instructions, then drain and rinse. Reheat the coconut soup, if need be, then distribute between four bowls. Divide the noodles between the bowls, top with the reserved chunks of squash and a small handful each of picked Thai basil, spritz the lime over the top and serve.Explore more on these topicsVegan food and drinkThe new veganThai food and drinkFoodVegetablesVegetarian food and drinkNoodlesSouprecipesShareReuse this content"

Cure them in salt and turn them into a super-savoury condiment, that’s whatTom HuntSat 5 Apr 2025 01.00 EDTShareSalt-cured egg yolks are incredibly simple to make and a great way to use up leftovers when you’ve used the whites in another dish. They are intensely savoury, umami-rich and a vibrant, golden colour, much like bottarga, or Italian-style cured fish roe. Once dried, they take on a firm, grateable consistency, and are ideal for giving dishes a final punch of flavour – I often use them instead of cheese: try grating over pasta, risotto or steamed greens.Salt-cured egg yolksSalt-cured egg yolks are a fine project that I’ve been meaning to take on for a while. These golden orbs of deliciousness add an incredible burst of flavour to any dish that could benefit from a whack of umami. Grate over buttery pasta, risotto, sushi maki rolls or steamed greens for an extra hit of depth. I recently enjoyed mine over purple sprouting broccoli, where it melted into the warm florets like a golden seasoning, adding both colour and loads of flavour. The salting draws out moisture, so preserving the yolks and intensifying their taste. Some recipes include sugar for balance, or black pepper and herbs for extra flavour, but I prefer a basic salt cure. The leftover salt absorbs some of that richness, too – keep it in the fridge and use up as a seasoning within a couple of days – I like it for salting the water when I’m boiling greens or pasta.Egg yolks2 tbsp fine sea salt per yolkOil, for greasingChoose a dish or bowl that’s large enough to hold the number of yolks you’d like to cure in a single layer, and leaving at least 2cm between each yolk. Measure out two tablespoons of fine sea salt per egg yolk. Spread half the salt in the base of the dish, and make slight hollows in it to welcome the yolks. Carefully separate the eggs, keeping the yolks intact, then nestle the yolks in the salt hollows (save the whites in a clean container for another use – they’ll keep in the fridge for up to three days). Cover the yolks completely with the rest of the salt, then cover and refrigerate for four to five days, or until the yolks are firm to the touch.Lift the yolks one by one from the salt, brush off any excess, then rinse quickly under the cold tap and pat dry. At this stage, the yolks will be jelly-like, and are delicious sliced. To dry them further, so they can be grated, use the residual heat from the oven after baking or roasting. Lay the dried yolks on a lightly greased oven grate, then put in the hot oven and leave to dry for one to two hours, until firm and grateable; if you’re turning on the oven specifically for the yolks, set it to 90C (70C fan)/gas ¼. Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a month.Explore more on these topicsEggsWaste notFoodFood wasteSide dishesfeaturesShareReuse this content"
