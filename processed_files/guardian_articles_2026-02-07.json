The return of this Glaswegian sitcom is very welcome indeedChitra RamaswamySat 7 Feb 2026 17.30 ESTLast modified on Sat 7 Feb 2026 17.32 ESTShareThe second series ofDinosauropens on the Isle of Wight – a mere seven-hour drive and ferry ride away from our heroine’s beloved Glasgow. Oh dear. Nina (Ashley Storrie) is eight months into a dig, the job she took at the end of series one, and despite discovering a metazoic dung beetle and getting pally with a big American fella called Clayton who is so charming he can call her “Scotland” and get away with it, she’s homesick.She is missing Lee, her almost-sort-of boyfriend who used to make her morning coffee outside the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, where she worked in the palaeontology department (notwith the dirty grave robbers over in antiquities). She is missing watching The Real Housewives with her sister, Evie, their takeaway Tuesdays and walks around the “wee dodgy parks in case we uncover a homicide”. She’s all set to go home when she is asked to stay on another year. Will she choose her precious old rocks, or head to the exact midpoint between the Isle of Wight and Glasgow to reunite with Lee? So begins the madcap rush (in a very slow buggy) to a park bench in Knutsford, and the happy return of this hilarious, heartwarming and covertly groundbreaking sitcom.I say covertly because at first sight Dinosaur treads the same ground as every other British sitcom about loving yet dysfunctional families, regional quirks, a good dose of farce, and the requisite cringingly cute will-they-won’t-they storyline. But all this so-called normality is undercut by Nina’s autistic perspective. (The biggest joke being, of course, that it is neurotypicals who are too much.) Nina’s autism is both fundamental to every scene of Dinosaur, and not what it’s about at all. In this way, even among the welcome slew of shows centring autistic people, it feels refreshing, unique and devoid of thoughtless stereotypes.View image in fullscreenSisters Evie (Kat Ronney) and Nina have an odd-couple dynamic.Photograph: BBC/Two Brothers Productions/Mark MainzAnd so to Glasgow via Knutsford, where – spoiler alert – Lee never shows up. Back home, everything has changed. Nina’s office at the museum has been moved, as has her desk to make way for a social pod and hydration station. Her local sandwich shop has stopped selling tuna melts because “no one likes hot tuna” and “we only served one a day to some woman who died last year”. “That was me!” Nina protests. A tuna meltdown, as Evie fondly calls it, nearly ensues. Once again, it’s the odd-couple dynamic between the sisters (closely followed by the adorable awkwardness between Nina and Lee) that makes the bones of Dinosaur really shine: their little finger hooks, sudden switches into Real Housewives accents and lightning fast Glasgow banter about boofing, bing bongs and big heids (and no, I’m not giving definitions – just watch it). Or when Nina is in distress and Evie simply says “weighted blanket?” Cut to Nina lying on a couch and Evie stretched out on top of her, weighing her down.This series is more self-assured than the first, piling up the jokes about Mary Anning and childbirth, Gloria Steinem and the Tebay services off the M6, David Attenborough and a fruity book of short stories Nina wrote called Romancing the Bone. The ensemble cast are, again, top-notch. Nina’s feckless older brother, Bo, spends much of his time in the family shed, freaking out about getting Evie’s best friend, Amber, pregnant. Ranesh, Evie’s feminist husband, is up to the same old stuff – buying a dehydration machine to make fruit leathers and cooking pasta from a book by the pope. I love the portrayal of Declan, Nina’s older colleague, probably undiagnosed but certainly autistic. And Lee performs at an open mic (Amber: “Mediocre white men singing in public is one of my kinks – it’s the switch from delusional confidence to defeat”), singing a lovely toe-curling song whose chorus sums up the spirit of Dinosaur: “It doesn’t matter what you do / As long as what you do is true.”Like Hackney inStarstruck, with which Dinosaur shares a sweet spiky messiness (though Dinosaur is more subversive, foul-mouthed, better) Glasgow is a major character. And Scotland’s biggest – and biggest-hearted –city, where I spent one of the best decades of my life, has never looked lovelier: all glossy tenement closes, tree-lined avenues and bougie bars. This is the other way in which Dinosaur is quietly radical. When do we ever get to seethisGlasgow on the telly?Both Dinosaur’s integrity and the Glaswegian intensity of its gag rate is down to its origins. It’s the co-creation of Storrie – who received her autism diagnosis in her early 30s and is the daughter of the comedian Janey Godley, who died between the first and second series – and Matilda Curtis, the daughter of the director Simon Curtis and the actor Elizabeth McGovern. It’s a show that came out of Storrie’s real life experience and is the product of close female collaboration. The outcome is a classic comedy full of light, shade and big feelings. As the mother of an autistic child myself, the simplest way I can put it is that it rings true, and gives me some big feelings of my own. In short, I love it.Dinosaur aired on BBC Three and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

None had protection from poor service or price hikes … until last monthZoe WoodSat 7 Feb 2026 02.00 ESTShare‘If I could move, I would – to a place without a heat network. But I can’t while this debt is hanging over me,” says Anja Georgiou.The mother lives with her family in a rented flat in the River Gardens development in Greenwich in south-eastLondonwhere, three years ago, residents were shocked to be presented with a surprise £200,000 bill for heating and hot water.With views of the Thames, and historic Greenwich Park nearby, it is a “very nice” place to live, says Georgiou. The development has a gym and swimming pool and, like many new-builds in the capital, the residents are hooked up to a communal boiler – one of the most common forms of heat network.Also known as district heating systems, these have been installed in many developments and supply heat from a central source via a network of pipes carrying hot water. The supplier is usually the landlord or freeholder, which buys energy on the commercial market for residents.Despite their growing use – during the past few years in London, almost three-quarters of new homes have had heat networks installed – the industry was, until a few days ago, unregulated. But on 27 January the regulator Ofgem officially started overseeing the sector in order to make sure customers are properly protected and “shielded from unfair price hikes”. That is good news for the 500,000 to 1 million households connected to a heat network.View image in fullscreenPart of the River Gardens development in Greenwich, south-east London.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianIn the spring of 2023, River Gardens residents were told their energy tariff would change that summer – from 20p a kilowatt hour with a 55p standing charge to 37p and 39p respectively.That wasn’t the only bad news. The development’s managing agent, Rendall & Rittner (R&R), said an extra charge was going to be slapped on their bills because of a £198,986 debt that had accumulated on the heat network’s energy account over a 15-month period spanning 2022 and 2023.Georgiou’s neighbour Calum Matheson, a software developer who owns a leasehold flat in the same block, was told he owed an extra £550. He immediately sought a way to fight it. “It was plainly wrong,” he says. “I had already paid my bills. You don’t get to send me an extra one.”Residents who were up to date with their bills struggled to comprehend the situation, and in a follow-up letter, R&R – which manages 90,000 homes – tried to explain what happened.R&R said River Gardens’ energy supplier With Energy had ceased buying gas for the building in 2022, and R&R’s own procurement arm had taken over. However, said R&R, in the months that followed, while the price it was paying for gas nearly doubled, it did not get With Energy – which still issues the bills – to review the tariff paid by residents quickly enough.View image in fullscreenCalum Matheson was told he owed an extra £550 after an updated (and backdated) change to tariffs. Matheson said: ‘There is no legal basis for charging historical tariff increases to residents.’Photograph: Maureen McLean/REX/ShutterstockThe “regrettable delay”, as R&R put it, resulted in a deficit opening up between the cost of the gas used to operate the heat network and the bills being paid.The debt would be shared out among the homeowners and tenants of the flats based on their usage during the period. The bills ranged from £50 to £600, with Georgiou’s share £337.R&R warned residents that they could not move to the cheaper deal it had secured for winter 2023 until the debt was cleared.The letter provoked a furious reaction. “Our energy contracts had clear terms and conditions,” says Georgiou.View image in fullscreenInside the Bunhill energy centre in Islington, north London, an energy network scheme that supplies more than 700 local homes with cheaper, greener heating using waste heat from the tube.Photograph: Piero Cruciatti/Alamy“I could not believe they thought they could just send a letter telling us they should have charged higher tariffs on the invoices already paid and show over £300 outstanding on my account with no bill … Imagine if British Gas did that? We’re absolutely not paying it. It is outrageous.”Matheson was determined to fight the bill. He contacted everyone he could think of for help, including the Energy Ombudsman, but was turned away. (Since last April, new legislation means heat network customers can now use the ombudsman service). When it emerged the landlord would seek to recover the debt from individual leaseholders through the service charge, he made an application to a first-tier property tribunal. These specialise in dealing with common property disputes.“There is no legal basis for charging historical tariff increases to residents,” says Matheson, pointing to the terms and conditions on their energy bills, which stated that With Energy agreed to bear the risk of volatility in the gas markets. “In any event, consumer protection law would prevent any additional charges based on energy already used and paid for at published and contracted prices.”Matheson represented himself and 56 other leaseholders at the tribunal, a process which he says meant “hundreds of hours’ work”.View image in fullscreenThe new housing development River Gardens with the old power station and Royal Naval College in the distance.Photograph: Eden Breitz/AlamyLast month that work paid off when the tribunal found in their favour. It said the money is “irrecoverable as service charges under the respective leases”.It also disallowed 20% of R&R’s fees for the 15-month period when the debt arose.Many residents, including Matheson, had paid their part of the bill in 2024 after receiving letters which said failure to do so would see the charge “passed to solicitors for collection”.The tribunal does not have the power to order the money to be refunded. The debt is still outstanding on Giorgiou’s account at the time of writing.An R&R spokesperson says: “We are aware of the tribunal findings. We are reviewing the matter and will then liaise with our client in relation to the charges for heating, which are legally payable to our client rather than to Rendall & Rittner. We have not raised any fees in relation to the heat services at the River Gardens.”View image in fullscreenThe post-industrial Greenwich peninsula has experienced large-scale housebuilding projects in recent years.Photograph: Marcin Rogozinski/AlamyThey add: “The case was brought against our client by leaseholders and proceeded without our involvement. We are therefore unable to comment further.”Matheson says: “I hope R&R will put residents back in the financial position that they ought to be in. If nothing else, I am glad this is out in the open, as I know it is happening across the country. I hope it will make other developers think twice before they act like this. As a point of principle, I’d also like my £550 back.”Stephen Knight, the chief executive of Heat Trust, the consumer champion for people on heat networks in Great Britain, says: “We see this quite a lot. What they were seeking to do was retrospectively increase the price they charge for a service. And one of the rules that has come in is that you have to announce your tariff rate 31 days before it applies. This will effectively outlaw the practice.”View image in fullscreenA district heat and power project in Gateshead, north-east England.Photograph: FlexitricityTurning up the heat: how watchdog can police poor serviceOfgem is now in charge of policing heat networks and can step in if customers face unfair price hikes or suffer poor service.The networks supply heat from a central source via a network of insulated pipes carrying hot water. The supplier is usually the landlord or freeholder, which buys energy on the commercial market for residents.Because heat network operators buy energy at commercial rates, their customers are not protected by the Ofgem price cap, which limits how much a supplier can charge a domestic customer for each unit of energy, as well as the maximum daily standing charge.The vulnerability of people with this type of energy contract came to the fore during the energy crisis fuelled by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.Before the war, operators could buy gas at a fraction of the price that domestic consumers could – but amid turbulent gas prices, some heat network customers saw their energy costs surge by up to 450%.Despite the problems, heat networks are a big part of the country’s net zero push. The set-up is supposed to provide communities with low-cost and efficient heat, and by 2050 the government hopes they will supply a fifth of England’s heat – up from 3% today.The Competition and Markets Authority made the case for proper regulation of heat networks back in 2018, and their rollout has made the case even more pressing.Helena Charlton, Ofgem’s director of heat networks, says: “Many heat network customers already receive a good service, but we also know that too many people face unclear bills, poor communication or uncertainty about what to do when things go wrong.”View image in fullscreenOver time, says Helena Charlton, Ofgem’s director of heat networks, the new regime will ensure customers can understand their bills, that prices are fair and that they can rely on their heat supply.Photograph: Jacob King/PAOver time, the new regime would ensure that customers could understand their bills, that prices were fair and that they could rely on their heat supply, she says. “These are protections that are commonplace for customers of gas and electricity companies … Heat networks customers can expect the same in future.”Some new protections took effect in 2025. The Energy Ombudsman started accepting disputes relating to heat networks, and a new advice service provided by Consumer Scotland and Citizens Advice in England and Wales launched.Stephen Knight, of Heat Trustsays regulation is “long overdue”.“There is an increasing number of people on heat networks, and until now, no clear set of rules on how they should be treated,” he says. “There’s a whole huge range of detriment issues due to this sector having not been properly regulated.”He adds: “The new Ofgem rules include a package of protections, which are obviously a huge step forward, but the bits that are missing include proper price protection – an equivalent of the price cap. All we have is a general rule that pricing has to be fair and proportionate, and that Ofgem will start to monitor prices and can intervene.”Explore more on these topicsEnergy billsConsumer affairsHousehold billsLeaseholdPropertyHousingCommunitiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.When Matt Hillier was in his 20s, he went camping with a friend who was a nurse. In the morning she told him she had been shocked by the snoring coming from his tent. “She basically said, ‘For a 25-year-old non-smoker who’s quite skinny, you snore pretty loudly,’” says Hiller, now 32.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Perhaps because of the pervasive image of a “typical” sleep apnoea patient – older, and overweight – Hillier didn’t seek help. It wasn’t until he was 30 that he finally went to a doctor after waking up from a particularly big night of snoring with a racing heartbeat. Despite being young, active and a healthy weight, further investigation – including a night recording his snoring – revealed that he had moderate sleep apnoea. His was classed as supine, the most common form of the condition, meaning it happens when he sleeps on his back, and is likely caused by his throat muscles.“It’s weird because I’m normally quite quiet and polite. So to hear recordings of me snoring like a rhinoceros grunting was a bit shocking.” So, too, was his diagnosis: “I thought I was too young and healthy, and I had no family history. But I know my mum, sister and auntie are snorers. So it could be a genetic anatomical thing … we’ve all got bad throats.”Over the pastdecade, according to experts, a snoring epidemic has begun to take hold in the world – and it’s more serious than you might think. Those grunts, honks and bellows people let out while they’re asleep have long been the butt of jokes, but they can often be a sign of trouble, and increasingly so. TheBritish Snoring & Sleep Apnoea Associationestimates there are around 15 million snorers in the UK. And while most of us do it occasionally, it seems we may be entering a new era of chronic and extreme snoring, driven by everything from pollution and rising temperatures to the obesity crisis.“Snoring still carries a lot of embarrassment and humour, so people tend to joke about it instead of seeking help,” says Professor Ama Johal, clinical lead atAerox Healthand a consultant orthodontist. “They don’t connect it with their general health or quality of life.” But they should: chronic snoring can decrease the quality of our sleep, causing fatigue, low mood, poor concentration and brain fog. It’s even been linked to high blood pressure and cardiovascular problems.The difference between snoring and sleep apnoea isn’t how loudly you snore; it’s whether you stop breathingAnd that’s not all. “The snoring epidemic reflects the tip of the iceberg of a more sinister condition – obstructive sleep apnoea – which affects anestimated eight million adultsin the UK,” saysRyan Chin Taw Cheong, currently the onlyNHS ear, nose and throat consultantand sleep surgeon who specialises in snoring and sleep apnoea full time. The exhausting and scary condition causes people to stop breathing in their sleep, dangerously lowering their oxygen levels. It raises the risk ofhigh blood pressure, diabetes, stroke, heart diseaseandsudden death. It can also significantly increase the risk of being in acar crash:10% of accidentscan be linked to sleep apnoea. Plusemerging researchhas begun to establish a link between untreated sleep apnoea and dementia later in life. “I tend to think of loud, regular snoring as an early warning light on the dashboard,” Johal says.Snoring happens when our airways are blocked when we’re asleep. As we breathe, we push air through our nose, throat and mouth. If something stops that, we make involuntary sounds as the tissues in the roof of the mouth, tonsils or tongue vibrate against each other. The sounds that escape can range from heavy breathing,vibrations and whistles to snorts and rattles. There’s no one-snore-fits-all. “Everyone snores in a unique way. It’s almost like a fingerprint,” Cheong says.What counts as heavy or loud snoring is subjective; it’s often when the snoring can be heard through a closed door. Johal says it can be classed as more serious, disruptive snoring “when it starts to impact your sleep or the sleep of those around you”.“Snoring and sleep apnoea share a common underlying mechanism and many of the risk factors are the same,” Johal adds. The difference between the two isn’t how loudly you snore; it’s whether you stop breathing as part of it. “Snoring becomes sleep apnoea when there are repeated pauses [apnoeas] or major reductions in airflow, usually with gasping or choking,” he says. “Bed partners of sleep apnoea patients often describe the sound they make as breathing stopping, followed by a snort.”To get a diagnosis, you first need a sleep study. This can be carried out at home overnight using equipment that records your heart rate, the flow of air through your nostrils and your oxygen levels. It can also tell you how many times each hour you stop breathing in your sleep. “Fewer than five and you’re a bad snorer. But five or more meets the threshold for adiagnosis,” Johal says.Interest in snoring and apnoea has surged in recent years, according to Cheong, as biohackers champion the role of sleep in health and longevity. It has sparked a cottage industry of TikTok Shop quick fixes for better rest, fromnasal dilatorsit’s claimed widen narrow airways to mouth tape designed to encourage nasal breathing. Meanwhile, tracking devices such asOuraandWhoop,and apps designed to monitor not just sleep quality but the sounds we make while unconscious – such asSnoreLab, which rates each night’s snoring from zero to “epic” – have grown in popularity. For some, this has revealed they are secret super-snorers, prompting efforts to tackle the problem. But, he adds, the rise in snoring and sleep apnoea is “absolutely a thing” – and not simply the result of more tracking.Genetics play a role in who snores or has sleep apnoea and who doesn’t – from narrow nasal passages to jaw shape, tonsils, tongue size and how much the throat muscles relax during sleep. So does body age and size, which is, in part, why prevalence of the condition is increasing, as the global population is getting older. “Like every other part of the body, as we age, the function and tone of the upper airway diminishes,” Cheong says. “Everything becomes more floppy and lax, including the palate, tongue and throat.” By the age of 70, snoring is present in nearly one in two people.People don’t recognise  signs of a medical condition.  They assume tiredness, headaches and irritability are just part of modern lifeThe population in the UK is also getting heavier. “For many patients, snoring often gets dramatically worse after even modest weight gain because it exacerbates the narrowing of the airway,” Johal says. Still, he cautions against oversimplification. Many people who are not overweight snore, and weight loss alone is not guaranteed to resolve the problem.Some of the reasons for the rise of sleep apnoea and heavy snoring go beyond the way our bodies are built and instead show how the world itself is changing. Pollution may play a part. Whileair quality in the UK has improvedin recent years, dangerous levels are often still reached. “There’s growing evidence that outdoor and indoor air pollution are linked with more habitual snoring. Traffic-related pollutants and fine particles irritate the upper airway, causing low-grade inflammation and swelling that narrow the nasal passages and throat,” Johal says. “Studies have shown higher rates of regular snoring in people living nearbusy roads or in homes with dampand poor air quality.”The higher likelihood ofheatwavesin the UK could have an effect on how much noise we make in our sleep, too. “Warm, stuffy bedrooms dry and irritate the nose and throat, promote congestion and fragment sleep, interrupting the sleep cycle, all of which make the airway more unstable and noisy,” Johal says.A recentstudyfrom Flinders University in Australia predicts cases ofsleep apnoea are likely to doubleover the next 75 years as a direct consequence of global heating. Researchers found that higher temperatures lead to less, lower quality and lighter sleep (the sleep stage where the condition flourishes). They believe it will affect everyone, not just those with pre-existing risk factors. Untreated sleep apnoea is already estimated to cost the US economy $87bn a year in lost workplace productivity and sick days. Dr Bastien Lechat, a senior researcher who co-authored the Flinders study, says he found the magnitude of the link between sleep apnoea and temperature “striking”. He’s particularly concerned because “sleep is the third pillar of health, alongside nutrition and exercise, and is essential for physical and mental wellbeing”.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Igor Bastidas/The GuardianRecently, there has been a rise in another kind of atypical sleep apnoea: what doctors are calling “social apnoea”, where heavy snoring tips over into something more serious at the weekend. “Alcohol depresses the muscles of the throat, so it becomes more floppy,” Cheong says. Even social orpassive smoking can irritate your nose and throat, cause swelling, block your airway and make it more likely you’ll snore.Vaping may have a similar effect, but research is lacking.Ciara Bowdler teeters on the edge of this category. After a housemate revealed she had been snoring particularly loudly after a night out, the then 28-year-old from Kent downloaded SnoreLab to record and play back her snores. Typically, newcomers to the appscore around 25. Bowdler, whose recording was peppered with epic snores, scored 99, putting her in the top 15% of 15 million users. “Of course, it was funny because snoring is funny to hear. But it was also embarrassing. Snoring is seen as such a male thing, and it just seems a bit gross. That’s what’s frustrating as a female. There’s a different stigma attached,” she says.By tracking what she ate and drank each day, Bowdler, now 32, learned there were three main culprits: red wine, social smoking and late-night takeaways. “God forbid a girl has a good time,” she jokes. By drinking fewer glasses of wine (two mediums seems to be the limit), eating earlier and bulk-buying stick-on nasal strips, used to widen nasal passages, she’s managed to get her score down to a respectable 14.Perhaps surprisingly, given its noisy reputation, it’s thought up to 90% of people with sleep apnoea in the UK are undiagnosed, and the health consequences of this are estimated tocost the NHS £28ma year. “One of the most surprising things about sleep apnoea is how easy it is to live with it for years without realising, because the breathing interruptions happen while you sleep,” says Professor Esther Rodriguez-Villegas, director of the wearable technologies lab at Imperial College London and founder of wearable medical device companyAcurable. “It’s also widely underreported because most people simply don’t recognise their symptoms as a sign of a medical condition. Many assume that tiredness, headaches, irritability or poor concentration are just part of modern life.”Of the 90% of undiagnosed cases, a significant portion are women. Rodriguez-Villegas says, “Women underreport symptoms of snoring and are less likely to come forward and say, ‘Hey, I’ve got a problem.’” The condition also tends to look a little different in women: “Their symptoms tend to be quieter and less stereotypical, with less dramatic snoring and gasping. Some of the most significant cases involve minimal or very subtle snoring. Women also have more complaints of fatigue, headaches, poor mood, fragmented sleep or difficulty concentrating,” Rodriguez-Villegas adds.As 58-year-old Mariana Sawyer knows, these symptoms can easily be dismissed as menopause related. The assistant bank manager from Luton felt shattered for years, but noticed her tiredness and occasional snoring got much worse after her 50th birthday. “It coincided with menopause, so it was really difficult to pinpoint what it was. I was also suffering from nasal problems, but knew this was very common with menopause,” she says. When her husband, Steve, played her a video of her snoring, she was horrified: “It was quite a deep, loud, hollow snore. It was almost like a roar, with choking and gasping for air. I’d wake up with a really dry mouth. My tongue would be white from dehydration. I was probably a little bit in denial for a while. You don’t feel very good about yourself in menopause anyway. Throw this into the equation and it really wasn’t a nice time.” When she eventually had a sleep study, Sawyer was shocked to learn that it wasn’t just menopause; she had sleep apnoea and was stopping breathing up to 27 times an hour.Snoring was ruining my marriage – here’s how I finally cured myselfRead moreRight now, the treatment landscape for sleep apnoea, if you’re going through the NHS, is far from ideal. You may be eligible for “sleep surgery” to optimise your airflow, but relatively few people meet the criteria, such as having a deviated septum (when the wall between nasal passages is off centre) or large tonsils. Johal says surgery is “very unpredictable in its outcome” anyway, so it’s often reserved for patients who haven’t responded well to other treatments.The go-to option is a continuous positive airway pressure (Cpap) machine, which pumps air into a mask that covers your mouth and nose as you sleep. Itimproves the quality of lifefor some patients,bringing down their blood pressureandreducing the risk of cardiovascularproblems. It’s also gained a surprising celebrity following, with snorers such asAmy Poehler and Jack Blackraving about the treatment. But it’s no perfect solution. If your sleep apnoea is considered not quite bad enough to get a Cpap machine through the NHS, buying one privately costshundreds of pounds, andone in threepatients can’t tolerate it. “I have high cheekbones and none of the masks would fit,” Sawyer says. “The air was blowing so violently, it was seeping out the sides, burning my eyes and creating an even worse sleep pattern.”There is a new kid on the block: animplantknown colloquially as the “sleep pacemaker”. “It stimulates the hypoglossal nerve, which controls the tongue, and pulses it forward to unblock the airway. Patients can control the device with their smartphone. The nerve implants will be all the rage for the next decade because it’s a really big step forward,” Cheong says. For those who don’t qualify, there may be an alternative: amandibular advancement device– essentially a custom-fitted mouthguard that shifts your jaw forward as you sleep to open up your airway.When it comes to heavy snoring, developments are happening here, too. There’smyofunctional therapy– exercises that strengthen the muscles around your palate, throat and tongue. Pelvic floor exercises for the mouth, if you will. SnoreLab’s companion app,SnoreGym,teaches users how to do oral workouts such as “tongue curlers”, where you push your tongue against the roof of your mouth and then slide it back as far as it’ll go. “Some early-stage studies are looking at things like didgeridoo-style breathing training or conch blowing to strengthen airway muscles,” Johal says. He also mentions “positional therapy– wearable technology that gently nudges people off their backs. Sleeping on your back is a major aggravator because gravity lets the jaw and tongue fall backwards.”There’s even work being done on “amedical pill for sleep apnoeathat increases the tone of the upper airway, which may help with snoring. It’s all very clinical trial-based at the moment. If it does hit the UK, it’s going to be at least eight years before we see it on the market,” Cheong says.Until then, we may have to learn to outsmart our snoring. Shifting on to yourside can reduceyour snores. So can tweaking the temperature of your bedroom. Or, like Bowdler, you could try tweaking other lifestyle factors: “I went away a couple of weekends ago on a bridesmaids’ weekend and forgot my nose strips. I ate early, only had two glasses of red, stopped drinking by 7pm and went to sleep at 10pm. According to my app, I had no snoring.”That said, experts caution that if your snoring is super-loud, regular, or comes with other symptoms, such as tossing and turning at night, feeling wiped out, headaches or a dry throat, then it’s considered a health problem and it’s important to see your GP.Just as Johal says snoring is an early warning light on the dashboard for our personal health, it seems the epidemic is a warning on a worldwide scale, too. It’s one of many reminders that our mistreatment of the planet has already begun to affect our wellbeing and will continue to do so – perhaps in ways we can’t yet imagine.Explore more on these topicsSleepSleep apnoeaHealth & wellbeingObesityClimate crisisPollutionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They are tales about an ingenious individual overcoming huge odds, a triumphant metaphor for the human spirit. Here’s a funny thing: castaway stories featuring large groups of people lead to the exact opposite. Forced to self-organise, they end up eating each other. The exception isLost; I don’t know what that was about. Polar bears?Needless to say, I like them all. So it’s exciting to see a new kid on the block – or rather an old boy. William Golding’s novelLord of the Flies, about a group of British schoolboys who crash-land on a desert island, has been part of the UK curriculum for more than 60 years. I wonder if we forget the books we’re forced to study, and are obliged to rediscover them in later life. I know this story well, but am not sure I can say I fully experienced it until this striking new BBC version (Sunday, 9pm, BBC One).Promisingly, it’s adapted byJack Thorne. Every time a new Jack Thorne drama appears, which is no more than a couple of times a month, my writer friends wonder at his prodigious talent. Why does this man write as if he’s running out of time? As if he’s found himself in possession of the last pen on Earth? Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, This Is England, Toxic Town, His Dark Materials, The Swimmers, The Virtues and The Motive and the Cue. You sawAdolescence. Did this man put his fingers in a socket doing DIY, and now electricity pours out of them?Lord of the Flies draws Thorne back to the theme of developing masculinity, with a 1950s spin. Except here’s the thing about desert islands: they stay the same. Without clothes, you lose another marker of time. Aside from wireless hiss over the opening credits, and the occasional use of period language from the book, nothing about this four-parter doesn’t feel contemporary, and painfully so. Think of it as Adolescence: Origins.The mini-series is directed by Bafta-laden film-maker Marc Munden, and from the first episode it takes no prisoners. Televisually, it unmoors the audience from familiar comforts as much as the stranded boys. Dialogue is sparse, shots held for a long time, the fourth wall frequently broken. This happens through repeated closeup portraits of the boys’ faces. They gaze back at us, upward into the lens, expressing – what? Vulnerability? Aggression? The ambiguity is telling.The boys are a diverse group, which isn’t to say there isn’t class analysis, too. The entrance of a troupe of Canterbury cap-clad choristers, processing up a white sand beach to the strains of a religious chant, is an extraordinary, mirage-like image. Posh, confident, reeking of skiing holidays, they are led by the entitled Jack. Having lost the initial leadership election to the more responsible Ralph, Jack decides his followers will be the hunters, a group unto themselves.“I hope no adults come for a week, so we get to have some fun!” crows Jack, played by cherubic newcomer Lox Pratt, who I really hope is as nice in real life. I’ll steer clear of spoilers (although the novel was written in 1954, and has been pumped into kids more often than brown asthma inhalers). Let’s just say we all have different ideas of fun. Some of us like Wordle and banana bread. Others like setting things on fire. The latter tends to have more of an impact on everyone else.It’s almost comical how quickly everything is on fire. “Toilets, water, hut-building, boring!” complains Jack, who wants leadership without guardrails. He could be wearing a “Make Desert Island Great Again” cap; he’s actually wearing a face shroud made of garments salvaged from a dead woman’s suitcase. Is this a story about politics or toxic masculinity? They are one and the same, is the bleak suggestion. The show is excellent, a Joseph Conrad-esque fever, with moments of surreal horror. I felt sick watching it, though. I’ve never been more grateful to live under the rule of law, that ultimate dweeb’s charter.Jack Thorne’s output remains unequalled. Surely he must need a break from this material, to go on holiday or something. Can anyone recommend a quiet beach?Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioThe watcherTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It leads the US news and dominates the headlines, fusing crime and celebrity together in ways not seen since OJ Simpson or the Lindbergh baby.The Pima county sheriff’s department, which covers Tucson,Arizona, says that Guthrie, mother of Today show anchor Savannah Guthrie, was last seen by loved ones at 9.48pm on 31 January when she was dropped off at her single-story home after dining and playing games with her daughter Annie and husband Tommaso Cioni. At 9.50pm the garage door closes.Then, at 1.47am, Guthrie’s Ring doorbell camera disconnects. At 2.12am, the software detects movement, perhaps a person, on camera. But there’s no film because the account wasn’t set up. At 2.28am, Guthrie’s pacemaker app disconnects from her phone. The following day, at 11.56am, the family checks on Guthrie after she missed church: she is missing.View image in fullscreenThe home of Nancy Guthrie in Tucson, Arizona, on Thursday.Photograph: Caitlin O’Hara/APAt 12.15 a patrol car arrives. The Ring camera is missing. Guthrie’s phone and Apple watch are in the home. There are blood droplets on the porch, later confirmed as hers. Authorities have been searching for her since, warning that she has “some physical ailments, has some physical challenges, and is in need of medication”.It might have been a missing person’s case were it not for three ransom notes received via email by the celebrity news siteTMZand two Tucson-area outlets,KOLDandKGUN, that included a demand for millions in Bitcoin, two deadlines and details about the crime scene.Heith Janke, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s Phoenix office, said details about an Apple Watch and a broken floodlight were included in the alleged notes. The FBI has said it does make recommendations when a ransom is received, and “any action taken on any ransom is ultimately decided by the family.”In a tearful appealposted to Instagram, Savannah Guthrie, who had to cancel her assignment to report from the winter Olympics and was flanked by her brother and sister, described their mother as “funny, spunky, and clever”, saying: “Momma, if you’re listening, we need you to come home. We miss you.”To her mom’s presumed captors, she said: “We need to know without a doubt that she’s alive and that you have her.” She asked for “proof of life” and addressed the possibility of people creating deepfakes. “We live in a world where voices and images are easily manipulated.”View image in fullscreenSavannah Guthrie, accompanied by her siblings Annie and Camron, speaks in a video message, posted on social media on Wednesday.Photograph: Savannah Guthrie/Instagram/ReutersFBI’s Janke said: “With AI these days you can make videos that appear to be very real. So we can’t just take a video and trust that that’s proof of life because of advancements in AI.”In a new video posted to Savannah Guthrie’sInstagram accounton Saturday, the Today show host speaks to the captors again begging for her mother’s return and apparently offering to compensate them. “This is very valuable to us and we will pay,” Savannah Guthrie says.Criminal activity and its motivation may be relatively similar across eras, but advances in technology have changed how they are conducted and resolved. The Guthrie case is both old-fashioned – a ransom note sounds almost quaint – and what might have once been a demand for a suitcase of cash in non-sequential, used, small-denomination bills at a drop-off is now a transfer of cryptocurrency.In December, the FBIwarned that peopleposing as kidnappers can provide what appears to be a real photo or video of a loved one, along with demands for money. In this case, Guthrie is missing, presumed abducted. Investigators won’t say if there was a forced entry to the home and say they believe Guthrie is “still out there”.Pima county sheriff Chris Nanos told reporters: “We have no suspect, no persons of interest.”A neighbor of Guthrie’s has reported seeing a white panel van nearby in the days before Guthrie went missing. A clue perhaps? Nanos said on Friday authorities won’t hold another news conference until there’s major news. “It’s pretty pointless to just keep hounding the same things over and over,” he said.Bryanna Fox, a former FBI profiler and professor of criminology at the University of South Florida who has previously appeared on NBC’s Today show with Savannah Guthrie, says the case is indeed perplexing.“I’ve never seen a case where the ransom notes were sent to the media and the family’s response was not done at a press conference but posted on Instagram,” she says. “The ransom itself was not asked for as cash in a bag, and we can’t even rely on the ransom is real and proof of life is real because of artificial intelligence.“And all of it – Bitcoin, AI, TMZ and Instagram – wrapped together in a conversion of pop culture things,” Fox adds.Then, naturally, there is a political fringe to it. Almost as soon as Guthrie’s disappearance became public, there was speculation online of involvement of the Mexican cartels operating across the border. Had Guthrie tipped off would-be abductors when she invited Today cameras in her mother’s home months ago?Or could it be related to anger at the media in the age ofDonald Trump?But the TV anchor Guthrie is one of the most politically neutral in the business – the friendly face to whom millions of TV viewers wake on weekday mornings. She became co-anchor of Today in 2012 after serving as both White House correspondent and as a legal analyst and correspondent.Trump called Guthrie to offer his support and posted on social media that the federal government is making available “all resources to get her mother home safely. The prayers of our Nation are with her and her family.” Guthrie thanked Trump for taking the time to call her family.On Thursday, a California man was charged with sending text messages to the Guthrie family seeking bitcoin after following the case on television – but there is no indication he is connected to the case. TMZ founder Harvey Levin speculated that the kidnapper or kidnappers could still be in the Tucson area and described the purported ransom email as “very specific” and “well-organized”.Levin told Fox News’s Sean Hannity: “The letter begins by saying she is safe, but scared, and they go on to say she knows exactly what the demand is.” He said the bitcoin address is real, and the ransom note was not AI generated. “This is not a letter that was thrown together in a couple of minutes.”Nanos, meanwhile, has said he’s not ruling anyone out: “We’re actively looking at everybody we come across in this case. Everybody. It would be irresponsible if we didn’t talk to everybody.“The Uber driver, the gardener, the pool person, whoever, everybody. It’s so cliche, but everybody’s still a suspect in our eyes. That’s just how we look at things and think as cops.”The ransom note or notes, says Fox, is the strongest piece of evidence for investigators to decode, but she points out that more than 100 people confessed to the Lindbergh baby snatching in 1932.During Fox’s training at the FBI’s Quantico headquarters, she was tasked with analyzing theransom noteleft at the scene of another famous case, that of JonBenét Ramsey in 1996. “You get so much information about who could have done this, their motivation. Is it legitimate?” she said.In the Guthrie case, she points out, investigators can’t know that the note is real because it wasn’t left at the scene.“So we’re already starting out with doubt,” Fox says. “The question is, are there details in the letter that only a kidnapper could know, because you never know what detail is going to become critical. People get frustrated with the police, but their only goal is find her [Nancy Guthrie] alive. They don’t care about the public’s insatiable interest in crime.”Explore more on these topicsArizonaUS crimeDonald TrumpCryptocurrenciesUS-Mexico borderfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Substack takes about 10% of the revenue the newsletters make. About 5 million people pay for access to newsletters on its platform.Among them are newsletters that openly promote racist ideology. One, called NatSocToday, which has 2,800 subscribers, charges $80 – about £60 – for an annual subscription, though most of its posts are available for free.NatSocToday is understood to be run by a far-right activist based in the US and features a swastika, a symbol appropriated by the Nazi party in the 1920s to symbolise white supremacy, as its profile picture. The full name of the Nazi party was the National Socialist German Workers’ party.One of its recent posts suggests the Jewish race was responsible for the second world war and describes Adolf Hitler as “one of the greatest men of all time”. Within two hours of subscribing to NatSocToday for the purposes of this investigation, the Substack algorithm directed the Guardian’s account to 21 other profiles featuring similar content.Some of these accounts regularly share and like each other’s posts. Many have thousands of followers.Erika Drexler, a self-styled “NS [national socialist] activist” with 241 subscribers, shared posts describing Hitler as her hero and the “most overqualified leader ever”. The account is also believed to be US-based and charges $150 for an annual subscription.Ava Wolfe, who has 3,000 subscribers and calls herself an “archivist of articles and videos about history in particular WW2” appears to be based in the UK. She has a profile which features swastikas and other Nazi imagery. An annual subscription to her Substack costs £38.Much of the content Wolfe posts engages in Holocaust denial. About 6 million Jews died in the Holocaust, but she falsely claimed earlier this month that doctors had found that “no one was deliberately murdered by Germans” and that “death was from disease and starvation only”.It is unclear if Drexler and Wolfe have used their real identities to post their material, or if they write under pseudonyms.Another account, entitled Third Reich Literature Archive, with 2,100 subscribers, shared postcards purporting to be from a Nazi propaganda rally in Nuremberg in 1938, the year before the second world war began. It also charges $80 a year for a premium subscription.The Guardian account was shown separate posts that promoted conspiracy theories about Jewish power and influence and suggested antisemitism was a myth.The algorithm also promoted other extremist content, including newsletters relating to the “great replacement” conspiracy theory – the suggestion that there is a plot to replace white Europeans with people from other races.There has been a sharp increase in antisemitism and Islamophobia since the beginning of the Israel-Gaza war in October 2023. Two men were killed when a synagogue in Heaton Park, Manchester, was attacked on the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur in October last year. Fifteen people were shot dead as they celebrated Hanukah at Sydney’s Bondi Beach in December.View image in fullscreenThe Substack of a user who calls themselves White Rabbit.Photograph: SubstackThe chief executive of theAntisemitismPolicy Trust, Danny Stone, said harmful online content often inspired real-life attacks.As examples, Stone cited the racially motivated murder of 10 African Americans in Buffalo, New York, in 2022; a synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 2018 in which 11 people were killed and the 2017 attack on a mosque in Finsbury Park, north London, in which one person was killed and several injured.“People can be, and are, inspired by online harm to cause harm in real world,” he said. “The terrorist who attacked Heaton Park synagogue didn’t wake up one morning and decide to kill Jews; he will have been radicalised.“Algorithmic prompts and the amplification of harmful materials is extremely serious. The Online Safety Act was supposed to address the illegal content but very little is being done about so-called legal but harmful content.”Stone also expressed concern about online disinformation about the Holocaust.“There has been a drop in attendance and take-up of Holocaust memorial events,” he said. “We know that knowledge already was frighteningly low.“When you have Holocaust denial, inversion or comparisons, you are seeing, across the board, a diminishing of the memory of the Holocaust. As we are further away, with fewer survivors, the facts can get lost.“We have to win the battle for that narrative. This online content does extreme damage because if we fail to learn the lessons of that past, we’re doomed to repeat it.”View image in fullscreenNatSocToday has 2,800 subscribers and charges $80 – about £60 – for an annual subscription, though most of its posts are available for free.Photograph: SubstackA spokesperson for the Holocaust Educational Trust said: “Material like this that spreads conspiracy theories and Holocaust denial and which praises Hitler and the Nazis is not new but clearly its reach is increasing. The idea that Substack profits from this hateful material and allows for it to be boosted via their algorithm is a disgrace.“We are acutely aware of the passage of time which moves us further away from the events of the Holocaust, and eyewitnesses to this history are becoming fewer in number. At the same time, antisemitism is increasing – this extremism needs to be exposed, challenged and stamped out.”Joani Reid, the Labour chair of the all party parliamentary group against antisemitism, said she planned to write to Substack and Ofcom to ask them to address the Guardian’s findings. She said antisemitism was “spreading with impunity” and getting worse.“We need to hold these tech companies to account because there are real-life consequences to this,” she said. “Jewish people have been complaining about this for years – saying this violence online is going to end in violence offline and that is exactly what has happened. We need to start taking this stuff far more seriously.”Substack was contacted for comment but did not respond.Launched in 2017, the platform has previously faced criticism for hosting newsletters that promote extremist views. Its co-founder, Hamish McKenzie addressed its decision to host Nazi content in one of his own posts on the site in 2023.“I just want to make it clear that we don’t like Nazis either – we wish no one held those views,” he wrote. “But some people do hold those and other extreme views. Given that, we don’t think that censorship (including through demonetising publications) makes the problem go away – in fact, it makes it worse.“We believe that supporting individual rights and civil liberties while subjecting ideas to open discourse is the best way to strip bad ideas of their power. We are committed to upholding and protecting freedom of expression, even when it hurts.”McKenzie also said the site’s content guidelines “do have narrowly defined proscriptions, including a clause that prohibits incitements to violence”.Get in touchContact us about this storyThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

That apparently included information on sensitive fiscal and political developments including Brown’s own resignation, as well as a €500bneurozone rescue deal.Those emailsappear to have been sent to Epstein hours before they were publicly announced in May 2010. Both those eventsshifted the price of stocks and currencies, including of the British pound. It came at a febrile moment for global markets and local economies, which were still struggling to stabilise after the 2008 financial crisis.Cooper, who also serves as the Lib Dems’ Treasury spokesperson, pointed to emails apparently showing that Mandelson forwarded a confidential document to Epstein in June 2009 outlining policy options to shore up the UK’s public finances, including selling off £20bn worth of assets.She also highlighted the exchange in which Mandelson seems to tell Epstein that theJP Morganchief executive, Jamie Dimon, should “threaten” the Treasury over its plans to tax bankers’ bonuses in December 2009.The revelations have sent shock waves through Westminster, and led to Mandelson’s resignation from the Labour party on Sunday. Mandelson, who was sacked as the UK’s ambassador to the US in September 2025,resigned from the House of Lordson Tuesday.The Metropolitan police have launcheda criminal investigation into Mandelsonover allegations he leaked market-sensitive emails to Epstein, who died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial over child sex-trafficking charges.“No individual, regardless of their standing or former office, should be permitted to compromise the integrity of the UK’s financial system by treating confidential state information as a private commodity,” Cooper’s letter said. “I therefore urge the FCA to launch an immediate investigation into whether Peter Mandelson’s actions constitute a criminal offence under insider trading laws.“The victims who suffered such awful abuse at the hands ofJeffrey Epsteindeserve to know the full scope of the financier and his network’s crimes.”A spokesperson for the FCA said: “The [Met] police has already announced a criminal investigation. It wouldn’t be appropriate to comment any further.”Mandelson was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsPeter MandelsonFinancial Conduct AuthorityRegulatorsFinancial sectorJeffrey EpsteinJP MorganLiberal DemocratsnewsShareReuse this content"

Invoking racist tropes, the video depicted the Obamas’ faces superimposed on the bodies of cartoon apes dancing to The Lion Sleeps Tonight.Speaking later to reporters on Air Force One, Trump claimed he had briefly seen part of the video but then handed it off to an unidentified staffer to post. Trump said he would not fire the staffer in question but would not apologize because he did not make a mistake.Trump’s toxic, racist video surpasses previous levels of debasementRead more“No, I looked at the first part. It was really about voter fraud and the machines – how crooked it is, how disgusting it is,” Trump said. “Then I gave it to the people, generally they’d look at the whole thing but I guess somebody didn’t and they posted it. And then we deleted it.”Trump’s recounting sparked speculation inside his orbit about the extent to which the president was responsible and which of his aides ultimately hit “send” on the post. Besides Trump, only two aides have access to his social media account, people familiar with the matter said: Dan Scavino and Harp.Trump’s advisers quickly discounted Scavino, given he has been preoccupied lately with his new role running the presidential personnel office – and instead focused on Harp, who has previously been entangled in Trump’s communications.The White House did not respond to a request for comment about the intrigue at the end of a tumultuous day, which began with the press shop defending the post before it backtracked and blamed a staffer – a claim Trump also repeated in calls with Republican lawmakers.In a call with Tim Scott, the only black Republican senator, who is also the chair of the national Republican senatorial committee andexplicitly denounced the videoas racist, Trump said it was a staffer’s mistake and that he would take the video down,CBS News reported.The move to delete the video marked a rare reversal for Trump, whose instinct has long been to stand by even his most provocative statements – and given that the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, had earlier dismissed criticism of the video.“This is from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the king of the jungle and Democrats as characters fromThe Lion King,” Leavitt said. “Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public.”Harp, 35, is among Trump’s most devoted aides. She joined his 2024 re-election campaign at the outset, and quickly became known as “Human Printer” because she travels with the president carrying a portable printer and spare toner so she can hand him tweets and news articles in hard copy.Over time, Harp established a broader role as a conduit of information to and from the president, relaying to him text messages, social media posts and news articles she believed he would appreciate.But she has also been criticized by colleagues for showing poor judgment – for instance, when she sent an aggressive text to the Trump megadonor Miriam Adelson in the summer of 2024 criticizing her $100m Super PAC as being poorly managed, a person familiar with the matter said.At various points, Harp’s proximity to Trump and her tendency to operate outside the formal chain of command have fueled resentment among other aides. More than once, people have suggested to Trump that she was a liability and sought any opportunity to force her ouster.But Trump has consistently rebuffed those concerns and rewarded Harp for her close loyalty, elevating her at the White House. Harp is a regular presence in the Oval Office, and Trump’s advisers suggested it was unlikely there would be any repercussions for anyone over the episode.Get in touchContact us about this storyThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

Her death and the killing of another Minneapolis resident, Alex Pretti, just weeks later have stoked outrage nationwide overDonald Trump’s immigration crackdown.Scores of protesters gathered across the street from the Bishop Henry Whipple federal building around midday, throwing bottles and sex toys at a line of police guarding the property. TheMinnesotaStar Tribune reported that officers arrested a handful of protesters after the crowd starting throwing chunks of ice. A deputy was hit in the head, and a squad vehicle’s windshield was smashed, according to a statement the newspaper obtained from the Hennepin county sheriff’s office.Police declared the gathering unlawful and ordered protesters to leave. Many complied, the Star Tribune reported, but about 100 remained in a standoff with deputies, state troopers and state conservation officers.Video circulating onsocial mediashows several protesters being forced to the ground and taken into custody. One person, as they appear to be placed in handcuffs, says: “I was here delivering pizza for the protesters. I had no idea that this was happening. I moved to the side of the curb when they started rushing everyone and now they’re arresting me. I am a peaceful protester delivering pizza and they’re arresting me.”No one from the sheriff’s office responded to email, voicemail and text messages from the Associated Press on Saturday afternoon requesting a copy of the statement and inquiring about how many people were arrested, whether anyone was injured and what led up to the arrests.Meanwhile on Saturday, hundreds of people gathered on a snow-covered field in aMinneapolispark to honor Good and Pretti. Event organizers echoed recent criticisms of the immigration crackdown across Minnesota, characterizing it as a federal occupation.A Lakota spiritual leader, Chief Arvol Looking Horse, led a ceremony at the front of the crowd filled with people holding signs and American flags. Others shared music and poetry to honor the two people who have become central figures in the polarizing immigration debate in recent weeks.A federal immigration officer shot and killed Good , a 37-year-old mother of three, in her car in Minneapolis on 7 January. Three agents surrounded her Honda Pilot SUV on a snowy street a few blocks from Good’s home. Bystander video show an officer approaching the SUV, which was stopped across the middle of the road, demanding the driver open the door and grabbing the handle.The vehicle began to pull forward and a different ICE officer standing in front of it pulled his weapon and immediately fired at close range, jumping back as the vehicle moved toward him. The Trump administration has painted Good as a domestic terrorist who tried to run over an officer with her vehicle. State and local officials have rejected that characterization.Pretti was killed on 24 January during a scuffle with immigration officers on the street. Bystander video shows a half-dozen officers taking Pretti to the ground. One spots Pretti’s gun, which he was licensed to carry, and shouts: “He’s got a gun.” Two officers then open fire.The Trump administration’s border czar, Tom Homan, on Wednesday announced the administration would pull 700 immigration officers from Minnesota – roughly a quarter of the officers deployed to the state – after state and local officials agreed over the past week to cooperate by turning over arrested immigrants. Homan did not say when the administration would end its crackdown in the state, however.Good’s wife, Becca Good, issued a statement Saturday saying that the immigration effort is hurting people in Minneapolis and no one knows their names.“You know my wife’s name and you know Alex’s name, but there are many others in this city being harmed that you don’t know – their families are hurting just like mine, even if they don’t look like mine,” Becca Good said in the statement. “They are neighbors, friends, co-workers, classmates. And we must also know their names. Because this shouldn’t happen to anyone.”Marina Dunbar contributed reporting.Explore more on these topicsMinneapolisProtest (US)ICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)MinnesotaUS immigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Lewis, who did not appear on the all-staff meeting during which the cuts were announced, has faced criticism for his absence and leadership.“All – after two years of transformation at TheWashington Post, now is the right time for me to step aside,” Lewis wrote in an untitled email to Post staffers obtained by the Guardian. “I want to thank Jeff Bezos for his support and leadership throughout my tenure as CEO and Publisher. The institution could not have a better owner.”Lewis then addressedsome of the criticism that the Posthas received in recent days, including from many current employees. At least 300 journalists were cut from the Post’s newsroom in one of the largest round of layoffs in American media history.“During my tenure, difficult decisions have been taken in order to ensure the sustainable future of The Post so it can for many years ahead publish high-quality nonpartisan news to millions of customers each day,” Lewis wrote, signing off: “With gratitude, Will.”Jeff D’Onofrio, who only joined the Post in June as chief financial officer, will serve as acting publisher and chief executive.“This is a challenging time across all media organizations, and The Post is unfortunately no exception,” D’Onofrio wrote in a memo to staffers. “I’ve had the privilege of helping chart the course of disrupters and cultural stalwarts alike. All faced economic headwinds in changing industry landscapes, and we rose to meet those moments. I have no doubt we will do just that, together.“I’m honored to take the helm as acting Publisher and CEO to lead us into a sustainable, successful future with the strength of our journalism as our north star,” he wrote. “I look forward to working shoulder to shoulder with all of you to make that happen.”Bezos, who has owned the Post since 2013, and who has received heavy criticism in recent days for his stewardship of the publication, released a statement touting the Post and its new leadership team – without addressing Lewis’s tenure overseeing the company.“The Post has an essential journalistic mission and an extraordinary opportunity. Each and every day our readers give us a roadmap to success. The data tells us what is valuable and where to focus,” Bezos said. “Jeff, along with [executive editor Matt Murray] and [opinion editor Adam O’Neal], are positioned to lead The Post into an exciting and thriving next chapter.”During an interview last week,Murray defended Lewiswhen asked about his absence. “Look, Will has been engaged with me very closely on this for a long time,” Murray told Fox News. “And there were a lot of things that the company did and Will was engaged with all across the company, and I wasn’t. He had a lot of things to tend to today.”Lewis also faced criticism when a former Post sports reporterpublished a photo of himat the festivities for Sunday’s Super Bowl, even after the Post largely destroyed its sports section, laying off writers who cover football.Lewis, 56, joined the Post after a lengthy career working for Rupert Murdoch’s media properties. Most recently, Lewis had spent six years as chief executive officer and publisher of the Wall Street Journal, departing in 2020.Lewis began his career as a journalist at the Financial Times. After working as business editor at the Sunday Times and editor in chief of the Telegraph from 2005 to 2010, Lewis was appointed group general manager at what was then called News International.He played a key role in handling the aftermath of the hacking scandal that enveloped Murdoch’s UK media properties as part of the company-created management and standards committee that handled the company’s interactions with police investigating the allegations. Lewis said upon joining the Post that he did not plan to discuss his role in the aftermath of the hacking scandal any further.His departure was celebrated by some current and former Post journalists who spoke with the Guardian.“Will can put on British charm and knows how to manage up but eventually results matter,” said Glenn Kessler, a former Post journalist who has been critical of the paper’s leadership. “Every initiative he launched failed and he never found a way to boost readers for the Post.”“Will Lewis’s exit is long overdue. His legacy will be the attempted destruction of a great American journalism institution,” said the union representing most Post employees. “But it’s not too late to save The Post. Jeff Bezos must immediately rescind these layoffs or sell the paper to someone willing to invest in its future.”Explore more on these topicsWashington PostWill LewisNewspapersUS press and publishingNewspapers & magazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

Both denied any wrongdoing.View image in fullscreenExamples of emails between Jack Lang and Jeffrey Epstein taken from documents published by the US Department of Justice.Photograph: Nguyen Van Hai-Barbier/Jean Pierre/Abaca/ShutterstockLang’s departure is the latest example of thefallout in Europefrom files released on 30 January by the US Department of Justice, many of which showed Epstein’s social, networking and financial links. Lang is the most high-profile public figure in France caught up in thelatest release of private messagesfrom the convicted sex offender.Lang was culture minister under the Socialist president François Mitterrand in the 1980s and 90s, and oversaw major modern architectural projects such as the building of the Louvre Pyramid. Since 2013, he has headed the Institut du Monde Arabe, or Arab World Institute, a cultural and research institution that promotes understanding of the Arab world and is supervised by the French foreign ministry.Lang was shown in the Epstein files corresponding intermittently with the financier between 2012 and 2019, when Epstein died by suicide in jail.Lang was mentioned more than 600 times in the files, according to news agencies. His daughter was also repeatedly mentioned.Caroline Lang resigned this week from France’s Union of Independent Producers after the emails showed she had founded an offshore company with Epstein in 2016 to invest in the work of young artists. She said she had resigned from that offshore company when further allegations were made against Epstein in 2019. She denied any wrongdoing.Caroline Lang also appeared in Epstein’s will as a beneficiary of €5m, according to the French investigative websiteMediapart. She told the French public broadcaster France 2 this week that she had never heard of the will and had never seen any such document or received any funds.Jack Lang has denied any wrongdoing, saying he was “shocked” that his name appeared in the statutes of the offshore company in 2016 and that he had appealed to Epstein only as a philanthropist.View image in fullscreenJack Lang in January.Photograph: Martin Lelievre/AFP/Getty ImagesLaurent Merlet, a lawyer for Jack and Caroline Lang, told Agence France-Presse: “There has been no movement of funds … But I think it is normal for the justice to want to verify this.” He said Caroline Lang was “serene” because she had received no funds.In a defence used by other Epstein associates, Lang insisted he was unaware of Epstein’s criminal behaviour despite his conviction in 2008 for soliciting a minor for prostitution.“How could a man so courteous, so charming, so generous have perpetrated such abominations?” Lang told the French public broadcaster, France 2, this week. He said he had been shocked to learn of the allegations against Epstein in 2019.A video showed Lang with Epstein in front of the Louvre pyramid in Paris in March 2019, months before he was charged with sex trafficking girls as young as 14.Resignations, denials and excuses: Epstein fallout hits some harder than othersRead moreLe Monde newspaper and Mediapart, which investigated the files, said no documents released by the US justice department suggested either Lang or his daughter had been implicated in Epstein’s sex crimes.Earlier this week, Lang had insisted he would not resign, despite calls for him to quit from all parties, including his own.Lang has said he was introduced to Epstein by the American actor and director Woody Allen.Epstein owned a vast apartment in the west of Paris and was a frequent visitor to the French capital before his death in prison in 2019.Explore more on these topicsFranceJeffrey EpsteinEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He was 47.The band said in a statement on Saturday that Arnold “passed away peacefully, surrounded by loved ones, in his sleep after his courageous battle with cancer”.3 Doors Down formed in Mississippi in 1995 and four years later received a Grammy nomination for the breakout hit Kryptonite. Arnold wrote the song in math class when he was 15 years old, according to the band statement.Their debut album, The Better Life, sold more than 6m copies. A second Grammy nomination came in 2003, for the song When I’m Gone.The band said Arnold “helped redefine mainstream rock music, blending post-grunge accessibility with emotionally direct songwriting and lyrical themes that resonated with everyday listeners”.3 Doors Down released six albums, most recently Us and the Night in 2016. Singles included Loser, Duck and Run and Be Like That, which appeared on the soundtrack for the 2001 film American Pie 2.While promoting their fifth album, Time of My Life, Arnold said he considered himself lucky to have carved out a career in the music business.“If you do something as long as we’ve done it, you can’t help but get better at it, you know?” Arnold told the Associated Press in 2011.In 2017, 3 Doors Down performed at the first inauguration concert of Donald Trump.Arnold announced his cancer diagnosis last May, saying clear cell renal carcinoma had metastasized to his lungs. The band was forced to cancel a summer tour.“His music reverberated far beyond the stage, creating moments of connection, joy, faith, and shared experiences that will live on long after the stages he performed on,” the band said.Explore more on these topicsUS newsnewsShareReuse this content"

It values SpaceX at $1tn and xAI at $250bn, with a stock market flotationexpected in Juneto time with Musk’s birthday and a planetary alignment.However, there are questions over the deal, such as whether it is good for SpaceX’s non-Musk shareholders and whether the technological premise behind it can succeed.Why is Musk linking up rockets and AI?For Musk, a key part of the deal’s rationale is to move datacentres – the central nervous system of AI tools – into space.AI companies are too dependent on earth-bound datacentres that carry immense energy demands, Musk argued this week. The solution, he says, is to put as many as a million satellites into orbit to form vast, solar-powered datacentres.Prof Julie McCann and Prof Matthew Santer, the co-directors of the school of convergence science in space, security and telecoms at Imperial College London, say solar-powered datacentres could be a future option for AI companies. However, there are limits to how much compute power can be mustered by current satellites, they say, so it would need a “planet-wide distributed computer composed of many satellites” – as envisioned by Musk.But even executing the concept might be affected by the quality of connection between the orbiting devices, which will need to operate in tandem in order to replicate terrestrial datacentres as they beam their outputs down to Earth.View image in fullscreenSpaceX launches Starlink satellites from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in October 2025.Photograph: Joe Marino/UPI/ShutterstockThere are other problems to be ironed out, they add, including solar radiation and maintenance. “Datacentres on earth are constantly maintained – component failure is normal. Shipping components to space is complex and expensive, and you would have to be innovative regarding how components are fitted.”Musk talks of these datacentres adding 100 gigawatts of AI capacity annually – currentglobal datacentre capacity is about 59GW– so his vision is ambitious. The world’s richest person believes a merger of rocket hardware and AI software is a winning combination and, in a message to employees, said it would create the “most ambitious, vertically integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth”.“This merger is aimed at creating a new path to generate a low cost of generating AI compute within the next two to three years by bringing together the top internet/space exploration company with top datacentre builders,” says Dan Ives, an analyst at the US financial services company Wedbush Securities.Does xAi need SpaceX’s financial help?Musk’s artificial intelligence company, xAi, is competing with rivals who are spending, and raising, huge sums on the infrastructure – datacentres, computer chips – needed for their products. The company, which has developed the Grok AI tool and also owns the social media network X, reportedly burned through $13bn last year and, unlike Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and Google, does not have a cash-generating legacy business to fund its efforts.View image in fullscreenElon Musk’s xAi is competing with rivals who are spending, and raising, huge sums on the infrastructure needed for their products.Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersCombining with SpaceX will give xAI better access to cash and investors, according to Ross Gerber, an investor in Tesla and SpaceX.“Musk is already running low on capital for xAI and it is competing with companies putting hundreds of billions of dollars into their AI investments. If you merge SpaceX and xAI you can support xAi because SpaceX is an extremely attractive prospect to a lot of investors,” he says.What do SpaceX shareholders think?SpaceX’s technology is complex but it is a straightforward business. It generates revenues from deploying reusable rockets for missions such as launching satellites and restocking the International Space Station. It also operates the Starlink satellite high-speed internet service. SpaceX made about $8bn in profit on $15bn to $16bn of revenue ​last year,according to Reuters.The addition of xAI adds narrative complexity to the SpaceX story, says Michael Sobel, the president and co-founder of Scenic Management, which buys secondary stakes in privately held companies and has invested in the AI company Anthropic.Sobel, who speaks to SpaceX investors regularly, says: “By folding in xAI, which carries a significant monthly cash burn, you change the financial profile of the company overnight. In the secondary market, ‘simple’ is usually rewarded. This merger requires investors to do a lot more homework on how xAI’s cash burn impacts SpaceX’s overall valuation and IPO timeline.”There is also the added burden of X, a social media platform that is a regular subject ofregulatory scrutinyandpolitical ire.Nonetheless, Sobel adds, the argument in favour of the deal is compelling.“For a long-term investor, this secures the most advanced AI ‘brain’ for the most advanced hardware ‘body’ in existence. The upside is a $1.25tn entity that controls the entire stack, from the launchpad to the neural network.”View image in fullscreenThe SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California.Photograph: Daniel Cole/ReutersGerber, who invested in Musk’soriginal buyout of X in 2022when the platform was better known as Twitter, says he welcomes the deal but is less sure about SpaceX investors.“For me as a Twitter shareholder, I could not be happier. I pretty much figured I had lost my money but that has now been parlayed into owning SpaceX shares. It’s awesome for me but if I was a SpaceX shareholder I would be pissed.”What next? A Tesla-SpaceX merger?Musk owns about 44% of the newly enlarged SpaceX business and 17% of Tesla, where he is the chief executive. Is the next step a combination of the two?Ives believes there is a “growing chance” that a one-stop shop for investing in Musk businesses will be created.  “Musk wants to own and control more of the AI ecosystem and step by step the holy grail could be combining SpaceX and Tesla,” he says.View image in fullscreenTesla vehicles in a parking area at the company’s factory in Fremont, California.Photograph: Noah Berger/APGerber believes the timing is right, with both companies currently worth $1.25tn. “This is the time to create a multitrillion-dollar company.

It was platonic, though, to be honest, I was probably in love with him at some point!My mum, Nadine, was an author and arts editor for the Financial Review, so we have lovely memories of going to the opera, ballet and theatre together: me, mum, Russell. She adored him. Mum and I lived in a converted church and he was always offering to work around the house. We’d listen to music, hang out – he tried to teach me about football, and I watched it because he liked it, even though I found it tedious.The moment I knew: as we sat on the veranda playing Scrabble, it hit me – I was in loveRead moreEventually, we started mixing in different circles. I left school in 1984 and went off to study art, and he finished high school then studied mechanical engineering. I’d still see him every now and then; he was working at the servo at Pennant Hills, and I would drop in occasionally.By 1991, I had completed my studies and then went up to Cairns with my then-boyfriend, who I eventually married. Russell and I fell out of touch.In 2003, my marriage broke up, and my mum and I moved to Lemon Tree Passage, near Nelson Bay, together. I was in my late 30s and met a new partner, but it was a difficult time. I was trying and failing to conceive via IVF. My partner and I split after two years, and my mum was very sick. I looked after her until she passed away in 2009.The next decade wasn’t easy, but just before 2020, I was ready for a fresh start. I sold my home and bought a caravan. I had planned to just go wherever I wanted, then Covid lockdowns happened. When the world shut down, I found healing. I was making jewellery, painting, swimming and spending time with my dogs. I was enjoying my own company and planned to stay single.At the same time, I had been searching for Russell. I wasn’t thinking anything romantic, but I did dream about him and wondered where he was. I found a guy with Russell’s name on Facebook and sent him a friend request, but the guy said: “I’m not the Russell you’re looking for.”Then, in June of 2025, I got a message out of the blue from another Russell. He asked: “Are you the Gabby who used to live in the church in Turramurra?”Russell was living in Adelaide, so we got on the phone. That first night, we talked for about three hours. We just clicked, like 40 years had disappeared with one call. We started talking every night.I have never trusted people easily but with Russell it was different. We were part of each other’s historyOn the phone, we talked about school, our childhood, the streets he’d ride down on his bike, about Mum, the old church and going to see the Sydney Dance Company with her. I told him how Mum had become ill, how I cared for her at home and how much she loved him when we were teenagers.Russell’s first marriage had ended a few years before we reconnected, and he turned romantic quickly, but I was still a bit reticent. I didn’t want to be lovey-dovey over the phone or anything. Within two months, he’d bought me a plane ticket to visit him in Adelaide. He took me to a beautiful oceanfront restaurant, and I felt safe and calm with him. It was like coming home.I have never trusted people easily, but with Russell, it was different. We were part of each other’s history. On that trip to Adelaide, our connection deepened, and we decided to make a long-distance relationship work.By that stage, I had bought an old church in Mount Russell, in northern New South Wales, and was planning to renovate. One day, while we were on the phone, Russell said he wanted to help me do it up. He’s a project manager and had all the skills I needed. I pushed back a little bit, but he insisted. He told me my mum would have wanted him to help, so he would. When he said that, I knew I was in love.View image in fullscreen‘I never thought I would have another partner at this stage of my life’: Gabby and Russell at dinner in Port Stephens, where Russell proposedLast October, we had our 40-year school reunion in Sydney. We planned to surprise everyone by turning up as a couple. We met up in Port Stephens so we could road-trip to Sydney together. The night he arrived, we went to dinner and he proposed.I never thought I would have another partner at this stage of my life. I was happy, content with my dog, my creative pursuits and my little church. But we can do it all, together. Russell and I now travel to see each other every few weeks, with long phone calls in between. I love his mind and curious nature. I can’t wait for the rest of our lives together.I don’t know when we will get married. But I have bought the most beautiful Camilla dress for the occasion, so we do need to have a party! And I know my mum would be so happy for us.Tell us the moment you knewShare your experienceShare your love storyDo you have a romantic realisation you'd like to share?

Our eyesight is one of the most important ways with which we interact with the world, and it interacts with us. We take our eyesight for granted, which is why it comes as such a shock when it starts to let us down.“Blindness is a very scary disability,” saysProf Lauren Ayton, deputy director of the Centre for Eye Research Australia at the University of Melbourne. “But people don’t realise actually about 90% of vision loss can be prevented or treated.” And like many other problems, keeping the eyes healthy so often comes down to good diet, keeping active, and regular check-ups.Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningThere are two key periods in life where eye problems become obvious. There is an emerging global epidemic of myopia – shortsightedness – in school-age children, with aroundone in threechildren and adolescents now short-sighted – and that figure is rising. And while the exact cause of this rise is unclear, research does suggest that screen time is a factor – but not in the way you might think.Screens versus the outdoorsFor all the concern about screen time being the enemy of eyesight, there actually is no evidence that closeup focusing on screens causes myopia.“The direct evidence for screens in and of themselves being problematic is pretty, pretty weak,” saysProf Allison McKendrick, Lions Eye Institute UWA chair in optometry research in Perth. What’s more likely is that screen time is taking over from time doing other things that are beneficial for eye health.‘The best movement is the next movement’: how to really look after your lower backRead moreOne of those things, particularly in children, is outdoor time, saysDr Flora Hui, a clinical scientist also at the Centre for Eye Research Australia. “Getting enough sunlight is actually important for the growth of their eye,” she says. One theory is that sunlight causes the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine, which is important for healthy eye development. Playing outside and away from screens also means the eye is focusing on things at distance, which also helps the eye develop.“I say ‘green time over screen time’,” Hui says. Encouraging children to go outside for one or two hours a day “has been proven to actually slow down the progression of shortsightedness”.The ‘inevitable’ mid-40s declineFor those who dodge myopia in their youth, the first awareness of the fallibility of the eye comes in midlife with what eye specialists jokingly describe as the “my arms are too short” problem. Anyone in their mid-forties who has unexpectedly found themselves holding a restaurant menu at arm’s length to read it will recognise this syndrome.It’s called presbyopia, it’s age-related, and it’s inevitable. “The need for reading glasses is linked to the number of birthdays you’ve had,” Ayton says. It’s simply the result of the clear flexible lens in the eye, which focuses light on to the back of the eye – the retina – becoming less flexible as we age. That means it’s less effective at bending to focus light, so we find it harder to see things up close.Unfortunately, there’s no prevention or cure for presbyopia.The only thing that can be done for presbyopia is to correct that focus with glasses, which – despite some concerns – does not make the eye weak or lazy. Ayton says she often gets people complaining that as soon as they got glasses, their vision got worse and worse, but that is the natural course of eye ageing.“It’s not going to make your eyes weaker by wearing glasses,” she said. “Pretty much every two years, your reading prescription is going to get updated.”Another common age-related eye condition is cataracts, and this is also to do with the lens of the eye. “As the lens grows, it gets hazier, so now instead of looking through a nice clear lens, you’re starting to look through a hazy one,” says Hui. Like presbyopia, cataracts aren’t preventable, but they can be treated by replacing the lens entirely with a new artificial one.Early diagnosisThe two age-related eye problems that can be prevented, or at least slowed down, are glaucoma, which is caused by progressive damage to the optic nerve, and age-related macular degeneration, which affects the central part of the retina at the back of the eye.While eating a healthy diet and not smoking can reduce the risk, the most important prevention is early diagnosis. “The message that needs to go out to people in their 40s and 50s, is that it is really important that you do have regular eye examinations,” McKendrick says. “The main age-related eye diseases like glaucoma and macular degeneration and so forth, initially don’t have any symptoms, and so you can have this slowly ticking away for years.” By the time they have become symptomatic enough to prompt people to see a specialist, they have already lost a lot of their vision, and that isn’t coming back.The key to healthy eyes and vision is the “three O’s”, says Ayton: keeping off screens, being outdoors, and seeing an optometrist or ophthalmologist regularly.“For general check-ups, people should be seeing the optometrist – if they’re below the age of 60 – every two to three years, and then over 60 becomes more regular as the risk of eye diseases gets higher.”Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingThe way you movefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Are they actually healthy?Adrienne MateiSat 7 Feb 2026 10.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 7 Feb 2026 10.03 ESTShareMost American adults today didn’t grow up with avocados, but we’ve certainly developed a hearty appetite for them. In 1990, the United States imported38m poundsof avocados; by 2023, that number was 2,789m, mostly from Mexico.On average, each of us eats about 20 avocados, or 9lbs of the fruit, a year – a sixfold increase from 1998. Super Bowl guacamole alone fuels a staggering demand for the fruit; in the lead-up to this Sunday’s game, Americans areexpectedto devour nearly 280m pounds of avocados, a historical record.Avocado toast, California rolls, cobb salad? America’s answer is “yes” – and not only because of the fruit’s creaminess, but its perceived healthfulness. We believe avocados are a superfood, but why, exactly, do they have that reputation?Black sesame is growing more popular in the US. Is it actually good for you?Read moreWhat is the nutritional makeup of avocados?One medium Hass avocado contains about 320 calories and 30g of heart-healthy, monounsaturated fat. A serving of avocado is about 50g, or a third of a medium fruit, but portion size is flexible: a whole fruit can fit into your daily diet depending on your overall calorie needs (a person consuming 2,000 calories a day requires about 44 – 78g of total fat).Not only does monounsaturated fat help lower cholesterol, thereby our risk of heart disease, but it can “carry” the vitamins in avocado, like vitamins A, D and folate, making them easier for our bodies to absorb through the gut and into our bloodstream, says Dalina Soto, a Philadelphia-based registered dietician.Avocado’s fiber contributes to its status as a nutritional powerhouse: one fruit contains 14g of fiber – roughly half your daily needs. “Avocados provide both soluble fiber, which helps support gut bacteria, slows digestion, and can help with blood sugar regulation, and insoluble fiber, which supports regular digestion and gut motility,” Soto explains. “We need both for gut and metabolic health.”Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, 'Well Actually', then 'Read more on living a good life in a complex world,' then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say 'More from this section'Avocados deliver vitamin E, an antioxidant helpful for immune defense and skin resilience. They also contain lutein, one of only two eye-specific carotenoids (a kind of antioxidant that gives plants their pigment) that accumulates in eye tissues to potentially help reduce the risk of age-related conditions like macular degeneration and cataracts, according to Tufts Universityresearch.These researchers also observed that daily avocado intake correlated with sharper working memory and attention in older adults, suggesting that avocados may be a good addition to a brain-supportive diet.Can avocados support weight loss?In 2021, a randomized controlledstudyfound that families with higher avocado consumption than a control group (14 avocados a week versus three for a family of five) “reported fewer calories overall and an improved diet quality” over a six-month period, says Dr Lorena Pacheco, first author of the study, nutritional epidemiologist and researcher at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health and the Herbert Wertheim School of Public Health at UC San Diego.In the families that ate more avocados, it seemed “there was a shift in their whole eating pattern in a healthier direction”, she says.Pacheco thinks several factors contributed to these results. For one, fiber-rich avocados are “known to help people feel fuller for longer”, thus leading people to eat less “without consciously trying to reduce calories”, she says.It’s worth noting that the reduction in calories did not lead to weight loss among the study’s participants, meaning their lifestyle shifts were either not significant enough to produce changes in waist circumference or BMI, or more time was required than the study’s six-month scope to take effect, Pacheco says.Does it even need to be said? No, you don’t need to do a ‘parasite cleanse’Read moreNonetheless, avocados “may replace less healthy foods”, meaning that when families added avocados to their meals, they may have substituted them for foods higher in sugar, refined carbs or saturated fat, “such as using avocado as a spread on a sandwich in lieu of mayonnaise”, Pacheco says.Consuming an excess of saturated fat can worsen cardiovascular health, raising “bad” LDL cholesterol and promoting the formation of plaque in arteries, so replacing saturated fat with monounsaturated fat – be it olive oil, nuts, seeds or avocado – is generally a healthful switch. Indeed, in 2022, Pachecopublishedstatistical estimates showing that people eating avocados twice a week or more could have an up to 21% lower risk of heart disease, especially when avocados replace trans or saturated fats like butter or processed meats.But is it ecologically responsible to eat avocados?Most of Mexico’s avocados are grown year-round in Michoacán, a mountainous state in westernMexico. There, the crop has historically contributed to illegal deforestation, affecting local biodiversity and monarch butterfly habitat. Avocado orchard expansion resulted in approximately 49,400 acres (think a mid-sized city) of deforestation between 2018 and 2024,accordingto Mexico’s secretary of environment and natural resources, Alicia Bárcena Ibarra.But there are signs that new forest loss could be curbed. Namely, the Mexican government and the Association of Avocado Exporting Producers and Packers launched a deforestation-free certification program in 2024 that tracks compliance with environmental laws and protects key biological areas, explains Kimin Cho, a PhD candidate at University of Hawai’i at Mānoa whose research has explored the environmental sustainability and transparency of Mexico’s avocado supply chain. “Certification also includes third-party auditors, so that helps the overall governance structure,” Cho says.As of January, Mexican avocados will need to meet a deforestation-free criteria in order to be exported. This may not be a silver bullet for all of avocado’s agricultural challenges, but it could mean our favorite, fatty fruit is getting just a little more green.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyAvocadosHealthFoodNutritionHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Their prominence represents a rebuke of the ugly Islamophobia that defined the period following 9/11, and is in many ways an outcrop of the mass movement for Palestinian rights forged over the last two years. Rhana Natour asked 18 Muslim New Yorkers to discuss their work and what this moment means.Read more4.A romance fraudster ruined my life – how I survived two years with a psychopathView image in fullscreenComposite: Guardian Design; ccahill/Getty Images“Tamsin met Mike in the summer of 2022. He was a mechanic in a garage that she walked past twice each day between home and work. After a while, he’d call out ‘good morning’ or ‘good evening’ and she’d wave and smile back. Then the exchanges got a little longer. (‘Hard day?’ ‘Looking forward to dinner?’) Six months later, Mike and Tamsin exchanged numbers. Within two years, her life was wrecked. She had left her marriage, lost her home, quit her job,sold her car and her phone, spent all her savings and racked up tens of thousands in debt.”Anna Moore explored how “one-person romance fraud” is becoming better understood – even if the police aren’t taking it seriously.Read more5.‘She worked like a maniac’ … Meet the design genius who could even make roadworks look goodView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Neil Spence/AlamyAirports, road signs, typefaces … Margaret Calvert revolutionised how Britain looked and her brilliantly clear designs are still used today. “There was also no such thing as graphic design back thent was just called commercial art,” she told Catherine Slessor.Read more6.‘They’re taught that showing feelings is shameful’: eight reasons men don’t go to therapy – and why they shouldView image in fullscreenIllustration: Nathalie Lees/The GuardianWhen it comes to talking therapy, men don’t come easily, and when they do seek help in a crisis, they can disappear as suddenly as they arrive. Yet male vulnerability is clear – men report lower levels of life satisfaction than women and make up three-quarters of suicides and problems with addiction. So why are men still so reluctant to talk? Clinical psychologist Dr Stephen Blumenthal explored eight key reasons.Read moreExplore more on these topicsSix great readsnewsShareReuse this content"

We will make no further comment until after the conclusion of the skeleton competition.”UK Sport has spent £5,765,123 of national lottery funding on skeleton sliders over the past four years, and has been rewarded with Weston in particular dominating the sport. Last year the 28-year-old became world champion for a second time, beating his closest rival Wyatt by 1.9sec. This season, Weston has won five races and Wyatt two.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsTeam GBnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s all bare wood and black and white photographs from the 1950s.All the set dressing in Cortina has an art deco touch, the place happily back in another era, before anyone had to worry about the 21st century. It feels like a town time forgot, and which the financial crisis didn’t touch. Louis Vuitton is here, so is Prada. There’s a pop-up Dior store with an eight-foot ice sculpture out front.There are two curling fixtures at 10am, round-robin matches in the mixed doubles, two Swedish siblings are playing a married couple from Switzerland in one, and the Great British pair of Bruce Mouat and Jenn Dodds are playing another married couple from Canada on the other. The Canadians, Brett Gallant and Jocelyn Peterman, started dating after they decided to form a team to try to qualify for the Olympics inPyeongchangeight years ago. There are a lot of married couples competing in mixed curling. Must be something in all that frozen water.“Harder!” Peterman screams at Gallant as he vigorously pumps his broom, “Harder! Keep going! Keep going! Yes! Yes!” It doesn’t do them any good. Everyone else might still be figuring out what’s what on day one, but the curlers have been here for almost a week already.View image in fullscreenThe sliding centre, which overlooks Cortina d’Ampezzo, was finished just in time for the Games, but no one seems to have got around to building any facilities around it.Photograph: Al Bello/Getty ImagesTheir competitions run on so long that this one started on the Wednesday before the opening ceremony, and Mouat and Dodds have been dominating the competition. They had already won all their first five matches and after Mouat put them 3-0 with his hammer in the very first end against Canada, it was clear their winning streak was about to reach six. They eventually won 7-5.Mouat is the most-feared competitor in the sport. The 31-year-old is the one all the others talk about in awed whispers. The day before,Snoop Dogg asked him for a selfie. “I’ve heard about you,” Snoop told him. Later on, Mouat and Dodds beat the previously undefeated USA duo 8-6, too, which means they have already qualified for the semi-finals. “How many times are they playing today?” asked a German photographer when they came back out on to the ice. “And twice more tomorrow, too,” I told him. “Christ,” he replied. “This is worse than cricket.”Tune in again on Tuesday evening, when they will be playing for medals. Till then, the women’s skiathlon is three hours’ drive in one direction, the women’s ski jump three hours in another and the ice hockey, figure skating and freestyle skiing in other parts of the country altogether.But the women’s alpine is only a 15-minute bus ride out of town up into the mountains. They’re holding the third, and last, day of training runs before the women’s downhill. It’s not immediately clear that the skiing set and the curling community are a part of the same species, let alone the same sporting event.Curlingis the slowest, most meditative sport in the Olympics and despite the best efforts of a gaggle of four enthusiastic Swiss, was taking place almost entirely in silence.View image in fullscreenBritain’s Bruce Mouat and Jennifer Dodds compete against the USA’s Korey Dropkin and Cory Thiesse.Photograph: David J Phillip/APUp on the mountain, they’re pumping out House of Pain over the public address system while the women come screaming down the mountain at the sort of speeds that make you nauseous from watching.They had to cancel the first day of training because of the weather, and the fog is closing in again on Saturday, but they have time to get a handful of racers away. Everyone wants to see Lindsey Vonn, competing in her final Olympics after coming out of a five-year retirement. The 41-year-old American is racing in a brace aftershe ruptured her anterior cruciate ligament in her left kneelast week. An ACL is apparently something she can get by fine without.‘My ACL is 100% gone’: Lindsey Vonn’s improbable comeback at 41 is just another riskRead moreShe finished in 1min 38.28sec, third fastest on the day, behind her USA teammate Breezy Johnson. There was a moment when her knee buckled on an early jump. Everyone watching winced in worry. But Vonn sped on. She didn’t even seem to stop to steady herself.There may not be another sport out there where the competitors are brushing up as close against the edge of what’s possible as they seem to do in downhill skiing. Vonn’s contest against Johnson, Germany’s Emma Aicher and the great Italian Sofia Goggia, who won gold back in 2018, may just be the great race of the entire Games.Better viewing, for sure, than the men’s singles luge competition back down at the sliding centre. They finished this just in time for the Games, but no one seems to have got around to building any of the facilities around it. So the crowd tumbled up and down the hill looking for a spot to stand and watch from.For such a fast sport, it’s a very slow watch. Which might be why everyone who knows what they’re doing has started drinking already. There were two races and the competition stretched on long into the evening as the sun started to dip down back into the valley over the other side of the mountain, the way things seem around here, the nights just might be the busiest time of day.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsCurlingLindsey VonnSkiingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Entering Sunday’s Olympic downhill medal race, injuries haven’t eitherBryan Armen Grahamin MilanSat 7 Feb 2026 09.29 ESTFirst published on Sat 7 Feb 2026 08.55 ESTShareIt was all going a little too easy forLindsey Vonn. All the nervous apprehension, the paternalistic concern, the arch skepticism and hushed snickers that had rippled through the sports world when she announced her comeback from a six-year retirement had long since gone silent. A once-unthinkable fairytale ending at the age of 41 on the slopes of Cortina d’Ampezzo was practically within touching distance.Back in November 2024, having been chased from the sport in 2019 by a battered right knee worn down by a string of gruesome crashes and multiple surgeries, Vonn proposed a return to a high-risk sport where no woman had ever won a race past the age of 34. There’s a history of comebacks like these going brutally wrong, and even Vonn’s most dedicated fans were bracing themselves for the worst. Think a shopworn Joe Louis getting battered through the ropes and on to the ring apron by Rocky Marciano. Or Björn Borg returning to the tour in the early 90s with a wooden racket, defiantly flailing through a sport that had moved on without him.Lindsey Vonn, skiing with ruptured ACL, takes crucial step in downhill medal bidRead moreBut a funny thing happened on the way to Vonn’s presumptive humiliation. In the first two months, shefinished 14th in a super-Gat St Moritz, before improving tosixthandfourthin her next two races at St Anton. Then came this Olympic season. Vonn reached the podiumin all five World Cup downhill racesshe entered – two wins, a second place and two thirds – seizing the red bib as the discipline’s season-long leader and reestablishing herself, against all odds, as one of the fastest skiers on the planet. Conspicuously absent were the injuries and surgeries and chronic pain that had become the familiar punctuation of her career. What could go wrong only one week out from the Olympics?It turns out plenty. At last week’s final World Cup downhill before the Games, Vonnlost control after landing a jump highon the course in Crans-Montana, Switzerland, skidding sideways into the safety netting. Her airbag deployed on impact and she remained down for several moments before she was helicoptered off the course to hospital. Scans later confirmed a complete ACL rupture in her left knee, along with a bone bruise and meniscal damage.It has never come easy for Vonn, the winner of 84 World Cup races and a three-time Olympic medalist, including downhill gold in 2010. Maybe it never was supposed to for theKima Greggsof the piste: sometimes things just gotta play hard.All eyes will be on Vonn, the biggest star at the Milano Cortina Olympics, when the women’s alpine skiing begins on Sunday at the Tofane Alpine Skiing Centre, with the downhill the first of five medal events. A top-three finish would cap a remarkable comeback rendered even more improbable by the injury. It would also make history, moving her past France’s Johan Clarey – also 41 when he won downhill silver in 2022 – as the oldest Olympic alpine skiing medalist. (She became the oldest woman to medaleight years ago in Pyeongchang.) The setting only adds deeper meaning: Vonn has piled up a record 12 World Cup victories in Cortina, making it one of the defining backdrops of her career.Her shredded kneepassed the first teston Friday afternoon when she posted one of the faster times without obvious hesitation in a downhill training run. Even her coach, the two-time Olympic champion Aksel Lund Svindal, sounded cautiously impressed. “She was smart. She didn’t go all in,” he said afterward. “The rest looked like good skiing. No big risk. To me, it looked symmetrical – and that’s what we were looking for today.”Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content,click 'Allow and continue'.Allow and continueThat word –symmetrical– may be the most important medical and competitive data point of her imperiled Olympic campaign. But Svindal went further. “She’s tough,” he said. “If she skis well, she can win. From what I saw today, she could possibly bring that on Sunday.”By Saturday, the evidence had grown stronger. Vonn clocked the third-fastest time in the second downhill training session, reaching a maximum speed of 78.7mph (126.7km/h) and finishing 0.37 seconds behind leader and US teammateBreezy Johnson, another indication that Sunday’s start will be for more than a participation trophy.Winter Olympics 2026: Swiss win first gold, IOC plays down norovirus concern, and more – liveRead moreNot everyone is convinced the story is quite that simple. On Friday, an online exchange between Vonn and a sports medicine doctor briefly became its own subplot. The doctor suggested publicly that her knee might have been functioning as if the ACL were already compromised before last week’s crash – the kind of chronic tear elite athletes sometimes learn to stabilize around – framing her comeback as remarkable but perhaps not quite unprecedented.Vonn’s response was characteristically direct.“Lol thanks doc,” she wrote. “My ACL was fully functioning until last Friday. Just because it seems impossible to you doesn’t mean it’s not possible. And yes, my ACL is 100% ruptured. Not 80% or 50%. It’s 100% gone.”The chippy repartee did little to alter the competitive reality. Vonn spent the hours after Friday’s run posting video of heavy squats and box jumps, equal parts rehab update and message to anyone still wondering what the human body is built to withstand. But it’s her capacity to reset mentally that remains almost inexplicable, even after all these years. If a neurologist studied her brain, they’d likely discover aHonnoldianlack of the circuitry responsible for producing fear. Vonn would probably disagree with that framing. She just metabolizes it differently.View image in fullscreenA week after rupturing her ACL, Lindsey Vonn clocked speeds above 70mph on her downhill training runs.Photograph: Mattia Ozbot/Getty Images“I’ve never been afraid,” she said this week. “I’ve always been the kid that climbs the tree. My grandpa always called me a daredevil. That’s why I’m a downhiller. I like risk. I like going fast. I like pushing myself to the limit.”That has always been embedded in her mythology. Vonn was never the smooth, untouched prodigy gliding above the sport. She was the one who crashed, who broke, who rebuilt, who came back angrier and faster. Pain was never a detour in her career; it was the road itself.What makes this chapter different is the arithmetic. At 25, you crash out and rehab and convince yourself there is unlimited runway ahead. At 41, every race carries the faint understanding that there may not be another tomorrow. That reality has never seemed to slow her. If anything, it has sharpened the edges of everything she does: the line choice, the risk tolerance, the willingness to trust a body that has betrayed her too many times to count.The Olympics have never been the neatest chapter of her story. Vancouver was triumph. Sochi was the one that got away. Pyeongchang was grit dressed up as a swansong. Milano Cortina has become something else entirely: a reckoning with time itself.Winter Olympics briefing: opening ceremony delivers a love letter to ItalyRead moreThere is a version of Sunday where physics and biology reassert themselves and this becomes another entry in the long, unsentimental history of sport moving on from its ageing heroes. There is another where Vonn holds it together for 90 seconds on a mountain she knows as well as anyone in the world and forces the sport to reckon, one more time, with the possibility that the normal rules do not apply to her. Either outcome would be consistent with the career she has lived.The truth about Vonn was never that she was untouchable. It was that she was willing to go back to the same dangerous place, again and again, long after most people would have stopped answering the call. On Sunday, in what may be the appointment viewing of the entire Olympics, she will push out of the start gate knowing exactly what this costs. The pain. The risk. The infinitesimal margin between triumph and catastrophe. The only part that has never changed is the decision. And as long as there is a mountain in front of her, she will point herself straight down it.Explore more on these topicsLindsey VonnWinter Olympics 2026US sportsUSA Olympic teamSkiingWinter OlympicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After his stunning performance in the men’s downhill on Saturday, it is surely time for an upgrade.On a beautiful day in Bormio, the 24-year-old dominated a challenging course to win in 1:min 51.61sec and take the first medal of these Olympic Games. That time was good enough to withstand Italy’s Giovanni Franzoni, who finished with the silver medal 0.20sec back. Another Italian, Dominik Paris, who is vocalist of a heavy metal band called Rise of Voltage, claimed bronze.Winter Olympics 2026: Swiss win first gold, IOC plays down norovirus concern, and more – liveRead more“It feels like a movie, not really real,” Von Allmen said. “I can’t tell you what it means to me. For now, can you imagine doing better at the Olympics?”When asked about the secret to his success he said: “Try to enjoy skiing, really,. I was relaxed in the morning and tried to keep the good feelings from the training, tried to fit all the pieces together from the training and just have fun.”Von Allmen, who became the youngest downhill world champion in 36 years last year, has done it the hard way. At 17, his father died and he had to crowdfund in order to continue skiing, before making the Swiss squad a year later.Unlike other racers who attend ski academies, he had to work, in his case on construction sites, in the summer. That experience not only helped his wallet, but built his physique and his character. “I had to go the extra mile and that shaped me,” he said.Franzoni, who took silver, praised von Allmen. “To share the podium with Franjo after the junior world championships, he’s such a great guy.”View image in fullscreenFranjo von Allmen barely put a ski off line as he blazed down the sunlit track to win with a time of 1:51.61.Photograph: Anna Szilágyi/EPAThe Italian was happy with his performance. “It’s such an amazing feeling,” he said. “This morning I was pretty calm, but at the start I was becoming so nervous. The Italian people gave me a great message, with passion, with love. It gave me great energy to produce a great run.”Paris was stunned after winning an Olympic Games medal at the fifth attempt. “I don’t have feelings at the moment,” he said. “Maybe when the prize ceremony starts that will change and I will understand what’s happened to me.”The pre-Games favouritem Marco Odermatt, of Switzerland, could only finish fourth, 0.70sec back from his gold-winning compatriot. “A disappointing race for me, but the feeling was actually good,” he said. “I skied like I wanted, but it was not fast enough.”But this day was about Von Allmen. According to his teammates, he is a likable guy who snores louder than anyone. But on Saturday, he made his biggest noise on the slopes.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsSkiingnewsShareReuse this content"

But when the TV cameras cut to Vance and his wife, Usha, there were boos, jeers and a smattering of applausefrom the crowd. The reaction was shown on Canadian broadcaster CBC’s feed, with one commentator saying: “There is the vice-president JD Vance and his wife Usha – oops, those are not … uh … those are a lot of boos for him. Whistling, jeering, some applause.”The USTA’s censorship of Trump dissent at the US Open is cowardly, hypocritical and un-American | Bryan Armen GrahamRead moreThe Guardian’s Sean Ingle was also at the ceremony andnoted the boos, as didUSA Today’s Christine Brennan. However, on the NBC broadcast the booswere not heard or remarkedupon when Vance appeared on screen, with the commentary team simply saying “JD Vance”. That didn’t stopfootage of the boosbeing circulated and shared on social media in the US. The White Houseposted a clipof Vance applauding on NBC’s broadcast without any boos.Friday was not the first time there have been moves to stop US viewers from witnessing dissent against the Trump administration. At September’s US Open, tournament organizersasked broadcastersnot to show the crowd’s reaction to Donald Trump, who attended the men’s final. Part of the message read: “We ask all broadcasters to refrain from showing any disruptions or reactions in response to the president’s attendance in any capacity.”Earlier on Friday in Milan, hundreds of people protested against the presence of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents at this year’s Olympics. The US state department has said that several federal agencies, including ICE, will be at the Games to help protect visiting Americans. The state department said the ICE unit in Italy is separate from those involved in the immigration crackdown in the United States.Before the ceremony, freestyle skier Hunter Hess said he had mixed emotions about representing the US in the current political climate.“There’s obviously a lot going on that I’m not the biggest fan of,” he said. “Just because I’m wearing the flag doesn’t mean I represent everything that’s going on in the US.”IOC spokesman Mark Adams addressed the crowd reaction in a Saturday news conference.“From the IOC’s point of view, the next Games are coming up in Los Angeles. We are super happy that the US administration is so engaged with the Games. That is a great thing for the Olympic movement. I was in the stadium last night, and seeing the US team being cheered as they were by the audience, fair play, that was fantastic.“I know [Vance and IOC president Kirsty Coventry] met, and it went incredibly well. There was very good chemistry and they had a very good discussion. She was very pleased about the enthusiasm of the vice-president for the Games.”Vance was not the only person to garner a negative reaction. The four athletes representing Israel were greeted with boos as well as cheers when they appeared for the opening ceremony.“We don’t like to see any booing, regardless of what countries athletes are from. It is important we support our athletes,” Adams said. “If you want to get philosophical about it, one idea [we have at the IOC] is that athletes shouldn’t be punished for the actions of governments or the countries where they are from.”Explore more on these topicsWinter OlympicsWinter Olympics 2026JD VanceUS sportsNBCUS televisionTelevision industrynewsShareReuse this content"

England have had tougher training sessions in preparation for thisSix Nationsand by the end the scoreboard spoke for itself. Wales were not so much beaten as buried beneath an avalanche of seven white tries including a first-half hat-trick for the pacy Bath wing Henry Arundell on his first England start since the 2023 World Cup.If not quite as big a rout asEngland’s 68-14 win in Cardiff11 months ago, the flashing red warning lights were visible from the moment the visitors had two players sent to the sin bin in the first quarter. They never looked like recovering and, in its own way, this disappointment will sting as much as the73-0 defeat by South Africain November.‘We let people down’: Dewi Lake apologises to Wales fans after England thrashingRead moreIf there was some consolation that England could not always sustain their first-half momentum it was strictly relative. The plain truth was that the game had long since been won and the bonus point banked, although head coach Steve Borthwick will be slightly irked by his side’s inability to put the hammer fully down when Wales were again reduced to 13 men by two more yellow cards in the final quarter.Quick GuideEngland 48 Wales 7: teams and scorersShowEnglandSteward (Smith 64); Roebuck (Pollock 64), Freeman, Dingwall, Arundell; Ford, Mitchell (Spencer 66); Genge (Rodd ht), George (Cowan-Dickie 50), Heyes (Davison 50), Coles (Itoje 50), Chessum, Pepper, Underhill (T Curry 50), EarlTriesArundell 3, Earl, Roebuck, Penalty tryConsFord 4PenFordYellow cardItoje 50WalesRees-Zammit; Mee (Grady 52), James, Thomas, Adams; Edwards, Williams (Hardy 78); Smith (Carre 50), Lake (Belcher 66), Griffin (Francis 50), Jenkins, Beard (Carter 69), Mann (Plumtree 50), Macleod (Deaves 52), WainwrightTryAdamsConEdwardsYellow cardSmith 16, Lake 17, Thomas 64, Plumtree 66Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Either way this was another sobering result for those who believe the Six Nations is only ever as strong as its weakest link. If this 145-year-old fixture ever becomes humdrum the championship will be fundamentally the poorer for it and its traditional colour and passion will steadily ebb away. It is not just Welsh fans who will be praying for some light at the eastbound end of the Brynglas tunnels.You certainly had to admire the pre-match optimism of the defiant visiting supporter carrying his inflatable leek up the road from Twickenham station. Good news is not exactly rife within Welsh rugby just now and theoff-field politicsremain poisonous. Those trying to keep the faith badly need something to cling to in the coming weeks but there was scant encouragement here on a cool, grey evening.By the end Wales had been shown four yellow cards, meaning they played almost a quarter of the game with 13 players. In their last five Test they have now accrued 10 yellows and one red, an indicator of the pressure they are frequently under. For England George Ford ran the game with practised ease and Ollie Chessum was a constant menace but, for the most part, the home side did not have to lift themselves much above second gear.View image in fullscreenBen Earl gives the crowd two thumbs up after touching down England’s third try.Photograph: Isabel Infantes/ReutersJust about everything that could have gone wrong for Wales did so in the first half.They were already 3-0 down to a Ford penalty when a charged-down clearance from Louis Rees-Zammit coughed up a useful position and Ford’s precision pass put Arundell over for the game’s first try. It was all a little bit too easy and decidedly ominous.While Wales were gallant and spirited, their captain Dewi Lake was soon being warned that his side were conceding too many penalties. Within moments Nicky Smith was being despatched to the sin bin and, two minutes later, Wales were reduced to 13 players when Lake also saw yellow for illegally killing a maul.Sure enough the floodgates opened. With the patched-up Welsh scrum backpedalling and gaps out wide, Ford dropped a little cross-kick neatly into the arms of Arundell to put England 15-0 up inside the opening quarter. With nine penalties already conceded and 51 tackles already made it already had the makings of a hard day’s night.Then Ben Earl powered through on the left, with Ford’s conversion making it 22-0. It then got steadily worse even after Wales were restored to 15 men. Relatively speaking there was little pressure on Ben Thomas as he headed right and prepared to pass to Rees-Zammit on his outside but the move went catastrophically awry. The ball went to ground a couple of yards behind the flying full-back and instead fell into England’s grasp, with Fraser Dingwall putting Arundell away for his hat-trick score.The wing has had to be patient since bursting on to the scene, having spent a spell in France playing for Racing 92 after the financial collapse of his previous club London Irish. What has never been in doubt, however, is his searing pace and he now has 11 tries to his name in 12 appearances for his country.Given England’s 29-point cushion at the interval, the rest was mostly academic. Tom Roebuck slid over for England’s fifth try and, while Wales did finally break their duck through a converted try by Josh Adams, a comeback was never remotely on the cards. Even after Maro Itoje was shown a yellow card within moments of arriving as a replacement, England were swiftly back on the attack with Henry Pollock close to scoring in the right corner. A penalty try was subsequently awarded for a high tackle by Taine Plumtree and Tommy Freeman powerfully rounded things off in the final minute. For Wales, who now welcome France to Cardiff next Sunday, this tournament is already a case of damage limitation.Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2026England rugby union teamWales rugby union teamRugby unionSix NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

But why compromise? Why choose one over the other?Against SunderlandGyökeres found a third way. He fell overwhilescoring. Maybe you can have it all.It made for a deeply wholesome moment. Gyökeres couldn’t help smiling ruefully behind his peekaboo celebration, even as he was mobbed fondly by his teammates. The goal was also his first touch seven minutes after coming on, a goal to kill a gameArsenalhad eased through in low gear, and which always felt like a matter of housekeeping, a question of exactly how and how many, from the moment they took the lead just before half-time.Gyökeres double keeps Arsenal on title track in stroll past sloppy SunderlandRead moreBy the end this had turned into an excellent afternoon for Gyökeres, not just because he scored twice in a 3-0 win and had his best Arsenal game so far, but because it was also a very Viktor Gyökeres kind of game.He still ran around like a man being chased by a sheepdog and preparing to hurl himself headfirst over a fence. As ever he looked through it all like a mythical Finnish wartime assassin who only eats self-killed venison and pine bark.And yes, he fell over putting the ball in the net. But the goal also came at the end of a really slick, deeply Arsenal kind of move, three parts of the team working in perfect concert.Declan Rice pressed hard in the right-back position. Leandro Trossard was super-smart in his movement, dropping off, anticipating where the ball would end up. Trossard’s instant pass to Kai Havertz was beautifully precise. Havertz looked up and eased the ball into Gyökeres’s stride as his left foot gave way on a mulchy surface and the ball was whumped low into the net.Gyökeres’s second touch shortly afterwards was also significant. It involved bumping Noah Sadiki to the floor just outside the Arsenal penalty area with an expert flex of his rump, then haring off in search of a return pass. Arenal players don’t really do this kind of thing. Gyökeres does this. Poaching and arse-bumps. This is what you sign him for. Maybe Mikel Arteta should have just taken him off at that point, two touches in, a perfect game completed, Total Gyökeres.However, by now Arsenal were running away with a game they had previously been walking away with. And Gyökeres’s second in stoppage time was also a good moment. It came from a breakaway in the dying moments, the second in four days on this ground, a two-man sprint, arms pumping, Chariots of Fire energy, Gabriel Martinelli streaking in on goal, Gyökeres showing decent sustained speed to keep pace, then rolling a perfect little sideways pass into the back of theSunderlandnet.What does it mean? Is Gyökeres the real thing now? Is he that trinket in the window, the £68m goal-machine centre forward? Will he ever be that? He remains unlikely to be mistaken at a casual glance for, say, Thierry Henry. Bundling and poaching remain the game. But in numbers terms things are regularising. He has six goals in his last eight across three competitions. He is now the club’s top scorer in the league with eight. Someone in this team is going to hit double figures, and things will generally make a little more straight-line sense. Gyökeres has 13 for the season overall. Wait. Is this … good?View image in fullscreenViktor Gyökeres scores Arsenal’s third goal.Photograph: Tony O Brien/ReutersAnd yes, you can dig a little. Alternate fact: the only Premier League teams he has scored against are Leeds, Nottingham Forest, Burnley, Everton and Sunderland. What he needs, still, is a big goal against a big team, a moment of real edge. But it feels closer. A few things do.Nine points clear in February, games in hand notwithstanding, is a proper lead. It’s home straight stuff. You really, really should win a league from here. And the signs are good. Rice was excellent here in the two-man pivot, a nice little tweak in response to the problems against Manchester United. This is good management from Arteta, who was present again in faded gardening coat and midwinter grey slacks, a shade of grey so astonishingly, insistently forgettable you have to feel there’s some kind of thought process at work here.Arsenal had four largely attacking players at the start. They had used seven by the end. Their most defensive midfielder scored the opening goal, a wonderful low drive that veered into the corner form outside the line of the posts.And Gyökeres apart, the bedrock was, as ever, the defence. Arsenal had their first choice back four here: Timber-Gabriel-Saliba-Calafiori. It’s an elite lineup. Calafiori, who has been missing in recent times, was stirring in his drives down the left, a romping, galloping cheekbone flexing vision of elite footballerdom, and a proper full-back athlete, all flying hair, muscles, jawline, medieval in his handsomeness.That first-choice back four has conceded one goal in the league at home all season, the Erling Haaland breakaway in September. It has also managed to start only nine games, seven ending in clean sheets. Keep them together from here. Wring more of the same out of the buttock-bouncing goal bludgeon up front. And anything does seem possible.Explore more on these topicsArsenalSunderlandanalysisShareReuse this content"

It was Romero’s second red card in 10 matches following his two yellows in the2-1 defeat at Liverpoolon 20 December and the ban is his fourth this season.Fernandes keeps Carrick’s perfect Manchester United record intact after Romero red cardRead moreRomero’s off-field conduct has also been a source of concern for the Spurs manager. Following last Sunday’s2-2 draw with Manchester City, Romerodescribed the depth of Spurs’ squad as “disgraceful”. The outburst on social media called into question his status as captain after the Argentinian was critical of the club’s ownership following the3-2 defeat at Bournemouthin early January. “They only show up when things are going well, to tell a few lies,” Romero posted on social media, but later deleted the reference to lies.Romero will not be available until 15 March and will miss Spurs’ games against Newcastle, Arsenal, Fulham and Crystal Palace. He was issued a straight red card against United by Michael Oliver on 29 minutes after the referee judged his stamp on Casemiro’s left ankle a dangerous challenge. Romero’s six red cards in all competitions since making his debut for Spurs in August 2021 is the most of anyPremier Leagueplayer in that period.Frank was asked if he will consider removing the captaincy from Romero. “No, I think it is fair to say he doesn’t have any intention to get a red card after 28 minutes,” said the head coach. Frank added: “There is not any regret in making him captain and also he is sorry for the incident. He apologised to his teammates.“He is one of the most important players. We haven’t spoken specifically about this – he apologised: that is enough for me for now. If you look at how many red cards he had, it is not like that he had that many, when you play with passion and aggression.”Michael Carrick was pleased with United’s fourth consecutive Premier League win under him. The run is the club’s first of that length since February 2024 and was secured by Bryan Mbeumo and Bruno Fernandes.The interim manager said: “The connection with everyone has been the most pleasing thing. We all know that what goes on the pitch is really important, but the emotion with players and the staff is good. Seeing the stadium in that way gives me a lot of satisfaction as much as the type of football and tactical and technical side.”Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurThomas FrankManchester UnitedMichael CarrickPremier LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

A soundtrack of boos greeted the final whistle but Newcastle’s manager did not complain.Dango Ouattara tips seesaw contest Brentford’s way to sink NewcastleRead more“I don’t blame the supporters for expressing their feelings but it’s hard to hear,” said Howe, who conducted a lengthy dressing room inquest. “I’ve got no issue with their reaction. We’ve had a run of games where we haven’t played as well as we can and got punished. There’s nothing else to do but accept responsibility for it.“It’s not good enough and it’s been out of character. There were certain moments tonight when we didn’t defend anywhere near well enough, either individually or collectively. We only have ourselves to blame. Accepting that is the only way to improve.”Howe appeared to blame himself as much as his players. “There’s a harsh reality for me,” he said. “I’ve got to think long and hard, not about my effort because I can’t question that about myself, but I think I’ve got to work better, I’ve got to do more.“I’ve always said the pressure I put on myself couldn’t be more extreme because I demand really high standards and I’m obviously not doing my job well enough at the moment. I’m annoyed with myself, angry with myself and blaming myself. I’ve got to take full responsibility for everything you see on the pitch and I’ve got to work out solutions.“Then of course I have to ask the same from the players. I have to ask them to be really honest with themselves and look at their best level, and judge how they’re playing against that now. I don’t think there’s too many that can say they’re playing towards their best. It’s a difficult moment for us.”Howe refused to blame the exhaustion of attempting to compete on four fronts – Newcastle’s Carabao Cup defence ended withsemi final defeat by Manchester Citylast Wednesday and they remain in the Champions League and the FA Cup – for adverse league results.“Yes, some of our players are having to play fatigued and we’ve a lot of injuries,” he said. “But we’ve got to do better. We’ve got to take full accountability. It’s a mentality issue, I don’t think it’s an ability issue. So we have to look at ourselves and show real character and strength.”Howe was particularly concerned that, not for the first time, Newcastle deteriorated after taking an early lead. “We’ve been worse for scoring and I don’t understand it,” he said. “Its a very, very difficult thing to work out because I think it’s all in the brain of maybe two or three players who sway the performance negatively.”He agreed Newcastle’s trademark physical aggression was absent. “Ultimately our preferred way of playing is to go for the throat and try to control the game even sometimes off the ball with relentless pressing, with really good physical performances. But that hasn’t been there regularly enough. It only takes one or two players to be off physically for that to break down. We’re not functioning like we have done historically as a team.”Brentford’s manager, Keith Andrews, was considerably happier after a fourth win in six Premier League games. “I’m pleased, really pleased,” he said. “There’s a feeling around the group that whoever we go up against we can win.”Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedEddie HoweBrentfordnewsShareReuse this content"

There have been only four Premier League seasons in whichManchester Cityand Liverpool have finished in the top two positions in the table (and one of those occasions was 2013-14 when the managers were Manuel Pellegrini and Brendan Rodgers, which is not a duel anybody is writing books or making documentaries about).Yet for most of thedecade that Pep Guardiola has been at City, it has felt that English football was defined by his struggle with Jürgen Klopp and Liverpool, and by a form of the game that developed as each learned from the other.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreKlopp has gone now and nobody would be surprised were Guardiola (and/or Arne Slot) to follow in the summer. The seasons when both clubs would soar past 90 points are past. They are in transition, recrafting their squads for a new age that is yet fully to take shape, and the rivalry is diminished as a result. Liverpool are out of the title race, and defeat at Anfield could in effect take out City as well.The issue with the Guardiola/Klopp revolution was perhaps that it was too successful. Once everybody accepted its principles, and holding them, almost no matter how efficiently you could execute them, was no longer enough. There isn’t a team in thePremier Leaguenow that isn’t at least relatively adept at pressing, often not in the remorseless fashion that became familiar in the days of peak Klopp but in short bursts in specific situations.The idea of using possession to create overloads is broadly accepted by everybody. Once a revolution has become the status quo, though, it is no longer a revolution. What comes next is the question nobody yet seems able to answer. And what’s striking is that, while many Premier League clubs have followed the example of Mikel Arteta, looking to controland set pieces, neither City nor Liverpool have.It’s just over a year since Guardiola gave the interview to TNT in which he said modern football was being played by Bournemouth, Brighton and Newcastle. That understandably drew the headlines, given it seemed in isolation to suggest that Guardiola was saying the game had become increasingly about ball-carrying rather than passing. Perhaps more telling, though, was what he said next.View image in fullscreenPep Guardiola has often had cause to be upset this season, with his team dropping points after being in the lead.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty Images“Today,” he went on, “modern football is not positional, you have to ride the rhythm, it is unbelievable, and we could not, simply we could not because we did not have the players … The teams that are playing once a week, it is another story and that doesn’t count, it counts when you are playing every three or four days.” (The pre-emptive drive-by on this season’s Manchester United was presumably accidental).This was not, in other words, some sort of recantation of faith by Guardiola, nor some sort of admission that his way of doing things was outmoded. Rather it was a practical point, a recognition that the modern calendar is too crowded to play the way he used to, the way he wants to. Guardiola has always existed in a state of perpetual evolution; his greatest strength has been his capacity to tweak, develop and hone his style of play – but his most recent adaptations have been forced on him.There is perhaps no greater example of that than the signing of Erling Haaland, the most traditional of No 9s, whose reluctance to engage with midfield possession felt like a deliberate attempt by Guardiola to introduce a creative friction, to break up the occasionally predictable patterns his football can create. Given that it brought the treble, it can be said to have worked, but the trend of buying against type has continued, although it’s unclear whether that is the work of Guardiola or Hugo Viana, who replaced Txiki Begiristain as sporting director last summer.Gianluigi Donnarumma is a commanding presence and an extremely good shot-stopper, but his relative lack of ability with his feet makes him an uncharacteristic Guardiola keeper.Rayan Cherki is technically giftedbut he plays with a freedom that is antithetical to the Guardiola desire for control. Rayan Aït-Nouri’s forward surges may be exciting but it’s hard to imagine a less typical Guardiola full-back.Familiar tale of two halves haunts Manchester City as Spurs find belated resolve | Jonathan WilsonRead moreThe makeup of the squad implied a move to playing a more traditional style, and that has materialised to an extent. City have, unusually, won four games this season with less than 50% possession; in the draw at Arsenal they had just 33% of the ball. More recently, though, Guardiola’s side have returned to something more familiar: since thechaotic 5-4 win over Fulhamin early December, City haven’t had less than 58% of the ball in any league game.If that was intended to bring control, though, it has failed. City’s attempts to employ an offside trap, redoubled since the arrival of Pep Lijnders as assistant last summer, have amplified the susceptibility to balls played in behind the defensive line. It’s not just high risk, it’s also a style that demands additional physical effort, an issue that seems contrary to Guardiola’s protests about fatigue and perhaps explains why this City team so often fade in the second half of games.View image in fullscreenHugo Ekitike was signed in the summer of 2025 when Liverpool needed midfield or defensive reinforcements more urgently.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAThe overall impression is of confusion, but Liverpool’s attempts to rejig their style have been just as muddled. It’s still not clear what vision underlay last summer’s spree. There seems to have been a general sense that it was better to focus on more technical players – and it probably is easier to bulk them up than to develop fast feet in physical monsters. But, unlessLiverpoolare set on following Leeds and Nigeria by operating regularly with a front pairing, it remains difficult to understand the logic behind signing two centre-forwards when there were such obvious deficiencies in midfield and at the back.And so what was recently the showpiece game of English football – think, perhaps especially, of their four meetings in 2017-18: a 5-0 win for City anda 4-3 win for Liverpool, followed by Liverpool’s 3-0 and 2-1 wins in the Champions League – has taken on a different cast.Two clubs who led the world, not only in terms of results but in how they played, now scratch around in the post-consensus gloom, wondering what the future may be and how they might lead it.Explore more on these topicsManchester CityInside footballLiverpoolPep GuardiolaArne SlotPremier LeaguecommentShareReuse this content"

She’s in form for sure and I’m really happy she was able to win this title at home. It meant a lot to her.“I had a great week myself. I really enjoyed playing here. The crowd really made me feel like I was at home. It was a really special week for me. Today I didn’t feel great, but it’s not going to take away from my week.”There was better news for the British No 4,Katie Boulter, won won her first WTA title since June 2024 at the Ostrava Open. Boulter, the world No 120, lost the first set 7-5 against Germany’s Tamara Korpatsch but battled back in impressive style, taking the second set 6-2 and the decider 6-1 to seal an emphatic victory in the Czech Republic.She will climb to 84 in the world rankings after wrapping up her victory in exactly two hours and adds her latest tournament win to previous successes in Nottingham (twice) and San Diego.“It feels incredible,” said Boulter. “I’ve waited a long time for this one. I’ve worked extremely hard after a really tough year and it feels like I got the reward I deserved after putting so much work in.“I’m absolutely thrilled. I just don’t want to stop working. I’ve got a big year ahead of me. It’s my wedding year and that’s going to be the best year of my life, no matter what happens.”At the Abu Dhabi Open, the Czech qualifier Sara Bejlek sealed a surprise first WTA Tour win by beating Ekaterina Alexandrova 7-6 (5), 6-1 in the final.

The unbeaten five-year-old, Lulamba, is the near-certain favourite for the Arkle Trophy, after maintaining his unbeaten record over fences in the Game Spirit Chase.In Tutti Quanti, who took the feature handicap apart under top weight of 12st, there is the possibility that a genuine contender for championship honours has emerged almost from nowhere.Throughout its long history under a variety of sponsors, the race that is staged as the William Hill Hurdle has always been one of the most fiercely competitive events of its type all season. Rarely, if ever, has it been won as emphatically as it was on Saturday. The front-running Tutti Quanti was clearly going far better than his rivals on the turn for home and he shrugged off both his weight and the strength-sapping ground as he strode further clear all the way to the line.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Sunday tipsShowChelmsford1.37Thanh Nam (nap)2.07Shafdar2.35King David3.07Marinakis3.37My Awele4.07Little Miss Magic (nb)4.37TubaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Tutti Quanti was a remarkable 15 lengths clear of the runner-up, prompting Paul Nicholls, his trainer, to suggest that a supplementary entry for the Champion Hurdle on 10 March could be a consideration.“He’s just one of those big, backward horses who has been physically improving and getting better all the time,” he said. “I still think there is more to come from him. I was a little bit nervous, as the record books tell you off 12st it is hard to win a race like this, but he has annihilated them.“We were thinking of putting him in the County [Handicap] Hurdle [at Cheltenham] and a few of those others but we might just have a rethink if the ground was right for him. We could supplement him for the Champion Hurdle if we wanted to. The great thing about supplementing is you only have to do it five or six days before the race and you will have a great idea about what the ground will be.”View image in fullscreenHaiti Couleurs did more than necessary on demanding ground to win.Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PANeither Haiti Couleurs nor Lulamba could be described as flawless in victory, as the Welsh Grand National winner was a little close to several fences while Lulamba’s inexperience showed mid-race before he picked up the leaders and then powered ahead halfway down the straight. But both did no more than necessary on deep, demanding ground, when it would have been easy to leave their festival chance behind.Native River, in 2018, was the last British-trained winner of the Gold Cup, while Norton’s Coin, who shocked Desert Orchid at 100-1 in 1990, was the last (and only the second) to be trained in Wales. Haiti Couleurs, though, will go to Cheltenham with a decent chance to snap both streaks and add a landmark win for Sean Bowen, his jockey.Bowen is the reigning champion jockey over jumps and is so far clear in this season’s race that if he retired tomorrow, he would still be long odds-on to retain his title when the season ends in April. While he is putting up Tony McCoy-like numbers in terms of winners, however, he has yet to enjoy a victory at the Cheltenham festival.“He was careful at a few early on and warmed up nicely into it,” Bowen said, “and then actually showed a turn of foot when they came to him and I was surprised how well he quickened.“He’s going to be a horse that three-miles-two around Cheltenham and then up the hill will really suit him. Whether he’s good enough after the back of the last we don’t know, but he’ll definitely be there pitching turning in.“You want to be riding in Gold Cups and I have only ridden in one and finished fourth, so to finish a few places higher would be nice.”Lulamba was trimmed to around 11-8 for the Arkle Trophy after extending his unbeaten record over fences to three, while Sam Thomas’s Steel Ally is around 10-1 (from 20-1) for the same race after a comfortable success in the Grade Two Kingmaker Novice Chase at Warwick.Newcastle’s jumps meeting on Sunday has been abandoned meaning the only action in the UK will take place at Chelmsford.Explore more on these topicsHorse racingHorse racing tipsnewsShareReuse this content"

India’s form over the last two years has made them the most feared side in world cricket but for a while as they got their World Cup campaign under way the only dread was being experienced by their own fans as the USA threatened a humiliating upset. But for some missed chances, a hugely unfortunate injury and the brilliance of Suryakumar Yadav it might well have happened.As it was, Suryakumar’s late acceleration took him to 84 off 49 balls and his team to 161 for nine, while the USA reply started with three early wickets – the absence of Jasprit Bumrah, ruled out by illness, doing little to dull India’s cutting edge – and the margin in the end was 29.Harry Brook says fallout from nightclub row has been ‘horrendous’Read moreThe fans who had gathered at the Wankhede Stadium early for the tournament’s opening ceremony – scheduled, somewhat confusingly, before its third game – would certainly have been expecting further fireworks once the India innings got under way. Instead Abhishek Sharma, the world’s top-ranked batter and a player of terrific power, improvisation and as much consistency as openers in this format can muster, steered his first ball to the fielder at deep cover and for a while instead of the predicted procession there was one of another kind entirely, involving India’s superstars regularly trudging back to the dressing room.As the powerplay ended Shadley van Schalkwyk had just taken three wickets in an over, India were 46 for four, and an upset for the ages was brewing. The tournament favourites were plunged into genuine peril despite an error-flecked fielding performance from the Americans, who beyond a handful of outfield fumbles – Van Schalkwyk humiliatingly nutmegged in the deep to turn a sharp two into an untroubled four – dropped Tilak Varma in the fourth over, Ishan Kishan in the fifth and, crucially, Suryakumar in the 10th.Suryakumar had scored 15 off 17, and India were reeling at 63 for four, when he flubbed a return catch to Shubham Ranjane and the bowler put it down. The match might have turned on that moment, or perhaps the one in the 16th over when Ali Khan scurried back from fine leg to chase down Axar Patel’s deliberate nudge. As he stopped the ball his left knee caught in the soft turf; Khan had been earmarked for two of the key death overs but, though he gamely tried, could bowl neither. Without him the India captain clicked into top gear at the very end of the innings to plunder 21 runs off the last.View image in fullscreenUSA’s Ali Khan (second right) takes the acclaim from his teammates after the wicket of India’s Abhishek Sharma.Photograph: Rafiq Maqbool/APThereafter Mohammed Siraj – parachuted straight into the team for his first T20 international since July 2024, having been coopted into the squad as a last-minute replacement for Harshit Rana – and Arshdeep Singh took three wickets in the first four overs. From there, and despite a fine fourth-wicket partnership of 58 runs between Milind Kumar and Sanjay Krishnamurthi, America’s run chase never looked anything but forlorn.Quick GuideShepherd takes hat-trick as West Indies beat ScotlandShowScotland started their unexpected T20 World Cup campaign with a defeat as Romario Shepherd's hat-trick inspired the West Indies to a battling 35-run victory in Kolkata.Thrust into the tournament with just a fortnight's notice after Bangladesh were unceremoniously kicked out over their refusal to play in India, Scotland needed 69 from 42 balls to chase down a 183 target.Richie Berrington and Tom Bruce, who was put down twice, put on 78 together but once they departed, Shepherd dismissed Matthew Cross, Michael Leask and Oliver Davidson from successive deliveries.The seam bowling all-rounder, who castled T20 debutant Davidson before haring off in celebration at his feat, then took his fourth wicket of the over by snaring Safyaan Sharif to finish with five for 20.It was Shepherd's first five-for in any international format and helped the Windies start their Group C campaign with a win, but they were given more of a test than they bargained for from their unfancied opponents.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“When I was sitting on the flight to Mumbai, it felt like a dream,” Siraj said. “I never thought I would play in the World Cup. For the past year, the planning was that all the World Cup players would get a chance in T20s, but when I didn’t play the T20s I understood I wouldn’t be part of it this year. But God changed my destiny.View image in fullscreenPerformers during the opening ceremony at the Wankhede Stadium.Photograph: Alex Davidson/ICC/Getty Images“Suddenly Surya called me. He said: ‘Get ready, pack your bag and come.’ I said: ‘Surya, don’t joke, because this is not going to happen.’ He said: ‘I’m telling you the truth – get ready.’ I came, played the match – everything was written.“Hats off to Surya for that innings. Even after losing so many wickets early, he stayed calm. I was sitting in the dressing room watching such fearless cricket. Even after losing six wickets, there was no panic. It was very calm. Everyone felt we would definitely win this match – and we did.”Explore more on these topicsT20 World Cup 2026India cricket teamUSA cricket teamT20 World CupTwenty20US sportsCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

What a surpriseArwa MahdawiThe Obama video should take a toll on the president’s political career – but of course it won’tSat 7 Feb 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 7 Feb 2026 09.02 ESTShareExtra, extra, Trumpdoes racist thing againDespite Donald Trump’s war on woke, he hasn’t (yet) made Black History Month illegal. In fact, on Tuesday the president issued a proclamation declaring February 2026 to be a celebration of Black historyand called“upon public officials, educators, librarians, and all the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities”.Clearly he didn’t get his own memo because, two days later, during one of hisfreneticlate-night Truth Social ranting sessions, the president posted aracistvideo that depictedBarack and Michelle Obamaas apes. The minute-long video, made by a third party, amplified false claims that Trump won the 2020 election and showed the first Black president and first lady superimposed on the bodies of primates in a jungle setting, bobbing their heads to the song The Lion Sleeps Tonight.It would be wrong to call this a mask-off moment because there is no mask with Trump. He has called Somali immigrants “garbage”, talked about “shithole countries”, and described Covid-19 as the “kung flu”. He launched his2016 presidential campaignby calling Mexican immigrants drug dealers, criminals and rapists. He repeatedlyquestionedObama’s birth certificate. He initiated aso-called Muslim banand used the word “Palestinian”as a slur. And Palestinians mean so little to him that a plan to build megacities in the ruins of Gazacirculated in the White House.While Trump’s latest exhibition of racism was hardly surprising, it was still shocking. Indeed, the image was so blatantly racist that even some of Trump’s allies were disgusted. Senator Tim Scott, for example, who was on Trump’s shortlist to be VP in 2024 and is the only Black Republican senator, wrote that the video was the “most racist thing” he has seen from the Trump White House. You should probably pay a little bit more attention then, Tim! There’s plenty of competition for that accolade.A fewother Republicans, including Representative Mike Lawler, Republican of New York, also denounced the post. And a number of Democrats spoke out, with House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, the first Black leader of a party in Congress,calling Trump“a vile, unhinged and malignant bottom feeder”.The White House, meanwhile, responded with their go-to strategy of aggressive gaslighting. “This is from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from the Lion King,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Friday. “Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public.”Shortly after that statement, however, the story coming out of the administration changed. The video was taken down and itwas reportedthat a White House staffer “erroneously made the post”.By rights, the Trump administration deleting the post wouldn’t be the end of this story. By rights, the outrage over this would mount and Trump would face serious consequences for his actions. I’m sure I don’t need to tell you this, but for the benefit of press secretary Leavitt, I’m going to spell it out: Trump’s stupid memes and social media posts matter. They matter because the president helps set the parameters of acceptable discourse. They matter because his bigotry emboldens others. Most of all, they matter because they reflect his policies.But while Trump’s racist video should impact his presidency, it won’t, will it? This is, after all, a convicted felon and adjudicatedsexual predatorwe are talking about. A man who appears to be successfully shrugging off his connections with Jeffrey Epstein, a child rapist. Give it a few days and nobody will remember this story. It will have been eclipsed by another scandal and then another scandal and then another scandal. And, if we’re not careful, we will grow ever more desensitized to these scandals.It’s not just democracy that is dying in the US right now; it is common decency. Every day when I look at the news I wonder what on earth I am supposed to tell my four-year-old about how to succeed in a world where kindness and compassion seem to be hindrances to getting ahead. A world where it is the scum that rises to the top. The idea that we live in a meritocracy (a word coined by a man who used itsatirically) has long beendemonstrablyfalse. Now, however, we seem to live in a malice-ocracy: the nastier, the crueler, the more self-serving you are, the better your chances of success.It has not been a good week for the Norwegian royal family …The son of Norway’s crown princess, Marius Borg Høiby, iscurrently on trialaccused of 38 crimes (which he denies), including four counts of rape, domestic abuse and illegal filming.

Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was tolerated as a “special representative for trade and investment” in the noughties despite allegations thathe kept convicted gun smugglers for friends, while Peter Mandelson’s ability to schmooze the rich and famous repeatedly overruled concerns about his probity.To close a deal, there are always compromises to be made, and sometimes the terms are unsavoury.Britain is at the forefront of international deal making. It has been a trading nation for as long as it has existed. And even before that.Recent studieshave shown the Cornish were trading tin and copper long before even the Romans arrived in the UK.The question is, as trade routes become dominated by new powers, such as China and India, does the UK pursue its interests in the same old ways or attempt to clean up its act.Keir Starmer told us what he thought last year when he appointed Mandelson to be US ambassador, and in so doing, became yet another prime minister to put the art of the deal before more ethical concerns.When Liz Truss appointed Ian Botham as a trade envoy to Australia, the former cricketer’s qualifications for the job were not immediately obvious.Last week,a group of MPs saidthe prime minister had spurned an opportunity to show he wanted to promote more sophisticated, secure and transparent trading relationships when he refused to appoint a “cross-government minister for economic security”.View image in fullscreenLiam Byrne, the business and trade committee chair and former Treasury minister, said deals were being done that needed more scrutiny, especially when Chinese companies are involved.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The ObserverLiam Byrne, the business and trade committee chair and former Treasury minister, said deals were being done that needed more scrutiny, especially when Chinese companies are involved, to prevent them becoming national security issues later on.Byrnewants the governmentto be more mindful of the intrusion, coercion and spying that can accompany deals with big businesses in other countries.Byrne mentions China consistently in his warnings about trade deals and there are clear reasons to be concerned: China’s ruling Communist party is calculating and amoral in its dealings with the outside world.There are also the governments and powerful elites that have become corrupted by the discovery of natural mineral wealth before they adopted democratic institutions, or were handed them by former colonial rulers.The financial waters have become even murkier in the last 30 years after an explosion in the money generated by the drug trade, which needs legitimate agencies to clean up the dirty cash.This is where corruption arrives on the doorstep of every country, regardless of their democratic history.Robin Cook wanted to establish Britain as an ethical trading nation when he became foreign secretary in the first Blair government. It was 1997 and China was emerging as big exporter.He gave a speechjust 10 days after the election, in which he said: “The Labour government does not accept that political values can be left behind when we check in our passports to travel on diplomatic business. Our foreign policy must have an ethical dimension.”In the 1980s,the £40bn al-Yamamah deal, initially for the supply of 120 Tornado aircraft and other military equipment, was agreed by the government of Margaret Thatcher and the son of the Saudi defence minister, Prince Bandar bin Sultan Al Saud.Thirty years latera report on the dealemerged to show how civil servants appeared to have lied about illicit commissions being paid to lubricate the deal.Cook lasted almost four years in the job, but his ethical foreign policy proved to be temporary. Those who see al-Yamamah as expedient won.Cook was described as naive when he embarked on his mission and it was probably a fair criticism. Byrne’s mission is more focused and hard headed.Yet it still prompts the question. Can Britain navigate relationships with the likes of India, China, South Africa and Brazil in a way that avoids backroom deals.The Liberal Democrats would say the answer is to get back inside the EU. That might happen 20 years from now, but the obstacles are many.Access to the single market and the customs union are strict. Switzerland and Norway have discovered this, and both have accepted being rule takers to gain access.Last month, trade minister Chris Bryantannouncednew trade envoys for France, Germany and Italy in an effort to build bridges beyond Brussels. It was Bryant who, in 2011, criticised “AirMiles Andy” for being a close friend of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi’s son Saif and the convicted Libyan gun smuggler Tarek Kaituni.The trade minister’s plan to use some of the smartest Labour MPs outside government to link up with officials on the continent might help secure trade access at the margins. But Byrne is right that the more pressing issuing is how to protect ourselves from the temptation of cheap stuff, especially from China. And the kind of major deals – in defence, in the NHS and infrastructure – that store up problems for the future.Beijing’s seduction of the UK, now that it lies outside any major trading bloc, is just beginning. Beijing wants to tempt us with cheap electric cars, cheap telecoms equipment and cheap artificial intelligence now the EU and the US have placed stricter limits on trade.In response, the UK needs a more systematic way of deciding what to buy. No more secret deals. No more laissez-faire.Explore more on these topicsTrade policyViewpoint columnInternational tradeEthical foreign policyGlobal economyEconomicsEconomic policyEthical businesscommentShareReuse this content"

It’s his global political revolutionMark LeonardI am convinced that Europe’s ‘new right’ is a radically contemporary movement. Defeating it means understanding its critique of liberalismSat 7 Feb 2026 02.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 7 Feb 2026 10.15 ESTShareEuropean governments are terrified of Donald Trump’s threats on trade, Greenland and the future of Nato. But the biggest threat is not that Trump invades an ally or leaves Europe at the mercy of Russia. It is that his ideological movement could transform Europe from the inside.A year after Trump’s return to the White House, his “second American revolution” is radiating outward into Europe. The Epstein files reveal how this beganclumsily in 2018 with Steve Bannon; but it has become a much more sophisticated partnership with the second coming of Trump and the rise to power of JD Vance. The USNational Security Strategypublished by the White Housein Novembercalled for strengthening the growing influence of “patriotic” European parties such as Reform UK, Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), Marine Le Pen’sRassemblement National(RN),Fidesz in HungaryandVox in Spain. As with the communist movements of the cold war, these nationalist, populist and in some cases far-right parties are best understood not as isolated national phenomena but as expressions of a shared intellectual project – a movement that is, to varying degrees, now being reinforced by a foreign power.The movement is often portrayed as backward-looking or reactionary, intent on restoring an imagined past. In reality, its strength lies in being radically contemporary – finely tuned to the political, social and intellectual conditions of the 21st century. I have spent the past 18 months trying to understand this movement, talking to everyone from bespectacled Hungarian intellectuals to freshly shaven young RN politicians in France, from Orthodox Jewish political philosophers to Maga diehards in the US. Based on this research, I am convinced that far from being lodged in the past, it is hyper-modern and its standard-bearers have a compelling analysis of the failings of liberal democracy and a pathway to power. Hence the designation “new right”.Central to the movement’s self-understanding is the claim that liberalism has failed, along with the deeply interdependent globalised order it promoted after the cold war. In its telling, citizens have seen their national cultures and economies battered by an unbroken sequence of shocks that come from liberalisation: the global financial crash of 2008, the eurozone crisis two years later, therefugee crisis of 2015, the Covid pandemic in 2020, and the sharp rise in living costs followingRussia’s invasion of Ukrainein 2022. Each crisis, it argues, has exposed the limits of liberal governance, overwhelmed state capacity and fuelled suspicion about whose interests governments were really serving. Governments rescued the banks, they point out, but cut welfare payments and let people’s homes be repossessed. Ordinary people paid the cumulative price of these crises – through lost jobs, strained services or rising bills – while elites were shielded from the consequences.One of the most articulate exponents of this view is Benedikt Kaiser, accused of once moving inneo-Nazi circles,who has embraced electoral politics and is becoming one of the leading voices in the AfD’s intellectual ecosystem. Kaiser told me it was the convergence of these crises that had sapped the legitimacy of the postwar liberal order and mainstream parties, providing the essential opening for political insurgents to capture the political agenda.Off the back of these crises, the movement set out to construct a new electoral coalition, appealing above all to working-class voters who felt they had lost out, experiencing a relative decline in income, security and social standing. This appeal has been distilled into a clear policy agenda spanning immigration, trade, foreign policy and state reform, all bound together by a promise to restore a shared national identity. Borders became a tool for distinguishing the “real” members of the nation from outsiders. Tariffs were recast as a way to rebuild domestic production and elevate the dignity of work. Foreign policy was stripped down to a narrowly defined national interest. And institutional resistance was overcome by attacking the “deep state” and discrediting experts as guardians of a discredited liberal order.The political centre must reinvent itself as the real defenders of national sovereigntyThe success of the new right also rests on its mastery of a fractured media environment – and its use of the algorithmic information space. As the public sphere splintered into online subcultures, it learned to bypass traditional journalism and dominate digital platforms. By advancing a permissive interpretation of “free speech”, it forged alliances with technology magnates such as Elon Musk and saturated the online space with its narratives and slogans. Often armed with “alternative facts” and edgy memes, the new right now dominates the attention economy. I interviewed the US conservative writer Rod Dreher, who cited the case ofIsabel Vaughan-Spruce, a Christian activist who was arrested twice in Birmingham for praying outside an abortion clinic, to illustrate how the mainstream and digital right now inhabit entirely different realities. Although Vaughan-Spruce has become a cult figure in the new-right information sphere, most of the Guardian’s readers will not have heard of her.Perhaps their most effective manoeuvre has been to force mainstream parties into an unwinnable position – casting them as defenders of elites rather than workers, of continuity rather than change. For too long, established parties downplayed the scale of the threat. When they did respond, they often resorted to mimicking the new right’s divisive rhetoric, particularly on migration. Yet imitation has often had the inverse effect of strengthening the challengers instead of neutralising them.Any effective response, then, must begin by acknowledging the force of the new right’s critique of liberalism. This must be paired with a political project that speaks to working-class concerns and uses new methods of engagement, an approach that has worked successfully in Denmark and the Netherlands, as well as in Kentucky and New York.Maybe the clearest lesson comes from figures such as Mark Carney and Anthony Albanese, who have realised that their countries’ populists’ association with Trump’s revolution could be a liability for them.Polling conductedby the European Council on Foreign Relations suggests that Trumpism could follow a similar trajectory: in country after country, clear majorities now see Trump’s re-election as harmful. If centrist forces wake up to the international threat posed by the second American revolution and rally around a strategy that turns the new right’s strengths into vulnerabilities, there is still a chance that the political centre can reinvent itself as the real defenders of national sovereignty and use the links between new right parties and Trump to defeat them.Mark Leonard is the author of the reportThe new right: anatomy of a global political revolution.

But another option is staring us in the faceDave SchillingI understand the appeal of avoiding all human contact. Still, good old-fashioned taxis have so much to offerSat 7 Feb 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 7 Feb 2026 15.53 ESTShareIt’s Super Bowl weekend here in America, which means a few things: copious amounts of gut-busting food, controversial half-time show performances, extravagant commercials, and occasionally a bit of football.For the tens of thousands rich enough to afford tickets to the Big Game, transportation to and from Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California, will be paramount. Thankfully, our robotic saviors are here to rescue the throng from the indignity of sharing a ride with an actual human being. This year’s Super Bowl isa test of the driverless taxi industry, currently lorded over by Waymo – a company that’s about to get a$16bn cash injectionto further expand its business to cities all around the world. Smaller American metro areas likeSacramentoandNashvilleare next up to get Waymo service, as are global capitals like London and Tokyo. Fleets of robotaxis are seeming more and more inevitable, yet another soldier in the onslaught of shiny gadgets designed to sand off the sharp edges of modern life.I, for one, welcome our new robot overlords.Self-driving taxis are coming to London – should we be worried? | Jack StilgoeRead moreWith some reservations. When I first tried Waymo after it landed here in Los Angeles, I was prepared to loathe the entire experience. Yet more low-wage workers out of a job thanks to ruthless automation. Efficiency over humanity. Plus, the cars looked stupid. Clunky modified Jaguars with a bunch of bulbous sensors all over the thing. Waymo cars resemble an expensive PC gaming mouse on wheels. Some of them even come splattered withgarish, multicolored graphic artdesigned to make the cars seem more friendly and less like atraveling recession indicator. And yet, I found myself eerily at peace inside the cold, sterile environs of the car. There was no driver, which meant no mystery smells, haggling over the radio, or idle chit-chat.Now, I recognize that interacting with strangers is part of life, especially life in a major city. Adults should be capable of making small talk if necessary. Politeness is something I personally appreciate. But there are limits for even the most well-mannered souls. Most Uber and Lyft drivers are normal, kind and appreciative of the customers making use of their service. Then, there’s the occasional driver who asks too many personal questions, makes lewd jokes, or worse, thinks they might be the Second Coming.After a night out, years ago, my then girlfriend and I were returning home via rideshare. Our driver, who conspicuously ignored the digital driving directions on his phone, managed to turn our 10-minute trip into an extended 20-minute monologue about the nature of existence. At one point, his unprompted Ted Talk landed on the question of whether or not he could be Jesus Christ reborn. I suppose driving a rideshare cab could be considered the modern equivalent of being a carpenter, but I didn’t share that thought in the moment.Waymo’s AI system doesn’t believe itself to be God. At least not yet. That’s one in the plus column.Waymohas not laid out its plan for world domination, and it also allows me to link my Spotify account to the car’s audio. That’s probably another sophisticated data mining operation, feeding their database with every song I’ve ever listened to so it might serve my phone targeted ads for Sabrina Carpenter tickets while I’m on the toilet. But at least I can listen to Espresso as many times as I want in a row without being judged.I’ve now used Waymo multiple times, and I’ve felt slightly less guilty every time. That gives me pause, as I still read stories about Waymosdecimating the taxi industry,hitting peopleorslamming into parked cars.Cabs operated by living drivershit people, too, I say to myself. Every Waymo I’ve ever been in has been more cautious than just about every human cab driver I’ve ever been driven by. Traditional rideshare apps also have a serious issue with sexual assaults perpetrated by their contractors, with Uber recentlyordered by a jury to pay $8.5mto a woman who said she was attacked by a driver. Driverless robotaxis would prevent such horrible incidents from occurring.Still, there are other solutions to this problem that don’t kill jobs – specifically one staring us all right in the face.Just start using taxis again.I’m sure that sounds archaic.A taxi? Like those clunky yellow Priuses that run red lights and have interiors covered in rubber like a sanitarium?Yes, a taxi. Regular taxicabs can be hired via apps just like Uber and Lyft. They are heavily regulated by municipal oversight. Their drivers have a union that ensures fair treatment and equitable wages. Because this is their actual profession rather than a side-hustle mandated by the collapse of the American middle class, they perform their duties with a dash more stoic responsibility and are far less prone to describe their potential for being the Messiah.In the last 20 years, tech barons (and craven politicians) have repeatedly told us that regulations are bad for us, that it slows down innovation and robs the world of the shiny utopia that digital products offer. The reality is, regulations are not bad for us. They’re bad forthem– the billionaires that dream of being trillionaires. Regulations force them to temper their ambitions, to think rationally, and to consider the greater good of society rather than their ever-expanding bank accounts.It all can start to feel rather nihilistic. Last year, the CEO of Waymo told a live audience that societywill accept a hypothetical driverless car deathand it wouldn’t affect their business growth. Other tech CEOs rhapsodize about the possibilities of artificial intelligence todecimate entire industrieswith messianic glee that weirdly reminds me of the spiraling rideshare driver that ruminated on his own divinity. I think I might enjoy riding in Waymos precisely because I’m eager to spend time sealed away from the mass delusion event that is life in 2026. I’m like the protagonist of theGary Numan song, hopelessly addicted to the solitude of the automobile and incapable of interacting with the outside world. Unfortunately for the driver with the Jesus complex, he can’t afford to make his megalomaniacal dreams come true. But for those that can, it’s full steam ahead.Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsWaymoOpinionSelf-driving carsSan FranciscoLos AngelescommentShareReuse this content"

He is wrong. It would actually result in a two-tier system, leaving a minority of vulnerable homes with an inferior free TV service: fewer channels, fewer programmes and basic functionality.By contrast, TV delivered online can offer a more consumer-friendly and accessible future, giving vulnerable audiences a familiar TV experience totally transformed by features only the internet can deliver, like voice control. TV delivered online is not the same as Freeview – it is better.While access and affordability of broadband needs to be solved, access to reliable broadband will be higher than the coverage of Freeview by 2032. Around95% of homes already pay for the internet, and most of the remainderalready pay for a landlinethat will soon be converted to an internet-delivered line – at no extra cost to them – ready for TV.We absolutely agree that no one should be left behind in terms of connectivity, usability and affordability, and there will be a minority who need support. And of course, any future transition in TV needs to be seen as part of a much wider plan for the UK to embrace the potential for a fully inclusive digital society, along with the wider societal and economic benefits it can deliver.Extending terrestrial TV into the 2040s does little for viewers, but much for the company providing the infrastructure it relies on. Yes, we should have a proper policy debate about Freeview’s future, but let’s base it on facts, not vested interests.Jonathan ThompsonCEO, Everyone TV – the organisation that runs free TV in the UK on behalf of public service broadcastersRe Christy Swords’ letter, we must look at the future of public service broadcasting not as a risk, but as a huge opportunity. Switching our public TV to be delivered over the internet does not have to exclude people. Instead, with proper planning and funding, this major change could be the driving force we need to finally close the digital divide across the UK.Newresearch showsthat older viewers are enthusiastic about internet-delivered TV, with 93% finding its features useful, rising to 99% among those aged 70-plus, and that voice control has improved accessibility for older or disabled audiences.Currently, there are 8 million people who lack the basic confidence and skills to be literate in using the internet and also over 1 million households who cannot afford a broadband service.However, with public service broadcasters suggesting a switchover could happen in 2034, there is time to remedy these figures. It’s also not just television that people need the internet for –research showsthat 31% of adults don’t engage with health services online, and a third of adults find it difficult to engage with government services online.Imagine a society where a strategically planned approach to digitally including a nation was enacted. We could start with a focus on a switch to internet-delivered TV in the 2030s. This requires strong leadership from the government. Broadcasters must play their part in raising awareness, just as they did for the digital switchover from 2008 to 2012. Businesses are already investing, and more companies can come on board and thousands of community organisations who are ready and willing to help.Let’s not be afraid of the future. Let’s not be naive and leave this to chance. Let’s plan strategically to give everyone the opportunity to benefit from a modern, digitally included society.Helen MilnerChief executive, Good Things FoundationWhile it is instructive to read the piece by Mark Sweney on the future of TV (As most TV viewers tune in via broadband, will 2034 signal the death of Freeview?, 29 January)and the Guardian is to be commended for giving this crucial subject extensive coverage, I fear there are two important issues that have failed to be properly addressed. Taken together, they suggest that we should not be rushing toward a premature closure of a TV service that millions of viewers continue to use and value.The first is around what might happen to TV usage if the market is left to its own devices (ie if there is no planned switch-off of Freeview in 2034). Far from there being consensus on this point, there continues to be a healthy debate. In my recent work in this area, I project that more than 5m households will still be using digital terrestrial TV (DTT), branded as Freeview, as the primary means of watching linear (live) TV on main television sets in 2034.The mistake made by some analysts is to equate technical availability of a broadband service capable of delivering TV with actual consumer behaviours and preferences. Moreover, the Freeview cohort is likely to be older and poorer than the national average, raising a number of concerns around fairness and equity.The second issue is the lazy assumption in some quarters that a switch to internet protocol television (IPTV) from DTT is broadly the same as the programme in the 2000s to move from analogue to digital television. The two are not the same. When we swapped out analogue for digital there were some one-off costs, but no ongoing commitments. Freeview was what it said on the tin: free. To get reliable IPTV, you need a fast broadband connection and will have to pay for this year in, year out. Nor can it be assumed that viewers in a hybrid household already watching some streaming will be able, or want, to switch to watching all of their TV around the house in that way.No one is arguing that live, linear TV is not declining (it is), that the transition to IPTV shouldn’t happen at some point (it probably should), or that a move to an all-IP future does not unlock real value for the UK (it probably does, although mobile alongside fixed-line IP plays a role here). It is primarily a question of when, how, and who should pay for the transition. A later switch-off brings real benefits and minimises the disbenefits.

I am a man in a hurry for justice,” he added.The second people’s inquiry symposium, held in north London on Saturday, brought together survivors, campaigners and advocates intent on establishing pathways to justice with victims’ voices at the forefront, while continuing to press the government to launch astatutory public inquiryinto the scandal.‘I’m part of this country’: Windrush man left homeless by Home Office inactionRead moreTheWindrush scandalwas brought to public attention through investigative reporting by the Guardian in 2017, which revealed thousands of legal UK residents to be mistakenly labelled as immigration offenders. Government schemes providing immigration status and compensation to those affected have since granted 17,000 people documentation and 2,600 of 8,800 claims have received compensation payments as of July 2024.Six months into Foster’s appointment, the Labour party, which has pledged to improve the government’s response, has adopted many of his recommendations for reforming the Windrush compensation scheme. But, years into the scandal, many are still struggling to navigate the process described as inefficient, bureaucratic and retraumatising.Among those still affected is Deborah, who has been supporting her brother in Barbados for decades since he has been unable to return to the UK after arriving as a Commonwealth citizen in 1966. “He didn’t leave with the intention of not coming back,” said Deborah, who asked to withhold her surname.Last year she was instructed by theHome Officeto apply for the Windrush scheme, unknown to the family as her mother did not arrive on the Windrush boat, which carried thousands from the Caribbean to the UK in 1948 and has become shorthand for the scandal. Deborah said the claim was rejected, she not having known the extent of evidence needed. In recent months, she travelled Barbados to gather documents in support of her brother’s case.“There’s so much negligence,” said Deborah. “There’s got to be a public inquiry and the voices of the victims heard and listened to and tangible things, not just apologies.”While some expressed concern on Saturday overa shift in Labour’s immigration policythey fear will create the “next generation of Windrush”, others such as the campaigner Garrick Prayogg said the only solution is legislative change.“If we don’t get legislation before the next general election in place, what will happen if Reform come in?” said Prayogg, calling for changes to the existing hostile environment policy that led to the scandal.WhilePatrick Vernon, who led a parliamentary petition related to the scandal in 2018, doesn’t see the current Labour government moving toward easing existing immigration policy, he said there are other changes as well as legislation, including a public inquiry and moving the compensation scheme from the Home Office.“Why is it black people are given less money, no legal aid, less support?” said Vernon, who cited the Post Office and infected blood scandals. “Why are we being treated differently?”He added: “You get a better service with Ryanair than the Home Office.”Explore more on these topicsWindrush scandalHome OfficeRaceCommonwealth immigrationImmigration and asylumnewsShareReuse this content"

Both made refuelling stops at Shannon airport in the west of Ireland.Dezer’s family property company has built a series of Trump-branded residential towers in Miami. He recently spoke of his “love” for the US president, with whom he claims to have had a 20-year friendship.Some of those onboard the flights on Dezer’s jet said they had their wrists and ankles shackled for the duration of the journey. After arriving in Tel Aviv, they appear to have been taken to the Israeli-occupiedWest Bank.The Irish government said in a statement that as the flights stopped in the country for “non-traffic purposes” and were “not picking up or setting down passengers” they did not require prior approval from its transport department.However, on Friday, opposition politicians expressed concern to theIrish Timesabout the practice.Duncan Smith, foreign affairs spokesperson for the Labour party in Ireland, said: “It is absolutely reprehensible that any ICE deportation flights would be allowed stop and refuel in Shannon. The taoiseach and minister for transport must intervene and ensure this ends.” He added: “Ireland cannot in any way be complicit in these ICE flights.”Roderic O’Gorman, leader of the country’s Green party, said that it was “deeply disturbing” to learn “that Shannon is being used to facilitate the cruel actions of Donald Trump’s ICE”.Patricia Stephenson, foreign affairs spokesperson for the Social Democrats, said the government “must make a statement on whether it knowingly facilitated these flights”. She told the Irish Times that she believed the human rights of those onboard had been violated.Dezer’s aircraft was chartered via Journey Aviation, a company based in Florida that is regularly used by the US authorities to source private jets. It declined to comment on the flights to Israel.According to Human Rights First (HRF), which tracks deportation flights, Dezer’s jet – which he has described as his “favourite toy” – was first chartered for removal flights last October. The organisation said the plane had been used to fly detainees to Kenya, Liberia, Guinea and Eswatini, before its recent trips to Israel.One of those onboard the first flight was Maher Awad, 24. Originally from the West Bank, he has lived in the US for almost a decade. He has a partner and baby in Michigan.“They dropped us off like animals on the side of the road,” Awad said. “We went to a local house, we knocked on the door, we were like: ‘Please help us out’.”In an email, Dezer told the Guardian he was “never privy to the names” of those who travelled onboard his jet when it was privately chartered by Journey, or the purpose of the flight. “The only thing I’m notified about is the dates of use,” he said. He did not respond to further questions about the use of his jet by the Trump administration to deport Palestinians through Israel.Aviation industry sources have estimated the flights would have cost ICE between $400,000 and $500,000.A spokesperson for the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not answer questions about the deportation flights to Israel, but said: “If a judge finds an illegal alien has no right to be in this country, we are going to remove them.

The vehicle was transporting displaced people who fled fighting in the Dubeiker area, the group said in a statement. Among the dead children were two infants.Several others were wounded and taken for treatment in Er Rahad, which suffers from severe medical supplies shortages, like many areas in the Kordofan region, the statement said.The doctors’ group urged the international community and rights organisations to “take immediate action to protect civilians and hold the RSF leadership directly accountable for these violations”.There was no immediate comment from the RSF, which has been at war against the Sudanese military for control of the country for about three years.Sudan was plunged into chaos in April 2023 when a power struggle between the military and the RSF exploded into open fighting in the capital, Khartoum, and elsewhere in the country, leaving tens of thousands dead and millions displaced.A drone attack on Friday on a World Food Programme (WFP) aid convoy in North Kordofan province killed one and wounded several others, said Denise Brown, the UN humanitarian coordinator in Sudan.Brown said the convoy was heading to deliver “life-saving food assistance” to displaced people in the city of El Obeid in North Kordofan when it was struck. The attack burned the trucks and destroyed the aid, she said.“Attacks on aid operations undermine efforts to reach people facing hunger and displacement,” she said in a statement.Last week, a drone strike hit close to a WFP facility in the Blue Nile province, wounding a WFP worker, Brown said.Emergency Lawyers, an independent group documenting atrocities in Sudan, blamed the RSF for the attack, while the Sudan Doctors Network called it a “flagrant violation of international humanitarian law [which] amounts to a full-fledged war crime”.Massad Boulos, a US adviser for African and Arab affairs, condemned the attack on X and called for holding those responsible accountable.“Destroying food intended for people in need and killing humanitarian workers is sickening,” he said. “The Trump administration has zero tolerance for this destruction of life and of US-funded assistance; we demand accountability.”The British minister for international development and Africa, Jenny Chapman, called the attack on the WFP convoy “disgraceful”.“Civilians are starving,” she wrote on Saturday on X. “Aid workers and humanitarian operations bringing vital food should never be targeted.”In a strongly worded statement on Saturday, Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry criticised the RSF for its recent drone strikes, including on the vehicle of displaced families, the WFP convoy and on a hospital in Kordofan that killed 22 people.The Saudi statement called for the RSF to stop its attacks on civilians and aid convoys, and called out foreign parties that continue to “deliver illegal arms, mercenaries and foreign fighters” – an apparent reference to the United Arab Emirates, which has been accused by rights groups and UN experts of arming the paramilitary group. The UAE has denied the accusations.In recent months, Kordofan has become a flashpoint in the war and the army managed to break the RSF siege of two major cities in the region earlier this year.The devastating war has so far killed more than 40,000 people, according to UN figures, but aid groups say that is an undercount and the true number could be many times higher.It created the world’s largest humanitarian crisis with more than 14 million people forced to flee their homes. It has fuelled disease outbreaks and pushed parts of the country into a famine that still spreads as the war shows no sign of abating.In a report released on Thursday, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) said famine was found in two more areas in the western region of Darfur where famine was confirmed for the first timein a displacement camp in August 2024.The report warned that acute malnutrition is expected to worsen in 2026, with a 13.5% increase in cases of acute malnutrition in children under five and pregnant and breastfeeding women – from 3.7 million children and women in 2025 to nearly 4.2 million in 2026.Severe acute malnutrition, the most dangerous and deadly form of malnutrition, is expected to increase to 800,000 cases, up 4% from 2025, it said.Mohamed Abdiladif, the country director for Save the Children in Sudan, said children were already dying from hunger-related causes in many parts of Sudan.“Every day we hear devastating stories of parents selling the last of what they own simply to keep their children alive from one day to the next,” he said.Explore more on these topicsSudanAfricaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Yet now withintense competition, rising costs, anddelays to government funding, some charger companies are running short of cash and investors are looking for a return on their investments, according to several people in the industry.Simon Smith, the chief executive of Voltempo, which focuses on charge points for lorries, said: “Charging is getting more capital intensive and more competitive at the same time. That means two things decide who survives: the right sites and fast utilisation. If volumes do not ramp [up], payback stretches, assets get stranded and consolidation follows. That is just infrastructure market logic.”The number of chargers installed in the UK hassoared in recent yearsas companies raced to win market share. There were nearly 88,000 charge points across 45,000 UK locations at the end of 2025, according to the data company Zapmap.Many charge point operators are making money, but others have installed points in anticipation of future demand, meaning they do not yet earn enough to cover costs, even if they are likely to as thenumber of electric cars on British roads rises rapidly.Ghafoor said “numerous” unnamed businesses have approached Be.EV looking for a buyer. “Companies are running out of money,” he said. “This is a very crowded space. We’ve got too many operators. All of these businesses are going to come together … That consolidation will allow investment and that scale.”Businesses could be keen to complete takeovers in an attempt to gain economies of scale including the same number of back office staff overseeing more charge points, the ability to negotiate bigger, cheaper nationwide contracts, and buying power in bulk.The oil company Shell owns the biggest UK network, followed by the government-backed Connected Kerb and the EDF-owned Pod Point. However, there are a host of other competitors, ranging from Sainsbury’s supermarkets, fossil fuel companies such as BP and Total, the Scottish car retailer Arnold Clark, and the carmakers BMW, Ford, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen, which back the Ionity network.“If you look at any of these markets, typically what you see is everyone wakes up and says, ‘I’ll have a go’,” said Ghafoor. “EV charging has been the widest ‘I’ll have a go’ sector I’ve been involved in.”The competition has forced smaller players to look for niches where they can find profits. Be.EV, with 2,500 chargers, is focusing on ultra-rapid charging at busy destinations such as retail parks and coffee shops. The company, which is backed with £110m from Octopus Energy, is also pursuing its own acquisitions of smaller players. Voltempo installscharge points at lorry depots, whose owners have a predictable source of demand and the ability to hire out their chargers toother users such as van fleets.The timing of the pandemic-era investment surge may also be adding to pressure on charge point operators. Some private equity (PE) and venture capital investors aim to make investments over five-year periods before they need to show their own backers a financial return. Ghafoor said “the PE cycle – flip within five years – that probably creates more pressure” on charging companies if they are struggling to make the business profitable.Explore more on these topicsElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsMotoringAutomotive industrynewsShareReuse this content"

The 4.5in-tall work depicts a lion at rest – in three-quarter view – while wearing a leash around its neck, “suggesting it was drawn from life”, the auction house said in a statement.“Every stroke renders the lion in exquisite detail, capturing its form but also its vitality, poise and power,” Sotheby’s statement added.Being able to see a live lion would have been rare in Europe at the time, and Sotheby’s speculated Rembrandt may have had the opportunity to do so at a fair.He is known to have drawn only six lions. Beside that which was auctioned off by Kaplan and Ayers, two are at London’s British Museum and the other four are at Paris’s Louvre, Amsterdam’s Rijksmuseum and Rotterdam’s Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen.Kaplan co-founded Panthera with wildlife biologist Alan Rabinowitz, and Ayers is the chair of the organization. Panthera is generally dedicated to ensuring the future of the 40 species of wild cats as well as protecting the landscapes on which they depend.Among other things, the group says it also collaborates with local communities to stop poaching and fight the illegal wildlife trade.Explore more on these topicsUS newsRembrandtWildlifeConservationAnimalsNew YorknewsShareReuse this content"

It is remarkable to think we only began with less than 200 snails and have now released over 100,000.”Dr Kristiina Ovaska of the Canada-based partners Biolinx Environmental Research said the restoration of the snails was an important part of restoring degraded ecosystems. “The snails function both as prey for larger animals and as consumers of live and decaying vegetation, so they are vital for turning over nutrients within their habitat,” she said.The Chester zoo team is now focusing its efforts on breeding a second rare species of snail,the lesser Bermuda land snail(Poecilozonites circumfirmatus).Explore more on these topicsWildlifeBiodiversityBermudaAmericasConservationAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

I went to find outPeterchurch, Herefordshire:Some silage competitions are assessed in a lab far away, this one takes place in a noisy pub, with judges getting their hands dirtyRev Simon LockettSat 7 Feb 2026 00.30 ESTLast modified on Sat 7 Feb 2026 05.38 ESTShareWhat a night. I’ve just got home from the Nags Head, Peterchurch, having attended the Eskleyside Agricultural Society’s annual silage competition. The Nags is one of the great social spots in the Golden valley. Here you can meet potato growers, social workers, sheep farmers, stranded pilgrims, water diviners and Thomas the cat. I’ve witnessed carol singing and dancing on tables, and the fire only goes out for two weeks each year, in the height of summer.Tonight the focus is silage. Grass, maize and cereal crops, harvested last summer, have been under wraps ever since in the local barns. Starved of oxygen, they have been steadily “pickling”, to ensure they’re packed with nutrients when fed to hungry cattle and sheep.I meet the judges out the back, where a livestock trailer holds the entries for all five categories: baled silage, baled haylage, grass pit, maize pit and whole crop pit; this last one is a seed mix of wheat, barley and grasses sown specifically for silage and cut in June at a young age. The smell from the bags is potent – too potent for the pub – but it’s also a beautiful smell; when you get a really good bit of silage, you know it. It looks, dare I say, almost edible.At some competitions the silage is analysed in a lab for metabolisable energy and crude protein, but here the science of sun and sugar is appraised by hand and nose. To that end, the judges crumble, rub and sniff the goods, testing for sweetness, texture and colour.At about 8.30pm they enter the bar to a cacophony of cheers and heckles. Prizes are handed out; among the winners are Eric Gwatkin for the baled silage, while Simon Bigley takes the crown for his baled haylage. A judge tells me that despite the summer drought halving tonnage per acre, the quality this year was high.Gatherings like this feed the soul of rural communities. This particular event depends on the existence of smaller hill farms around the valley, and there is always the fear that, as farms amalgamate into larger holdings, entries could fall. With several young farmers in attendance tonight, my hope is that this event will continue for many years yet.Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian’s Country Diary, 2018-2024, is available now atguardianbookshop.comExplore more on these topicsFarmingCountry diaryAgricultureRural affairsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There will be a time lag but this will cost lives. We have a responsibility to protect these lives.”Bates said it was “hypocritical” to talk about the need for action and then to reduce government spending in an area in which the UK had been a global leader.The UK made a commitment to spend 0.7% of gross national income on development in 2015 in order to align with a UN target. The Conservative government cut that commitment to 0.5%.On entering government, Starmer told a G20 summit in Brazil that his administration would prioritise “the fight against hunger” and would tackle “suffering and starvation”.But last year,Starmer announced that aid spending would be reducedto 0.3% of GDP by 2027, in order to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP in the same time frame.View image in fullscreenStarmer told a G20 summit in Brazil that his government would prioritise ‘the fight against hunger’ and would tackle ‘suffering and starvation’.Photograph: Saul Loeb/ReutersThe pivot by the government comes amid a global sea change towards aid spending.The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development projects that total global aid fell by 9% in 2024, and that it will have dropped by between 9% and 17% in 2025.A further drain on UK spending on global humanitarian causes is the decision to use part of the aid budget on asylum seekers already in the UK.The Home Office expects to spend £2.2bn of overseas development assistance this financial year on hotel bills alone.A government spokesperson said: “When we took the difficult decision to reduce our aid budget to allow more to be spent on defence and security, our funding for humanitarian support including to address hunger was relatively protected, and we recognise how important food assistance is for those in need.“The UK is the fifth largest donor to the WFP, which remains a vital partner.“In October, the prime minister announced a further £20m of UK aid to ensure water, sanitation and hygiene services reach tens of thousands of civilians across Gaza. This is in addition to the £74m we have already pledged.”Explore more on these topicsAidKeir StarmerHungerUnited NationsFood securitynewsShareReuse this content"

There aren’t empty spaces on the shelves with a label saying ‘waiting for British products’.”In other words, it could take years to restore Brexit losses.“Rebuilding demand will take time, effort and real focus,” he said.The analysis comes as the UK and the EU look to set up fortnightly political phone meetings toensure the negotiations over farmingand other elements of the “reset” in relations go smoothly between now and May or June, when the next leaders’ summit is scheduled.Cabinet Office and EU relations minister, Nick Thomas-Symonds, and European Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič had a bilateral on the sidelines of the trade deal review on Monday and agreed formalising talks would help nip any issue in the bud before it was too late.A government source said that while relations between Thomas-Symonds and Šefčovič were good there was a desire to formalise regular political-level negotiations in the run-up to the summit.“We want to step the political engagement up even further to iron out issues and drive forward negotiations. Both sides are keen to get positive results and keep building,” the source said.The collapse of talks over the UK’s full participation in the EU’s €150bn Safe defence programme was seen as unnecessary and a failure of statecraftThe EU had set a €2bn price tag on joining while the UK was only prepared to put in “hundreds of millions”, but many thought the gap should have been closed through political discussion given both sides agree on the need to strengthen Europe’s defence in the face of a US retreat.In the near term, the NFU is asking for the deal to ensure British farmers have sufficient time to transition to new rules that will apply to the GB market.It is also asking for certain exemptions to help safeguard areas of progress and innovation. For example, England has been faster than the EU to approve gene editing to develop disease resistant crops.“The EU is behind us, but moving in the same direction on plants. My argument to the EU is if you genuinely want to adopt this in the EU, don’t put the handbrake on the UK,” Bradshaw said.The UK outside the EU, has been able to move faster on vaccines on TB and aviation flu, for example, said Bradshaw, and has also approved some plant protection products, such as a fungicide used in cereal growing.Bradshaw says the deal should recognise the UK’s advances and if the EU is going in the same direction as the UK it should agree to “carve outs and transition arrangements”.He argues an adequate transition period is needed to prevent crops, which have been grown legally under current Great Britain rules prior to any agreement, becoming unsellable after a deal.Explore more on these topicsFarmingBrexitEuropean UnionEuropeForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Linden Kemkaran needs to stop peddling these false figures and focus on delivering better services for the people of Kent.”The council rejected this assessment, saying that while the only detail on the projects was two lines in an appendix to a budget document, and that they had not been approved or made subject to a business case, they were a “future cost‑avoidance measure”, and thus legitimate to claim as a saving.The row comes after one of the Reform councillors charged with finding major savings at the counciladmitted thatthe party had not found significant waste when it took over the local authority last year.Paul Chamberlain, who headed Kent’s Elon Musk-style department of local government efficiency, later apologised for a “lapse of judgment” with the comments and stepped down from the role.A Kent spokesperson said: “Kent county council categorically rejects any suggestion of impropriety, fabrication of figures or attempts to mislead. As we have already set out clearly in previous correspondence and our FoI response, the figures referenced relate to forward‑looking assumptions in the published budget book, not approved or designed projects.“The two items cited were listed in the potential capital projects section – high‑level, unfunded and unapproved possibilities for which no business cases existed. Local authorities routinely include such indicative items in medium‑term planning. The decision not to progress them is therefore a future cost‑avoidance measure, reflecting borrowing and expenditure the council will no longer need to incur.”The Reform leadership in Kent sent a separate statement, saying: “Only in Westminster bubble politics could stopping waste before it happens be spun as dishonesty. Reform prevented bad spending, and we make no apology for it.“This story is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of how public finances work, and a deliberate attempt to mislead readers … Polly Billington’s claim that these projects ‘never existed’ is demonstrably false.”Late last year, Kemkaran appointed a paid political adviser, Michael Hadwen. The movewas condemnedby the Liberal Democrat group on the council as a waste of money. They also expressed concern at previous social media posts by Hadwen that expressed support for Enoch Powell’s ideas about immigration.Explore more on these topicsReform UKKentLocal governmentnewsShareReuse this content"

A series of medical blunders by Bux led to the boy, referred to as Patient A, being transferred to hospital amid fears for his life.Summarising its decision, the GMC panel said: “Patient A was a serious case involving a vulnerable child where Dr Bux adopted a cavalier approach to the procedure resulting in a hospital admission of Patient A in a potentially life threatening situation.”It said Bux’s misconduct was of “such a serious nature” that removing him from the medical register was “the only proportionate sanction to protect the public, promote and maintain public confidence in the medical profession, and to uphold proper professional standards and conduct”.Despite this finding, Bux, 55, continues to advertise his services as a“circumcision practitioner”, which is legal as there isno requirement for circumcisers to be medically trained.In 2015 Mohammad Siddiqui, a private circumciser, was struck off by the GMC over medical failures in four circumcisions in separate homes. He, too, continued to perform circumcisions. Last yearhe was sentenced to more than five years in prisonfor causing “gratuitous pain and suffering” in circumcisions conducted between 2014 and 2019.Last month, the Guardian revealed the Crown Prosecution Service was consulting on guidance for prosecutors that would categorise circumcision aspotential child abuse, amid concern from judges and coroners about the lack of regulation of the procedure. Since 2001, circumcision has been a factorin the deaths of seven boys, including three children who bled to death.On his website, Bux offers circumcisions for“religious/cosmetic reasons”for babies up to six months old in north-west England, including Blackburn, Preston, Bolton, Burnley, Accrington and Nelson.The website says he has been performing circumcisions since 2003 and was a former senior partner at a GP practice. The website says he is no longer registered by the GMC but does not explain why.The tribunal hearing was told that Bux was “reckless and cavalier in his treatment of Patient A” and “risked fatal complications by carrying out the procedure in the community”.Specific mistakes upheld by the panel included: failing to consider Patient A’s congenital cardiac condition; failing to adequately inform his parents about the risks of the procedure being done in the community; failing to ensure the boy had sufficient pain relief – the cream Bux used did not “produce adequate numbness of the foreskin”; and administering excessive amounts of a liquid morphine.Bux’s lawyer told the panel it was a one-off incident and Bux had conducted thousands of circumcisions in the community without complications or infections.But the panel found Bux lacked insight into his mistakes, showed no remorse and gave no explicit apology. He was also struck off for “financially motivated dishonesty” after signinghundreds of bogus sicknotes for his wife’s legal firm.Alejandro Sanchez, head of human rights at the NSS, said: “The fact that Mr Bux can perfectly legally continue to circumcise boys is a catastrophic failure of child safeguarding that is endangering the lives of boys.“More fundamentally, ritual circumcision is medically unnecessary, dangerous and violates the child’s independent right to freedom of religion or belief.“When it comes to children, circumcision should only be performed by doctors, and only with medical necessity. “Decisions about non-therapeutic circumcision should therefore be deferred until the individual is old enough to decide for himself based on his own values.”Bux has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsCircumcisionHealthNHSNorth of EnglandReligionChildrenCrown Prosecution ServicenewsShareReuse this content"

The Ukrainian president also told reporters that both sides had been invited to further talks next week.Zelenskyy said theTrump administration“will probably put pressure” on Ukraine and Russia to end the war by the beginning of the summer. “They say they want to get everything done by June,” he said.“They will do everything to end the war and they want a clear schedule of all events.”He told reporters that if the new deadline of June was not met, Washington would probably put pressure on both sides to meet.Before Donald Trump took office, he promised to “end the war in 24 hours”. Later, his special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, suggested both sides could reach an agreementwithin 100 days of Trump’s inauguration.After this failed to occur, the US president set anew deadline for a dealin August last year, which also passed without any sign of peace, and in December he said a draft agreement to end the war was nearly “95% done”.Ukraine war briefing: Russia launches ‘massive attack’ on energy sites, triggering widespread blackoutsRead moreTwo days of US-led peace talks to end the war took place this week in Abu Dhabi but did not produce a breakthrough, although Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine’s presidential office, said the trilateral negotiations had been “genuinely constructive”.Zelenskyy said on Saturday that the Trump administration was proposing to host the next round of trilateral talks in the US, probably in Miami, in a week’s time. “We confirmed our participation,” he said.He hinted that the new June deadline for peace could be linked to Trump’s midterm elections campaign. “The [midterm] elections are definitely more important for them [the Americans]. Let’s not be naive.”He added: “If the Russians are really ready to end the war, then it is really important to set a deadline.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyRussiaTrump administrationUS foreign policyUS politicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Crown Princess Mette-Marit, meanwhile, has come under intense scrutiny over damaging revelations in the Epstein files abouther years-long relationshipwith the late sex offender.On Tuesday, the first day of his trial that has transfixedNorway, Høiby pleaded not guilty to the most serious charges of rape and domestic violence but acknowledged partial guilt – a plea allowed under Norwegian law – for aggravated assault and reckless behaviour. He also admitted lesser charges, including driving too fast.The crown princess had planned to leave the country for at least some of the trial, but changed her mind after the latest tranche of the Epstein files,released last Fridayby the US justice department, appeared to include nearly 1,000 mentions of her. In one exchange from 2012, she asked Epstein in an email if it was “inappropriate for a mother to suggest two naked women carrying a surfboard for my 15 yr old sons wallpaper?”The Epstein revelations prompted fierce criticism of Mette-Marit, including from the prime minister, Jonas Gahr Stør, who agreed with her own comments that she had shown “poor judgement” and called on her to provide more information.On Friday, Mette-Marit released a statement via the royal household expressing her “deepest regret for my friendship with Jeffrey Epstein” and apologising for “the situation that I have put the royal family in, especially the king and queen.”Her husband, Crown Prince Haakon, speaking to reporters, said there was “a lot happening at once” for his family. “We support Marius in the situation he is in, we look after the other children, they must also be looked after, and I have to look after and take care of the crown princess,” he said. “Fortunately, she takes care of me, too.”Although the king and his wife, Queen Sonja, remain popular among many Norwegians, the standing of the wider royal family has taken a severe hit. A poll this week by the newspaper Aftenposten found that support for Norway having a monarchy has dropped from 72% in 2024 to 54% today. A total of three polls have found that close to half of the population believes Mette-Marit can no longer become queen when Haakon ascends to the throne.As recently as December there was a public outpouring of support for the crown princess, who has pulmonary fibrosis, when she revealed that she will probably have to have a lung transplant. Now, some of the organisations of which she is royal patron have said they are considering ending their association with her.Kjetil B Alstadheim, Aftenposten’s political editor, who wrote an article this week asking the question: “Can Mette-Marit become queen after this?”, said the Epstein revelations posed the biggest threat because unlike Høiby – who is not an official member of the family – Mette-Marit has a central role in the institution and its future.“She is supposed to be queen one day, so that’s more difficult,” he said. “The others are side stories. Difficult stories but side stories. So it hits the family in a more direct way.”View image in fullscreenMette-Marit with Crown Prince Haakon. The latest tranche of the Epstein files appeared to include nearly 1,000 mentions of Mette-Marit.Photograph: SPA/dana press/ShutterstockStøre’s decision to comment on Mette-Marit’s actions was unprecedented, he said. “I have not found any example from earlier where a prime minister has criticised a member of the royal family in that way.”. He also added that Støre’s instruction to her to provide the public with more answers was highly unusual. “It’s very unique that a prime minister tells a member of the royal family what to do.”The royals are not immune to scandal: Mette-Marit’s entry into the family as a single mother before her marriage to Prince Haakon in 2001caused a stir, and thebusiness activitiesof Princess Märtha Louise – the crown prince’s sister – drew unwelcome attention after her marriage to a self-described shaman in 2024. But the developments of recent weeks are of a different order of magnitude.How the royal family handles the Epstein files issue will be crucial to “how they are viewed in the weeks and months and years to come”, said Alstadheim.Despite the apparent rise in republican sentiment and the unusual prime ministerial intervention, the dial hasn’t moved on the status of the monarchy among Norway’s wider political class. In a strange coincidence, a vote that takes places every four years in parliament on making Norway a republic was held on Tuesday. Just 26 MPs voted in favour of getting rid of the monarchy, against 141 who voted to keep it. Support was in fact lower than the last time a vote took place, in June 2022, when 35 voted in favour of a republic. The measure requires a two-thirds majority to pass.Alstadheim attributed the result to a desire on the part of the MPs to “look at this on a longer horizon than the current news cycle”.The Norwegian republican association, Norge Som Republikk, argued that the vote should have been postponed until more information was known about the mother and son’s behaviour. “Now we have to wait at least another four years,” said their leader, Craig Aaen-Stockdale.Vilde Helljesen, a journalist for the state broadcaster NRK, said many Norwegians were waiting for answers from Mette-Marit on the full extent of her relationship with Epstein. “She has said that she regrets her contact with Epstein and that she should have better researched his past and apologised for that,” Helljesen said. “However, the recent files have left new questions unanswered.”In practice, she added, the only person who could give and remove royal titles was the king: “As long as Mette-Marit is the wife of the heir to the throne, she will one day be queen – or the title that the king at the time decides. That is the formality.”Explore more on these topicsNorwayEuropeJeffrey EpsteinfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Missing Morales mystery as Bolivia’s ex-president goes to groundOnce a highly visible figure despite being wanted on human trafficking charges, the former leader has not been seen since shortly after the US kidnapped Venezuela’s presidentTiago RogeroSouth America correspondentSat 7 Feb 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 7 Feb 2026 07.54 ESTShareFor more than a year, he stayedhidden in plain sight: despite an arrest warrant for human trafficking charges, former presidentEvo Moralesmoved freely in at least one region of Bolivia, attended rallies, received foreign journalists and went to the polls to cast his vote in the 2025 presidential election.But shortly after the United States attack onVenezuela– and the detention ofNicolás Maduro– Morales disappeared from view; a month later his whereabouts remain a mystery.Bolivia’s first Indigenous president immediately criticised the attack on Caracas as “brutal imperial aggression”, both onsocial mediaand, the day after the strike, on his Sunday radio programme broadcast from the heart of the Chapare, a coca-producing region in central Bolivia.Since then, however, the man who was once one of the mostrecognisablefaces in Latin America has not been seen either on his programme – missing four editions – or at the public events he used to attend. His disappearance has fuelled a flurry of theories, includingclaimsby a conservative MP that he has fled the country.The disappearance comes as the centre-right president, Rodrigo Paz Pereira, tightens ties with the US in search of support for the battered economy and an acute dollar shortage.One of Paz Pereira’s main aims is tobring backthe US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), which, after violent incursions in Chapare that led to clashes and dozens of coca growers’ deaths, was expelled by Morales in 2008.Although the coca leaf has widespread legal and cultural uses in Bolivia as a stimulant, digestive aid or treatment for altitude sickness, it is known thatpartof the crop grown in Chapare is diverted forcocaineproduction.The official version – put forward by political allies and the coca growers’ unions – is that Morales has not fled but is instead ill.View image in fullscreenPresident Evo Morales, here attending a rally in Entre Rios, Cochabamba, on 14 August 2025, is said by supporters to have contracted dengue.Photograph: Agustín Marcarian/ReutersOn the first edition of his radio show without Morales, the presenter said the former president had “caught dengue”, a mosquito-borne viral illness common in Latin America.The following Sunday, the formerevistasenator Leonardo Loza fuelled the rumours already gaining traction and declined to disclose his whereabouts, saying only that he was “in some little corner of our Patria Grande”, a term used by some to refer to Hispanic America.His supporters made fun of the mystery, wearingmasksof his face and even producing asong, Where Is Evo?, which lists his achievements as Bolivia’s longest-serving president and concludes that he is “with the people.The swirl of theories intensified in late January, when the conservative MP Edgar Zegarra Bernal said the former president was in Mexico – something that would not be unprecedented: after Morales was accused of rigging elections in 2019,he fled to Mexicobefore later moving on to Argentina.How towering dominance of Bolivia’s socialist party came tumbling downRead moreBut Bernal gave no details or evidence and instead demanded that the government prove otherwise. “Why has the arrest warrant againstEvo Moralesnot been enforced so far?” he said.Since October 2024, Morales had beenentrenchedin a small village deep within the Bolivian jungle, wherehundredsof coca farmers prevented police from executing an arrest warrant against him over allegations that he fathered a child with a 15-year-old girl during his presidency in 2016.Morales has always denied the accusations, saying they amount to political persecution orchestrated by the then president, his former protege Luis Arce, with whom he broke after returning toBoliviain 2020.Deeply unpopular amid Bolivia’s worst economic crisis in four decades, Arce did not seek re-election. Paz Pereira won but did not move against Morales. Instead, he hadArce arrestedon accusations that he had “enabled illicit enrichment” while serving as Morales’s finance minister.Paz Pereira has not commented on Morales’s whereabouts, but his government minister, Marco Antonio Oviedo,saidthat “the information available” suggested Morales remained in the Chapare.A coca growers’ leader who requested anonymity told the Guardian that “Comrade Evo is already in full recovery and will soon resume his public agenda,” without offering a timeline or location, adding only: “There will be a surprise soon; he has already overcome dengue.”The former president has also resumedpostingon social media, criticising Paz Pereira’s government. “But that is no guarantee that he is here or elsewhere, because it’s well known that he does not usually write his own tweets,” said the political analyst José Orlando Peralta.As dengue symptoms, at least in milder cases, do not usually last more than a week, Peralta believes that “either Morales has fled or he is more seriously ill – it is not typical of him to disappear from the media agenda for this long”.Given the relationship Paz Pereira has sought to establish with the White House – this week, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio,praisedthe US “friend Bolivia” – and theemphasisTrump has placed on a so-called “war on drugs”, Peralta believes that “it’s surely only a matter of time before the DEA returns to Bolivia, and that will obviously complicate Evo Morales’s political and private life.”Additional reporting by Thomas Graham in Mexico CityExplore more on these topicsEvo MoralesBoliviaAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That was the highest rate among the British banks receiving the most complaints.NatWest ranked second, deemed to have wrongly rejected 33% of 1,972 fraud complaints, andHSBCthird, with 32% of 2,535 complaints wrongly rejected.There is normally a lag between fraud occurring, the customer raising a complaint to the bank, and the FOS later processing escalated complaints. A spokesperson for Monzo said some of the cases related to fraud that had happened more than two years ago.They said: “Since then, we have continued to invest in technology to stop fraud before it impacts our customers – and it’s working. We prevented 2.9 times the value of fraud in 2025 compared to the year before.”Fraud has become the most commonly experienced crime in the UK, accounting foran estimated 41% of all offencesin England and Wales in the year ending September 2024.Alex Neill, the co-founder and co-chief executive of the consumer rights organisation Consumer Voice, said fraud and scam victims often faced further distress when making a complaint against their bank.“People who’ve been scammed aren’t just out of pocket, they are often left feeling worried and ashamed,” she said. “Firms need to play their part and make reimbursement fair, fast and consistent, without forcing victims into a long fight for answers.”In 2024 the government introduced a new rule that obliges banks to refund most victims of APP fraud tricked and manipulated into transferring money to the criminals.UK Finance, a body that represents the banking industry, found there were 185,733 APP cases in 2024, down 20% from a peak of 232,427 in 2023. Overall, fraudsters took £450.7m from their victims in 2024, and £267.1m was paid out in compensation.A spokesperson for the FOS said it received hundreds of cases a week from people who have been victims of fraud and scams.Monzo, which is online-only, launched in 2015 as a wave of challenger banks such as Revolut and Starling joined the sector. It was valued at £4.5bn in October 2024 when employees sold stock to existing investors.While its valuation has lagged significantly behind that of Revolut, Monzo has focused most of its growth in the UK and gained a banking licence from British regulators in 2016.However, last summerthe bank was fined £21mby the City regulator over weak financial crime controls, after it allowed customers to register for accounts with “implausible” home addresses – including 10 Downing Street, Buckingham Palace and Monzo’s own headquarters.A few months later Monzo made the surprise announcement that its chief executive, TS Anil, who has led the company for almost six years, would step down in February. He will be replaced by Diana Layfield, a former Google executive.Under Anil’s leadership, Monzo trebled its number of customers to more than 14 million. The bank reported a record £60.5m in pre-tax profit in the year to March, with revenue of £1.2bn.A FOS spokesperson said if someone had been a victim of a scam, they should first speak to their financial provider. “If they don’t feel they’ve been treated fairly by their bank, they should complain to the business first, then get in contact with our free and independent service and we’ll see if we can help,” they said.A spokesperson for NatWest said its priority was to resolve complaints for customers in the first instance, and it proactivelyreached out to customers in historic cases to help the FOS clear its backlog of complaints and worked closely with the ombudsman to ensure fair outcomes for its customers.A spokesperson for HSBC said: “We fully comply with our regulatory obligations around the mandatory reimbursement of scams. Last year, we refunded over 13,000 scam claims and prevented over £130m being defrauded from our customers.“Financial Ombudsman Service data reflects only the small proportion of cases that were referred to the ombudsman and does not capture the customers we successfully help each year through early intervention, reimbursement, and support.”Explore more on these topicsMonzo bankBankingConsumer rightsNatWest GroupHSBCScamsFinancial sectornewsShareReuse this content"

It has concluded that the Philadelphia picture was “91% negative” and that the Turin version was “86% negative”.View image in fullscreenThe version of Saint Francis of Assisi Receiving the Stigmata on display in Turin.Photograph: Heritage Images/AlamyTill-Holger Borchert, one of the leading Van Eyck scholars and director of the Suermondt-Ludwig-Museum in Aachen, said the Van Eyck findings supported scholars who had suggested that both versions were studio paintings – produced in the artist’s workshop but not necessarily by him.He said that, although he was “surprised” by the analysis, it posed further questions that needed to be explored.Dr Carina Popovici, Art Recognition’s chief executive, said that such high negative percentages for the paintings were particularly dramatic. In contrast, an analysis of another Van Eyck –The Arnolfini Portrait, which is among the most popular paintings in the National Gallery in London – said it was 89% likely to be authentic.View image in fullscreenPortrait of Giovanni Arnolfini and his Wife, by Jan van Eyck.Photograph: AlamyShe said she had also been taken aback by the findings: “I expected that, if one painting was negative, the other would be positive. But no, both came out negative.”She told the Guardian: “I’m guessing that the Philadelphia and Turin museums won’t be happy. It’s not good news on these paintings.” The Philadelphia and Turin museums have been contacted for comment. Critics have contended that a paintings’ condition and later restorations may affect such AI-based brushstroke analysis.Dr Noah Charney, an art historian who discussed the initial Philadelphia painting’s findings on hispodcast, described Art Recognition’s previous analyses as “remarkably accurate” and said that the negative result for both pictures had been so surprising that deeper tests had been conducted to confirm the results.He said he had expected that the Turin picture would be confirmed as by Van Eyck, and that the Philadelphia version would emerge as a copy, whether from the artist’s workshop or later.“The negative results suggest that both of these pictures are studio works, which may mean that we have a lost original that was more fully by Van Eyck’s hand than these two,” he said.“If a work comes out of Van Eyck’s studio, it doesn’t necessarily mean that he actually physically painted the surface level of all aspects of it,” he said on his podcast. “That’s a misconception that people get from this 19th-century idea of the lone artist in a garret in Paris drinking absinthe, smoking cigarettes, wearing a beret and doing every aspect of the work themselves.”Van Eyck is regarded as one of the pioneers of oil painting. “[Van Eyck] didn’t invent oil painting, but he perfected it so thoroughly that everyone else seemed to be working in his shadow for centuries,” Charney said. “His surfaces shimmer with light in detail so fine you need a magnifying glass to take it all in. Every stone, hair, reflection, and a glint seems to be rendered with a kind of supernatural clarity.“That ability to make the everyday luminous is why many consider him not only a great painter, but one of the great observers of reality in all of western art. And yet for all his fame, Van Eyck’s surviving oeuvre is small: fewer than 20 paintings are universally accepted as by his own hand.”The National Gallery in London is preparing to stage an exhibition of Van Eyck portraits in November.Among previous analyses, Art Recognition detected up to 40 fake paintings that were being offered oneBayin 2024. It also concluded in 2021 that Rubens’Samson and Delilahin the National Gallery was “91% negative”, supporting critics who have long doubted that it was painted by the 17th-century Flemish master.Explore more on these topicsArtJan van EyckItalyPhiladelphiaBelgiumAI (artificial intelligence)EuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Last month, the government announced a big shake-up of the UK vet sector that ministers saidshould push down costs for pet ownersby requiring practices to make their pricing clearer.Pet insurance is mainly designed to cover the cost of vet fees for the treatment of illness and injury; other policy benefits can include things such as cover for loss and theft. One of the main types is lifetime insurance, which is the most comprehensive – and the most expensive.Average lifetime pet insurance premiums ended 2025 about 1.6% lower than a year earlier after a 2.3% drop in the final three months of last year, the pricing consultancy Pearson Ham said this week.It added: “The most pronounced year-to-date reductions [were] seen among animals aged four to six, where competitive pricing from leading brands has driven premiums down by about 4% over the year.” By contrast, premiums for older dogs and cats “have remained broadly flat year-on-year”.Pearson Ham said the median lifetime insurance quote last month was £247 for dogs and £180 for cats a year, adding that the data “underlines just how competitive the pet insurance market remains”.View image in fullscreenVeterinary nurse at a PDSA Animal Hospital examining a Beagle dog.Photograph: Barrie Neil/AlamyTrying to find the best pet insurance for your needs can be daunting; there are hundreds of products available, with big differences in what they offer. Many providers offer several levels of cover.If the huge choice and various options have left you scratching your head, the financial data provider Moneyfacts has offered pet owners a helping hand. This week it announcedthe winnersof its 2026 Moneyfactscompare.co.uk Awards, with ManyPets named “pet insurance provider of the year”. An insurer called Napo was highly commended, with Petgevity was commended.Those three firms also scored highly inthe latest annual star ratingsfor cat and dog pet insurance issued by Moneyfacts this week. It assesses the products available and gives the highest ratings to those that have the most extensive range of features and highest cover limits. “These can help assist the customer when looking for the best policy within their budget,” it says.Other firms that achieved five-star ratings for at least some of their dog and cat policies included: Argos Pet Insurance; Asda Money; John Lewis Money; LV=; Sainsbury’s Bank; and TescoInsurance.Tesco Insurance said a third (33%) of pet owners admitted they don’t have pet insurance, according to its latest research, “leaving them at risk of paying out a huge sum if their pet were to become unwell or get injured”.Looking at the reasons, cost was one of the main factors. More than two-fifths (46%) said they believed pet insurance was too expensive, with 29% saying they could not afford it.Explore more on these topicsConsumer affairsPet insurancePetsAnimalsInsurancenewsShareReuse this content"

Sign up hereGwilym MumfordSat 7 Feb 2026 02.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 7 Feb 2026 02.02 ESTShareTwo very unusual films were released last weekend. One you will have absolutely heard of: Melania, the soft-focushagiocumentaryof the US first lady, which was plonked into thousands and thousands of often entirely empty cinemas across the globe by Amazon and Jeff Bezos in what is widely perceived as a favour-currier to the White House. Melania’s $7m takings in the US were marginally better than forecasted (and far ahead of therisiblenumbersfor the film elsewhere) but, given the documentary’s vast cost, still represents a dramatic loss (especially if the rumour that Amazonpaid for the film to be in some cinemasis true). Then again, this was a rare multimillion dollar film where the primary marker of success was probably not financial.The other unusual film released last weekend you are less likely to have heard of, even though it dwarfed Melania’s takings. Adapted from a video game of the same name, Iron Lung is a grimy post-apocalyptic sci-fi horror in which a convict has to pilot a rusty submarine through an ocean of human blood on a distant planet. That peculiar plotline isn’t the most unusual thing about the film, though. No, what’s really remarkable is that Iron Lung came close to topping the US box office, earning $17m in its opening weekend, despite being entirely self-financed by an American YouTuber.That YouTuber is Mark “Markiplier” Fischbach, who – though I must confess I had never heard of before writing this piece– is a huge figure in the gaming streamer world, attracting millions of views for his playthrough videos and skits. The charismatic, floppy-haired Fischbach firstplayed through Iron Lung, a largely unheralded indie horror game, on his channel in 2022 and clearly liked it enough to sink $3m of his own money into writing, directing and starring in a film adaptation that is playing on thousands of screens across America and many more around the world.View image in fullscreenBlood, sweat and tears … a still from Iron Lung.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyIron Lung hasn’t exactly awed the critics, but then that doesn’t seem terribly relevant here. Because it’s worth underscoring how unlikely this all is. Making a film and then getting it into cinemas at such scale is a matter for studios and experienced distributors, not a lone gamer (Fischbach was turned down by studios and distributors before opting to release Iron Lung himself). The barrier for entry is formidably high, especially when you factor in the usually pricey marketing costs for a release. Though that wasn’t an issue for Fischbach, who stuck to a tight production budget and swerved the usual paid media campaign in favour of promoting the life out of his film on his own platform to an army of engaged fans. Regular viewers of his channel would have been hearing about the film for the best part of two years, an insistent drumbeat of anticipation that must have made its release feel like an event.Those fans, in turn, became active advocates for Iron Lung’s release on as many screens as possible, petitioning their local cinemas to show the film. It turned what might have been a niche release on a handful of screens into something far bigger, attracting the attention of the Regal cinema chain, whoagreed to show the filmat 99% of its US locations, including in the tiny pacific territory of Guam. The result is a indie movie hit of a very modern kind, built on blood, sweat andparasocial relationships.How replicable a hit it is, however, is difficult to say. Self-financing and distributing a film is a forbidding prospect for most people, even those with an army of fans. And Fischbach is far more experienced than most YouTubers in more formal film-making, graduating from online shorts to a self-funded TV series (The Edge of Sleep) to a feature film. Plus it’s hard to imagine many YouTubers being willing to juggle making a full-length film with the already time-consuming job of streaming your life for the world to see (Fischbach found himself making Iron Lung in his spare time on weekends).Equally though, current industry conditions might offer a tiny sliver of opportunity for the budding self-funded film-maker. It’s unlikely Iron Lung – or indeed Melania – would have had the space to show on thousands of screens a decade or more ago when, thanks to longer “theatrical windows”, films stuck around in cinemas for months. But, in an industry landscape where movies disappear on to on-demand in the space of weeks (and where there arefewer of them in cinemasin total than before Covid), there is room for unheralded releases to squeeze on to screens. Let’s hope it means more DIY efforts like Iron Lung – and perhaps fewer Melanias.To read the complete version of this newsletterplease subscribeto receive The Guide in your inbox every FridayExplore more on these topicsCultureThe Guide newsletterGamesMelaniaYouTubenewslettersShareReuse this content"

The novel’s reputation precedes it as a book infamously few ever finish, and those who do tend to belong to a particular breed of college-age guys who talk over you, a sect of pedantic, misunderstood young men for whom, over the course of 30 years, Infinite Jest has become a rite of passage, much as Little Women or Pride and Prejudice might function for aspiring literary young women.Most readers come to the novel in their formative years, but I was a late bloomer. It wasn’t until the winter of 2023 that, at the age of 34, smoking outside a party in Brooklyn, I found myself suddenly motivated to embark on the two-pound tome. A boy I knew from high school brought it up, and as I happened at the time to have developed a casual interest in those works one might attribute to the “lit-bro” canon (Bret Easton Ellis, Hemingway, etc), it seemed the appropriate time to take it on.It’s difficult to pin down what exactly constitutes this canon beyond the readership that tends to gravitate toward it, and by extension the readership it repels, but its defining feature seems to be the centering of male loneliness. A male protagonist, isolated and misunderstood, stands at odds with social norms and expectations and either grapples internally to critique them or identifies the source of ideology and seeks violent revenge against it. The spaces these works operate in are largely male-dominated – war zones, finance offices, fight clubs. They are largely accessible on a stylistic level and deeply familiar on a psychological one and, as such, have proven popular mainstream fare – massive bestsellers, ripe for adaptation, often critically championed besides. In recent years, the backlash against such success, carried out online and in other public discourse, and the backlash against that backlash have done as much as any single intrinsic commonality to create the perception of similitude throughout the canon.View image in fullscreenMichelle Zauner.Photograph: Sam HellmanMy guess is I became interested in this genre because I wanted to see for myself what exactly this community of young men was attracted to. And so I purchased a copy of Infinite Jest at the start of the new year. I aimed to read 50 pages a day. Some days 50 pages felt breezy, cinematic, riveting; other days they felt like a slog. Though neither the Enfield Tennis Academy nor the Ennet House Drug and Alcohol Recovery House is an inherently male-dominated space, the majority of the characters are men, all of them, of course, completely levelled by loneliness, but in terms of pace and accessibility, the novel stands starkly apart from the genre with which I had come to associate it.For one thing, reading is often interrupted by endnotes, of which there are 388 in tiny 8pt font. They range in complexity and salience from a one-word translation of the Québécois word for wheelchair to a nine-page inventory of a fictional film director’s collection of archival footage.“The endnotes are very intentional and they’re in there for certain structural reasons … It’s almost like having a second voice in your head,” Wallace said in an interview with Charlie Rose in 1997. He hesitates to go into more detail lest he appear pretentious, until Rose wheedles him to “quit worrying about how you’re gonna look and just be”.In interviews Wallace often comes across as a kind of Charlie Kaufman protagonist. Isolated by his own intelligence, longing for connection, neurotic but vulnerable, gently well-spoken, often apologising for roundabout answers that nonetheless exhibit great clarity or calling out his own tendency to sweat before someone else can beat him to the chase. “There’s a way, it seems to me, that reality is fractured,” Foster Wallace continues. “The difficulty about writing about that reality is that text is very linear, it’s very unified. I, anyway, am constantly on the lookout for ways to fracture the text that aren’t totally disorienting.”“One of the things I was trying to do in this book was have something be long and difficult but have it be fun enough that somebody would be almost seduced into doing the work.”Contrast, for example, the novel’s opening scene, which reads with the orgasmic intensity of a teen movie on hallucinogenics, with one some 80 pages later, a meeting between a Québécois separatist agent and a government operative set against a backdrop of Arizona shale. What appears to be a lesser endnote, a backstory concerning one of the agent’s superiors is itself twice noted, leading to an eight-page history of the separatist movement in question, narrated in and out of free indirect discourse, in the form of a semi-plagiarised term paper, which of course contains its own notes, one of which, most infuriatingly, requires us to turn an additional eight pages just to connect pimple cream to its chemical formula.Trust-fall into the barbed intricacies of the writing, and you will discover its soft, exquisite humanityA bathos of almost absurd proportions, but cumulatively, all of Infinite Jest’s digressions and pages of impenetrable density test the reader’s attention, conjuring the very irritations and panics and highs and plateaux that Wallace describes at length in the minds of his characters, and then, after long spells of banal tediousness, compensate the diligent with some excruciating, unfathomable detail plucked from the secret interior of a flawed human being pulsing with life. If you allow yourself to trust-fall into the barbed intricacies of the writing, you will discover soft, exquisite humanity as its perennial landing.These many valences of density are part of a larger meditation on life and art in the age of entertainment. For gen X, that mostly meant television, under the hegemony of which they came of age, when concerns about the death of the novel and the idea that fiction’s time had passed felt truly pressing.It is tempting to see Infinite Jest as one final act of heroism in the name of fiction. Certainly, I think it’s no stretch to say it’s unlikely we’ll see another book like this in our lifetimes. Ten years from now, Infinite Jest may exist as an artefact of an era when humans still wrote, from a writer who could describe the weather with detail as compelling as the realists, a work that combines Shakespearean lexical boldness with literary brat-pack druggie precocious cool and mainstream momentum to create one of the enduring literary successes of the 20th century.When I was approached to celebrate the novel’s 30th anniversary edition, it was perhaps hoped that I might assist in assuaging the unfair, outsized connotations of what it means to be aDavid Foster Wallacereader, which, at its worst, has come to signify misogyny, and at its best, someone who’s just slightly annoying.When I emerged from those weeks of dedicated reading I had a feeling of intensified mental acuity, but more importantly, there was the sensation of grief. It was a type of mourning I had not experienced before, one contingent on the fact that this book had demanded so much of my attention for so long a time. I missed these characters. I had lived with Hal, Joelle, Orin, Stice, Pemulis, and meaty, square-head, heart-of-gold Don Gately, witness to their deformities and obsessions so meticulously detailed and made so alive on the page, and suddenly without them I felt hollow. And just as with real grief, I found myself wanting to be surrounded by fellow mourners, to seek them out and convene in our collective memory, people who I realised were defined by a set of attributes wholly different from those I had assumed, people who had committed an act of defiance and tenacity, curiosity and rigour, and after it all, were sad to see its end.A 30th anniversary edition of Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace, introduced by Michelle Zauner, is published by Little, Brown.

His current Barbican residency sees him range across genres. Always ask questions, always engage, he says. He talks ‘capital O opera’ and big ideasSat 7 Feb 2026 09.00 ESTShareIn performance, Davóne Tines is electrifying. In thefirst concertof the US bass-baritone’s2025-26 residency at London’s Barbican Centre, he appeared at the back of the auditorium and then slowly descended towards the stage, spotlit and subtly miked. His unaccompanied voice fractured into stentorian booms, spat-out consonants and the violent crackle of mouth noises. This, unmistakably, was the musician whom the New Yorker announced back in 2021 was“changing what it means to be a classical singer”.Since then, Tines has been named Musical America’s vocalist of the year, he has won a2024 Chanel next prizefor “international contemporary artists who are redefining their disciplines”. And he was awarded the2025 Harvard arts medalfor distinguished alumni of the Ivy League university who have demonstrated achievement in the arts. Recent winners of the latter includearchitect Frank Gehryandnovelist Margaret Atwood. Unlike those cultural figureheads, Tines is not yet 40.Davóne Tines may have the voice of an opera singer, but he talks like a philosopher.Other singers win major awards, of course, and others explore the technical and aesthetic limits of what is conventionally recognised as “singing”. But few in classical music are as openly determined to range freely across genres and professional activities – or as acutely aware of their own agency. Our video calls are sprinkled with substantial silences as Tines formulates answers delivered in long paragraphs, often presenting densely argued theories about aspects of classical music. It is a rare interviewee who uses words such as “preclusively”, “valences” and “reified” as a matter of course, or who attempts to explain feelings about his own performances in terms of a “quadratic function”. Davóne Tines may have the voice of an opera singer, but he talks like a philosopher.We first speak as Tines is preparing to appear in a double-bill of works by Kurt Weill and William Grant Stillat Detroit Opera. Tines rose to international prominence in the Dutch premiere of Kaija Saariaho’s chamber operaOnly the Sound Remainsin 2016 and more recently made his Metropolitan Opera debut in a2024 production of John Adams’s opera El Niño. Yet he also performs spirituals and gospel and is working on a project “for a broader ear” with his band the Truth. His forays into what he calls “capital O opera” are strictly occasional. “For this project [at Detroit Opera] that is about presenting Black American love stories,” he says, “I’ll happily retake the mental baggage.” What keeps him at a distance the rest of the time? “Many cultural artefacts and practices that are upheld by institutions over time tend to be exclusionary because the populations, largely white and predominantly wealthy, have created systems and foundations for propagating their own perspective or interests.”A few weeks later, I return tentatively to the question of “capital O opera”. Tines has previously said he’d be interested in singing certain bass-baritone roles such as Mozart’s Don Giovanni or even Wagner’s Wotan – is that still the case? “I’m open to all of those possibilities. It’s always been dependent upon context.” There’s a pause. He starts and abandons several sentences before musing: “You know, maybe there can be an assumption that I don’t like the operatic canon?” That is not the issue, he stresses. The problem is that “its supporters and its purveyors don’t continually reassert its value to humanity as a necessary part of storytelling and emotional and cultural social catharsis”. What’s too often missing for Tines in opera and classical music is an investigation into why treasured artworks remain valuable and what they may say today. What he’s not interested in, he concludes with a knowing cackle, is being “slapped into someone’s production of Don Giovanni. I want to understand that text through a very intentional process of evaluation.”View image in fullscreenDavóne Tines in Julius Eastman: A Power Greater Than at the Barbican in October 2025.Photograph: Andy Paradise“Intentionality” emerges as a keyword in Tines’s capacious lexicon. When I ask about programming his current Barbican residency, he stresses that exercising his agency as an artist isn’t simply about what or how to sing. “It’s saying, ‘I have an engagement within the larger world and I’m choosing to exist in it in a certain way’.” He identifies two principles underpinning his artistic process: firstly, the fact that “thewaysomething is constructed is as important aswhatis constructed”. And secondly? “I really do feel that everything is some sort of metaphor for everything else. Like, all ideas are transferable and scalable – and I think that’s why we have art.”Tines is keen to emphasise that these big, abstract ideas are writ large in his Barbican residency. His first concertfocused on works by Julius Eastman– a “Black, gay, triple-threat composer, pianist and singer,” as Tines has described him elsewhere. Like Eastman, Tines is Black, gay and works beyond the conventional boundaries of any single musical metier, billing himself as a “creator and opera singer”. Just as importantly, the performance was an entirely collaborative affair, featuring Tines amid a lineup of musicians and dancers, with the programme curated by Grammy-nominated cellist Seth Parker Woods. As an opening statement, Tines tells me, the concert was about “representing a point of view [and] a way of working”.View image in fullscreenDavóne Tines performs his devised work Concerto No 1: Sermon with the BBC Symphony Orchestra in October 2021.Photograph: Mark Allan/Mark Allan / BBCHis devised work Concerto No 2: Anthem – the centrepiece of hissecond residency concert, with the BBC Symphony Orchestra – spotlights even more explicitly his vision for what he calls “lateral” artistic agency. The piece was commissioned by the LA Philharmonic for performance at the Hollywood Bowl in 2022. “What normally would happen,” he tells me, “is an orchestra would commission a composer to make a thing – and then I would be hired much later in the process to execute the thing, like a trained monkey.” He giggles. “I wanted to try a different way of modelling a relationship with an institution and so I had the orchestra commission me, personally as an artist, to create a piece for them.” Singers, he points out coolly, aren’t usually granted such a role.For Anthem, Tines brought together three composers –Michael Schachter,Caroline ShawandTyshawn Sorey– andMahogany L Browne, the inaugural poet-in-residence at Lincoln Center, to create a concerto for voice and orchestra that asks “what are we founding our sovereignty on?”. He issued his collaborators with a single sheet of detailed instructions. Inspired by the glamour of the Hollywood Bowl, he wanted “to do something big and shiny – like a magic trick. The magic trick is turning the Star-Spangled Banner into Lift Every Voice and Sing (the US’s Black national anthem) over the course of three concerto movements.”The political landscape in the US has shifted considerably since Anthem’s 2022 premiere. What are his hopes for the US now, I wonder, in the nation’s 250th anniversary year? After so much nebulous theorising, Tines’s answer is almost shockingly direct: “I hope it can become a place where true empathy is exercised. I think if we all were better able to identify with and respect the struggles and lives of others, we would make worlds that were better for ourselves.”Davóne Tines is at the Barbican, London, with the BBC Symphony Orchestra on13 Februaryand performs in Tyshawn Sorey’s Monochromatic Light (Afterlife) at St Giles’ Cripplegate, London,on 22 June.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicOperainterviewsShareReuse this content"

By then, I had already been sexually abused by a teacher for two years, and despite showing all the signs of trauma – night terrors, twitching, wetting the bed, constant stomach aches – I obediently kept his secret. To me, the world was a war zone of pain. I was a shy, awkward, lonely kid, but alone in my bedroom with that piece of music, I found a little bit of light that was just for me. Hearing it for the first time was almost a religious experience.People think classical music is dry, but Bach was anything but. Half of his 20 children died in infancy: there was no way to get rid of that grief other than through his music. Bach composed the Chaconne when his wife died suddenly, and he didn’t get to say goodbye or even go to the funeral. Even if you don’t know any of that, listening to it, on some level you will know. When you think it’s the end, it just carries on, like having one more thing to say to a person after they die. There’s so much truth and so much emotion hidden inside those 16minutes of music.At seven, music offered me a way to deal with what I was feeling but didn’t yet have the words for. I became obsessed. Every night, I would sit in my room listening to recordings of Bach, then Horowitz and Ashkenazy, pretending to play along. It was pure escape, pure fantasy. I could hide inside the music, and it made everything bearable. The Chaconne specifically was like an ancient key that slid into my heart.I had my first piano teacher at 14 and was offered a scholarship to the Guildhall at 18, but my parents wouldn’t let me go, preferring me to attend a “proper university” instead. So I stopped playing for 10 years, and worked in the City in a job I hated. I returned to piano in my late 20s with the same devotion I’d had as a child. Learning as an adult was more difficult, but I was more determined. Feeling as if you owe your life to something that you’ve lived and breathed and inhaled since you were seven carries you further than talent and ambition ever could.I thought: if something this pure exists, then I don’t have to dieAt 31, in a psychiatric ward, I heard another piece of music that changed my life. I had been trying to kill myself. I didn’t want to die, I just couldn’t go on living. A friend smuggled in an iPod nano with Glenn Gould playing the Bach-Marcello Concerto in D minor on it. I’d never heard anything so beautiful in my entire life. I was heavily medicated, but it was as if I was seven years old again, hearing classical music for the first time.That recording told me the same deep truth that the Chaconne had as a child, but now, as an adult, I was able to put it into words: if something this pure exists, then I don’t have to die. It gave me the impetus to get out, to keep living. I must have heard and performed that piece thousands of times, and every time it blows my mind. My first album came out a few years later, and I’ve just released my eighth. I’m playing on the same stages my heroes have played on – at the same venues, sometimes even in the same month and on the same Steinway.My cultural awakening: A Queen song helped me break free from communist CubaRead moreBut sexual abuse as a child is not something you can ever recover from or put behind you. It’s always there. My abuser was eventually arrested and charged with multiple counts of rape. He died before he faced trial. Everyone has their own version of trauma, but somehow we find a way to survive it. Music gave me the tools to feel less alone, to navigate a childhood filled with shame and secrets and power dynamics. In the Chaconne, I heard suffering transformed into something alive and beautiful. In Marcello, I heard hope at the exact moment I needed it. Both pieces taught me that there’s plenty of good in the world if we know where to look for it.Finding that tape was a sliding-doors moment. It’s impossible to say how my life would have been different if I’d never heard the Chaconne, but it probably saved my life, and it has given me a career that I love. As a child, I thought: if something this incredible can exist, then it can’t all be bad. I believed that at seven, and I still believe it now.TheNSPCCoffers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000.

So was his remark in 2023, to Premier Guitar magazine, that throughout his career he felt he had generally been “more obsessive than I’ve been curious”.Towner nurtured an unmistakable lyricism on a guitar, and his obsessiveness enabled him to tap into an imagination that kept coming up with hauntingly lyrical melodies, and revealing where their shapes might lead his improvising.His confidence in that inner world brought a remarkable catalogue of achievements. He played New York jazz clubs as an accomplished pianist in the late 1960s, but also played the Woodstock festival on guitar with the folk-blues singer-songwriter Tim Hardin in the same period. He performed and wrote for the saxophonist Paul Winter’s folk/jazz/classical band the Winter Consort, unexpectedly finding two of his compositions for the band – Icarus and Ghost Beads – becoming the names of craters on the moon, after the Apollo 15 moon-landing crew took Winter’s 1970 album Road with them on the trip.On a 12-string acoustic guitar, Towner freely improvised an opening forWayne Shorter’s The Moors, on Weather Report’s 1972 album I Sing the Body Electric, thereby creating a historic moment in the breakout of 60s/70s jazz-rock fusion.Through his brief association with the Winter Consort, Towner and three musical soulmates from that group (the bassist Glen Moore, the reeds player Paul McCandless, and the sitarist and percussionist Collin Walcott) contributed to another landmark moment in contemporary music-making. With the formation of the popular quartet Oregon, they created a hybrid of jazz, folk, classical, Asian and Latin-American music, brought together with a spacious patience, that came to be described as chamber-jazz.As a leader of his own projects, in 1973 Towner also began to collaborate with the producer Manfred Eicher, founder ofECM Records. He led more than two dozen releases of solo and small-group projects for ECM under his own name – including partnerships with Jan Garbarek, the trumpeter/composer Kenny Wheeler, the drummersJack DeJohnetteand Peter Erskine, and the vibraphonist Gary Burton. His tunes were so expressive that classy singer-songwriters would compose lyrics for them, notably the subtle British vocalist Norma Winstone.View image in fullscreenTowner in Sydney, Australia, in 1974 while touring with the Gary Burton Quartet.Photograph: Fairfax Media Archives/Getty ImagesHis last ECM release was the exquisite 2023 solo guitar album At First Light, a rich mix of the personal and the interpreted, even including Danny Boy, one of his favourite melodies.The youngest of five siblings, Towner was born in the city of Chehalis in south-west Washington state. His father, Milo, a timber-mill worker, played the trumpet, and his mother, Bernice (nee Caverly), was a church organist and a piano teacher. Milo died in the second world war when Ralph was three, and the boy learned the piano with his mother. He showed an early aptitude for improvisation in school, and was allowed to jam on penny whistles and other instruments with school ensembles because his ear for a spontaneous countermelody was so reliable.When the family moved south to the city of Bend, Oregon, Ralph took up the trumpet, and played in local jazz and polka bands. Music preoccupied him throughout his teens, and he studied classical piano and composition at the University of Oregon, enrolling in 1958.Two encounters in his college years would shape Towner’s life. The first was that he began jamming with Moore, a fellow student and self-taught double-bassist. The second was hearing another student playing an instrument he had never considered before – a classical acoustic guitar. Towner was so astonished by the instrument’s sonorities that, on the recommendation of one of his teachers, he sought out Karl Scheit, a classical guitar and lute master at the Vienna Academy of Music.Studying with Scheit meant relocating to Austria, living alone in a shoebox room and practising and studying seven days a week. Scheit usually taught his students Haydn, Vivaldi, Dowland or Bach, but by the time the young Towner returned to the US, he had a flexible contrapuntal technique that would also allow him to draw inspiration from the piano and basslines of the Bill Evans piano trio or a Brazilian samba group, adding percussion parts by intermittently drumming on the guitar’s body.When Towner and Moore joined Winter Consort in 1971, they met McCandless and Walcott, skilled musicians with quirky leanings similar to their own. The four quickly formed Oregon, thus named because of Towner’s and Moore’s affection for the landscape of the state where they were raised. It was a dream lineup for a contemporary genre-bending group in a musical era opening up to non-western cultures, and the proof was apparent in its worldwide success.With albums such as Music of Another Present Era (1973), Oregon in Concert (1975) and Northwest Passage (1997, with a changed lineup following Walcott’s death in 1984 in a tour bus crash), the band sustained on record and on tour their capacity for cinematic atmospherics, abstract yet melodic collective improv, and variously brooding and coolly funky grooves. Their 30th and finalalbum was Lantern (2017) – with a typically widely travelled repertoire taking in classic originals including The Glide and Duende, alongside Brazilian, Egyptian, Scottish and flamenco references.The 1973 solo album Diary remains a standout in Towner’s catalogue. Solstice (1977) was a memorable transfer of an Oregon sensibility to an A-list European lineup featuring Garbarek, the bassist Eberhard Weber, and the drummer Jon Christensen.Towner’s duo with the bassist Gary Peacock, Oracle (1994), is an object lesson in finely detailed collaboration, while Ana (1997) and Anthem (2001) are virtuoso solo guitar showcases, the latter featuring a delectable version of Charles Mingus’s classic Lester Young tribute, Goodbye Pork Pie Hat.Towner married the Italian actor Mariella Lo Sardo in 1994, and moved first to Palermo in Sicily and then to Rome. Productive new musical connections inevitably followed, notably with the Sardinian trumpeter Paolo Fresu.He is survived by Mariella, and by a daughter, Celeste, from his first marriage, to Janet, which ended in divorce.Ralph Towner, jazz musician, born 1 March 1950; died 18 January 2026Explore more on these topicsMusicJazzExperimental musicobituariesShareReuse this content"

He took this shot on the rooftop of his home in El Médano, Tenerife; a communal terrace filled with laundry rooms and cleaning supplies. This was 2021, in the throes of a Covid lockdown, so he would walk around in circles on the rooftop of his building, enjoying the fresh air.‘I always knew my dogs loved the wind on their faces’: Thiago Bernardes de Souza’s best phone pictureRead more“To be honest, there was a nail stuck in the wall, but I didn’t put it there,” he admits. One morning, he absent-mindedly propped the broom against the nail and noticed that it stayed at a 45-­degree angle. He returned to the rooftop for several days, waiting until the shadow of the small ceiling above matched, then captured the moment with his phone.“Someone has sold us the idea that if you like street photography, for example, you have to travel to New York, London or Paris,” Dähncke says. “Now, obviously, if you’re a fan of photographing giraffes and you live in Tokyo, you’re screwed. But I think there’s a middle ground where we often lose ourselves, and the photo we want to take is closer than we think, often just around the corner. It is our responsibility to cultivate a curious gaze like that of a child, the sense of wonder of a tourist visiting our city or town.“During that time, I learned to appreciate the little things, like the space and air on my roof. After the pandemic, I tend to forget I don’t need much,” Dähncke adds. “This photo reminds me of that.”Explore more on these topicsPhotographySmart shotArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What now?The misery of the English winter has made me homesick for extreme US weather. I hate to miss a hurricaneTim DowlingSat 7 Feb 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 7 Feb 2026 13.36 ESTShareIam sitting in my office shed, cut off from the house by a driving rain. The misery and boredom of the English winter is, I have to admit, beginning to get to me. I spent January talking about the days getting longer, and used up all my optimism.For the last 10 minutes I’ve been scrolling through the website of my American home town newspaper, which is full of pictures of the recent snowfall – over a foot, with more predicted in the coming days. Extreme weather has a tendency to make me homesick – I hate to miss a hurricane.Another local headline catches my eye, one I find difficult, at first glance, to believe.“The town is about to get its first ever roundabout,” I say to the oldest one the next morning. “At the intersection of Wilson and Meadow Street.”“You told me this yesterday,” he says. “You came running in.”“My worlds are colliding,” I say. “I’m not sure I can handle it.”The US, in the 30 years I’ve been away, has gone from being a country that knew nothing of roundabouts to one that cannot build them fast enough. In the paper, the town’s director of transport was quoted as saying, “I think it’s going to look great,” as if they were installing a new fountain.My wife walks in.“Are you coming on this dog walk?” she says.I pull on my boots and my coat. In the car my wife suggests going somewhere new – a different park.“There’s nowhere new round here,” I say. “We’ve been everywhere.”“I found a country park I’ve never heard of,” she says. “It’s only about 7 miles away.”We find ourselves in a lonely car park with three other cars in it. The other cars all have people in them, just sitting there. This looks fun …My wife drives while I navigate. Traffic is heavy heading west, and conversation fitful.“It’s near the ice rink,” I say. “Past where the old community college was.”“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” my wife says.“The new roundabout,” I say.Fifteen minutes later we find ourselves in a lonely car park with three other cars in it. The other cars all have people in them, just sitting there.“This looks fun,” I say.“It’s something different, anyway,” my wife says.In a steady drizzle we follow a winding wooded path, with me staring at our current location on my phone, trying to orientate myself.“What’s that way?” my wife says.“The motorway,” I say.“And what about that way?” she says, pointing south.“The airport,” I say.The dog tears through the trees and splashes along the bed of a shallow, rubbish-filled stream.The path opens on to a meadow.“So they got a foot yesterday,” I say, “and they’re expecting more.”“Wow,” my wife says.We make a large circuit of the open space, dodging vast puddles, until we end up back at the car park.“There’s a church,” my wife says. “Do you want to see the church?”“Why not?” I say. “We’re here.”Tim Dowling: the dung men are here. The tortoise is out. Surely it’s not spring already …Read moreWith the dog on a lead, we take a path through some trees until we come to a churchyard surrounding a chapel with a squat brick tower. A woman is scrubbing the front steps. She nods and smiles, and says it’s all right to take the dog in.Inside it becomes clear the church is very old. A man is crouched in the corner, treating the damp where the wall meets the floor.“What’s the history of this place?” my wife says.“Well,” the man says, slowly getting up off his knees. “There’s been a church here since Saxon times.”“Really?” my wife says.He shows us the monuments, and points out the 14th-century wall painting above the altar. He sees me staring at a marble tomb tucked in the corner, with the carved effigy of a woman on top.“That’s Anne Boleyn’s great-great niece,” he says.“Huh,” I say. For a long time there is no sound, apart from the roar of cars on the M4.“Well, that was weird,” I say when we’re back at the car.“It’s good to do different things,” my wife says.A left turn out of the car park takes us under the motorway, and on to a crowded roundabout.“Guess what this reminds me of,” I say.“Shut up about your stupid roundabout,” my wife says.Explore more on these topicsFamilyThe Tim Dowling columnfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Of course, the Scots know this. They know how fantastic this genius concoction of pulses, vegetables, oats and spices is; how meaty without being, well, meaty. I began eating it because I share a birthday with Robert Burns (seehaggis kheema) but it deserves to be eaten all year round. Here, I’ve introduced the haggis to another favourite of mine, dan dan noodles, and I’m pleased to report they get on like a house on fire.Haggis dan dan noodlesDo not be put off by the list of ingredients. The first four are stirred together to make a sauce, and the majority are put into a pan, one after another, and come together quickly.Prep15 minCook30 minServes42 tbsp rapeseed oil2 garlic cloves, peeled and minced2cm x 2cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated, to get 1 tbsp454g pack vegetarian haggis(I likeMacsween’s)1 tsp five spice2 tsp dark soy sauce1½ tbsp hoisin sauce1 tbsp shaoxing wine2 pak choi, quartered400g dan dan noodles, or medium wheat noodlesFor the sauce100g light tahini4 tbsp(60ml) light soy sauce2½ tbsp chilli sediment and oil4 tsp black Chinkiang vinegar (black rice vinegar)To finish40g roasted salted peanuts, ground or very finely chopped2 spring onions, whites and greens, very finely slicedPlace all the ingredients for the sauce in a large heatproof bowl, mix really well and leave to one side.To make the haggis topping, put the oil in a wide saucepan on a medium-high heat and, once hot, add the garlic and ginger. Cook for two minutes until fragrant, then crumble in the haggis. Stir frequently for around eight minutes until it starts to brown in spots, then stir in the five spice, followed by the soy and hoisin sauces. Cook for another five minutes, until it looks dry and a little crunchy, then stir through the shaoxing. Take off the heat and leave in a single layer in the pan to cool.Meanwhile, cook the noodles according to packet instructions in plenty of hot water. One minute before the cooking time has finished, carefully remove a mugful of the water and drop in the pak choi. Stir, leave to soften for half a minute, then use a straining spoon or fork to lift out the pak choi.Drain the noodles, put them in the sauce bowl and mix anbd toss using a spaghetti fork or tongs. Add the reserved noodle water a tablespoon at a time (you’ll need between six and 10 tablespoons to make the noodles nice and saucy).Distribute the noodles between four shallow bowls, spoon over the haggis topping and the pak choi, sprinkle over the peanuts and spring onions, and dig in.Explore more on these topicsVegetablesMeera Sodha recipesFoodVegetarian food and drinkBurns NightChinese food and drinkHaggisrecipesShareReuse this content"

It showed a street scene: 100-odd people, a few dogs, some mills in the background. I remember liking the work mostly because I could see myself in it, in a way that I couldn’t when faced with paintings of fruit or water lilies. I’ve had a soft spot for the painter ever since, and to mark the 50th anniversary of his passing, I travelled up to Manchester for a Lowry-themed break.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.My first stop was theManchester Art Galleryon Mosley Street, where a number of his works hang alongside those of his mentor, the French impressionistPierre Adolphe Valette(Lowry took evening classes with Valette while working as a rent collector).Each of the paintings on show, whether of a street or park or lonely road, hints at a shared experience. They are more than the sum of their parts, more than mere matchsticks. Detractors bemoan Lowry’s lack of technique, but for me that’s rather like dismissing Gavin & Stacey for not containing enough big words.With the rain falling heavily, I found refuge inSam’s Chop House, down an alley off Cross Street. The pub-restaurant has been going since 1868, and was a bolthole for Lowry, who sits still at the bar, set in bronze. I leant on the man as I saw off a pint, then made a fool of myself by trying to get a selfie with the pair of us in it. Lowry was too large for the frame.View image in fullscreenA statue of Lowry can be found propping up the bar in Sam’s Chop House.Photograph: Wirestock, Inc/AlamyI crossed the River Irwell and entered Salford, which has a unique identity and is a city in its own right – not just Manchester’s bit on the side, as is routinely reported.Alongside the Irwell, just a few yards into Salford, standsThe Lowry hotel, which was initially owned by Sir Rocco Forte, whose hotelier father was a Lowry enthusiast. In the hotel’s gym, I realised that the music of the Smiths isn’t conducive to a workout. But on the treadmill I caught a Morrissey lyric about it taking “strength to be gentle”, and it made me think of Lowry, a man brave enough to stick to his everyday scenes at a time arty types in London were calling for more elevated fare.Lowry’s house is unmarked. I’m tempted to consider this regrettable, but it’s probably what he would have wantedI was collected from the hotel byJohn Consterdine, a local legend who does tours of the region in an electric black cab, including one focused on Lowry. We started at Lowry’s endpoint,Southern Cemetery, where the painter has lain since perishing of pneumonia in 1976, at the age of 88. His resting place is marked by a modest stone cross and adorned with paintbrushes. It is shared, fittingly, with his overbearing mother.View image in fullscreenThe writer with taxi tour guide John Consterdine outside the Lowry centre.Photograph: Scott AntcliffeNext, we drove out to a part of town known as Victoria Park. Once a gated community for middle-class Victorians, it’s where Lowry grew up. The house at 14 Pine Grove offers no hint that he lived here until the age of 22, at which point the family were forced to move to Pendlebury, a deprived district of Salford. The relocation was a fall from grace, one that Lowry’s mother would never recover from.Lowry did adapt to his new surroundings, however. Indeed, it was here that he discovered his unlikely muse – Manchester’s industrial landscape – and went to work on the down-to-earth scenes that he would become known for. Again, the house (117 Station Road) is unmarked. I’m tempted to consider this regrettable, but it’s probably what Lowry would have wanted. Theartist refused a knighthood in 1968, and holds the record for most honours declined, turning down five in his lifetime.After a brief stop atPeel Park, which Lowry painted several times, John dropped me at Salford Quays, which would have been as busy as a box of frogs back in the day, before the bottom fell out of the cotton market. Salford was affected badly by the slump and the city entered a long, deep depression, soundtracked by Joy Division. The docks were a wasteland, renewal a pipe dream.I entered a space the size of a squash court, each side and surface alive with Lowry’s artwork … the paintings grow to their subjects’ true height, becoming entire worldsEnter Lowry. Or rather,theLowry: a theatre and gallery complex, conceived by Salford councillors in the late 1980s, who hoped an arts centre would rejuvenate the area. It opened in 2000 and set off a chain reaction. London’sImperial War Museumerected a northern outpost; then the BBC moved to MediaCityUK and told Gary Lineker he’d be dipping his prawns in gravy henceforth. By the time ITV and Corrie moved in, in 2013, Salford Quays was becoming a tourist, retail, residential and leisure hub.At the heart of it was the Lowry, whose halls had been decked with the vast collection of Lowry paintings the local council had been snapping up over the years.I started with a new immersive experience calledLowry 360. I entered a space the size of a squash court, each side and surface alive with Lowry’s artwork – bobbies on the beat, bicycles on the move, matchsticks a go-go – the whole thing elevated by a voiceover from Sophie Willan, star of the sitcom Alma’s Not Normal. By animating Lowry in this way, the paintings grow to their subjects’ true height, becoming entire worlds. This is Lowry in the round, and it works like a dream.View image in fullscreenGoing to the Match, one of Lowry’s most famous works.Photograph: The estate of LS LowryI moved on to the paintings, which felt more alive off the back of the animation. Centre stage is Going to the Match (1953), one of his most famous works featuring signature “matchstick men”, which shows a crowd on their way to a Bolton Wanderers game.The painting has been on quite the journey. When the Lowry opened, it was offered to the gallery on long-term loan by its then owners, the Professional Footballers’ Association. Twenty years later, the PFA suddenly asked for the painting back, because it wanted to flog it at auction. The Lowry was gutted, knowing its prized possession would be lost for good.Enter Andrew Law, a state school lad from Stockport and the sitting CEO of a global hedge fund. He wrote the Lowry a blank cheque and told it to acquire the painting.It did so – for £7.8m. Someone buy that man a shandy!I could bang on about each of the paintings on show at the Lowry, but suffice to say that the whole range is here: mills, streets, churches, parks, a girl in a corset and the deep blue sea. Despite the received wisdom, Lowry is no one-trick pony.

Manchester United were at home to Bournemouth that evening, so off I went to the “Theatre of Dreams”. I took up a position behind the East Stand, part of a thickening congregation as kick-off approached: kids on shoulders, a lady hawking scarves, coppers policing Matt Busby Way.It was some view. There wasn’t a chimney in sight, but I fancy Lowry would have captured the scene nicely nonethelessNot having a ticket, I withdrew toHotel Football, within earshot of the ground. After the game I climbed to the top and looked towards the skyline of Salford and Manchester.It was some view: the skyscrapers ofNew Jackson, the bright cluster of MediaCity, the dark lifted by countless northern lights. There wasn’t a chimney in sight, but I fancy Lowry would have captured the scene nicely nonetheless.

It is a Saturday evening in February 2013, andJeffrey Epsteinis messaging Bill Gates’s assistant about guests for a dinner he wants to organise.“People for Bill,” the email begins. Epstein starts listing possible candidates: the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, the film director Woody Allen, the prime minister of Qatar, a couple of Harvard academics, the billionaire CEO of Hyatt hotels, a White House communications director, a former US secretary of defence.He names 10 powerful men, before suggesting “Anne Hathaway (really)”. Epstein has to make it clear, with the bracketed word, that he is not joking when he proposes that a woman might join them at the table. The lists ends tentatively: “victoria secret models?” Epstein wonders: “Who on the list do you think he would enjoy the most?”The Epstein files reveal a patriarchy in action. This is a world where the men are rich and powerful, and the women are not. The emails showcase the private behaviour of a male ruling class, as they network, joke and trade information.Womenexist at the periphery, tolerated because they organise the diaries of the busy men, they arrange food, they grace a table, they provide sex.View image in fullscreenJeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.Photograph: US Department of JusticeA typical email from Epstein to a man in his network will say: “Head of the Nobel Peace Prize committee Thorbjorn Jagland will be staying in ny with me. You might find him interesting.” Epstein is writing to Richard Branson in characteristic style, combining some casual showing off with an offer to share access to someone else influential.A typical email from Epstein to a woman might say: “Take a selfie of your pussy and send.”Women feature as objects to be looked at and improved – teeth seen to, weight lost, STDs treatedSpend three days rummaging through the chaotic, sprawling, sordid pit of information contained in the Epstein files, and you learn valuable lessons about how this modern global patriarchy operates: through flattery, the exchange of favours and occasional curt reminders of who owes what to whom.For women, these files offer an unprecedented chance to eavesdrop on conversations from which they are usually excluded. They provide salutary insights into what a set of distinguished global figures think and say about women when they assume the women aren’t listening.There are two groups of people in the Epstein files. The men: the billionaires, the tech entrepreneurs, the bankers, statespeople, politicians, leaders, people who need to be cultivated because they offer Epstein ways to strengthen his network of influence. And the women, who exist as insignificant plus-ones, or as people to whom he doles out money because they are providing him with services. Women feature as objects to be looked at and improved – teeth seen to, weight lost, STDs treated, features fixed. (“You might want to see a doctor about reducing the nose a little before you turn 23,” Epstein suggests to an unnamed woman in July 2017.) The emails show that Epstein is often irritated by the women.Women as organisersThe men are looked after by teams of female helpers. Lesley Groff, Epstein’s long-term executive assistant, appears to be responsible for organising schedules, snacks and sex. When Epstein has a meeting with Larry Summers in 2012, Groff reminds her female colleagues that “Larry is VIP!” and tells them: “We should be prepared with snacks for Larry.” She reminds them again later: “Can we make sure to have something snack-y for Larry.” She is on first-name terms with a global cast of female personal assistants – Elon Musk’s Mary Beth and Anne, Branson’s Helen; they consult each other about their employers’ dietary preferences (Branson likes sauvignon blanc, pinot grigio and rosé. “No chardonnay please! Likes desserts in general. As sugar-free as possible.”)Groff provides a tireless dual-track service organising diaries and travel so her boss can meet powerful men, as they endlessly circle the world between Paris, Los Angeles, New York and London, attending summits and dinners. She smooths out the wearisome business of packing and booking helicopters with calming emails that promise: “Leave it with me,” and: “I’ll take care of it.” Groff’s lawyers have previously said their client had “never witnessed anything improper or illegal”.When Epstein decides on a whim on a Saturday evening in 2012 that he wants to organise two seminars, one on power, and one on money, he emails Groff with a list of 20 men he thinks should attend: Jeff Bezos, Jes Staley, Bill Clinton, Peter Thiel, Gates etc (it seems no women are going to participate in the power and money seminars). Groff is unflustered by the request to start scheduling invitations to tech billionaires and some of the world’s most powerful men, and sends a chirpy reply: “Great. I will keep track.”View image in fullscreenBill Clinton and Jeffrey Epstein.Photograph: US Department of JusticeIn parallel, she sorts out logistics for the women that Epstein likes to move around the world with him – air tickets are purchased, visas sorted, cars arranged. She handles countless requests to extract women from cities in eastern Europe: “Organise for [redacted] to come from moscow to paris arrive 2.40 sat, leave late sun night, she will send her passport.” She sends out details of the addresses that women should be picked up from (“Girls to meet at 71st Street with their IDs. Heli to East Hampton”). She reassures women that payments for tickets have been “purchased on JE’s Black Amex!!”. She gets saunas fixed, steam rooms serviced, makes sure the modem is working in the bedroom. Not much gratitude is expressed by her boss. Very occasionally the diary is double booked; Groff is duly reprimanded by Epstein: “I have depos all day? You should know that.”Men messaging menWithout women observing their behaviour, the men are uninhibited in the way they communicate with each other, frat-boy-style tones unchecked. “By the way,” the Emirati businessman Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem messages Epstein early on a November Tuesday morning in 2013, “the Ukrainian and the Moldavian arrived. Big disappointment the Moldavian is not as attractive as the picture.” “Photo shop,” Epstein suggests. “Not only that she was too short and skinny,” Bin Sulayem replies.Pussy is, indeed, low carb. Still awaiting results on gluten content, thoughCanadian longevity doctor Peter AttiIs this just standard locker-room banter? (How can women who aren’t normally allowed in these spaces possibly know the answer to that?) There are just 525 messages referencing pussy, but more often the word is coyly initialised. Men sign off messages to Epstein wishing him “lots of P”. “Happy new year with lots of P” or “Happy birthday and a year full of health, money and lots of P”. Epstein’s friends like to email him updates about the health benefits of sex. “Pussy is, indeed, low carb. Still awaiting results on gluten content, though,” the Canadian longevity doctor Peter Attia writes. Being in Epstein’s company allows distinguished elders, such as Noam Chomsky, the linguistics professor, to reveal their true thoughts about women. In 2019, months before Epstein died in prison, Chomsky was advising him on how to handle all the bad press he was getting, advising him to ignore it all, given “the hysteria that has developed about abuse of women”. It allows the married father of six, and former Harvard president, Summers, to continue messaging Epstein – a man who had pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl a decade earlier – asking for romantic advice, up to the day before his arrest in 2019.There are plenty of examples of sniggering disdain for women (Peter Mandelson and Epstein joking about celebrating his release from prison with strippers called Grace and Modesty). But it is the routine display of indifference that feels most chilling. Take the protracted back-and-forth between Epstein’s female assistants and Branson over travel arrangements to get Epstein to Necker Island for a lunch date in 2013. Would it be all right if Epstein brought Gates’s assistant with him, and two Russian girls (names redacted)? Branson replies himself, within a few minutes: that’s fine. Best, Richard. The next email checks whether it matters that the two Russian girls don’t have UK visas. This doesn’t seem to pose a problem. No interest is expressed in who these Russian girls are, no explanation is offered about their role, and there is no curiosity about why a convicted child sex offender is bringing them. The response is just: “Of course. Best. Richard.”Some might be tempted to dismiss the Epstein files as just evidence of the extreme behaviour of a prolific sex offender.But strip away the lewd and crude content, and they also reveal much about how patriarchy works day to day.Favours and flatteryThe men message each other endlessly, inquiring about each other’s locations, responding with light displays of one-upmanship, informing each other about their tight schedules. Their messages say things like: “Are you in NY? Would be great to catch up. I’m in SF/LA til Wed.” One month, Mandelson messages from Shanghai where “the entire Chinese banking fraternity is attending”; next month he messages from Centre Court at Wimbledon (“But not in royal box like Andrew”). He expresses concern that his friend is in New York and not on holiday: “Not doing mykonos?”Once their geography is established, the men exchange titbits of knowledge. “What do u make of JPMorgan stuff?” Summers asks Epstein in 2012. The responses are not always hugely insightful; these conversations seem more about flexing their closeness to the centre of power.Favours are swapped. Epstein is asked if he can help get someone’s son a job, let someone stay in his New York flat. Connections are traded openly. In 2019 Epstein seeks reputational advice from Steve Bannon about which journalists might give him an easy hearing, before offering as a quid pro quo an introduction to Chomsky – who is “an iconic figure and you shouldn’t pass up the chance to talk history and politics. I will connect you on email.”Behind the scenes, Epstein is trying to manage the women he has imported into his lifeHelping boost each other’s reputations is standard practice. One of Epstein’s friends tells him he has been working on editing his Wikipedia page for him. “BTW, we also took out you in the sex offender category … And, now it just reads businessman, philanthropist.”When women intrude into this male world, it is often because they are representing philanthropic foundations. Philanthropy is used cynically by many of the men to extend their networks of influence and to distract attention from their financial dealings. In this world, mostly unpeopled by women (apart from those who are there for sex), Sarah Ferguson is something of a category error, a Bianca Castafiore figure, the lone woman in Tintin, annoying the men with her insufferable singing.View image in fullscreenSarah Ferguson and an unknown person, in an image from the Epstein files.Photograph: US Department of JusticeBehind the scenes, Epstein is trying to manage the women he has imported into his life. He advises one to go to the doctor for STD checks and to get a test of her hormones. “Whore moans,” he adds, and suggests she attend a tantric sex class. Another woman accuses him of mistreatment. “I dressed like u told me. I did my hair style like u asked. We had sex. I did massage for you non-stop. I took a bath with u and your girls even if I don’t like it. I danced even if I didn’t feel like to dance or wasn’t in the mood.” He expresses annoyance at the behaviour of a long-term girlfriend whom he accuses of “crying and whining” because he will not let her attend the dinners he organises with powerful men. Somehow the women have not yet learned that they cannot expect to sit at the table. The women cannot have their own preferences; the women must always be ready to dance.Get in touchContact us about this storyThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

Can he really pull off a socialist revolution?Simon HattenstoneSat 7 Feb 2026 01.00 ESTShareAdd the Guardian on GoogleWAKEFIELD17 JANUARY 2026“I’m dying for a wee,”Zack Polanskisays as he gets off the train at Wakefield Westgate. Why didn’t you go on the train, I ask? “It was very busy and too many people recognised me on the way to the toilet. I knew I’d never get there for all the conversations, so I came back.” When did it become hard for him to go to the toilet on a train? “2 September,” he says. “The day I was elected.”At first, I wonder if Polanski is bigging himself up, but over the next couple of weeks I see for myself he is not exaggerating. While Polanski says it’s not, and cannot be, about one individual, in Green circles there is much talk of the Polanski effect. Since he was elected in September 2025, the Greens have risen by an average of four points in the polls. Just before going to press,the Guardian’s latest poll trackerhad the party at 13.5%, only five points behind Labour, on 18.6%; 20% of people who voted Labour in 2024 now say they will go Green.It’s astonishing how life has changed for the party leader over five months. For 20-odd years Polanski, aged 43, was a jobbing actor nobody had heard of. He got by, just, by supplementing his acting gigs with all sorts of jobs – teaching drama, dressing up as hotdogs, handing out flyers at the nightclub Heaven, working in bars and, now notoriously, as a hypnotherapist.Polanski became deputy leader of theGreen partyin 2022, and still pretty much nobody had heard of him. These days, he looks like an old-timer, born to a life in politics. But the truth couldn’t be more different.We reach the hall in Wakefield where supporters are waiting to welcome Polanski. Kate Dodd, a local party co-ordinator, says when he came here two years ago, there was an audience of a dozen. “We booked the same venue and pushed the capacity to 50, but in October we thought we’d better get a bigger room. We’re expecting 400 and there’s a reserve list. It’s a bit overwhelming. I never thought this would happen, not here.”Wakefield is not traditionally fertile territory for the Greens. But last May they sensed things might be changing. Polanski announced he was standing for the leadership, and local people were already disillusioned with the government, despite the town being a Labour stronghold. So Wakefield Greens held a strategy meeting. “We had about 80 members and set ourselves a target of 150.” It was ambitious, but Polanski wanted to rebrand the Greens as the party of hope, in opposition to Nigel Farage’s Reform, which he saw as the party of hate. “We now have nearly 600 members,” Dodd says. “That is how things have changed. Some of it is down to our activism, but a lot is down to Zack’s leadership.”To say there’s a lot left to be done is an understatement. Of the 63 councillors on the council, not one is Green. How many seats would Dodd like to win in the May elections? “All of them, obviously.” She laughs, then gets serious. “Our goal is to win half a dozen.”View image in fullscreen‘I couldn’t have been less political for most of my life if I’d tried.’Photograph: Sebastian Nevols/The GuardianThe Green party looks different from Britain’s other political parties. Many members here today are young. Dodd introduces Olli Watkins and Ash Howick, both wearing green HOPE badges; they were parliamentary candidates at the general election, aged 21 and 22, and have been partners for five years. Next to them is Incy Wood, an artist and wheelchair user in a magnificent rainbow-­coloured checked suit and orange bob. You can’t move here for orange, blue and purple hair.Few people I speak to mention the environment. It’s taken for granted they’re green. The word on everyone’s lips is socialist. “People had seen us as a party for climate justice but hadn’t realised the extent to which we are a socialist party,” says Dodd, a Labour refusenik.Wood introduces Polanski to the audience. “I would like to welcome an absolute lunatic and general rattler of the establishment, Zack Polanksi.” There’s a roar.“Nigel Farage called me an absolute lunatic,” Polanksi explains, then proceeds to talk fluently, at 100 miles an hour without notes, about community, the cost of living crisis, taxing the rich, making the world work for the majority. When hebecame leader, he said the Greens were reclaiming the language of Reform; they were the true populists because they represented regular civilians, not the elite. Today, we hear less about populism. It turns out it’s not such an easy word to reclaim.In a tiny room, I join Polanski for a lunch of vegetable tacos. He is a vegan and supports Forest Green Rovers, theworld’s only fully vegan football club. After he won the New York mayoral election, Zohran Mamdani, to whom Polanski is often compared, invited him for a tete-a-tete. Polanski declined because he doesn’t fly.He seems like a caricature of a to-the-manure-born Green politician. But, he says, “I couldn’t have been less political for most of my life if I’d tried. I actively avoided conversations about politics.”Polanski grew up in a traditional Jewish family in Manchester – a happy time until, when he was 11, his parents split up: “It felt like the world had broken.” He says he became a pawn in the hostilities. While his two older half-siblings stayed with their mother, he went to live with his father because hedidn’t want him to be alone. Until his barmitzvah, at 13, he attended synagogue regularly, then suddenly stopped. Why? “Because it was a thing I did with my parents. And once we weren’t going together, it felt quite painful to go.”By the age of nine, Polanski realised he was gay, though he couldn’t put it into words. “I was watching the wrestling and realised I wasn’t just interested in that; there was something about these men that I was really drawn to. I didn’t recognise it as gay till I was 14.”But at school he was bullied after being caught snogging in a nightclub. “My first kiss was with a young Muslim man called Jihad when I was 14.” He knows he shouldn’t have been clubbing in his early teens, but says it was inevitable. This was the time of Section 28, which banned the “promotion” of homosexuality by local authorities. “I couldn’t talk about being gay at home and you weren’t allowed to at school.” He viewed Canal Street, the focal point of Manchester’s gay village, as his safe space. In reality, it was anything but. “It’s clearly not an appropriate place to go at that age, and I was definitely meeting age-inappropriate people.”Polanski, who then went by his birth name David Paulden, had come out at school but not to his family. These years were traumatic: “I was homophobically bashed on Canal Street at 15, and ended up in hospital. Then I was kicked out of Stockport Grammar, where I was on a scholarship. I never felt I belonged there. I got kicked out for not making grades and being cheeky. One teacher said I’d never make anything of myself.”BOLD POLITICS11 DECEMBER 2025A month before our visit to Wakefield, I meet Polanski in London where he is recording his podcastBold Politics. He invites people he admires on to the show and soaks up what they can teach him. It’s a clever format. As well as acknowledging how much he needs to learn, it means that influential leftwing thinkers such as the Guardian columnist George Monbiot, journalist Carole Cadwalladr and economist Grace Blakeley leave having had a positive experience, then spread the word.But lots of people are less positive about Polanski. On social media he is trolled for anything from his stance on Nato (leave, because the US is an unreliable ally), his grasp of economics, his style of running, histeeth, for saying Israel has committed genocide in Palestine (despite a UN commission reaching the sameconclusion). And it’s not just trolls who are critical. In early December he appeared on Rory Stewart and Alastair Campbell’s podcast The Rest Is Politics, and he is still licking his wounds. He appeared to confuse the country’s national debt and the deficit. When asked England’s top rate of income tax, he incorrectly said 40% rather than 45%. Stewart, a former Conservative MP, was brutal. “I was horrified beyond belief on the economics stuff. It’s not acceptable,” he told listeners once Polanski had gone. “If this is where British politics is going, no, no, no.”Today’s guest on Polanski’s show is Gary Lineker, who owns the company that hosts The Rest Is Politics. Polanski is a skilled presenter. Again, he doesn’t use notes. The interview makes headlines, with the former Match of the Day presenter saying he’d never go into politics and admitting, “I cry most days when I see innocent kids being killed” in Gaza. But Polanski can’t leave his treatment on The Rest Is Politics alone. He repeatedly tells Lineker it was unfair – he insists they had promised not to go into granular detail and that he was misrepresented by Stewart, who told the audience he said he could learn numbers easily because he was an actor, suggesting he was acting out the role of politician. It obviously got to him. I wonder if this is him standing up to the establishment or being oversensitive.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenRecording his podcast with Gary Lineker. Photographs: supplied by the Green partyI ask Lineker later what he makes of Polanski. “I like a lot of what he says. He seems a really good guy: fresh energy and a bit of kindness.” Does he seem different from other politicians? “I think so. He seems more open. He’s not in power, so that makes it a little bit easier.”What does he think about Stewart’s attack on Polanski and his reaction? “Well, if people are having a pop at you, you must be doing something right. You’re going to get caught out occasionally, and he’s only been in charge for a few months. To be a politician, if you’ve not got thick skin, you’re in the wrong job.” Is Polanski’s thick enough? “I don’t know. We’ll find out, won’t we?” Despite everything, Stewart goes on to name Polanski his politician of the year.PALANTIR PROTEST, LONDON22 JANUARY2026Polanski, a couple of dozen supporters, a few journalists and a smattering of police are outside Palantir’s British HQ in Soho. Palantir is a US software company that helps huge organisations make sense of their data. Using a loud hailer, Polanski says it is a surveillance company providing the software used by US government agencies such as the CIA and ICE. It also supplies the Israeli Defence Forces with technology for “war-related missions”. In 2023, it signed a£330m dealwith the British government to unify data across the NHS, whichcomes up for review soon. Polanski is here in his regulation black suit, open white shirt, Dr Martens and green raincoat to deliver a letter telling Palantir to “pack its bags and get the hell out of the NHS”. But there’s a problem: “They won’t let me deliver the letter.”“Noooh!” the small crowd shouts. “Shame!”“But we will be emailing it, so they will be getting it,” Polanski announces. Then he changes his mind, gets on all fours and tries to slip the letter under the front door.“Palantir out of the NHS! Palantir out of the NHS!” the crowd chant. It doesn’t really work. Too many syllables.View image in fullscreenWith protesters at the Palantir HQ in London.Photograph: Aldo Ciarrocchi/LNPMo, a youthful NHS consultant, is holding up a Green party banner. How long has he been a member? “Half a year.” Why did he join? “Straight up, Zack Polanski. He’s clear about what he believes in. He’s got very left-leaning views. I used to be a Labour party member. After Keir Starmer took over and it was clear he was taking the party in a particular direction, I left.”On the corner of Soho Square, a delivery worker approaches two young police officers. “It’s him,” he says, pointing at Polanski. “He’s saying good things.”“Is it really?” the female officer says. “Really?”The male officer gets his phone out and searches for a picture of Polanski. “We didn’t realise it washim!” the female officer says. Does she like him? She laughs nervously. “I’d better not say.”HACKNEYLATER THAT DAYIt’s now afternoon, and I meet Polanksi in a cafe near where he lives, full of young parents and their children.“Thank you for everything you’re doing, Zack,” one mum says, as if they’re resuming a chat. When we leave, I ask if he knows her. “No,” he says. “People often talk to me as if we’re in the middle of a conversation and we know each other. I believe the phrase for it is aparasocial relationship. It’s really lovely because it feels like wherever you go, there are friends you’ve not met yet.”We make our way through a park and head for a pub. I ask if he thinks he’s at peak popularity – still untainted by power because he doesn’t really have any. “I hope not, but that’s a possibility.” The Green party has almost tripled its membership in a year to 190,000 (67,000 more than the Tories), putting them in third place behind Labour, whose membership hasfallen to a reported 250,000, and Reform, whose website claims 270,000.A man with long orange hair on an orange bike cycles up. “Hey, sorry to interrupt,” he says. “I know you’re local and I run a charity called theTree Musketeers.’’“My boyfriend has volunteered for you,” Polanski says. “You do things in Springfield Park, don’t you?”“Yeah, and we’re planting trees there on the 31st if you just want to come and say hello.”“I’m local, but sadly I’m rarely here. I imagine my boyfriend might be there.” Polanski asks his name. Marcello, he says. “Every time I look there are new trees. Thank you for everything you’re doing, Marcello!”View image in fullscreen‘I wouldn’t work with Keir Starmer … but my calculation is he won’t be around much longer.’Photograph: Sebastian Nevols/The GuardianOver the decades, I’ve followed many politicians, but none has been greeted as positively by the public. It’s not surprising he has been compared to Mamdani. Both are leftwing, charismatic, have names beginning with Z and won elections against the odds. “I think it’s a huge compliment,” Polanski says. How are they alike? “Well, we’ve both come from the grassroots and have a positivity about politics and an unconditional solidarity to minority groups.” But while Mamdani dresses fabulously and is effortlessly urbane, Polanski is snaggle-toothed, a bit cheesy and at his happiest in pre-loved clothes. It’s part economics (he still struggles for money, and is hoping to work his way on to the property ladder with his boyfriend, Richie Bryan), part green ideology, part character. “The right wing are obsessed with my teeth,” he says. How many are missing? “Two.” He points to a gap. “Important story. The baby tooth fell out a couple of years ago. The adult tooth is waiting to come through. I’m worried when it does it will look like I’ve got an implant, so I have to make sure everyone knows I haven’t been bullied into filling that gap!”He tells me about an important part of his life. At 18, he left home for Shrewsbury, where he worked for a children’s adventure company. For the first time, he was moving in a different world, with colleagues from other countries. It was around this time he changed his name. Though he had given up on synagogue, he was interested in Jewish history – how his ancestors had fled pogroms in Latvia and Poland, and had been called Polanski. But also: “I had a stepfather called David I got on badly with. I didn’t want to be a ‘little David’ version of this man making my life difficult.” He chose Zack because of the Jewish character Zach in Michelle Magorian’s wartime novel Goodnight Mister Tom. “Once I changed it, I found out it was probably Polinski. But by then I was, like, I’m not changing my name twice!”It felt like a new start. He went on to Aberystwyth University in Wales, where studying drama was the making of him: “I became camper and more flamboyant. Extrovert.” Then he went to a drama school in Atlanta, Georgia, got hooked on American football and withdrew into his shell. “I desperately didn’t want people to know I was gay. There was a lot of toxic masculinity around. My obsession with American football was something to do with retreating a little bit from my sexuality.”Zack Polanski: ‘I’m going to confess I haven’t finished The Climate Book by Greta Thunberg’Read moreIn the few weeks I’ve been following Polanski, more high-profile politicians have taken a pop at him. A couple of weeks ago Wes Streeting criticised Polanski after he said on Question Time he appreciated the work migrants did, particularly as so many were in the caring industries and he for one wouldn’t fancy wiping people’s bottoms.But Polanski says the attack was cynical, pointing out that Richie works in a hospice as a physiotherapist and has wiped his fair share of bottoms. “It was the mostfuckingridiculous attack ever.” Polanski so rarely swears that it’s shocking when he does. “Hundreds of care workers told me they appreciated what I was saying. And if Wes Streeting really wanted to do something about care workers, he should pay them properly and treat them with dignity.”Yesterday, he says, at prime minister’s questions, Starmer “went on a rant about me being high on drugs and soft on Putin. I’ve never taken a drug in my life. As for the Putin stuff, that just isn’t credible. Putin is an autocrat and dictator. It just feels like a desperate smear. So I said he was low in the polls and hard on the country.”Not only has Polanski never taken drugs, he has never drunk alcohol. “It’s not for moralistic reasons. I’ve always had a lot of energy about me. People used to say, ‘I drink to be comfortable on the dancefloor’, but I always felt perfectly comfortable dancing without drink or drugs.”In the pub, he orders tea with oat milk and chips. I ask if he felt frustrated all those years doing multiple jobs and working day and night. He looks at me as if I’m mad: “I was having the best time ever.” This was when he found his confidence. “The flyer-boy job was pivotal. You were handing out leaflets for, say, a £2 drink, and people rejected you over and over. So you have to build up the armour, keep up that positivity when people tell you to fuck off, and 10 seconds later you’re going again: ‘Hey, would you like to come to G.A.Y. tonight?’ That built a resilience, which helped me with acting, because you go to an audition and never hear from them again.”He became so confident, he began giving drama students body confidence lessons – how to hold yourself, stand, breathe. And after doing a course in hypnotherapy, he combined the two. “Then, famously, I met a Sun journalist and got into a bit of trouble.” Ah,Boobgate.In 2013 a Sun journalist asked if he could hypnotise her into having bigger breasts. “She said, ‘Are you willing to do it as an experiment?’ I said, ‘Yes, so long as you make it clear it’s not something I normally do, and it’s your idea.’ She then wrote this absurd article saying it worked, which should be the biggest clue the whole thing is nonsense. What’s important is I’m not just saying this retrospectively. I went out on radio the next day and said this article doesn’t represent me.”Are we ready to take on power and wealth? Are we ready to get our country back? Then make some noiseI quote from the Sun: “This is an extremely new approach but I can see it becoming popular very quickly, because it’s so safe and a lot cheaper than a boob job.”Did he actually say that? He looks sheepish. “Yeah, I said that, because once you’ve accepted you’re doing it as an experiment, you go along with the absurdity of it.” The piece said he charged £220 a session. He insists the Sun never paid him a penny, and he charged drama students whatever they could afford.Did he feel humiliated? “No. I thought it was ludicrous and embarrassing, but not something to worry about because I was an actor doing all these quirky jobs.”Was he a good actor? “I’d like to think so.” Was he in any movies or TV shows I might have seen? God no, he says, he was far too snobby for that: all that mattered to him was Shakespeare or community theatre. It was the latter that finally politicised him. He got involved in interactive theatre, where actors and audience mingle and shape the story. “In one show, Echo/Chamber, I was leader of an organisation, a bit like Extinction Rebellion, and there were 50 people in the audience and I’d bark orders at them, pushing them to a point where they would overthrow me and ideally kick me out, and the rest of the show would happen without a single actor. In The People’s Revolt at the Tower of London, the audience could decide why they were unhappy and what demands they would make of the government.”View image in fullscreenPhootograph: Sebastian Nevols/The Guardian. Grooming: Celine Nonon at Arlington ArtistsIt was after this that he joined his first political party, the Lib Dems, in 2015, and stood as a councillor in north London in 2016.“We got obsessed with proportional representation,” he says now, “because almost every conversation turned to the fact that politics is broken, we need to change our voting system. And back then the only people talking about that were the Lib Dems.”But during Brexit, he became disenchanted. “I don’t want to be rude to former friends, but suddenly I noticed the Lib Dems seemed quite stuffy and not really my vibe. The Green party felt right for me.” He joined in 2017, by 2021 had been elected to the London assembly – the first decently paid job in his life – and in 2022 he became deputy leader. Last year he decided to stand for the leadership. He thought the party should be more radical and inclusive, and offer a genuine counter to Reform. If Labour refused to tell a positive story about migration and redistribution, he told members, his Green party certainly should. He won 84% of the vote.Time for our next round – I get a glass of red, he gets another pot of tea. Chips all round. The most seductive thing about Polanski as a politician is his willingness to say things the mainstream parties run scared of. Yes, he wants a wealth tax; yes, he wants to leave Nato and forge a new alliance with Europe; yes to a universal basic income. And, of course, these are also the policies that will scare off more conservative voters. If he realised, say, his stance on Nato could cost the Greens 20 seats in the next parliament, would he compromise? “No way! I would look at a different way to communicate it, to win the argument.” Would he really refuse to work with a Labour government? “I said I wouldn’t work with Keir Starmer.” And he’ll stick to that? “Yes, you need to be sincere and coherent. And this is a man who wascomplicit in a genocide, wanted toslash disability benefits… But my calculation is he won’t be around much longer, so it feels pretty irrelevant to talk about working with him.”Polanski is hoping to win a seat at the next general election. He’d love to win one in London, which he has regarded as home for a long time. What about taking on Starmer in Holborn and St Pancras? “Well, that could clearly go Green,” he says with a mischievous smile.G.A.Y. AT HEAVEN25 JANUARY 2026Polanski is doing a Green fundraiser at Heaven, the legendary LGBTQ+ nightclub in London’s West End. The dancefloor is heaving. Upstairs, Polanski is reminiscing with his former boss and Heaven owner Jeremy Joseph. The suit and DMs have gone. Tonight it’s jeans, a rainbow-coloured sweatshirt and trainers.He tells me his day has been ruined by Labour announcing it won’t let Burnham stand in the Gorton and Denton byelection. Journalists have been calling Polanski all day asking if he’s tempted. (He’s not.)Joseph says how much Heaven is struggling under Labour. “The rise in national insurance cost us an extra £8,000 a week. I don’t know if we’ll make it through the year. They say they’re doing it for the workers. Well, if there are no businesses, there are no jobs.”What was Polanski like as an employee? He laughs. “Terrible barman!” And as a politician? “He’s amazing. He’s the only politician I’m willing to put on here at the moment. And this is a perfect place for him to get his voice heard. On a Saturday night we get 2,000 people.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenOn stage at Heaven nightclub, where he once had a job handing out flyers. All photographs: Matt PayneThere are two things I need to check, I tell Polanski. Was he born in Salford or Manchester? “I grew up in Manchester, but I was born in Hope hospital, Salford. Here’s your headline: I came from a place called Hope.” He loves a bit of cheese.Finally, I say, I’ve read you are bisexual. Is it true?“Really? Where does it say that? No, definitely gay.”Joseph grins. “It might have meant that when he couldn’t get it, he paid for it. Buy-sexual.”Back on the dancefloor, the crowd chants Polanski’s name, fists pumping. “Are we ready to take on power and wealth?” he asks from the stage. “Are we ready to get our country back? Are we ready to make hope normal again? Then make some noise.” And they do.The DJ starts a beat and Polanski is spitting on it hip-hop style. “They will try to divide and distract us. They will say the threat is on a small boat or a dinghy. But we know the real threat: it’s flying above our heads in private jets. Flying above our food banks. Flying above people who are homeless. Flying above the climate crisis. But we are so strong when we find our collectivity … Together, through community, that’s how we’ll change the world.”As Bonnie Tyler’s Holding Out for a Hero starts playing, Polanski rips off his sweatshirt to reveal a black T-shirt that reads “Vote Hope”. He dives into the crowd, and I leave him dancing with them.Explore more on these topicsZack PolanskiGreen partyGreen politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The vehicle was transporting displaced people who fled fighting in the Dubeiker area, the group said in a statement. Among the dead children were two infants.Several others were wounded and taken for treatment in Er Rahad, which suffers from severe medical supplies shortages, like many areas in the Kordofan region, the statement said.The doctors’ group urged the international community and rights organisations to “take immediate action to protect civilians and hold the RSF leadership directly accountable for these violations”.There was no immediate comment from the RSF, which has been at war against the Sudanese military for control of the country for about three years.Sudan was plunged into chaos in April 2023 when a power struggle between the military and the RSF exploded into open fighting in the capital, Khartoum, and elsewhere in the country, leaving tens of thousands dead and millions displaced.A drone attack on Friday on a World Food Programme (WFP) aid convoy in North Kordofan province killed one and wounded several others, said Denise Brown, the UN humanitarian coordinator in Sudan.Brown said the convoy was heading to deliver “life-saving food assistance” to displaced people in the city of El Obeid in North Kordofan when it was struck. The attack burned the trucks and destroyed the aid, she said.“Attacks on aid operations undermine efforts to reach people facing hunger and displacement,” she said in a statement.Last week, a drone strike hit close to a WFP facility in the Blue Nile province, wounding a WFP worker, Brown said.Emergency Lawyers, an independent group documenting atrocities in Sudan, blamed the RSF for the attack, while the Sudan Doctors Network called it a “flagrant violation of international humanitarian law [which] amounts to a full-fledged war crime”.Massad Boulos, a US adviser for African and Arab affairs, condemned the attack on X and called for holding those responsible accountable.“Destroying food intended for people in need and killing humanitarian workers is sickening,” he said. “The Trump administration has zero tolerance for this destruction of life and of US-funded assistance; we demand accountability.”The British minister for international development and Africa, Jenny Chapman, called the attack on the WFP convoy “disgraceful”.“Civilians are starving,” she wrote on Saturday on X. “Aid workers and humanitarian operations bringing vital food should never be targeted.”In a strongly worded statement on Saturday, Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry criticised the RSF for its recent drone strikes, including on the vehicle of displaced families, the WFP convoy and on a hospital in Kordofan that killed 22 people.The Saudi statement called for the RSF to stop its attacks on civilians and aid convoys, and called out foreign parties that continue to “deliver illegal arms, mercenaries and foreign fighters” – an apparent reference to the United Arab Emirates, which has been accused by rights groups and UN experts of arming the paramilitary group. The UAE has denied the accusations.In recent months, Kordofan has become a flashpoint in the war and the army managed to break the RSF siege of two major cities in the region earlier this year.The devastating war has so far killed more than 40,000 people, according to UN figures, but aid groups say that is an undercount and the true number could be many times higher.It created the world’s largest humanitarian crisis with more than 14 million people forced to flee their homes. It has fuelled disease outbreaks and pushed parts of the country into a famine that still spreads as the war shows no sign of abating.In a report released on Thursday, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) said famine was found in two more areas in the western region of Darfur where famine was confirmed for the first timein a displacement camp in August 2024.The report warned that acute malnutrition is expected to worsen in 2026, with a 13.5% increase in cases of acute malnutrition in children under five and pregnant and breastfeeding women – from 3.7 million children and women in 2025 to nearly 4.2 million in 2026.Severe acute malnutrition, the most dangerous and deadly form of malnutrition, is expected to increase to 800,000 cases, up 4% from 2025, it said.Mohamed Abdiladif, the country director for Save the Children in Sudan, said children were already dying from hunger-related causes in many parts of Sudan.“Every day we hear devastating stories of parents selling the last of what they own simply to keep their children alive from one day to the next,” he said.Explore more on these topicsSudanAfricaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Due to be introduced this week, a transition to the system has now been postponed until April.It was the latest sign of unrest in a country facing significant problems tackling aid cuts, foreign currency shortages, and resulting rises in the cost of necessities.Protests over food and fuel pricesin September and November were hijacked by political groups, with outbreaks of violence.President Peter Mutharika, elected last year with a promise to restore the economy, has carried out adjustments to fuel, electricity and VAT, withfuel prices rising by 41%and electricity by 12%.Those who closed their shops and walked to tax offices, dressed in black and carrying placards criticising the revenue authority for prioritising “hitting the target” of revenue collection and “celebrating” while vendors are having to shutter their businesses, are especially struggling over import and export of goods.A shortage of foreign currency, they say, is pushing them to buy the dollar for imports at almost three times the bank rate.“Our businesses are under threat because of the economy,” said Robert Nachamba, a representative of small business owners, after a group of 1,000 protesters delivered their petition at the Blantyre revenue authority offices.“The country does not have foreign currency in the banks and now the Malawi Revenue Authority is coming with issues that threaten our businesses even further.Nigeria’s big tax gamble: great in theory but people are already checking their pockets | Cheta NwanzeRead more“When we think about how tough things are in the country, our pain is that there is a lack of foreign exchange which forces us to buy it on the black market because it is not available in the banks. Now we have already got it at an abnormally high rate and now we need to declare the prices of goods to the tax authorities? This will make the prices of our commodities higher even compared with our neighbouring countries and we don’t need that system,” he said.“We closed our shops and travelled to submit our petitions. That is why they were peaceful because we can’t destroy our own shops.”Malawi’s minister of finance, Joseph Mwanamvekha, hastold citizensto “remain resilient” as the government implements tough economic measures to stabilise the economy, cut expenditure and “improve revenue collection”.But economists warn that while the measures are technically rational – including the introduction of the electronic invoicing system to improve administration and combat tax evasion – businesses in the informal sector need to survive.Malawian economist Bertha Bangara-Chikadza told the Guardian: “The [policies] are being implemented under extreme macroeconomic challenges. If the government can use the resulting revenue to stabilise the economy and improve public services, it may indeed be a good step. However, if the increased tax burden fails to translate into improved infrastructure and energy, it risks further straining an economy.”Malawi is the latest in a string of African economies, including Kenya, Nigeria, Egypt and Uganda, to implementmandatory electronic invoicingand “real-time tax reporting systems” as part of a trend to improve revenue collection and reduce fraud.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentTax and spendingProtestMalawiAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It is remarkable to think we only began with less than 200 snails and have now released over 100,000.”Dr Kristiina Ovaska of the Canada-based partners Biolinx Environmental Research said the restoration of the snails was an important part of restoring degraded ecosystems. “The snails function both as prey for larger animals and as consumers of live and decaying vegetation, so they are vital for turning over nutrients within their habitat,” she said.The Chester zoo team is now focusing its efforts on breeding a second rare species of snail,the lesser Bermuda land snail(Poecilozonites circumfirmatus).Explore more on these topicsWildlifeBiodiversityBermudaAmericasConservationAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

The timing for the retrial had not yet been set.Zhang said he met with Schellenberg in Dalian on Friday and that the Canadian appeared relatively relaxed.Carney, who took office last year, visited China in January as part of his global effort to broaden Canada’s export markets to reduce trade reliance on the US.“Global Affairs Canada (GAC) is aware of a decision issued by the supreme people’s court of the People’s Republic of China in Mr Robert Schellenberg’s case,” Canadian foreign ministry spokesperson Thida Ith said in a statement.Ith said the ministry “will continue to provide consular services to Mr Schellenberg and to his family”, adding: “Canada has advocated for clemency in this case, as it does for all Canadians who are sentenced to the death penalty.”Key sectors of the Canadian economy have been hammered by US president DonaldTrump’s tariffs, and Carney has said Canada can no longer count on the US as a reliable trading partner.Carney says that despite ongoing tensions, including allegations of Chinese interference in Canadian elections, Ottawa needs a functioning relationship with Beijing to safeguard its economic future.When in Beijing last month, Carney metChinese leader Xi Jinpingandheralded an improved era in relations, saying the two countries had struck a “new strategic partnership” and a preliminary trade deal.Global Affairs Canada did not comment on whether diplomacy during Carney’s visit related to Schellenberg’s case impacted the Chinese court decision.“Due to privacy considerations, no further information can be provided,” Ith said.Zhang said Carney’s visit raised his hopes that the Chinese court would announce a relatively positive outcome for his client.Meng, who had initially been charged with scheming to evade US sanctions on Iran – which she denied – was freed in September 2021.Spavor and Kovrig were released the same month.Explore more on these topicsChinaCanadaTrump tariffsXi JinpingAsia PacificAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

But they are also endangering livesGet ourbreaking news email,free appordaily news podcastLuca IttimaniandIma CaldwellSat 7 Feb 2026 18.45 ESTFirst published on Fri 6 Feb 2026 19.26 ESTShareAfter the Sydney Harbour Bridge wasswarmed by 40 or so ebikesand e-motorcycles on Wednesday, the Australian government said the country faced a “real emergency”.“[Illegal ebikes] are a total menace on the road,” the health minister, Mark Butler, said on Friday.“Kids have done stupid things on bikes ever since the penny-farthing [but] the injuries that are coming into our hospital emergency departments are absolutely devastating.“We’ve got to make sure we stop these things coming into the country [and] police are given the powers to crack down, to take them away, to crush them, to destroy them.”Ebikes have been hailed as a climate-friendly solution to city traffic congestion, transport emissions and even youth social media addiction, offering Australians a means to get more exercise and save money.But they have come with a cost – and even taken lives.The state of New South Wales recorded 226 injuries related to ebikes in 2024. In just the first seven months of 2025, that had already to surged to 233 injuries plus four deaths.The rest of Australia has faced the same issue, with legal ebikes involved in 239 crashes in 2025 in Queensland, four of which were fatal, according to preliminary police data.View image in fullscreenBen Boucher, 16, and friends on ebikes at Manly beach.Photograph: Andrew Quilty/The GuardianFor teenagers such as Ben Boucher, 16, ebikes have become a source of independence. Boucher bought his in late 2025 with savings from a part-time job. Most of his grade has started riding to school, cutting commutes to just 10 minutes, he says.“It’s just easier to get around,” the Manly student says. Suddenly everyone seems to have one: “[there’s] so much hype”, he says.But he is also aware of the dangers. “I see these tiny kids riding them and I think that’s dangerous because they don’t understand road rules or anything,” Boucher says.View image in fullscreenEbike riders at Manly beach.Photograph: Andrew Quilty/The GuardianFrancisco Furman, owner of Manly Bikes, in Sydney’s north, says sales began to surge in 2022. But after yet another death in December, this time on a rental-share ebike, the normally busy Christmas period went quiet.“We had a lot of cancellations, which is really affecting our business in a big way, we hold less stock,” he says.‘Close the barn door’The NSW premier, Chris Minns, has said governments are “trying to close the barn door” on the ebike boom, with close to a million of these machines already on Sydney streets.Industry experts attribute the boom partly to the federal government’s relaxation of import standards in 2021. Those standards were tightened again in late 2025, meaning road-legal ebikes will be required to have motors that only activate when the rider is pedalling and are restricted to speeds of 25km/h and power of 250 watts. NSW, which had permitted power as high as 500 watts, has cut that back to 250 watts.Tadana Maruta, owner of inner-Sydney shop PedL, says plenty of customers are satisfied with safer, low-powered legal ebikes, but those who have tried high-speed devices would be reluctant to swap.“They’re not trying to break the law, they’re just normal people that walk in the door and they say … ‘I don’t want it, it’s too slow,” Maruta says.“You put the drugs into the community and now people have tasted it, and now you want to take it out. It’s too late.”He says ebikes can still be tuned to run at higher speeds, like cars, regardless of their engine’s wattage.View image in fullscreenSchoolboys on ebikes at Manly beach.Photograph: Andrew Quilty/The Guardian“All it takes is one clever kid, and there’s always one clever kid that will be able to do that,” he says.Customers could also continue to buy ebikes that go faster than 25km/h and have high-powered throttles or no pedals at all, which are illegal on public roads but permitted on private property. .Such products have outsold the 25km/h road-safe versions, Maruta says. Retailers warn customers not to take them on streets but those warnings are widely ignored.Illegal bikes and e-motorbikes joined the Harbour Bridge rideout, and accounted for more than half of the ebikes intercepted in a Melbourne police operation in August.“There is a clear lack of understanding, or blatant disregard, for compliance,” the Victoria police assistant commissioner Glenn Weir said at the time.Enforcement and educationIn a bid to keep ebikes behaving like bicycles and not motorbikes, police powers to test and impound illegal devices will be expanded in NSW, the state’s transport minister, John Graham announced on Sunday,“Illegal bikes will end up as a twisted wreck so they can’t rejoin the road,” Graham said.“If you are breaking the rules, and your bike does not meet the very clear specifications of a pedal-assisted e-bike, expect it to be removed from your possession and crushed.Western Australia police began moving to strip overpowered ebikes from streets in 2025, with more than 30 seized and crushed in January.Calls have also grown to crack down on “rideouts” like that on the Harbour Bridge, at a north Sydney golf course and through Melbourne’s Docklands district.Group cycling events grew popular in Australian cities amid the Covid pandemic, often run for and by urban teenage boys and promoted on social media. Attendance swelled from dozens to hundreds.Natalie Ward, the deputy leader of NSW’s opposition, has demanded “ebikie gangs” be barred from the streets.Regular riders such as Brookvale couple Kieran and Elle sympathise with this view.“They’re giving us a bad name,” says Kieran, travelling to dinner with his four- and one-year-olds strapped into the kids’ seats.“We would never go over around 20 km/h, we just want to come down for a cruise on a Friday night.”View image in fullscreenTyler and his sons Ellis, 8, and Sage, 5, on their way home on an ebike after school at Manly Cove.Photograph: Andrew Quilty/The GuardianDaz, who works with rideout organiser Bike Life Australia, says police had started surrounding gatherings to issue move-on orders and fines in bulk.“There’s an energy when you ride in a pack like that, doing tricks with your friends,” says Daz, who declined to share his surname. “The boys need it, it helps them get out.”Bike Life is working to coordinate more closely with police, Daz says.Heavy-handed enforcement should be the last resort, according to Bicycle NSW, which is calling for teenagers, parents and retailers to be taught the laws. The advocacy organisation is trialling an education program in hundreds of schools with the aim of rolling it out across the state.Max*, a 15-year-old Sydney student, recalls a class where he cracked one egg with a model helmet, then another without, and observed the difference.“I was just like, ‘man, I don’t want that to be my head’,” says Max, who asked to remain anonymous.He unlocked his DiroDi Gen 4 fat tyre bike as soon as he got it in January but says he does not ride at high speed out of concern for his safety.He says that concern is not shared by some of his classmates or their parents.“I’m just wondering, like, do these people’s parents know they’re giving their 14-year-old kid a bike that can go over 50 km/h?” he says.* not his real nameExplore more on these topicsElectric vehiclesTransportBusinessCycling (News)Cycling (Life and style)newsShareReuse this content"

Both denied any wrongdoing.View image in fullscreenExamples of emails between Jack Lang and Jeffrey Epstein taken from documents published by the US Department of Justice.Photograph: Nguyen Van Hai-Barbier/Jean Pierre/Abaca/ShutterstockLang’s departure is the latest example of thefallout in Europefrom files released on 30 January by the US Department of Justice, many of which showed Epstein’s social, networking and financial links. Lang is the most high-profile public figure in France caught up in thelatest release of private messagesfrom the convicted sex offender.Lang was culture minister under the Socialist president François Mitterrand in the 1980s and 90s, and oversaw major modern architectural projects such as the building of the Louvre Pyramid. Since 2013, he has headed the Institut du Monde Arabe, or Arab World Institute, a cultural and research institution that promotes understanding of the Arab world and is supervised by the French foreign ministry.Lang was shown in the Epstein files corresponding intermittently with the financier between 2012 and 2019, when Epstein died by suicide in jail.Lang was mentioned more than 600 times in the files, according to news agencies. His daughter was also repeatedly mentioned.Caroline Lang resigned this week from France’s Union of Independent Producers after the emails showed she had founded an offshore company with Epstein in 2016 to invest in the work of young artists. She said she had resigned from that offshore company when further allegations were made against Epstein in 2019. She denied any wrongdoing.Caroline Lang also appeared in Epstein’s will as a beneficiary of €5m, according to the French investigative websiteMediapart. She told the French public broadcaster France 2 this week that she had never heard of the will and had never seen any such document or received any funds.Jack Lang has denied any wrongdoing, saying he was “shocked” that his name appeared in the statutes of the offshore company in 2016 and that he had appealed to Epstein only as a philanthropist.View image in fullscreenJack Lang in January.Photograph: Martin Lelievre/AFP/Getty ImagesLaurent Merlet, a lawyer for Jack and Caroline Lang, told Agence France-Presse: “There has been no movement of funds … But I think it is normal for the justice to want to verify this.” He said Caroline Lang was “serene” because she had received no funds.In a defence used by other Epstein associates, Lang insisted he was unaware of Epstein’s criminal behaviour despite his conviction in 2008 for soliciting a minor for prostitution.“How could a man so courteous, so charming, so generous have perpetrated such abominations?” Lang told the French public broadcaster, France 2, this week. He said he had been shocked to learn of the allegations against Epstein in 2019.A video showed Lang with Epstein in front of the Louvre pyramid in Paris in March 2019, months before he was charged with sex trafficking girls as young as 14.Resignations, denials and excuses: Epstein fallout hits some harder than othersRead moreLe Monde newspaper and Mediapart, which investigated the files, said no documents released by the US justice department suggested either Lang or his daughter had been implicated in Epstein’s sex crimes.Earlier this week, Lang had insisted he would not resign, despite calls for him to quit from all parties, including his own.Lang has said he was introduced to Epstein by the American actor and director Woody Allen.Epstein owned a vast apartment in the west of Paris and was a frequent visitor to the French capital before his death in prison in 2019.Explore more on these topicsFranceJeffrey EpsteinEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Both made refuelling stops at Shannon airport in the west of Ireland.Dezer’s family property company has built a series of Trump-branded residential towers in Miami. He recently spoke of his “love” for the US president, with whom he claims to have had a 20-year friendship.Some of those onboard the flights on Dezer’s jet said they had their wrists and ankles shackled for the duration of the journey. After arriving in Tel Aviv, they appear to have been taken to the Israeli-occupiedWest Bank.The Irish government said in a statement that as the flights stopped in the country for “non-traffic purposes” and were “not picking up or setting down passengers” they did not require prior approval from its transport department.However, on Friday, opposition politicians expressed concern to theIrish Timesabout the practice.Duncan Smith, foreign affairs spokesperson for the Labour party in Ireland, said: “It is absolutely reprehensible that any ICE deportation flights would be allowed stop and refuel in Shannon. The taoiseach and minister for transport must intervene and ensure this ends.” He added: “Ireland cannot in any way be complicit in these ICE flights.”Roderic O’Gorman, leader of the country’s Green party, said that it was “deeply disturbing” to learn “that Shannon is being used to facilitate the cruel actions of Donald Trump’s ICE”.Patricia Stephenson, foreign affairs spokesperson for the Social Democrats, said the government “must make a statement on whether it knowingly facilitated these flights”. She told the Irish Times that she believed the human rights of those onboard had been violated.Dezer’s aircraft was chartered via Journey Aviation, a company based in Florida that is regularly used by the US authorities to source private jets. It declined to comment on the flights to Israel.According to Human Rights First (HRF), which tracks deportation flights, Dezer’s jet – which he has described as his “favourite toy” – was first chartered for removal flights last October. The organisation said the plane had been used to fly detainees to Kenya, Liberia, Guinea and Eswatini, before its recent trips to Israel.One of those onboard the first flight was Maher Awad, 24. Originally from the West Bank, he has lived in the US for almost a decade. He has a partner and baby in Michigan.“They dropped us off like animals on the side of the road,” Awad said. “We went to a local house, we knocked on the door, we were like: ‘Please help us out’.”In an email, Dezer told the Guardian he was “never privy to the names” of those who travelled onboard his jet when it was privately chartered by Journey, or the purpose of the flight. “The only thing I’m notified about is the dates of use,” he said. He did not respond to further questions about the use of his jet by the Trump administration to deport Palestinians through Israel.Aviation industry sources have estimated the flights would have cost ICE between $400,000 and $500,000.A spokesperson for the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not answer questions about the deportation flights to Israel, but said: “If a judge finds an illegal alien has no right to be in this country, we are going to remove them.

The Ukrainian president also told reporters that both sides had been invited to further talks next week.Zelenskyy said theTrump administration“will probably put pressure” on Ukraine and Russia to end the war by the beginning of the summer. “They say they want to get everything done by June,” he said.“They will do everything to end the war and they want a clear schedule of all events.”He told reporters that if the new deadline of June was not met, Washington would probably put pressure on both sides to meet.Before Donald Trump took office, he promised to “end the war in 24 hours”. Later, his special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, suggested both sides could reach an agreementwithin 100 days of Trump’s inauguration.After this failed to occur, the US president set anew deadline for a dealin August last year, which also passed without any sign of peace, and in December he said a draft agreement to end the war was nearly “95% done”.Ukraine war briefing: Russia launches ‘massive attack’ on energy sites, triggering widespread blackoutsRead moreTwo days of US-led peace talks to end the war took place this week in Abu Dhabi but did not produce a breakthrough, although Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine’s presidential office, said the trilateral negotiations had been “genuinely constructive”.Zelenskyy said on Saturday that the Trump administration was proposing to host the next round of trilateral talks in the US, probably in Miami, in a week’s time. “We confirmed our participation,” he said.He hinted that the new June deadline for peace could be linked to Trump’s midterm elections campaign. “The [midterm] elections are definitely more important for them [the Americans]. Let’s not be naive.”He added: “If the Russians are really ready to end the war, then it is really important to set a deadline.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyRussiaTrump administrationUS foreign policyUS politicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

There aren’t empty spaces on the shelves with a label saying ‘waiting for British products’.”In other words, it could take years to restore Brexit losses.“Rebuilding demand will take time, effort and real focus,” he said.The analysis comes as the UK and the EU look to set up fortnightly political phone meetings toensure the negotiations over farmingand other elements of the “reset” in relations go smoothly between now and May or June, when the next leaders’ summit is scheduled.Cabinet Office and EU relations minister, Nick Thomas-Symonds, and European Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič had a bilateral on the sidelines of the trade deal review on Monday and agreed formalising talks would help nip any issue in the bud before it was too late.A government source said that while relations between Thomas-Symonds and Šefčovič were good there was a desire to formalise regular political-level negotiations in the run-up to the summit.“We want to step the political engagement up even further to iron out issues and drive forward negotiations. Both sides are keen to get positive results and keep building,” the source said.The collapse of talks over the UK’s full participation in the EU’s €150bn Safe defence programme was seen as unnecessary and a failure of statecraftThe EU had set a €2bn price tag on joining while the UK was only prepared to put in “hundreds of millions”, but many thought the gap should have been closed through political discussion given both sides agree on the need to strengthen Europe’s defence in the face of a US retreat.In the near term, the NFU is asking for the deal to ensure British farmers have sufficient time to transition to new rules that will apply to the GB market.It is also asking for certain exemptions to help safeguard areas of progress and innovation. For example, England has been faster than the EU to approve gene editing to develop disease resistant crops.“The EU is behind us, but moving in the same direction on plants. My argument to the EU is if you genuinely want to adopt this in the EU, don’t put the handbrake on the UK,” Bradshaw said.The UK outside the EU, has been able to move faster on vaccines on TB and aviation flu, for example, said Bradshaw, and has also approved some plant protection products, such as a fungicide used in cereal growing.Bradshaw says the deal should recognise the UK’s advances and if the EU is going in the same direction as the UK it should agree to “carve outs and transition arrangements”.He argues an adequate transition period is needed to prevent crops, which have been grown legally under current Great Britain rules prior to any agreement, becoming unsellable after a deal.Explore more on these topicsFarmingBrexitEuropean UnionEuropeForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

It has concluded that the Philadelphia picture was “91% negative” and that the Turin version was “86% negative”.View image in fullscreenThe version of Saint Francis of Assisi Receiving the Stigmata on display in Turin.Photograph: Heritage Images/AlamyTill-Holger Borchert, one of the leading Van Eyck scholars and director of the Suermondt-Ludwig-Museum in Aachen, said the Van Eyck findings supported scholars who had suggested that both versions were studio paintings – produced in the artist’s workshop but not necessarily by him.He said that, although he was “surprised” by the analysis, it posed further questions that needed to be explored.Dr Carina Popovici, Art Recognition’s chief executive, said that such high negative percentages for the paintings were particularly dramatic. In contrast, an analysis of another Van Eyck –The Arnolfini Portrait, which is among the most popular paintings in the National Gallery in London – said it was 89% likely to be authentic.View image in fullscreenPortrait of Giovanni Arnolfini and his Wife, by Jan van Eyck.Photograph: AlamyShe said she had also been taken aback by the findings: “I expected that, if one painting was negative, the other would be positive. But no, both came out negative.”She told the Guardian: “I’m guessing that the Philadelphia and Turin museums won’t be happy. It’s not good news on these paintings.” The Philadelphia and Turin museums have been contacted for comment. Critics have contended that a paintings’ condition and later restorations may affect such AI-based brushstroke analysis.Dr Noah Charney, an art historian who discussed the initial Philadelphia painting’s findings on hispodcast, described Art Recognition’s previous analyses as “remarkably accurate” and said that the negative result for both pictures had been so surprising that deeper tests had been conducted to confirm the results.He said he had expected that the Turin picture would be confirmed as by Van Eyck, and that the Philadelphia version would emerge as a copy, whether from the artist’s workshop or later.“The negative results suggest that both of these pictures are studio works, which may mean that we have a lost original that was more fully by Van Eyck’s hand than these two,” he said.“If a work comes out of Van Eyck’s studio, it doesn’t necessarily mean that he actually physically painted the surface level of all aspects of it,” he said on his podcast. “That’s a misconception that people get from this 19th-century idea of the lone artist in a garret in Paris drinking absinthe, smoking cigarettes, wearing a beret and doing every aspect of the work themselves.”Van Eyck is regarded as one of the pioneers of oil painting. “[Van Eyck] didn’t invent oil painting, but he perfected it so thoroughly that everyone else seemed to be working in his shadow for centuries,” Charney said. “His surfaces shimmer with light in detail so fine you need a magnifying glass to take it all in. Every stone, hair, reflection, and a glint seems to be rendered with a kind of supernatural clarity.“That ability to make the everyday luminous is why many consider him not only a great painter, but one of the great observers of reality in all of western art. And yet for all his fame, Van Eyck’s surviving oeuvre is small: fewer than 20 paintings are universally accepted as by his own hand.”The National Gallery in London is preparing to stage an exhibition of Van Eyck portraits in November.Among previous analyses, Art Recognition detected up to 40 fake paintings that were being offered oneBayin 2024. It also concluded in 2021 that Rubens’Samson and Delilahin the National Gallery was “91% negative”, supporting critics who have long doubted that it was painted by the 17th-century Flemish master.Explore more on these topicsArtJan van EyckItalyPhiladelphiaBelgiumAI (artificial intelligence)EuropenewsShareReuse this content"

There arecalls for an independent inquiryinto the number of people killed.Journalists have been told they remain targets for the Iranian security services, despite being on UK soil. Some are taking extra security measures after receiving credible death and kidnapping threats.Others have already been forced to quit because of the financial pressures placed on their relatives.One journalist, who spoke anonymously out of fear that being named would place “more pressure on my family”, said their father had been detained and warned by security forces that they were monitoring overseas journalists.“They knew everything about me somehow,” the journalist said. “They said they know where I live. They even gave my father the address, the telephone number, where I’m sitting exactly in the newsroom.“They knew which programme exactly that I was with and they said ‘we are not really happy with this programme’.” They said their family had been warned that London was not safe.View image in fullscreenIranian lawmakers in parliament. There are calls for an inquiry into the number of people killed during the unrest.Photograph: Islamic Consultative Assembly News Agency handout/EPAThere have been credible threats to Iranian journalists in the UK, including the stabbing of a reporteroutside his London home. Last year, three Iranians appeared in courtcharged with targeting UK-based journalists. They deny the charges.The situation became even more critical following Iran’s internet shutdown, whichbegan on 8 Januaryand followed nearly two weeks of anti-government protests. State authorities appear to have relaxed internet restrictions more recently, but not removed them, after theviolent suppressionof protests by the security forces.Behrang Tajdin,BBCPersian TV’s economics correspondent, said his mother was detained and asked about his work. He said he did not hear from her for three weeks during the internet blackout imposed by the government.“Some of the threats look very serious and are made by people who may not be based in Iran, so they may have the means to affect what they are saying,” he said. “Since 2022, it seems like the Iranian regime is hiring third-party criminals to try to harm Iranian journalists and activists based on UK soil.“I and many other BBC journalists may work in the same building, but we don’t lead the same sort of life in terms of being confident that we are completely safe. We have to take the situation seriously and that hasn’t abated. We need to be very, very careful.”Tajdin said family members of his colleagues had been threatened with having business licences removed or forced into early retirement.Another BBC journalist, who wished to remain anonymous, said they had to be careful when calling family members. “After these protests, they didn’t leave us,” the journalist said. “It’s not safe at all after this protest to talk very clearly.“Many of my colleagues, their families already had their assets frozen. Some have been obliged to leave the BBC. I know at least two of them left because their families have been under really big [financial] pressure and they needed the money.”The journalist said the tactic was designed to pressure them out of journalism and it left them feeling guilty. “They know how to push mental pressure,” they said. “[My family] have no choice because it’s my choice to be a journalist and be out of Iran – the pressure is on them.“This is something that I can’t really forgive myself for. Even sometimes when I’m happy, and I want to go [out] with friends to have a normal life, you feel a little bit of shame inside because you feel, OK, the family are under pressure, anything can happen to them, but I’m freely living here.”Tajdin said: “I cannot count the number of times that a colleague has come to me with teary eyes, saying: ‘My dad passed away, my mom passed away, and I couldn’t be there to say goodbye. I couldn’t be at their funeral’. Or worse than that – they’ve got a terrible terminal illness and they can’t be with them.“I can’t stress this enough – every single one of us knows that our family members in Iran are being punished on our behalf.”Explore more on these topicsIranBBCMiddle East and north AfricaJournalist safetynewsShareReuse this content"

He added that the continuance of talks depended on consultations in Washington and Tehran, but saidIranhad underlined that any dialogue required refraining from threats.Donald Trump described the talks as “very good” and said that another meeting would be held early next week. But the US president, speaking aboard Air Force One, also warned: “If they don’t make a deal, the consequences are very steep.”The talks were the first to be held between Iran and the US since Washington and Israel launched devastating military strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites and political leadership last June.Trump has in recent weeksassembled a large fleetin the region built around the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier group, after telling Iranian protesters in January that “help is on the way” during large-scale anti-government demonstrations.Iran, which has experienced intense internal unrest in which thousands of protesters have been killed in a bloody crackdown, had insisted that the talks be confined to guarantees about the civilian purpose of its nuclear programme, and not extend to human rights, its missiles, or support for proxy groups in the region including Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthi rebels in Yemen. “Our talks are solely nuclear and we do not discuss any other issues with the Americans,” Araghchi said.View image in fullscreenIran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi (centre), arriving to meet Omani negotiators in Muscat on Friday.Photograph: Omani foreign ministry/AFP/Getty ImagesThe indirect talks in Muscat were mediated by Oman’s foreign minister, Badr al-Busaidi, in separate talks between the two sides. The US team was led by Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, and the US president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.The US Centcom commander, Adm Brad Cooper, was also present, underlining how Trump has made US military leverage a central part of his diplomatic armoury.Al-Busaidi said in a statement: “These consultations focused on creating suitable conditions for the resumption of diplomatic and technical negotiations emphasising the importance of these talks and parties’ determination to succeed in achieving lasting security and stability.”Trust between Iran and the US has been minimal since the US backed the launch of Israeli military strikes on Iran only days before the two sides were due to meet for a sixth round of talks last June.“After eight turbulent months during which we went through a war, resuming a process of dialogue is not simple,” Araghchi said. “The deep mistrust that has developed on top of previous mistrust is a serious challenge. First we must overcome the prevailing atmosphere of distrust … If this trend continues, I think we can reach a good framework for an agreement”.Washington wanted to expand the talks to cover Iran’s ballistic missiles, support for armed groups in the region and “treatment of their own people” – as the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said on Wednesday. But, after days of speculation, Iranian negotiators were satisfied that only the nuclear dispute would be discussed, at least initially.Iran is betting that Trump does not have a plan for regime changeRead moreIran is seeking assurances that the US is not using the talks as a smokescreen to impose regime change.Before the talks, Tehran said the US had to drop its request for the negotiations to be held in Turkey in the presence of foreign ministers from Qatar, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.Iran says its right to enrich uranium on Iranian soil – a right it was granted in the now-defunct 2015 nuclear deal negotiated by Barack Obama – is not negotiable. The best source of compromise is that Iran agrees to suspend plans to enrich uranium for a fixed number of years, and a regional consortium is formed that enriches uranium, taking the region closer to an integrated civil nuclear programme.Iran is also seeking sanctions relief in return for a new inspections regime at its nuclear sites. The value of the rial against the dollar has halved since the Israeli attacks in June, and Iran’s plummeting standard of living, made worse by runaway food inflation close to more than 100%, was the spark for the demonstrations that broke out in late December.The talks were meanwhile being held against the backdrop of repeated warnings by Trump that he will strike Iran militarily from the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier group if no progress is made. The US has been building up its naval presence in the region after the Iranian government crackdown on protests, heightening tensions between Washington and Tehran.Tehran has said it will not hesitate to attack Israel or US military bases in the region if it is attacked. Washington last month held back from attacking Iran partly because Israel and the US military did not feel they were fully prepared to withstand the likely Iranian reprisals.Explore more on these topicsIran nuclear programmeIranUS foreign policyTrump administrationOmanMiddle East and north AfricaUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

I am a man in a hurry for justice,” he added.The second people’s inquiry symposium, held in north London on Saturday, brought together survivors, campaigners and advocates intent on establishing pathways to justice with victims’ voices at the forefront, while continuing to press the government to launch astatutory public inquiryinto the scandal.‘I’m part of this country’: Windrush man left homeless by Home Office inactionRead moreTheWindrush scandalwas brought to public attention through investigative reporting by the Guardian in 2017, which revealed thousands of legal UK residents to be mistakenly labelled as immigration offenders. Government schemes providing immigration status and compensation to those affected have since granted 17,000 people documentation and 2,600 of 8,800 claims have received compensation payments as of July 2024.Six months into Foster’s appointment, the Labour party, which has pledged to improve the government’s response, has adopted many of his recommendations for reforming the Windrush compensation scheme. But, years into the scandal, many are still struggling to navigate the process described as inefficient, bureaucratic and retraumatising.Among those still affected is Deborah, who has been supporting her brother in Barbados for decades since he has been unable to return to the UK after arriving as a Commonwealth citizen in 1966. “He didn’t leave with the intention of not coming back,” said Deborah, who asked to withhold her surname.Last year she was instructed by theHome Officeto apply for the Windrush scheme, unknown to the family as her mother did not arrive on the Windrush boat, which carried thousands from the Caribbean to the UK in 1948 and has become shorthand for the scandal. Deborah said the claim was rejected, she not having known the extent of evidence needed. In recent months, she travelled Barbados to gather documents in support of her brother’s case.“There’s so much negligence,” said Deborah. “There’s got to be a public inquiry and the voices of the victims heard and listened to and tangible things, not just apologies.”While some expressed concern on Saturday overa shift in Labour’s immigration policythey fear will create the “next generation of Windrush”, others such as the campaigner Garrick Prayogg said the only solution is legislative change.“If we don’t get legislation before the next general election in place, what will happen if Reform come in?” said Prayogg, calling for changes to the existing hostile environment policy that led to the scandal.WhilePatrick Vernon, who led a parliamentary petition related to the scandal in 2018, doesn’t see the current Labour government moving toward easing existing immigration policy, he said there are other changes as well as legislation, including a public inquiry and moving the compensation scheme from the Home Office.“Why is it black people are given less money, no legal aid, less support?” said Vernon, who cited the Post Office and infected blood scandals. “Why are we being treated differently?”He added: “You get a better service with Ryanair than the Home Office.”Explore more on these topicsWindrush scandalHome OfficeRaceCommonwealth immigrationImmigration and asylumnewsShareReuse this content"

Substack takes about 10% of the revenue the newsletters make. About 5 million people pay for access to newsletters on its platform.Among them are newsletters that openly promote racist ideology. One, called NatSocToday, which has 2,800 subscribers, charges $80 – about £60 – for an annual subscription, though most of its posts are available for free.NatSocToday is understood to be run by a far-right activist based in the US and features a swastika, a symbol appropriated by the Nazi party in the 1920s to symbolise white supremacy, as its profile picture. The full name of the Nazi party was the National Socialist German Workers’ party.One of its recent posts suggests the Jewish race was responsible for the second world war and describes Adolf Hitler as “one of the greatest men of all time”. Within two hours of subscribing to NatSocToday for the purposes of this investigation, the Substack algorithm directed the Guardian’s account to 21 other profiles featuring similar content.Some of these accounts regularly share and like each other’s posts. Many have thousands of followers.Erika Drexler, a self-styled “NS [national socialist] activist” with 241 subscribers, shared posts describing Hitler as her hero and the “most overqualified leader ever”. The account is also believed to be US-based and charges $150 for an annual subscription.Ava Wolfe, who has 3,000 subscribers and calls herself an “archivist of articles and videos about history in particular WW2” appears to be based in the UK. She has a profile which features swastikas and other Nazi imagery. An annual subscription to her Substack costs £38.Much of the content Wolfe posts engages in Holocaust denial. About 6 million Jews died in the Holocaust, but she falsely claimed earlier this month that doctors had found that “no one was deliberately murdered by Germans” and that “death was from disease and starvation only”.It is unclear if Drexler and Wolfe have used their real identities to post their material, or if they write under pseudonyms.Another account, entitled Third Reich Literature Archive, with 2,100 subscribers, shared postcards purporting to be from a Nazi propaganda rally in Nuremberg in 1938, the year before the second world war began. It also charges $80 a year for a premium subscription.The Guardian account was shown separate posts that promoted conspiracy theories about Jewish power and influence and suggested antisemitism was a myth.The algorithm also promoted other extremist content, including newsletters relating to the “great replacement” conspiracy theory – the suggestion that there is a plot to replace white Europeans with people from other races.There has been a sharp increase in antisemitism and Islamophobia since the beginning of the Israel-Gaza war in October 2023. Two men were killed when a synagogue in Heaton Park, Manchester, was attacked on the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur in October last year. Fifteen people were shot dead as they celebrated Hanukah at Sydney’s Bondi Beach in December.View image in fullscreenThe Substack of a user who calls themselves White Rabbit.Photograph: SubstackThe chief executive of theAntisemitismPolicy Trust, Danny Stone, said harmful online content often inspired real-life attacks.As examples, Stone cited the racially motivated murder of 10 African Americans in Buffalo, New York, in 2022; a synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 2018 in which 11 people were killed and the 2017 attack on a mosque in Finsbury Park, north London, in which one person was killed and several injured.“People can be, and are, inspired by online harm to cause harm in real world,” he said. “The terrorist who attacked Heaton Park synagogue didn’t wake up one morning and decide to kill Jews; he will have been radicalised.“Algorithmic prompts and the amplification of harmful materials is extremely serious. The Online Safety Act was supposed to address the illegal content but very little is being done about so-called legal but harmful content.”Stone also expressed concern about online disinformation about the Holocaust.“There has been a drop in attendance and take-up of Holocaust memorial events,” he said. “We know that knowledge already was frighteningly low.“When you have Holocaust denial, inversion or comparisons, you are seeing, across the board, a diminishing of the memory of the Holocaust. As we are further away, with fewer survivors, the facts can get lost.“We have to win the battle for that narrative. This online content does extreme damage because if we fail to learn the lessons of that past, we’re doomed to repeat it.”View image in fullscreenNatSocToday has 2,800 subscribers and charges $80 – about £60 – for an annual subscription, though most of its posts are available for free.Photograph: SubstackA spokesperson for the Holocaust Educational Trust said: “Material like this that spreads conspiracy theories and Holocaust denial and which praises Hitler and the Nazis is not new but clearly its reach is increasing. The idea that Substack profits from this hateful material and allows for it to be boosted via their algorithm is a disgrace.“We are acutely aware of the passage of time which moves us further away from the events of the Holocaust, and eyewitnesses to this history are becoming fewer in number. At the same time, antisemitism is increasing – this extremism needs to be exposed, challenged and stamped out.”Joani Reid, the Labour chair of the all party parliamentary group against antisemitism, said she planned to write to Substack and Ofcom to ask them to address the Guardian’s findings. She said antisemitism was “spreading with impunity” and getting worse.“We need to hold these tech companies to account because there are real-life consequences to this,” she said. “Jewish people have been complaining about this for years – saying this violence online is going to end in violence offline and that is exactly what has happened. We need to start taking this stuff far more seriously.”Substack was contacted for comment but did not respond.Launched in 2017, the platform has previously faced criticism for hosting newsletters that promote extremist views. Its co-founder, Hamish McKenzie addressed its decision to host Nazi content in one of his own posts on the site in 2023.“I just want to make it clear that we don’t like Nazis either – we wish no one held those views,” he wrote. “But some people do hold those and other extreme views. Given that, we don’t think that censorship (including through demonetising publications) makes the problem go away – in fact, it makes it worse.“We believe that supporting individual rights and civil liberties while subjecting ideas to open discourse is the best way to strip bad ideas of their power. We are committed to upholding and protecting freedom of expression, even when it hurts.”McKenzie also said the site’s content guidelines “do have narrowly defined proscriptions, including a clause that prohibits incitements to violence”.Get in touchContact us about this storyThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

But last week, one hearing was momentarily interrupted by an unlikely and comic intervention.As one legal professional addressed the bench, the voice of Tom Holland, host of the popular podcast The Rest is History, boomed out through the court’s microphone system, delivering a satirical impersonation of the late US president Jimmy Carter.One of the judges inadvertently pressed play on an episode of the Rest is History on his phone, which then played into the courtroom microphones.‘We’re insanely hubristic’: how The Rest Is History became the world’s biggest history podcastRead moreAs proceedings were being recorded, the moment was captured and quickly circulated online. As the theme song plays and gets louder, the lawyer starts to laugh, while Lord Briggs, one of the judges, appears to look down at his phone.“The Rest Is History. It was switched to silent, do carry on,” he said, prompting laughter in the courtroom.The clip was quickly shared by the podcast’s social media team with the caption: ‘What was Jimmy Carter doing in the supreme court last week?’A supreme court spokesperson confirmed that the video is genuine. They added: “Lord Briggs switched off his phone quickly and apologised to the court.”The history podcast, hosted by Holland and Dominic Sandbrook, has more than 600 main episodes. Holland’s enthusiastic and occasionally wayward impressions are a regular feature of the show, which has over 20m monthly downloads.View image in fullscreenThe Rest Is History podcast is hosted by Tom Holland, left, and Dominic Sandbrook, right.Photograph: Chris Floyd/PAFans reacted online to the unlikely appearance of Holland’s voice, posting on social media. One said: “Of ALL of the impressions that could’ve played, of course it was the most accurate one.”Another usersaid: “They couldn’t have picked a better intro. Imagine their shock when they heard Jimmy Carter resurrected from the dead.”The Rest Is History launched in 2020 when Goalhanger – Gary Lineker’s podcast company – approached Holland to make a history podcast.“They couldn’t work out who I should be paired with and, idiotically, I suggested Dominic,” Holland said in aninterview with the Guardian. Sandbrook replied: “Yeah, you regret that now, mate.”Speaking about the popularity of the podcast, Sandbrook said: “The truth is, history is quite embattled as a discipline. Lots of historians would probably say anything that tries to spark public interest must be a good thing … we wouldn’t have the number of listeners we have if people didn’t find history completely gripping.”Holland and Sandbrook’s project is part of a wider network of podcasts under the Goalhanger umbrella, including The Rest Is Politics, The Rest Is Science and The Rest Is Football.Previous guests of The Rest Is History includes Stephen Fry, who spoke about his fascination with Greek mythology, as well as Michael Wood, Mary Beard, Sir Ian Kershaw, William Dalrymple, and Marc Andreessen.Explore more on these topicsUK supreme courtPodcastingnewsShareReuse this content"

Her death and the killing of another Minneapolis resident, Alex Pretti, just weeks later have stoked outrage nationwide overDonald Trump’s immigration crackdown.Scores of protesters gathered across the street from the Bishop Henry Whipple federal building around midday, throwing bottles and sex toys at a line of police guarding the property. TheMinnesotaStar Tribune reported that officers arrested a handful of protesters after the crowd starting throwing chunks of ice. A deputy was hit in the head, and a squad vehicle’s windshield was smashed, according to a statement the newspaper obtained from the Hennepin county sheriff’s office.Police declared the gathering unlawful and ordered protesters to leave. Many complied, the Star Tribune reported, but about 100 remained in a standoff with deputies, state troopers and state conservation officers.Video circulating onsocial mediashows several protesters being forced to the ground and taken into custody. One person, as they appear to be placed in handcuffs, says: “I was here delivering pizza for the protesters. I had no idea that this was happening. I moved to the side of the curb when they started rushing everyone and now they’re arresting me. I am a peaceful protester delivering pizza and they’re arresting me.”No one from the sheriff’s office responded to email, voicemail and text messages from the Associated Press on Saturday afternoon requesting a copy of the statement and inquiring about how many people were arrested, whether anyone was injured and what led up to the arrests.Meanwhile on Saturday, hundreds of people gathered on a snow-covered field in aMinneapolispark to honor Good and Pretti. Event organizers echoed recent criticisms of the immigration crackdown across Minnesota, characterizing it as a federal occupation.A Lakota spiritual leader, Chief Arvol Looking Horse, led a ceremony at the front of the crowd filled with people holding signs and American flags. Others shared music and poetry to honor the two people who have become central figures in the polarizing immigration debate in recent weeks.A federal immigration officer shot and killed Good , a 37-year-old mother of three, in her car in Minneapolis on 7 January. Three agents surrounded her Honda Pilot SUV on a snowy street a few blocks from Good’s home. Bystander video show an officer approaching the SUV, which was stopped across the middle of the road, demanding the driver open the door and grabbing the handle.The vehicle began to pull forward and a different ICE officer standing in front of it pulled his weapon and immediately fired at close range, jumping back as the vehicle moved toward him. The Trump administration has painted Good as a domestic terrorist who tried to run over an officer with her vehicle. State and local officials have rejected that characterization.Pretti was killed on 24 January during a scuffle with immigration officers on the street. Bystander video shows a half-dozen officers taking Pretti to the ground. One spots Pretti’s gun, which he was licensed to carry, and shouts: “He’s got a gun.” Two officers then open fire.The Trump administration’s border czar, Tom Homan, on Wednesday announced the administration would pull 700 immigration officers from Minnesota – roughly a quarter of the officers deployed to the state – after state and local officials agreed over the past week to cooperate by turning over arrested immigrants. Homan did not say when the administration would end its crackdown in the state, however.Good’s wife, Becca Good, issued a statement Saturday saying that the immigration effort is hurting people in Minneapolis and no one knows their names.“You know my wife’s name and you know Alex’s name, but there are many others in this city being harmed that you don’t know – their families are hurting just like mine, even if they don’t look like mine,” Becca Good said in the statement. “They are neighbors, friends, co-workers, classmates. And we must also know their names. Because this shouldn’t happen to anyone.”Marina Dunbar contributed reporting.Explore more on these topicsMinneapolisProtest (US)ICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)MinnesotaUS immigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Lewis, who did not appear on the all-staff meeting during which the cuts were announced, has faced criticism for his absence and leadership.“All – after two years of transformation at TheWashington Post, now is the right time for me to step aside,” Lewis wrote in an untitled email to Post staffers obtained by the Guardian. “I want to thank Jeff Bezos for his support and leadership throughout my tenure as CEO and Publisher. The institution could not have a better owner.”Lewis then addressedsome of the criticism that the Posthas received in recent days, including from many current employees. At least 300 journalists were cut from the Post’s newsroom in one of the largest round of layoffs in American media history.“During my tenure, difficult decisions have been taken in order to ensure the sustainable future of The Post so it can for many years ahead publish high-quality nonpartisan news to millions of customers each day,” Lewis wrote, signing off: “With gratitude, Will.”Jeff D’Onofrio, who only joined the Post in June as chief financial officer, will serve as acting publisher and chief executive.“This is a challenging time across all media organizations, and The Post is unfortunately no exception,” D’Onofrio wrote in a memo to staffers. “I’ve had the privilege of helping chart the course of disrupters and cultural stalwarts alike. All faced economic headwinds in changing industry landscapes, and we rose to meet those moments. I have no doubt we will do just that, together.“I’m honored to take the helm as acting Publisher and CEO to lead us into a sustainable, successful future with the strength of our journalism as our north star,” he wrote. “I look forward to working shoulder to shoulder with all of you to make that happen.”Bezos, who has owned the Post since 2013, and who has received heavy criticism in recent days for his stewardship of the publication, released a statement touting the Post and its new leadership team – without addressing Lewis’s tenure overseeing the company.“The Post has an essential journalistic mission and an extraordinary opportunity. Each and every day our readers give us a roadmap to success. The data tells us what is valuable and where to focus,” Bezos said. “Jeff, along with [executive editor Matt Murray] and [opinion editor Adam O’Neal], are positioned to lead The Post into an exciting and thriving next chapter.”During an interview last week,Murray defended Lewiswhen asked about his absence. “Look, Will has been engaged with me very closely on this for a long time,” Murray told Fox News. “And there were a lot of things that the company did and Will was engaged with all across the company, and I wasn’t. He had a lot of things to tend to today.”Lewis also faced criticism when a former Post sports reporterpublished a photo of himat the festivities for Sunday’s Super Bowl, even after the Post largely destroyed its sports section, laying off writers who cover football.Lewis, 56, joined the Post after a lengthy career working for Rupert Murdoch’s media properties. Most recently, Lewis had spent six years as chief executive officer and publisher of the Wall Street Journal, departing in 2020.Lewis began his career as a journalist at the Financial Times. After working as business editor at the Sunday Times and editor in chief of the Telegraph from 2005 to 2010, Lewis was appointed group general manager at what was then called News International.He played a key role in handling the aftermath of the hacking scandal that enveloped Murdoch’s UK media properties as part of the company-created management and standards committee that handled the company’s interactions with police investigating the allegations. Lewis said upon joining the Post that he did not plan to discuss his role in the aftermath of the hacking scandal any further.His departure was celebrated by some current and former Post journalists who spoke with the Guardian.“Will can put on British charm and knows how to manage up but eventually results matter,” said Glenn Kessler, a former Post journalist who has been critical of the paper’s leadership. “Every initiative he launched failed and he never found a way to boost readers for the Post.”“Will Lewis’s exit is long overdue. His legacy will be the attempted destruction of a great American journalism institution,” said the union representing most Post employees. “But it’s not too late to save The Post. Jeff Bezos must immediately rescind these layoffs or sell the paper to someone willing to invest in its future.”Explore more on these topicsWashington PostWill LewisNewspapersUS press and publishingNewspapers & magazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

He was 47.The band said in a statement on Saturday that Arnold “passed away peacefully, surrounded by loved ones, in his sleep after his courageous battle with cancer”.3 Doors Down formed in Mississippi in 1995 and four years later received a Grammy nomination for the breakout hit Kryptonite. Arnold wrote the song in math class when he was 15 years old, according to the band statement.Their debut album, The Better Life, sold more than 6m copies. A second Grammy nomination came in 2003, for the song When I’m Gone.The band said Arnold “helped redefine mainstream rock music, blending post-grunge accessibility with emotionally direct songwriting and lyrical themes that resonated with everyday listeners”.3 Doors Down released six albums, most recently Us and the Night in 2016. Singles included Loser, Duck and Run and Be Like That, which appeared on the soundtrack for the 2001 film American Pie 2.While promoting their fifth album, Time of My Life, Arnold said he considered himself lucky to have carved out a career in the music business.“If you do something as long as we’ve done it, you can’t help but get better at it, you know?” Arnold told the Associated Press in 2011.In 2017, 3 Doors Down performed at the first inauguration concert of Donald Trump.Arnold announced his cancer diagnosis last May, saying clear cell renal carcinoma had metastasized to his lungs. The band was forced to cancel a summer tour.“His music reverberated far beyond the stage, creating moments of connection, joy, faith, and shared experiences that will live on long after the stages he performed on,” the band said.Explore more on these topicsUS newsnewsShareReuse this content"

She now joins a field that includes former reality television personality Spencer Pratt, Housing NowCaliforniadeputy director Rae Huang, veteran city engineer Asaad Alnajjar and the incumbent mayor, Karen Bass.During her remarks, Raman said she is concerned that the city “is no longer a place of opportunity”.Three dead and six hurt after driver hits cyclist and crashes car into LA storeRead more“Los Angeles is at a breaking point, and people feel it in the most basic ways,” she said. “Housing costs are forcing families out of the city, a homelessness system that lacks clear ownership and accountability is leaving people stuck in crisis while the city cycles from emergency to emergency. Too many people don’t feel safe walking down their own blocks at night, even as crime comes down because broken street lights stay broken and the city can’t seem to manage the basics.”She continued: “And while everyone agrees we need more housing, the city still struggles to lead with urgency, building too little too slowly while working families get priced out over and over again.”Raman also argued that Los Angeles needs a mayor who will hold city departments accountable, plan ahead for emergencies, and push for increased housing supply and affordability. During her tenure on the city council, she has focused on rent stabilization and efforts to address homelessness.Her entry into the race sets up what could be a strong challenge to Bass, who is running for a second four-year term. The incumbent hasfaced scrutinyrecently over her handling of the historic wildfires that burned parts of LA early last year.Raman has previously been a close ally of Bass and was the first council member elected with backing from the Democratic Socialists of America, which achieved amajor winlast fall with the election of New York City’s new mayor, Zohran Mamdani.At the same time, she has established strong connections with leaders in theYimbymovement, which has advocated for expanding housing production through measures such as upzoning single-family neighborhoods and revising Measure ULA, the so-called mansion tax applied to property sales of $5.3m or more.Raman’s last-minute decision to run comes at the end of what has been one of the most volatile mayoral filing periods in Los Angeles in decades. Her announcement followed closely after LA county supervisor Lindsey Horvath opted not to enter the race, choosing instead to focus on her bid for a second term on the board of supervisors.Horvath made her decision public a day before the deadline to file a declaration of intent for the 2 June primary, becoming the third potential contender in two days to rule out a challenge to Bass.Earlier in the week, former Los Angeles unified school district superintendent Austin Beutner and billionaire developer Rick Caruso also announced that they would not be running.The mayoral race comes as ongoing immigration raids by the Trump administrationhave agitatedthe city, making it an issue at the forefront of voters’ minds. Bass has described the raids as “an attack from our own federal government” and an affront to cities and people across the US.Explore more on these topicsLos AngelesUS politicsCaliforniaWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

It values SpaceX at $1tn and xAI at $250bn, with a stock market flotationexpected in Juneto time with Musk’s birthday and a planetary alignment.However, there are questions over the deal, such as whether it is good for SpaceX’s non-Musk shareholders and whether the technological premise behind it can succeed.Why is Musk linking up rockets and AI?For Musk, a key part of the deal’s rationale is to move datacentres – the central nervous system of AI tools – into space.AI companies are too dependent on earth-bound datacentres that carry immense energy demands, Musk argued this week. The solution, he says, is to put as many as a million satellites into orbit to form vast, solar-powered datacentres.Prof Julie McCann and Prof Matthew Santer, the co-directors of the school of convergence science in space, security and telecoms at Imperial College London, say solar-powered datacentres could be a future option for AI companies. However, there are limits to how much compute power can be mustered by current satellites, they say, so it would need a “planet-wide distributed computer composed of many satellites” – as envisioned by Musk.But even executing the concept might be affected by the quality of connection between the orbiting devices, which will need to operate in tandem in order to replicate terrestrial datacentres as they beam their outputs down to Earth.View image in fullscreenSpaceX launches Starlink satellites from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in October 2025.Photograph: Joe Marino/UPI/ShutterstockThere are other problems to be ironed out, they add, including solar radiation and maintenance. “Datacentres on earth are constantly maintained – component failure is normal. Shipping components to space is complex and expensive, and you would have to be innovative regarding how components are fitted.”Musk talks of these datacentres adding 100 gigawatts of AI capacity annually – currentglobal datacentre capacity is about 59GW– so his vision is ambitious. The world’s richest person believes a merger of rocket hardware and AI software is a winning combination and, in a message to employees, said it would create the “most ambitious, vertically integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth”.“This merger is aimed at creating a new path to generate a low cost of generating AI compute within the next two to three years by bringing together the top internet/space exploration company with top datacentre builders,” says Dan Ives, an analyst at the US financial services company Wedbush Securities.Does xAi need SpaceX’s financial help?Musk’s artificial intelligence company, xAi, is competing with rivals who are spending, and raising, huge sums on the infrastructure – datacentres, computer chips – needed for their products. The company, which has developed the Grok AI tool and also owns the social media network X, reportedly burned through $13bn last year and, unlike Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and Google, does not have a cash-generating legacy business to fund its efforts.View image in fullscreenElon Musk’s xAi is competing with rivals who are spending, and raising, huge sums on the infrastructure needed for their products.Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersCombining with SpaceX will give xAI better access to cash and investors, according to Ross Gerber, an investor in Tesla and SpaceX.“Musk is already running low on capital for xAI and it is competing with companies putting hundreds of billions of dollars into their AI investments. If you merge SpaceX and xAI you can support xAi because SpaceX is an extremely attractive prospect to a lot of investors,” he says.What do SpaceX shareholders think?SpaceX’s technology is complex but it is a straightforward business. It generates revenues from deploying reusable rockets for missions such as launching satellites and restocking the International Space Station. It also operates the Starlink satellite high-speed internet service. SpaceX made about $8bn in profit on $15bn to $16bn of revenue ​last year,according to Reuters.The addition of xAI adds narrative complexity to the SpaceX story, says Michael Sobel, the president and co-founder of Scenic Management, which buys secondary stakes in privately held companies and has invested in the AI company Anthropic.Sobel, who speaks to SpaceX investors regularly, says: “By folding in xAI, which carries a significant monthly cash burn, you change the financial profile of the company overnight. In the secondary market, ‘simple’ is usually rewarded. This merger requires investors to do a lot more homework on how xAI’s cash burn impacts SpaceX’s overall valuation and IPO timeline.”There is also the added burden of X, a social media platform that is a regular subject ofregulatory scrutinyandpolitical ire.Nonetheless, Sobel adds, the argument in favour of the deal is compelling.“For a long-term investor, this secures the most advanced AI ‘brain’ for the most advanced hardware ‘body’ in existence. The upside is a $1.25tn entity that controls the entire stack, from the launchpad to the neural network.”View image in fullscreenThe SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California.Photograph: Daniel Cole/ReutersGerber, who invested in Musk’soriginal buyout of X in 2022when the platform was better known as Twitter, says he welcomes the deal but is less sure about SpaceX investors.“For me as a Twitter shareholder, I could not be happier. I pretty much figured I had lost my money but that has now been parlayed into owning SpaceX shares. It’s awesome for me but if I was a SpaceX shareholder I would be pissed.”What next? A Tesla-SpaceX merger?Musk owns about 44% of the newly enlarged SpaceX business and 17% of Tesla, where he is the chief executive. Is the next step a combination of the two?Ives believes there is a “growing chance” that a one-stop shop for investing in Musk businesses will be created.  “Musk wants to own and control more of the AI ecosystem and step by step the holy grail could be combining SpaceX and Tesla,” he says.View image in fullscreenTesla vehicles in a parking area at the company’s factory in Fremont, California.Photograph: Noah Berger/APGerber believes the timing is right, with both companies currently worth $1.25tn. “This is the time to create a multitrillion-dollar company.

There have been only four Premier League seasons in whichManchester Cityand Liverpool have finished in the top two positions in the table (and one of those occasions was 2013-14 when the managers were Manuel Pellegrini and Brendan Rodgers, which is not a duel anybody is writing books or making documentaries about).Yet for most of thedecade that Pep Guardiola has been at City, it has felt that English football was defined by his struggle with Jürgen Klopp and Liverpool, and by a form of the game that developed as each learned from the other.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreKlopp has gone now and nobody would be surprised were Guardiola (and/or Arne Slot) to follow in the summer. The seasons when both clubs would soar past 90 points are past. They are in transition, recrafting their squads for a new age that is yet fully to take shape, and the rivalry is diminished as a result. Liverpool are out of the title race, and defeat at Anfield could in effect take out City as well.The issue with the Guardiola/Klopp revolution was perhaps that it was too successful. Once everybody accepted its principles, and holding them, almost no matter how efficiently you could execute them, was no longer enough. There isn’t a team in thePremier Leaguenow that isn’t at least relatively adept at pressing, often not in the remorseless fashion that became familiar in the days of peak Klopp but in short bursts in specific situations.The idea of using possession to create overloads is broadly accepted by everybody. Once a revolution has become the status quo, though, it is no longer a revolution. What comes next is the question nobody yet seems able to answer. And what’s striking is that, while many Premier League clubs have followed the example of Mikel Arteta, looking to controland set pieces, neither City nor Liverpool have.It’s just over a year since Guardiola gave the interview to TNT in which he said modern football was being played by Bournemouth, Brighton and Newcastle. That understandably drew the headlines, given it seemed in isolation to suggest that Guardiola was saying the game had become increasingly about ball-carrying rather than passing. Perhaps more telling, though, was what he said next.View image in fullscreenPep Guardiola has often had cause to be upset this season, with his team dropping points after being in the lead.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty Images“Today,” he went on, “modern football is not positional, you have to ride the rhythm, it is unbelievable, and we could not, simply we could not because we did not have the players … The teams that are playing once a week, it is another story and that doesn’t count, it counts when you are playing every three or four days.” (The pre-emptive drive-by on this season’s Manchester United was presumably accidental).This was not, in other words, some sort of recantation of faith by Guardiola, nor some sort of admission that his way of doing things was outmoded. Rather it was a practical point, a recognition that the modern calendar is too crowded to play the way he used to, the way he wants to. Guardiola has always existed in a state of perpetual evolution; his greatest strength has been his capacity to tweak, develop and hone his style of play – but his most recent adaptations have been forced on him.There is perhaps no greater example of that than the signing of Erling Haaland, the most traditional of No 9s, whose reluctance to engage with midfield possession felt like a deliberate attempt by Guardiola to introduce a creative friction, to break up the occasionally predictable patterns his football can create. Given that it brought the treble, it can be said to have worked, but the trend of buying against type has continued, although it’s unclear whether that is the work of Guardiola or Hugo Viana, who replaced Txiki Begiristain as sporting director last summer.Gianluigi Donnarumma is a commanding presence and an extremely good shot-stopper, but his relative lack of ability with his feet makes him an uncharacteristic Guardiola keeper.Rayan Cherki is technically giftedbut he plays with a freedom that is antithetical to the Guardiola desire for control. Rayan Aït-Nouri’s forward surges may be exciting but it’s hard to imagine a less typical Guardiola full-back.Familiar tale of two halves haunts Manchester City as Spurs find belated resolve | Jonathan WilsonRead moreThe makeup of the squad implied a move to playing a more traditional style, and that has materialised to an extent. City have, unusually, won four games this season with less than 50% possession; in the draw at Arsenal they had just 33% of the ball. More recently, though, Guardiola’s side have returned to something more familiar: since thechaotic 5-4 win over Fulhamin early December, City haven’t had less than 58% of the ball in any league game.If that was intended to bring control, though, it has failed. City’s attempts to employ an offside trap, redoubled since the arrival of Pep Lijnders as assistant last summer, have amplified the susceptibility to balls played in behind the defensive line. It’s not just high risk, it’s also a style that demands additional physical effort, an issue that seems contrary to Guardiola’s protests about fatigue and perhaps explains why this City team so often fade in the second half of games.View image in fullscreenHugo Ekitike was signed in the summer of 2025 when Liverpool needed midfield or defensive reinforcements more urgently.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAThe overall impression is of confusion, but Liverpool’s attempts to rejig their style have been just as muddled. It’s still not clear what vision underlay last summer’s spree. There seems to have been a general sense that it was better to focus on more technical players – and it probably is easier to bulk them up than to develop fast feet in physical monsters. But, unlessLiverpoolare set on following Leeds and Nigeria by operating regularly with a front pairing, it remains difficult to understand the logic behind signing two centre-forwards when there were such obvious deficiencies in midfield and at the back.And so what was recently the showpiece game of English football – think, perhaps especially, of their four meetings in 2017-18: a 5-0 win for City anda 4-3 win for Liverpool, followed by Liverpool’s 3-0 and 2-1 wins in the Champions League – has taken on a different cast.Two clubs who led the world, not only in terms of results but in how they played, now scratch around in the post-consensus gloom, wondering what the future may be and how they might lead it.Explore more on these topicsManchester CityInside footballLiverpoolPep GuardiolaArne SlotPremier LeaguecommentShareReuse this content"

But now he is one win from clinching the NFL titleAndrew Lawrencein San FranciscoSat 7 Feb 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 7 Feb 2026 12.37 ESTShareAdd the Guardian on GoogleFor the teams, the reality of theSuper Bowlhits like deja vu: a ritual they’ve watched and fantasized about for years suddenly arrives, sucking them into its vast, chaotic center.For Sam Darnold, though, it’s a reality come full circle. San Francisco, after all, was the city that gave him a chance after hecrashed and burned in New Yorkand washed out in Carolina, long after most around the NFL had consigned him to history’s pile of first-round draft busts.As part of the 49ers two years ago, Darnold watched from the sideline as the team’s starter, Brock Purdy,fell shortof leading San Francisco past Kansas City. But he had done enough in relief appearances to get picked up by Minnesota, where he had an unlikely bounce-back year before joining the Seattle Seahawks. Now, the Orange County native stands on the verge of closing his redemption arc in Sunday’s Super Bowl against the New England Patriots – an outcome most had long since given up on. “I grew up watching a ton of great football players and teams get to this moment and make great plays,” Darnold said earlier this week. “I was always emulating those plays in my yard with friends. I always dreamed of moments like this.”The factors that will decide the Super Bowl: a brilliant receiver, pass protection and explosive playsRead moreNew York Jets fans, too, dared to dream about returning to the Super Bowl in the lead-up to the 2018 NFL draft. Darnold’s gunslinging style and knack for making plays in chaotic situations at USC drew comparisons to Brett Favre, yet he slid to third overall because of the Browns’ recency bias for Heisman winner Baker Mayfield and the Giants’ long-term commitment to Eli Manning. “Suck for Sam”, the fans’ rallying cry the previous season, had been an unqualified triumph.Darnold had a respectable rookie season under head coach Todd Bowles, but Jets brass decided the QB would be better served by an offensive mind and hired the Miami Dolphins’ Adam Gase. But Gase’s rigid schemes and erratic play-calling only exacerbated Darnold’s raw mechanics, reducing him to fleeing defenders only he seemed to see. In 2020 Darnold posted the league’s worst completion percentage and failed to surpass 240 yards in any of his 12 starts, as the Jets managed just two wins all season. Fans went from suckingforSam to suckingwithhim, turning a Monday Night Football graphic of Darnold’s 2019 mononucleosis absence intoa tragic meme.In 2021 the Panthers traded for Darnold, but a slight improvement in play wasn’t enough to keep him from being benched over the ensuing seasons, first for a fading Cam Newton, then for Mayfield – fresh off his own departure from Cleveland. Darnold was eventually cut loose in 2023 to make way for top pick Bryce Young.Staring at the possible end of his road in theNFL, Darnold landed in San Francisco on a modest one-year deal and was immediately thrown into a camp competition with Purdy and Trey Lance. He impressed early enough that some reporters wondered whether he might actually beat out Purdy, who was still working his way back from an elbow injury. Purdy eventually shook off the rust and locked down the starting job, but Darnold’s successful overtake of Lance, a former No 3 pick himself, for the backup role was viewed as a significant step forward.In the lead-up to this year’s Super Bowl, the 28-year-old has repeatedly credited 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan with saving his career and rehabbing his game. “To have Kyle as a coach, to hear him talk about football during OTAs and training camp, when we had a ton of time with him as quarterbacks – I soaked in all of those moments,” Darnold said. “He talked about football in a way I had really never heard before.” San Francisco was also where Darnold began working with passing game coordinator Klint Kubiak, a partnership that has since been rekindled in Seattle. “He’s very honest and forthcoming,” Darnold said of the Seahawks offensive coordinator. “Myself and a lot of the guys really appreciate that about him.”After watching Purdy tighten his grip on the 49ers’ starting job during San Francisco’s Super Bowl run in the 2023 season, Darnold signed another prove-it deal with Minnesota and quickly emerged as one of the league’s best quarterbacks, racking up career highs in completion percentage (66%), passing yards (4,319) and touchdowns (35) while leading the Vikings into the playoffs – a breakout that stunned everyone who had once written him off. Darnold had hoped to remain in Minnesota and continue his progress. But the Vikings’ faith in him took a hit when he reverted to form in Minnesota’s NFC divisional clash against the Los Angeles Rams, a blowout loss that raised new questions about Darnold’s mental toughness in big games. In the end the Vikings let him walk and committed to first-round draft choice JJ McCarthy. Ask themhow that’s going.Minnesota’s loss became Seattle’s gain. Last March the Seahawks signed Darnold toa three-year deal with $55m guaranteed– far more than his skeptics believed he was worth. After seeing him confidently lead Seattle to the top of the NFC and a Super Bowl appearancewith near flawless play, those critics would be hard pressed to deny the move has paid off. “What a journey,” said Patriots quarterback Drake Maye of his opposite number. “What a career he’s had, just to battle the life of the NFL. He’s battled not playing for years, and being the backup to getting his chance and just making the most of it. It’s been awesome to see.”During Super Bowl week, reporters from Darnold’s past NFL stops made a point of wishing him well on behalf of the fanbases that had once considered him such a disappointment. He would certainly be within his rights to use his success to highlight the failings of his former teams. But for this full-circle journey, Darnold stays on the high road. “Every experience is its own,” he said, reflecting on the bumps that led to this point. “I knew I could do this at a high level, and that’s what kept me going. I knew at some point an opportunity would arise.”And he had seen it all before, of course.Explore more on these topicsSeattle SeahawksNFLUS sportsSuper Bowl LXSuper BowlfeaturesShareReuse this content"

During the opening lap of the classical section, Finland’s Vilma Nissinen fell on a downhill turn, triggering congestion in the pack. In the chaos, Diggins tumbled with Norway’s Karoline Simpson-Larsen and was forced into heavy traffic as the race began to stretch apart.“My tip just disappeared in the slush and unfortunately it was a tough spot where you lose all your momentum,” Diggins said. “A lot of things out of my control just didn’t work out for me today, but that’s OK. I’m really proud of my heart and my grit and the amount of energy and commitment I put into this, not just today but every day.”At one stage Diggins was as low as 14th place and facing a long solo effort to reconnect with the leaders, particularly with the Swedish team driving a relentless pace from the front. By the halfway transition she was already chasing a race that was slipping away.Karlsson and Andersson had raced tightly together through the classic portion in a lead group dominated by Scandinavian skiers, before breaking the race open early in the freestyle segment. Karlsson proved untouchable from there, clocking 53min 45sec and finishing 51 seconds clear of Andersson, with enough time to grab a Swedish flag before crossing the line alone. Andersson finished in 54:36 and Weng in 55:11 after a late push secured bronze.Karlsson said the scale of the moment only fully registered late in the race.“That was the moment when it hit me. I was like, OK, this is for real,” she said. “I had so much fun out there today and I am really proud of my whole team who have made this happen. The skis were super and the body felt amazing.“In the home straight, I kind of understood that I would win. It feels so nice to do it this way, with the team.”View image in fullscreenFrida Karlsson, right, and Ebba Andersson secured a one-two finish for Sweden in Saturday’s race.Photograph: Matthias Schräder/APThe race was contested on wet, energy-sapping snow under cloud cover on the Dolomite course at Tesero Cross-Country Stadium, with temperatures around 41F (5C), light winds and heavy humidity adding another layer of difficulty. Karlsson, 26, looked at ease in the conditions, executing a flawless ski exchange and steadily distancing the field. The victory marked her first individual Olympic medal after winning a relay bronze at the Beijing Games.“We’ve worked hard for many years and I’ve found my way forward together with my coach,” Karlsson said. “I’ve never been as much in love with skiing as I am now. This is a once-in-a-lifetime moment.”Jessie Diggins: ‘Eating disorders are about control when you feel like you have none’Read moreShe added: “It’s like when you throw more logs into the fire: I get hungrier and hungrier, the longer the race goes. I found a good rhythm, and then it turns into some kind of dance.”Diggins produced a trademark fightback once the race shifted to freestyle, her strongest discipline. The Minnesota native clawed back positions over the second half of the race to finish eighth, 2min 21sec behind Karlsson and 55 seconds off the podium, still emerging as the top US finisher after what could easily have become a far more difficult result.“The crash wasn’t that big of a deal to me,” said Diggins, whosefamous 2018 team sprint goldwith Kikkan Randall marked the first Olympic title in US cross-country skiing history. “Yes, I did lose some time but that wasn’t the bigger problem today, so I just kept focusing on: ‘Stay calm, work your way back and ski the best you can ski.’”Saturday’s race also marked a historic shift for the sport. For the first time in Olympic history, men and women contested equal 20km skiathlon distances, with athletes racing 10km in classic technique before switching equipment mid-race for 10km of freestyle. The event opened a cross-country program that will feature 12 medal races over the course of the Games.The result was a brutal introduction to Diggins’s final Olympic campaign after the 34-year-oldannounced she will retireat the end of the season, calling time on a 15-year career that hascompletely recalibrated expectationsfor American cross-country skiing. The most decorated US cross-country skier in history, Diggins arrived in Milan leading the World Cup standings andfresh off a dominant Tour de Ski, framing the Olympics as a chance to race with freedom and perspective.Saturday did not unfold as planned. But her recovery to finish inside the top 10 – after losing contact with the leaders in the opening minutes – served as an early reminder of the resilience that has defined her career.“I’m in the best shape of my life and my body felt really good, but there’s a lot of things that need to come together for a good ski race to happen,” Diggins said. “There’s a lot of puzzle pieces that need to lock into place and I was really encouraged by the skate [freestyle] half, but the classic half, the things out of my control did not go very well.”Diggins, who is expected to compete in all six women’s events on the cross-country slate, will have further chances to add to her career haul of three Olympic medals before bringing her career to a close on home snow at the World Cup finals next month in Lake Placid.Explore more on these topicsJessie DigginsUSA Olympic teamWinter Olympics 2026SkiingUS sportsWinter OlympicsShareReuse this content"

All the nervous apprehension, the paternalistic concern, the arch skepticism and hushed snickers that had rippled through the sports world when she announced her comeback from a six-year retirement had long since gone silent. A once-unthinkable fairytale ending at the age of 41 on the slopes of Cortina d’Ampezzo was practically within touching distance.Back in November 2024, having been chased from the sport in 2019 by a battered right knee worn down by a string of gruesome crashes and multiple surgeries, Vonn proposed a return to a high-risk sport where no woman had ever won a race past the age of 34. There’s a history of comebacks like these going brutally wrong, and even Vonn’s most dedicated fans were bracing themselves for the worst. Think a shopworn Joe Louis getting battered through the ropes and on to the ring apron by Rocky Marciano. Or Björn Borg returning to the tour in the early 90s with a wooden racket, defiantly flailing through a sport that had moved on without him.Lindsey Vonn, skiing with ruptured ACL, takes crucial step in downhill medal bidRead moreBut a funny thing happened on the way to Vonn’s presumptive humiliation. In the first two months, shefinished 14th in a super-Gat St Moritz, before improving tosixthandfourthin her next two races at St Anton. Then came this Olympic season. Vonn reached the podiumin all five World Cup downhill racesshe entered – two wins, a second place and two thirds – seizing the red bib as the discipline’s season-long leader and reestablishing herself, against all odds, as one of the fastest skiers on the planet. Conspicuously absent were the injuries and surgeries and chronic pain that had become the familiar punctuation of her career. What could go wrong only one week out from the Olympics?It turns out plenty. At last week’s final World Cup downhill before the Games, Vonnlost control after landing a jump highon the course in Crans-Montana, Switzerland, skidding sideways into the safety netting. Her airbag deployed on impact and she remained down for several moments before she was helicoptered off the course to hospital. Scans later confirmed a complete ACL rupture in her left knee, along with a bone bruise and meniscal damage.It has never come easy for Vonn, the winner of 84 World Cup races and a three-time Olympic medalist, including downhill gold in 2010. Maybe it never was supposed to for theKima Greggsof the piste: sometimes things just gotta play hard.All eyes will be on Vonn, the biggest star at the Milano Cortina Olympics, when the women’s alpine skiing begins on Sunday at the Tofane Alpine Skiing Centre, with the downhill the first of five medal events. A top-three finish would cap a remarkable comeback rendered even more improbable by the injury. It would also make history, moving her past France’s Johan Clarey – also 41 when he won downhill silver in 2022 – as the oldest Olympic alpine skiing medalist. (She became the oldest woman to medaleight years ago in Pyeongchang.) The setting only adds deeper meaning: Vonn has piled up a record 12 World Cup victories in Cortina, making it one of the defining backdrops of her career.Her shredded kneepassed the first teston Friday afternoon when she posted one of the faster times without obvious hesitation in a downhill training run. Even her coach, the two-time Olympic champion Aksel Lund Svindal, sounded cautiously impressed. “She was smart. She didn’t go all in,” he said afterward. “The rest looked like good skiing. No big risk. To me, it looked symmetrical – and that’s what we were looking for today.”Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content,click 'Allow and continue'.Allow and continueThat word –symmetrical– may be the most important medical and competitive data point of her imperiled Olympic campaign. But Svindal went further. “She’s tough,” he said. “If she skis well, she can win. From what I saw today, she could possibly bring that on Sunday.”By Saturday, the evidence had grown stronger. Vonn clocked the third-fastest time in the second downhill training session, reaching a maximum speed of 78.7mph (126.7km/h) and finishing 0.37 seconds behind leader and US teammateBreezy Johnson, another indication that Sunday’s start will be for more than a participation trophy.Winter Olympics 2026: Swiss win first gold, IOC plays down norovirus concern, and more – liveRead moreNot everyone is convinced the story is quite that simple. On Friday, an online exchange between Vonn and a sports medicine doctor briefly became its own subplot. The doctor suggested publicly that her knee might have been functioning as if the ACL were already compromised before last week’s crash – the kind of chronic tear elite athletes sometimes learn to stabilize around – framing her comeback as remarkable but perhaps not quite unprecedented.Vonn’s response was characteristically direct.“Lol thanks doc,” she wrote. “My ACL was fully functioning until last Friday. Just because it seems impossible to you doesn’t mean it’s not possible. And yes, my ACL is 100% ruptured. Not 80% or 50%. It’s 100% gone.”The chippy repartee did little to alter the competitive reality. Vonn spent the hours after Friday’s run posting video of heavy squats and box jumps, equal parts rehab update and message to anyone still wondering what the human body is built to withstand. But it’s her capacity to reset mentally that remains almost inexplicable, even after all these years. If a neurologist studied her brain, they’d likely discover aHonnoldianlack of the circuitry responsible for producing fear. Vonn would probably disagree with that framing. She just metabolizes it differently.View image in fullscreenA week after rupturing her ACL, Lindsey Vonn clocked speeds above 70mph on her downhill training runs.Photograph: Mattia Ozbot/Getty Images“I’ve never been afraid,” she said this week. “I’ve always been the kid that climbs the tree. My grandpa always called me a daredevil. That’s why I’m a downhiller. I like risk. I like going fast. I like pushing myself to the limit.”That has always been embedded in her mythology. Vonn was never the smooth, untouched prodigy gliding above the sport. She was the one who crashed, who broke, who rebuilt, who came back angrier and faster. Pain was never a detour in her career; it was the road itself.What makes this chapter different is the arithmetic. At 25, you crash out and rehab and convince yourself there is unlimited runway ahead. At 41, every race carries the faint understanding that there may not be another tomorrow. That reality has never seemed to slow her. If anything, it has sharpened the edges of everything she does: the line choice, the risk tolerance, the willingness to trust a body that has betrayed her too many times to count.The Olympics have never been the neatest chapter of her story. Vancouver was triumph. Sochi was the one that got away. Pyeongchang was grit dressed up as a swansong. Milano Cortina has become something else entirely: a reckoning with time itself.Winter Olympics briefing: opening ceremony delivers a love letter to ItalyRead moreThere is a version of Sunday where physics and biology reassert themselves and this becomes another entry in the long, unsentimental history of sport moving on from its ageing heroes. There is another where Vonn holds it together for 90 seconds on a mountain she knows as well as anyone in the world and forces the sport to reckon, one more time, with the possibility that the normal rules do not apply to her. Either outcome would be consistent with the career she has lived.The truth about Vonn was never that she was untouchable. It was that she was willing to go back to the same dangerous place, again and again, long after most people would have stopped answering the call. On Sunday, in what may be the appointment viewing of the entire Olympics, she will push out of the start gate knowing exactly what this costs. The pain. The risk. The infinitesimal margin between triumph and catastrophe. The only part that has never changed is the decision. And as long as there is a mountain in front of her, she will point herself straight down it.Explore more on these topicsLindsey VonnWinter Olympics 2026US sportsUSA Olympic teamSkiingWinter OlympicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Carey took to the stage to sing Domenico Modugno’sNel Blu, dipinto di Bluin Italian, followed by one of her own songs, Nothing Is Impossible, but many social media users quickly claimed that there were several times where her lip movements were out of time with the music.When asked directly whether Carey was lip-synching, the director of the show, Maria Laura Iascone, confirmed that there had been a pre-recording – but refused to say whether it had been used or the American had sung live.Winter Olympics briefing: opening ceremony delivers a love letter to ItalyRead more“During all the ceremonies, in order to be on the safe side, we always record,” she said. “But this is something that is practised internationally in events with high-level broadcasting.”However, she insisted she had no complaints with Carey’s performance. “Yesterday’s performance was really extraordinary,” she said, “It was fantastic for everybody and we are all satisfied by the results we had. And the images can prove it to you all, because there was magic.”Iascone confirmed that Carey had not been paid. “We believe thatMariah Careywas exceptional, as were all our artists,” she added. “She was not paid for participation as this was the condition for the opening ceremony. We were really honoured to have her with us.“We were extremely happy and satisfied with her performance, as a major talent, who has given us the possibility of representing a very joyful moment. And she also sang an Italian song, which people in the stadium felt deeply about.”A Milan-Cortina spokesperson later told the Guardian that certain elements of the opening ceremony were pre-recorded “to ensure accurate timing, sound quality and a seamless broadcast”.“The technical, logistical and organisational complexities of an Olympic ceremony are not comparable to a live performance by a single artist,” they said. “The ceremony involves coordinated choreography between multiple artists, speakers, performers and musicians, all of which must align precisely with a live global broadcast.View image in fullscreenMariah Carey was praised for singing an Italian song which pleased the locals attending at San Siro.Photograph: Piero Cruciatti/AFP/Getty Images“The operation for the Milano Cortina 2026 opening ceremony was significant. It involved more than 1,300 cast and performers over multiple locations, over 500 musicians contributing to the musical score, and more than 700 hours of rehearsals across several host venues.“For this reason, a different production model is required, in which certain elements of the ceremony are pre-recorded to ensure accurate timing, sound quality and a seamless broadcast.”The International Olympic Commitee played downthe boos for the US vice-president JD Vancein the opening ceremony, preferring instead to note the enthusiastic reception given to the USA team. However, IOC spokesperson Mark Adams said that there had been “very good chemistry” between Vance and IOC president Kirsty Coventry when they sat down to discuss the Los Angeles 2028 Olympics.“With the next games coming up in Los Angeles we are super happy, very happy that the US administration is so engaged with the games here and going forward,” Adams added. “She was very pleased about the enthusiasm of the vice-president and the whole administration for the Games, which obviously for us is an important thing.”Meanwhile, Italian police said on Saturday they suspected arsonists had struck rail infrastructure near the northern city of Bologna, triggering major disruptions to train traffic on the first full day of the Games. The fire hit a track switch and severed electrical cables used to detect train speed, causing delays of up to two hours for high-speed, Intercity and regional services at one of Italy’s busiest rail hubs.The blaze was “presumably deliberate” but had not been claimed, a spokesperson for the police said. Italy’s transport ministry called it an act of “serious sabotage“, adding that it echoed the opening day of the 2024 Summer Olympic Games in Paris, when saboteurs struck France’s high-speed TGV train network, causing travel chaos.“These actions of unprecedented seriousness do not in any way tarnish Italy’s image in the world, an image that the Games will make even more compelling and positive,” said the transport ministry, which is headed by the deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Mariah CareyWinter OlympicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s gone eight o’clock in the morning by the time the daylight has made it over the high peaks to the east, and it’s another two hours from that before the Olympic day gets under way.It’s slow out, as if everyone’s still sleeping off the night before, when the town was out cheering for the athletes as they made their parade around the square. The police are still packing away all the railings, and the street sweeps are brushing up the confetti.Non c’è fretta. No one’s in a rush. Maybe your bus will turn up, but no one’s making any promises.Winter Olympics 2026: speed skating gold for Italy, CAS upholds ban on GB skeleton helmets and more – liveRead moreFortunately, you don’t need it for the curling, which is only a short walk. They built this arena for the last Olympics here, back in 1956, when it was the venue for the figure skating competition and, like everything else around town, it’s looking very well-dressed. It’s all bare wood and black and white photographs from the 1950s.All the set dressing in Cortina has an art deco touch, the place happily back in another era, before anyone had to worry about the 21st century. It feels like a town time forgot, and which the financial crisis didn’t touch. Louis Vuitton is here, so is Prada. There’s a pop-up Dior store with an eight-foot ice sculpture out front.There are two curling fixtures at 10am, round-robin matches in the mixed doubles, two Swedish siblings are playing a married couple from Switzerland in one, and the Great British pair of Bruce Mouat and Jenn Dodds are playing another married couple from Canada on the other. The Canadians, Brett Gallant and Jocelyn Peterman, started dating after they decided to form a team to try to qualify for the Olympics inPyeongchangeight years ago. There are a lot of married couples competing in mixed curling. Must be something in all that frozen water.“Harder!” Peterman screams at Gallant as he vigorously pumps his broom, “Harder! Keep going! Keep going! Yes! Yes!” It doesn’t do them any good. Everyone else might still be figuring out what’s what on day one, but the curlers have been here for almost a week already.View image in fullscreenThe sliding centre, which overlooks Cortina d’Ampezzo, was finished just in time for the Games, but no one seems to have got around to building any facilities around it.Photograph: Al Bello/Getty ImagesTheir competitions run on so long that this one started on the Wednesday before the opening ceremony, and Mouat and Dodds have been dominating the competition. They had already won all their first five matches and after Mouat put them 3-0 with his hammer in the very first end against Canada, it was clear their winning streak was about to reach six. They eventually won 7-5.Mouat is the most-feared competitor in the sport. The 31-year-old is the one all the others talk about in awed whispers. The day before,Snoop Dogg asked him for a selfie. “I’ve heard about you,” Snoop told him. Later on, Mouat and Dodds beat the previously undefeated USA duo 8-6, too, which means they have already qualified for the semi-finals. “How many times are they playing today?” asked a German photographer when they came back out on to the ice. “And twice more tomorrow, too,” I told him. “Christ,” he replied. “This is worse than cricket.”Tune in again on Tuesday evening, when they will be playing for medals. Till then, the women’s skiathlon is three hours’ drive in one direction, the women’s ski jump three hours in another and the ice hockey, figure skating and freestyle skiing in other parts of the country altogether.But the women’s alpine is only a 15-minute bus ride out of town up into the mountains. They’re holding the third, and last, day of training runs before the women’s downhill. It’s not immediately clear that the skiing set and the curling community are a part of the same species, let alone the same sporting event.Curlingis the slowest, most meditative sport in the Olympics and despite the best efforts of a gaggle of four enthusiastic Swiss, was taking place almost entirely in silence.View image in fullscreenBritain’s Bruce Mouat and Jennifer Dodds compete against the USA’s Korey Dropkin and Cory Thiesse.Photograph: David J Phillip/APUp on the mountain, they’re pumping out House of Pain over the public address system while the women come screaming down the mountain at the sort of speeds that make you nauseous from watching.They had to cancel the first day of training because of the weather, and the fog is closing in again on Saturday, but they have time to get a handful of racers away. Everyone wants to see Lindsey Vonn, competing in her final Olympics after coming out of a five-year retirement. The 41-year-old American is racing in a brace aftershe ruptured her anterior cruciate ligament in her left kneelast week. An ACL is apparently something she can get by fine without.‘My ACL is 100% gone’: Lindsey Vonn’s improbable comeback at 41 is just another riskRead moreShe finished in 1min 38.28sec, third fastest on the day, behind her USA teammate Breezy Johnson. There was a moment when her knee buckled on an early jump. Everyone watching winced in worry. But Vonn sped on. She didn’t even seem to stop to steady herself.There may not be another sport out there where the competitors are brushing up as close against the edge of what’s possible as they seem to do in downhill skiing. Vonn’s contest against Johnson, Germany’s Emma Aicher and the great Italian Sofia Goggia, who won gold back in 2018, may just be the great race of the entire Games.Better viewing, for sure, than the men’s singles luge competition back down at the sliding centre. They finished this just in time for the Games, but no one seems to have got around to building any of the facilities around it. So the crowd tumbled up and down the hill looking for a spot to stand and watch from.For such a fast sport, it’s a very slow watch. Which might be why everyone who knows what they’re doing has started drinking already. There were two races and the competition stretched on long into the evening as the sun started to dip down back into the valley over the other side of the mountain, the way things seem around here, the nights just might be the busiest time of day.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsCurlingLindsey VonnSkiingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The medics were unable to save her, andWTVC NewsChannel 9 reportedshe had suffered a suspected stab wound as well as other injuries.The name of the woman, who was Lee’s girlfriend, has not been released and local police said her death was being treated as a homicide. Lee was also charged with tampering with evidence. WTVC reported that an affidavit said there was evidence that blood had been cleaned from several areas around the home.“Due to the condition of the victim and the residence, HCSO Criminal Investigative Services Detectives responded. Preliminary findings indicate the victim’s death was the result of a homicide,” the Hamilton County sheriff’s office said in a statement.Lee was one of the best college players in the country during his time at Ohio State, and the Jets selected him with the 20th overall pick in the 2016NFLdraft. The Jets signed him to a four-year contract that included $7.9m guaranteed but he left the team in 2019 after disciplinary problems and poor play.Lee was a part of theKansas City Chiefsroster that won the Super Bowl in February 2020, although he did not play in the game itself.

But why compromise? Why choose one over the other?Against SunderlandGyökeres found a third way. He fell overwhilescoring. Maybe you can have it all.It made for a deeply wholesome moment. Gyökeres couldn’t help smiling ruefully behind his peekaboo celebration, even as he was mobbed fondly by his teammates. The goal was also his first touch seven minutes after coming on, a goal to kill a gameArsenalhad eased through in low gear, and which always felt like a matter of housekeeping, a question of exactly how and how many, from the moment they took the lead just before half-time.Gyökeres double keeps Arsenal on title track in stroll past sloppy SunderlandRead moreBy the end this had turned into an excellent afternoon for Gyökeres, not just because he scored twice in a 3-0 win and had his best Arsenal game so far, but because it was also a very Viktor Gyökeres kind of game.He still ran around like a man being chased by a sheepdog and preparing to hurl himself headfirst over a fence. As ever he looked through it all like a mythical Finnish wartime assassin who only eats self-killed venison and pine bark.And yes, he fell over putting the ball in the net. But the goal also came at the end of a really slick, deeply Arsenal kind of move, three parts of the team working in perfect concert.Declan Rice pressed hard in the right-back position. Leandro Trossard was super-smart in his movement, dropping off, anticipating where the ball would end up. Trossard’s instant pass to Kai Havertz was beautifully precise. Havertz looked up and eased the ball into Gyökeres’s stride as his left foot gave way on a mulchy surface and the ball was whumped low into the net.Gyökeres’s second touch shortly afterwards was also significant. It involved bumping Noah Sadiki to the floor just outside the Arsenal penalty area with an expert flex of his rump, then haring off in search of a return pass. Arenal players don’t really do this kind of thing. Gyökeres does this. Poaching and arse-bumps. This is what you sign him for. Maybe Mikel Arteta should have just taken him off at that point, two touches in, a perfect game completed, Total Gyökeres.However, by now Arsenal were running away with a game they had previously been walking away with. And Gyökeres’s second in stoppage time was also a good moment. It came from a breakaway in the dying moments, the second in four days on this ground, a two-man sprint, arms pumping, Chariots of Fire energy, Gabriel Martinelli streaking in on goal, Gyökeres showing decent sustained speed to keep pace, then rolling a perfect little sideways pass into the back of theSunderlandnet.What does it mean? Is Gyökeres the real thing now? Is he that trinket in the window, the £68m goal-machine centre forward? Will he ever be that? He remains unlikely to be mistaken at a casual glance for, say, Thierry Henry. Bundling and poaching remain the game. But in numbers terms things are regularising. He has six goals in his last eight across three competitions. He is now the club’s top scorer in the league with eight. Someone in this team is going to hit double figures, and things will generally make a little more straight-line sense. Gyökeres has 13 for the season overall. Wait. Is this … good?View image in fullscreenViktor Gyökeres scores Arsenal’s third goal.Photograph: Tony O Brien/ReutersAnd yes, you can dig a little. Alternate fact: the only Premier League teams he has scored against are Leeds, Nottingham Forest, Burnley, Everton and Sunderland. What he needs, still, is a big goal against a big team, a moment of real edge. But it feels closer. A few things do.Nine points clear in February, games in hand notwithstanding, is a proper lead. It’s home straight stuff. You really, really should win a league from here. And the signs are good. Rice was excellent here in the two-man pivot, a nice little tweak in response to the problems against Manchester United. This is good management from Arteta, who was present again in faded gardening coat and midwinter grey slacks, a shade of grey so astonishingly, insistently forgettable you have to feel there’s some kind of thought process at work here.Arsenal had four largely attacking players at the start. They had used seven by the end. Their most defensive midfielder scored the opening goal, a wonderful low drive that veered into the corner form outside the line of the posts.And Gyökeres apart, the bedrock was, as ever, the defence. Arsenal had their first choice back four here: Timber-Gabriel-Saliba-Calafiori. It’s an elite lineup. Calafiori, who has been missing in recent times, was stirring in his drives down the left, a romping, galloping cheekbone flexing vision of elite footballerdom, and a proper full-back athlete, all flying hair, muscles, jawline, medieval in his handsomeness.That first-choice back four has conceded one goal in the league at home all season, the Erling Haaland breakaway in September. It has also managed to start only nine games, seven ending in clean sheets. Keep them together from here. Wring more of the same out of the buttock-bouncing goal bludgeon up front. And anything does seem possible.Explore more on these topicsArsenalSunderlandanalysisShareReuse this content"

India’s form over the last two years has made them the most feared side in world cricket but for a while as they got their World Cup campaign under way the only dread was being experienced by their own fans as the USA threatened a humiliating upset. But for some missed chances, a hugely unfortunate injury and the brilliance of Suryakumar Yadav it might well have happened.As it was, Suryakumar’s late acceleration took him to 84 off 49 balls and his team to 161 for nine, while the USA reply started with three early wickets – the absence of Jasprit Bumrah, ruled out by illness, doing little to dull India’s cutting edge – and the margin in the end was 29.Harry Brook says fallout from nightclub row has been ‘horrendous’Read moreThe fans who had gathered at the Wankhede Stadium early for the tournament’s opening ceremony – scheduled, somewhat confusingly, before its third game – would certainly have been expecting further fireworks once the India innings got under way. Instead Abhishek Sharma, the world’s top-ranked batter and a player of terrific power, improvisation and as much consistency as openers in this format can muster, steered his first ball to the fielder at deep cover and for a while instead of the predicted procession there was one of another kind entirely, involving India’s superstars regularly trudging back to the dressing room.As the powerplay ended Shadley van Schalkwyk had just taken three wickets in an over, India were 46 for four, and an upset for the ages was brewing. The tournament favourites were plunged into genuine peril despite an error-flecked fielding performance from the Americans, who beyond a handful of outfield fumbles – Van Schalkwyk humiliatingly nutmegged in the deep to turn a sharp two into an untroubled four – dropped Tilak Varma in the fourth over, Ishan Kishan in the fifth and, crucially, Suryakumar in the 10th.Suryakumar had scored 15 off 17, and India were reeling at 63 for four, when he flubbed a return catch to Shubham Ranjane and the bowler put it down. The match might have turned on that moment, or perhaps the one in the 16th over when Ali Khan scurried back from fine leg to chase down Axar Patel’s deliberate nudge. As he stopped the ball his left knee caught in the soft turf; Khan had been earmarked for two of the key death overs but, though he gamely tried, could bowl neither. Without him the India captain clicked into top gear at the very end of the innings to plunder 21 runs off the last.View image in fullscreenUSA’s Ali Khan (second right) takes the acclaim from his teammates after the wicket of India’s Abhishek Sharma.Photograph: Rafiq Maqbool/APThereafter Mohammed Siraj – parachuted straight into the team for his first T20 international since July 2024, having been coopted into the squad as a last-minute replacement for Harshit Rana – and Arshdeep Singh took three wickets in the first four overs. From there, and despite a fine fourth-wicket partnership of 58 runs between Milind Kumar and Sanjay Krishnamurthi, America’s run chase never looked anything but forlorn.Quick GuideShepherd takes hat-trick as West Indies beat ScotlandShowScotland started their unexpected T20 World Cup campaign with a defeat as Romario Shepherd's hat-trick inspired the West Indies to a battling 35-run victory in Kolkata.Thrust into the tournament with just a fortnight's notice after Bangladesh were unceremoniously kicked out over their refusal to play in India, Scotland needed 69 from 42 balls to chase down a 183 target.Richie Berrington and Tom Bruce, who was put down twice, put on 78 together but once they departed, Shepherd dismissed Matthew Cross, Michael Leask and Oliver Davidson from successive deliveries.The seam bowling all-rounder, who castled T20 debutant Davidson before haring off in celebration at his feat, then took his fourth wicket of the over by snaring Safyaan Sharif to finish with five for 20.It was Shepherd's first five-for in any international format and helped the Windies start their Group C campaign with a win, but they were given more of a test than they bargained for from their unfancied opponents.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“When I was sitting on the flight to Mumbai, it felt like a dream,” Siraj said. “I never thought I would play in the World Cup. For the past year, the planning was that all the World Cup players would get a chance in T20s, but when I didn’t play the T20s I understood I wouldn’t be part of it this year. But God changed my destiny.View image in fullscreenPerformers during the opening ceremony at the Wankhede Stadium.Photograph: Alex Davidson/ICC/Getty Images“Suddenly Surya called me. He said: ‘Get ready, pack your bag and come.’ I said: ‘Surya, don’t joke, because this is not going to happen.’ He said: ‘I’m telling you the truth – get ready.’ I came, played the match – everything was written.“Hats off to Surya for that innings. Even after losing so many wickets early, he stayed calm. I was sitting in the dressing room watching such fearless cricket. Even after losing six wickets, there was no panic. It was very calm. Everyone felt we would definitely win this match – and we did.”Explore more on these topicsT20 World Cup 2026India cricket teamUSA cricket teamT20 World CupTwenty20US sportsCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

Bruno Fernandes’s 81st-minute strike was a feathered touch off a shin – from Diogo Dalot’s cross – that beat Guglielmo Vicario to the left of the Spurs goalkeeper, and confirmed a miserable day for Frank.“He is our captain and one of our important players,” the Dane had said after retaining Cristian Romero as captain despitethe defender’s “disgraceful” outburstregarding there being only 11 outfield players available for lastSunday’s draw with Manchester City.Frank backs Romero as Spurs captain despite red card at Manchester UnitedRead moreWhat followed was Romero’s second red card in 10 games (and sixth in club colours) on 29 minutes that had Frank cursing and appearing rather silly, though he will not ask someone else to lead the team despite the four-match ban the defender now serves.The excellent Bryan Mbeumo’s 10th goal in 20 appearances followed eight minutes later and so you wonder about Frank’s future. For Carrick, the Midas touch becomes ever more golden: United last reeled off four league wins in a row under Erik ten Hag in February 2024.View image in fullscreenCristian Romero is sent off by Michael Oliver.Photograph: James Gill/Danehouse/Getty ImagesFeint, punch and counterpunch was the pattern, for a phase, as the protagonists flitted about exchanging passes and constructing the odd move. For United, Fernandes, fed by Amad Diallo, prompted Mbeumo down the left, but he blasted over.For Spurs, Xavi Simons, dropping off the left, was chief conductor, starting one attack inside his half then popping up in United’s, dropping the ball to Conor Gallagher who should have beaten Senne Lammens at close range. Dominic Solanke, too, failed to profit from a fizzed Destiny Udogie ball from the left, Spurs’ striker falling over.The visitor’s 4-2-3-1 was near-mirrored by United’s 4-1-1-3-1, Kobbie Mainoo operating ahead of Casemiro in the engine room with Carrick fielding an unchanged XI.Frank, selecting three different players from the City draw, was searching for a first league victory since 28 December: a harrowing statistic. Micky van de Ven’s return from injury was the big plus, but Romero retaining his place backfired with an X-rated challenge on Casemiro. Outside Spurs’ area the ball ran to the Manchester United midfielder prompting the Argentinian to stamp on his left ankle.Casemiro howled in pain and Michael Oliver raised his red card instantly. Romero trundled off to jeers, Wilson Odobert the sacrifice to allow Radu Dragusin to take the disgraced centre-back berth.So United had a man advantage for 72 minutes (plus added time) and less than 10 were needed for Mbeumo’s clever finish. From the left Fernandes rolled a corner to Vicario’s near post where Mainoo, peeling off from the centre of goal, met the ball and no-look passed towards the apex of the area where the unmarked Cameroonian slide-ruled home into the right corner.Jubilation for United and, moments later, Mbeumo turned near-provider – a cross from the right was powered at goal by a Casemiro header, but Vicario tipped over.View image in fullscreenBryan Mbeumo (second right) has Old Trafford rocking after opening the scoring.Photograph: Phil Duncan/Every Second Media/ShutterstockUnited were slick, Spurs amateurish. Those in red built a six-pass move through a static opponent, it broke up, yet still Luke Shaw could be found in the area. His ball to Diallo was turned in, but he was offside.Spurs’ woes worsened when Udogie was forced off on 54 minutes, the 19-year-old Souza replacing the left-back. They needed a minor miracle or an error, as when Shaw’s infield-punt went straight to Simons, though the forward’s shooting radar was off.Shaw next lifted an effort at goal that Vicario beat out and the keeper did the same when Dalot took aim, in a period of prolonged United dominance. By now Benjamin Sesko was on for Cunha, while and Frank made a triple change that changed nothing, as Kolo Randal Muani, Yves Bissouma and Mathys Tel took over from Solanke, Gallagher and João Palhinha.Sesko, at the very end, missed a sitter of a header but it did not matter, especially after Fernandes’s second. The United captain said: “Some people will say I didn’t mean it, but I did because I knew the ball would go straight into the floor so I had to just go straight across Vicario.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester UnitedTottenham Hotspurmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The 20-year-old fell awkwardly in the second half of a 3-1 defeat byLensin Ligue 1 and appeared in agony as he left the pitch.“For Jérémy, it’s his shoulder, and for Abdelhamid [Ait Boudlal, the other Rennes player injured] it’s muscular,” Beye said in his post-match interview. “We’ll have time to see, but it’s definitely quite serious for both of them.”Liverpool saw off competition from Chelsea toagree a deal to sign the highly rated France Under-21 centre-backfor £55m plus £5m in add-ons on 1 July on a five-year contract, with the option of a further 12 months. Arne Slot described Jacquet as “a very big talent and maybe even more than a talent, but we speak about talent because of his age”.The result meantLensreclaimed top spot from Paris Saint-Germain to keep up their unexpected title challenge with a 10th successive home win.

Hansi Flick’s side controlled possession from the start and Marcus Rashford fired narrowly wide before playing a key role in the opener, as Dani Olmo headed his blocked effort into the path of Robert Lewandowski, who finished calmly in the 29th minute.Barcelona pushed on after half-time, with Marc Casado hitting the post, and the pressure told in the 61st minute when 18-year-old Lamine Yamal struck a superb shot from distance for his fifth goal in consecutive matches in all competitions. Substitute Marc Bernal, also 18, completed the scoring with a fine solo run and low finish.

A soundtrack of boos greeted the final whistle but Newcastle’s manager did not complain.Dango Ouattara tips seesaw contest Brentford’s way to sink NewcastleRead more“I don’t blame the supporters for expressing their feelings but it’s hard to hear,” said Howe, who conducted a lengthy dressing room inquest. “I’ve got no issue with their reaction. We’ve had a run of games where we haven’t played as well as we can and got punished. There’s nothing else to do but accept responsibility for it.“It’s not good enough and it’s been out of character. There were certain moments tonight when we didn’t defend anywhere near well enough, either individually or collectively. We only have ourselves to blame. Accepting that is the only way to improve.”Howe appeared to blame himself as much as his players. “There’s a harsh reality for me,” he said. “I’ve got to think long and hard, not about my effort because I can’t question that about myself, but I think I’ve got to work better, I’ve got to do more.“I’ve always said the pressure I put on myself couldn’t be more extreme because I demand really high standards and I’m obviously not doing my job well enough at the moment. I’m annoyed with myself, angry with myself and blaming myself. I’ve got to take full responsibility for everything you see on the pitch and I’ve got to work out solutions.“Then of course I have to ask the same from the players. I have to ask them to be really honest with themselves and look at their best level, and judge how they’re playing against that now. I don’t think there’s too many that can say they’re playing towards their best. It’s a difficult moment for us.”Howe refused to blame the exhaustion of attempting to compete on four fronts – Newcastle’s Carabao Cup defence ended withsemi final defeat by Manchester Citylast Wednesday and they remain in the Champions League and the FA Cup – for adverse league results.“Yes, some of our players are having to play fatigued and we’ve a lot of injuries,” he said. “But we’ve got to do better. We’ve got to take full accountability. It’s a mentality issue, I don’t think it’s an ability issue. So we have to look at ourselves and show real character and strength.”Howe was particularly concerned that, not for the first time, Newcastle deteriorated after taking an early lead. “We’ve been worse for scoring and I don’t understand it,” he said. “Its a very, very difficult thing to work out because I think it’s all in the brain of maybe two or three players who sway the performance negatively.”He agreed Newcastle’s trademark physical aggression was absent. “Ultimately our preferred way of playing is to go for the throat and try to control the game even sometimes off the ball with relentless pressing, with really good physical performances. But that hasn’t been there regularly enough. It only takes one or two players to be off physically for that to break down. We’re not functioning like we have done historically as a team.”Brentford’s manager, Keith Andrews, was considerably happier after a fourth win in six Premier League games. “I’m pleased, really pleased,” he said. “There’s a feeling around the group that whoever we go up against we can win.”Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedEddie HoweBrentfordnewsShareReuse this content"

It was Romero’s second red card in 10 matches following his two yellows in the2-1 defeat at Liverpoolon 20 December and the ban is his fourth this season.Fernandes keeps Carrick’s perfect Manchester United record intact after Romero red cardRead moreRomero’s off-field conduct has also been a source of concern for the Spurs manager. Following last Sunday’s2-2 draw with Manchester City, Romerodescribed the depth of Spurs’ squad as “disgraceful”. The outburst on social media called into question his status as captain after the Argentinian was critical of the club’s ownership following the3-2 defeat at Bournemouthin early January. “They only show up when things are going well, to tell a few lies,” Romero posted on social media, but later deleted the reference to lies.Romero will not be available until 15 March and will miss Spurs’ games against Newcastle, Arsenal, Fulham and Crystal Palace. He was issued a straight red card against United by Michael Oliver on 29 minutes after the referee judged his stamp on Casemiro’s left ankle a dangerous challenge. Romero’s six red cards in all competitions since making his debut for Spurs in August 2021 is the most of anyPremier Leagueplayer in that period.Frank was asked if he will consider removing the captaincy from Romero. “No, I think it is fair to say he doesn’t have any intention to get a red card after 28 minutes,” said the head coach. Frank added: “There is not any regret in making him captain and also he is sorry for the incident. He apologised to his teammates.“He is one of the most important players. We haven’t spoken specifically about this – he apologised: that is enough for me for now. If you look at how many red cards he had, it is not like that he had that many, when you play with passion and aggression.”Michael Carrick was pleased with United’s fourth consecutive Premier League win under him. The run is the club’s first of that length since February 2024 and was secured by Bryan Mbeumo and Bruno Fernandes.The interim manager said: “The connection with everyone has been the most pleasing thing. We all know that what goes on the pitch is really important, but the emotion with players and the staff is good. Seeing the stadium in that way gives me a lot of satisfaction as much as the type of football and tactical and technical side.”Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurThomas FrankManchester UnitedMichael CarrickPremier LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

Enveloped by his space-grey puffer coat, making a circle with his hands, bemused staff and teammates soon caught his drift: Palmer wanted evidence of his handiwork, a 25-minute first-half hat-trick that put this game beyond Wolves, even if Liam Rosenior’s side eased off in the second.After retrieving the match ball from a pitchside attendant, Palmer juggled it halfway across the pitch, embarking on a warm-down of keepie-uppies. It would be easy to paint this as a Palmer masterclass, the England midfielder completing his hat-trick on 38 minutes, but it is fair to say by the time he was substituted on the hour, his work was done. At that point it was 3-1 to the visitors, Wolves pulling a goal back nine minutes into the second half when Tolu Arokodare spun in the box to convert at a corner.Everton win battle of own goals with Fulham thanks to Leno’s late blunderRead moreFrom there, if not earlier, it was hard not to feel as though Chelsea were going through the motions. Palmer’s trio of typically ice-cool finishes, two from the penalty spot, established a comfortable cushion, though it was his third, to cap a slick team move that began with his goalkeeper, Robert Sánchez, that was most satisfying for Rosenior.“It was a very, very pleasing goal and that is the type of football we want to play,” said the Chelsea head coach, whose record now reads seven wins in nine matches and four successive victories in the league. “Obviously Cole gets three goals, but some of our football was everything I wanted to see. We know what a world-class player he is. He’s played a lot of football over the last year with not much rest, but when he’s at his best he’s unstoppable.”Wolves, however, gave Palmer and Chelsea a leg-up on 12 minutes. Rob Edwards’s side were the better team until the experienced Wolves captain, Matt Doherty, conceded a silly penalty. João Pedro appeared in a harmless spot, moseying away from José Sá’s goal when Doherty was overzealous and bumped the Brazilian in the box, giving the referee, Jarred Gillett, little choice but to point to the penalty spot.Palmer sent Sá the wrong way and covered his ears with his black gloves as he wheeled away towards the Chelsea supporters strewn across the lower bank of the Steve Bull Stand. “When you’re at this club with the scrutiny – which I’m starting to learn myself – you have to block out the noise and remember what a good footballer you are,” Rosenior said. “I love working with him.”Chelsea triumphed from their first meaningful attack and now the confidence was flowing through the visitors. Enzo Fernández attempted a rabona shot. The galling thing for Edwards was Chelsea’s second goal stemmed from another Wolves gift, Yerson Mosquera’s brainless two-handed shove on João Pedro giving the officials a simple decision. The only thing to check was whether the foul was in the box. Once decided, Palmer removed his hands from his hips and dispatched the ball into the opposite corner.View image in fullscreenCole Palmer takes time out from his usual celebration after scoring Chelsea’s first goal from the penalty spot.Photograph: Darren Walsh/Chelsea FC/Getty ImagesChelsea’s third goal was a crisp move. Pedro Neto, who caused havoc for Hugo Bueno on his return to Molineux, sent the ball across the field to Fernández and the Argentina midfielder spied the run of Marc Cucurella. When Cucurella cut the ball back for Palmer, a yard or so in front of the penalty spot, Palmer lashed a first-time finish into the roof of the Wolves net.Wolves have now lost their past four matches to Chelsea by an aggregate scoreline of 15-4 and that is without mentioning their6-2 defeatat the start of last season. “It was about trying to win the half, sticking to the things we wanted to do and showing some of this,” Edwards said, tapping his heart. “We did that. It wasn’t a team that went under in the end because if we had it would have been embarrassing.”Chelsea were drifting by the time Alejandro Garnacho entered in place of Palmer. In fact, Palmer’s third was Chelsea’s last effort on goal. Wolves summoned some fight. Arokodare reacted after reading the debutant Adam Armstrong’s clever backward header at a corner, the Wolves goal coming moments after Mateus Mané, a bright light in a gloomy season, struck the inside of a post.“My hands are feeling the effects after thumping a door in a bit of anger,” Edwards said afterwards. “It was a really promising start but then we made a couple of really ludicrous mistakes. We had to stop the bleeding.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueWolverhampton WanderersChelseamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

There was little between the two, but the Hammers showed why they have hope of staying up, providing the brief moments of quality, something the home side could not in a tense Turf Moor atmosphere.Crysencio Summerville and Taty Castellanos expertly finished from two perfect assists to send West Ham to victory, leaving them three points adrift of Nottingham Forest in 17th, the last place above the relegation spots, as they bounced back from alate loss at Chelsea. Burnley showed fight, but a 16th straight game without a win, including 11 defeats, brought derision from the home supporters and demands for change in the dugout and boardroom.Newcastle United v Brentford: Premier League – liveRead more“I’m a fighter and I’ve experienced a lot of things in my life and I’ve been through a lot of adversity and I’ve been through a lot of challenges,” Parker said. “One thing I hold firmly and I stand by and is a foundation and an absolute rock, which is concrete, which is built on, is: in these moments of pure adversity, I will not waver. I will always stand up and I’ll always represent that to this group.”There was more than an air of resignation around the ground before the first whistle was blown. Nothing in the opening 12 minutes suggested either team had the desire or capability to get out of the relegation zone.Burnley, as Parker puts it, are often on the wrong side of the Premier League’s “fine margins”, but it is often of their own making. On this occasion, full-back Lucas Pires gave the ball away needlessly on the halfway line, Mateus Fernandes broke and slipped a precise pass through to Summerville, who reminded Kyle Walker of his advancing years, before dinking over Martin Dúbravka, as the winger scored in a fifth consecutive match.Neither set of fans are happy with life, but the visitors were more vocal, chanting “sack the board” in the hope of ousting Karren Brady and David Sullivan, though Burnley supporters were not short of toxicity come the 26th minute. The second was far too easy as El Hadji Malick Diouf was afforded the left wing to himself, allowing him to send in a perfect cross, headed home by Castellanos, who did well to get across his man.Chanting “We want Parker out”, “we want our club back” and telling substitute Jacob Bruun Larsen “you’re not fit to wear the shirt” after calling for more encouragement from the home fans, summed up the mood. The Burnley head coach did have some support but it came from the away end, having served West Ham as a player.View image in fullscreenWest Ham players feel the relief after Taty Castellanos scores their second goal.Photograph: Phil Oldham/Shutterstock“In the first half we looked fragile, we looked edgy,” Parker said. “There’s obviously a [lack of] confidence at the moment and just the whole environment today at certain moments was testing for the players. You could sense that certainly in the first half. I totally understand it [the atmosphere], but I just didn’t think that helped this young group at times.“They’re guys that are absolutely giving everything and it was tough for them. I get that when you’re hearing the level of, openly, the criticism. It affects us.”Considering the inept nature of the first-half performance, Burnley came out with intent sourced from within the dressing room. They were on top in the early stages, creating numerous dangerous situations, which should have resulted in a goal, only for two fine blocks from Marcus Edwards and Zian Flemming chances to secure a first clean sheet of the Nuno Espírito Santo era. That was helped by a solid debut from Axel Disasi at centre-back and a third win in four league matches.“It shows improvement, but we are still in the same situation,” Nuno said. “Nothing has changed, we have to keep trying, trying and fighting.”West Ham struggled to create chances to kill the game off, to keep things vaguely interesting, but Burnley failed to score for the ninth time this season. The only great escape Burnley could muster was the mass early exit of fans and no one could blame them. West Ham’s supporters stayed to the end, savouring the surroundings in the hope they will not be back next season.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBurnleyWest Ham Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Which way do they go? They have plenty of talent, but are they capable of pushing on? Can they convince Marco Silva to extend his contract or will one of the most underrated managers in thePremier Leaguedecide it is time to look for a new challenge at the end of the season?Silva’s itchy feet are a badly kept secret. He has been key to Fulham’s rise since promotion in 2022, but there is a sense of a relationship drawing to a close. The manager, who has been linked with a number of vacancies in recent years, has not been shy to call for more investment in his squad.Oscar Bobb, signed from Manchester City for £27m, was an eye-catching arrival during the winter transfer window. The failure to meet PSV Eindhoven’s asking price for the USA striker Ricardo Pepi was a more frustrating development.Arsenal v Sunderland, Wolves v Chelsea, Burnley v West Ham and more: football – liveRead more“We have to be more brave, be more aggressive,” Silva said after watching his side throw away a 1-0 lead. He was talking about the dip in Fulham’s performance after a fantastic first half, but he could have been discussing the club as a whole. This was an opportunity forFulhamto cement themselves as genuine contenders for European qualification. The tentative nature of their approach after half-time suggests a slide into mid-table is the likelier outcome.Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall provided the spark for the late turnaround. The midfielder equalised in the 75th minute and made the winner eight minutes later. Bernd Leno, who was at fault for both goals, was pinned to his line by Jake O’Brien and powerless to do anything more than paw Dewsbury-Hall’s corner into his own net.Fulham, who were level withEvertonat kick-off, had pretty much punched themselves in the face. They were outstanding for 45 minutes but failed to build on going ahead through an unfortunate own goal from Vitalii Mykolenko.“We should have four more goals,” Silva said. “The game should be over at half-time. The number of chances we created, we have to blame ourselves. Second half, we stopped doing the right things. We expected a reaction from Everton.”It felt inevitable after a slew of misses from Fulham. They led when Jordan Pickford pushed a shot from Raúl Jiménez on to Mykolenko and the ball went in off the left-back.Fulham were in their element. Samuel Chukwueze, who linked brilliantly with Alex Iwobi, tested Pickford at the near post and rattled a shot against the bar. Jiménez and Harry Wilson shot wide from good positions. Emile Smith Rowe was also unfortunate not to score when he bent an effort against the woodwork.View image in fullscreenEverton’s Vitalii Mykolenko inadvertently diverts the ball into his own net to give Fulham the lead.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/ReutersEverton, unbeaten in five away games, were overwhelmed but industrious. With one goal in it, they responded with the defiance that typifies every David Moyes side. They stepped up in the second half and imposed themselves. James Garner, Dewsbury-Hall and Idrissa Gueye took control in midfield and Iliman Ndiaye’s dribbles caused problems.The challenge for the visitors was creating more in open play. James Tarkowski and O’Brien threatened from corners, but Jorge Cuenca and Joachim Andersen kept Thierno Barry quiet before the striker made way for Beto.With time running out, Everton drew level. Mykolenko broke free down the left and picked out Dewsbury-Hall, whose shot squirmed past Leno.Fulham, who had been reduced to playing on the break, were unable to lift themselves. Tyrique George, the Chelsea loanee, made an impact after coming on for his Everton debut. The winger won a corner. Everton, dangerous from set pieces all afternoon, completed their comeback when Leno flapped at Dewsbury-Hall’s inswinging cross.Moyes smiled when he heard about Dewsbury-Hall asking for the goal to be given to him. Everton’s manager had watched events unfold from the back of the new Riverside Stand. It even has a pool on the roof. “I had a wee swim when I was up there,” Moyes deadpanned. Silva was in a less humorous mood.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueFulhamEvertonmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

This one got away from the younger Basque who is yet to prevail over Emery in eight meetings. With Aston Villa’s hopes of an unlikelyPremier Leaguetitle faded, time to protect a Champions League place. They ought to be grateful for a point on the south coast. Not for the first time, Iraola wondered how his team created so many chances and yet failed to win.“Before the game maybe you’d take a point,” said Bournemouth’s manager. “After the game I cannot be completely satisfied. We were the better team today.”Arsenal v Sunderland, Wolves v Chelsea, Burnley v West Ham and more: football – liveRead moreEmery said: “A very good point … we must feel very good.” Soon enough he repeated previous comments that his team should not be considered title contenders, financial constraints nodded towards. “The contender for the title should be Arsenal, [Manchester] City, Chelsea, Newcastle, [Manchester] United.”After 20 Bournemouth shots against Villa’s seven had rained on Emi Martínez’s goal, the keeper’s shaky handling reflected a difficult afternoon for his team. Villa still took the lead through Morgan Rogers’ brilliantly executed finish. Rayan’s second-half equaliser was no less impressive, a solo goal to further the gathering hype surrounding the young Brazilian, and Bournemouth’s dealmaking prowess.Aneye-catching cameo at Wolveshad convinced Iraola to start Rayan on the right of an attack full of youthful zest. The Vitality Stadium has a teenage hero tomake fans forget Antoine Semenyo. “Amazing player,” said his new manager of a young man with considerable physical presence. “We lost one of the most physical players you can get in Antoine, we needed someone strong.”View image in fullscreenMorgan Rogers fires Aston Villa ahead early on in the first half.Photograph: Charlie Crowhurst/Getty ImagesWithin a Bournemouth team Iraola is evolving impressively on the hoof, Alex Scott has become key. The Channel Islander had the first shot in anger of many more to follow, while Junior Kroupi’s shooting soon showed the same venom as when scoring at Wolves.Villa fans voiced their approval of Douglas Luiz’s return but their team struggled throughout in midfield. Set-piece organisation, too. Specialist coach Austin MacPhee’s instructions from the sidelines fell on deaf ears when a training-ground routine set up a first-half Kroupi missile. Two goalkeepers on the bench with Harvey Elliott unnamed said plenty about the landlocked loanee’s plight, as well as Villa’s injury list.At such times of incoherence, Villa’s usual answer is Rogers. His goal, after decent work from Jadon Sancho, was decisive in the extreme, crashed in on the angle by one of the Premier League’s very best players. Villa suddenly walked taller, Bournemouth’s previous confidence lessening, the contest more entertaining for that. “He’s doing a fantastic season,” said Emery of his star man. “He was always pushing, helping. Everyone was feeling good playing with him.”View image in fullscreenRayan scores Bournemouth’s equaliser on his home debut.Photograph: Charlie Crowhurst/Getty ImagesRayan might not have enjoyed quite the same freedom as at Molineux but one first-half drop of the shoulder beyond Lucas Digne was evidence of his threat, a warning Villa and Digne particularly failed to heed. Rayan glided past a hapless Digne, accelerating into space, and with his right foot skidded his shot beyond Martínez’s reach.“When there’s space he can go one against one,” said Iraola. “It’s really difficult for the defender. He’s finished it really well. He’s still a young player who needs to improve some things … we also need to learn a lot from him.”Villa opportunities became yet more occasional, though one Matty Cash special whistled over the bar. Kroupi was replaced by Ryan Christie as Iraola successfully shored up midfield with the Scot’s energy levels.Emery, for his part, paced anxiously as Bournemouth’s barrage intensified. Martínez was belatedly solid in making a save from Christie’s long-ranger, and from the same player’s close-range volley. “The second half we couldn’t play how they wanted, they pushed us,” said Emery, more than happy to praise his compatriot’s team. “They were in our box more times than we wanted. They are always forward.” Iraola happily returned the compliment: “He’s one of the best managers.”With Manchester United and Chelsea now looming, Villa found themselves unable to locate any path to victory. Ollie Watkins chased shadows in vain until replaced late on by Tammy Abraham. Moments later, Rayan departed. A home debut to remember if not the result his team deserved.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBournemouthAston Villamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The visitors were second best in all departments and have now lost 22 of their last 24 Test matches with a buoyant France heading for Cardiff next Sunday in ominous form.Lake did not mince his words after his team’s latest heavy loss which saw them concede seven tries and receive four yellow cards. “We let ourselves down, we let people down,” he said. “We spoke all week about what we were going to produce and we didn’t do it. There is no other way to say it – we’re massively disappointed with what we put on the field today.Arundell hat-trick fires England to emphatic Six Nations win against WalesRead more“Every voice matters to us at the minute, every fan in a seat that can get behind us. We said we would get the fans on their feet and we didn’t today. We put ourselves under pressure, the penalty count and the yellow cards are down to us. We will be better next week. This group will fight for each other all day, there is never a question of effort. [But] we weren’t accurate enough when we had opportunities. You can’t do that against one of the form teams in world rugby.”The Wales head coach, Steve Tandy, was similarly dismayed. “We are bitterly disappointed. We were inaccurate and couldn’t get any momentum. Playing England with 15 men is tough enough. Playing with 13 men for almost 20 minutes is hard. We are not a good enough team to have these inaccuracies. Even though we are 11th in the world and we came up against the third team in the world we expect more of ourselves.”England’sSteve Borthwick, in contrast, was happy enough with many aspects of his side’s performance as they extended their winning run to 12 in a row. “I thought defensively we were excellent, I thought our kicking game was excellent,” he said. “What was pleasing is that we created lots of opportunities. But in the second half we didn’t convert those opportunities in the way we’d have liked.”Borthwick also paid tribute to Henry Arundell, whose hat-trick of first-half tries extended his tally for England to 11 in 12 Tests. “We all know Henry is a player who has an incredible ability running with the ball and his ability to find a way to the try line is excellent,” the head coach said. “What I have been really impressed is over the last number of months is his attitude to go and improve other aspects of his game. He has worked exceptionally hard and has come back to theSix Nationsan even better player.”Jamie George, who led out the team with regular captain Maro Itoje starting on the bench, also suggested England were now in a handy position heading into next Saturday’s Calcutta Cup game at Murrayfield. “Regardless of who we were playing next week it’s a brilliant platform. We wanted to start with a bang and I thought we did that today.”George Ford, the man of the match, also believes there is more to come from England and praised the first half efforts of his pack. “The start of a Test match is always massive. I thought the boys did that well … we were able to dominate territory because of the boys up front. We are just trying to put bits of our game together, the more attacking opportunities we create the more we should take.”Explore more on these topicsWales rugby union teamSix Nations 2026England rugby union teamSteve BorthwickSix NationsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

We will make no further comment until after the conclusion of the skeleton competition.”UK Sport has spent £5,765,123 of national lottery funding on skeleton sliders over the past four years, and has been rewarded with Weston in particular dominating the sport. Last year the 28-year-old became world champion for a second time, beating his closest rival Wyatt by 1.9sec. This season, Weston has won five races and Wyatt two.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsTeam GBnewsShareReuse this content"

England have had tougher training sessions in preparation for thisSix Nationsand by the end the scoreboard spoke for itself. Wales were not so much beaten as buried beneath an avalanche of seven white tries including a first-half hat-trick for the pacy Bath wing Henry Arundell on his first England start since the 2023 World Cup.If not quite as big a rout asEngland’s 68-14 win in Cardiff11 months ago, the flashing red warning lights were visible from the moment the visitors had two players sent to the sin bin in the first quarter. They never looked like recovering and, in its own way, this disappointment will sting as much as the73-0 defeat by South Africain November.‘We let people down’: Dewi Lake apologises to Wales fans after England thrashingRead moreIf there was some consolation that England could not always sustain their first-half momentum it was strictly relative. The plain truth was that the game had long since been won and the bonus point banked, although head coach Steve Borthwick will be slightly irked by his side’s inability to put the hammer fully down when Wales were again reduced to 13 men by two more yellow cards in the final quarter.Quick GuideEngland 48 Wales 7: teams and scorersShowEnglandSteward (Smith 64); Roebuck (Pollock 64), Freeman, Dingwall, Arundell; Ford, Mitchell (Spencer 66); Genge (Rodd ht), George (Cowan-Dickie 50), Heyes (Davison 50), Coles (Itoje 50), Chessum, Pepper, Underhill (T Curry 50), EarlTriesArundell 3, Earl, Roebuck, Penalty tryConsFord 4PenFordYellow cardItoje 50WalesRees-Zammit; Mee (Grady 52), James, Thomas, Adams; Edwards, Williams (Hardy 78); Smith (Carre 50), Lake (Belcher 66), Griffin (Francis 50), Jenkins, Beard (Carter 69), Mann (Plumtree 50), Macleod (Deaves 52), WainwrightTryAdamsConEdwardsYellow cardSmith 16, Lake 17, Thomas 64, Plumtree 66Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Either way this was another sobering result for those who believe the Six Nations is only ever as strong as its weakest link. If this 145-year-old fixture ever becomes humdrum the championship will be fundamentally the poorer for it and its traditional colour and passion will steadily ebb away. It is not just Welsh fans who will be praying for some light at the eastbound end of the Brynglas tunnels.You certainly had to admire the pre-match optimism of the defiant visiting supporter carrying his inflatable leek up the road from Twickenham station. Good news is not exactly rife within Welsh rugby just now and theoff-field politicsremain poisonous. Those trying to keep the faith badly need something to cling to in the coming weeks but there was scant encouragement here on a cool, grey evening.By the end Wales had been shown four yellow cards, meaning they played almost a quarter of the game with 13 players. In their last five Test they have now accrued 10 yellows and one red, an indicator of the pressure they are frequently under. For England George Ford ran the game with practised ease and Ollie Chessum was a constant menace but, for the most part, the home side did not have to lift themselves much above second gear.View image in fullscreenBen Earl gives the crowd two thumbs up after touching down England’s third try.Photograph: Isabel Infantes/ReutersJust about everything that could have gone wrong for Wales did so in the first half.They were already 3-0 down to a Ford penalty when a charged-down clearance from Louis Rees-Zammit coughed up a useful position and Ford’s precision pass put Arundell over for the game’s first try. It was all a little bit too easy and decidedly ominous.While Wales were gallant and spirited, their captain Dewi Lake was soon being warned that his side were conceding too many penalties. Within moments Nicky Smith was being despatched to the sin bin and, two minutes later, Wales were reduced to 13 players when Lake also saw yellow for illegally killing a maul.Sure enough the floodgates opened. With the patched-up Welsh scrum backpedalling and gaps out wide, Ford dropped a little cross-kick neatly into the arms of Arundell to put England 15-0 up inside the opening quarter. With nine penalties already conceded and 51 tackles already made it already had the makings of a hard day’s night.Then Ben Earl powered through on the left, with Ford’s conversion making it 22-0. It then got steadily worse even after Wales were restored to 15 men. Relatively speaking there was little pressure on Ben Thomas as he headed right and prepared to pass to Rees-Zammit on his outside but the move went catastrophically awry. The ball went to ground a couple of yards behind the flying full-back and instead fell into England’s grasp, with Fraser Dingwall putting Arundell away for his hat-trick score.The wing has had to be patient since bursting on to the scene, having spent a spell in France playing for Racing 92 after the financial collapse of his previous club London Irish. What has never been in doubt, however, is his searing pace and he now has 11 tries to his name in 12 appearances for his country.Given England’s 29-point cushion at the interval, the rest was mostly academic. Tom Roebuck slid over for England’s fifth try and, while Wales did finally break their duck through a converted try by Josh Adams, a comeback was never remotely on the cards. Even after Maro Itoje was shown a yellow card within moments of arriving as a replacement, England were swiftly back on the attack with Henry Pollock close to scoring in the right corner. A penalty try was subsequently awarded for a high tackle by Taine Plumtree and Tommy Freeman powerfully rounded things off in the final minute. For Wales, who now welcome France to Cardiff next Sunday, this tournament is already a case of damage limitation.Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2026England rugby union teamWales rugby union teamRugby unionSix NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

The unbeaten five-year-old, Lulamba, is the near-certain favourite for the Arkle Trophy, after maintaining his unbeaten record over fences in the Game Spirit Chase.In Tutti Quanti, who took the feature handicap apart under top weight of 12st, there is the possibility that a genuine contender for championship honours has emerged almost from nowhere.Throughout its long history under a variety of sponsors, the race that is staged as the William Hill Hurdle has always been one of the most fiercely competitive events of its type all season. Rarely, if ever, has it been won as emphatically as it was on Saturday. The front-running Tutti Quanti was clearly going far better than his rivals on the turn for home and he shrugged off both his weight and the strength-sapping ground as he strode further clear all the way to the line.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Sunday tipsShowChelmsford1.37Thanh Nam (nap)2.07Shafdar2.35King David3.07Marinakis3.37My Awele4.07Little Miss Magic (nb)4.37TubaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Tutti Quanti was a remarkable 15 lengths clear of the runner-up, prompting Paul Nicholls, his trainer, to suggest that a supplementary entry for the Champion Hurdle on 10 March could be a consideration.“He’s just one of those big, backward horses who has been physically improving and getting better all the time,” he said. “I still think there is more to come from him. I was a little bit nervous, as the record books tell you off 12st it is hard to win a race like this, but he has annihilated them.“We were thinking of putting him in the County [Handicap] Hurdle [at Cheltenham] and a few of those others but we might just have a rethink if the ground was right for him. We could supplement him for the Champion Hurdle if we wanted to. The great thing about supplementing is you only have to do it five or six days before the race and you will have a great idea about what the ground will be.”View image in fullscreenHaiti Couleurs did more than necessary on demanding ground to win.Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PANeither Haiti Couleurs nor Lulamba could be described as flawless in victory, as the Welsh Grand National winner was a little close to several fences while Lulamba’s inexperience showed mid-race before he picked up the leaders and then powered ahead halfway down the straight. But both did no more than necessary on deep, demanding ground, when it would have been easy to leave their festival chance behind.Native River, in 2018, was the last British-trained winner of the Gold Cup, while Norton’s Coin, who shocked Desert Orchid at 100-1 in 1990, was the last (and only the second) to be trained in Wales. Haiti Couleurs, though, will go to Cheltenham with a decent chance to snap both streaks and add a landmark win for Sean Bowen, his jockey.Bowen is the reigning champion jockey over jumps and is so far clear in this season’s race that if he retired tomorrow, he would still be long odds-on to retain his title when the season ends in April. While he is putting up Tony McCoy-like numbers in terms of winners, however, he has yet to enjoy a victory at the Cheltenham festival.“He was careful at a few early on and warmed up nicely into it,” Bowen said, “and then actually showed a turn of foot when they came to him and I was surprised how well he quickened.“He’s going to be a horse that three-miles-two around Cheltenham and then up the hill will really suit him. Whether he’s good enough after the back of the last we don’t know, but he’ll definitely be there pitching turning in.“You want to be riding in Gold Cups and I have only ridden in one and finished fourth, so to finish a few places higher would be nice.”Lulamba was trimmed to around 11-8 for the Arkle Trophy after extending his unbeaten record over fences to three, while Sam Thomas’s Steel Ally is around 10-1 (from 20-1) for the same race after a comfortable success in the Grade Two Kingmaker Novice Chase at Warwick.Newcastle’s jumps meeting on Sunday has been abandoned meaning the only action in the UK will take place at Chelmsford.Explore more on these topicsHorse racingHorse racing tipsnewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Afew days after Christmas 2022,Bad Bunny, the Puerto Rican reggaetonero, appeared without warning on one of the most unlikely of stages:the roofof a Gulf Oil gas station in San Juan. To a massive crowd singing every word, he performed a surprise concert, along with friend and collaborator Arcángel, that was part hype-ymusic video shoot, part exultant post-tour homecoming, and part pointed critique. He ended the set withEl Apagón(“The Power Outage”), a clubbyprotest anthemabout local displacement andtherollingblackoutsthathaveplagued Puerto Rico, a US “commonwealth” (read: colony), since Hurricane Maria in 2017.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Bad Bunny sang it from a roof on Santurce’s Calle Loíza, a thoroughfare in a former working-class Black neighborhood now dotted with Airbnbs. But you do not need thefull contextto get the show’s contagious energy. Though I have never walked Calle Loíza, nor do I speak Spanish, the gas station show is still my favorite concert to rewatch viaonline fan clips: electric, organic, genuinelypopular.In terms of reach, critical acclaim and longevity, Bad Bunny rivals – andsometimes outsells– the likes of Taylor Swift, Kendrick Lamar, Beyoncé and Drake, though it is hard to imagine those peers appearing so unguarded, sopublic,as he does on that roof.That particular combination of pure charisma, irreducible identity and undeniable beats has propelled Bad Bunny, born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, to the height of global superstardom, transcending language barriers to a heretofore unseen degree in the continental US. His genre-smashing music – all in Caribbean Spanish – flows everywhere from New York street corners to my parents’ kitchen in suburban Ohio, projected and celebrated on a series of bigger and bigger stages: a record-setting US arena tour in 2022, includingtwo sold-out nightsat Yankee Stadium. At Coachella in 2023, where he became thefirst Spanish-language headliner, opening atop a replica of that Gulf gas station. At theGrammys, where just last week he became the first Spanish-language artist towin album of the year, for his homecoming opus Debí Tirar Más Fotos (“I Should Have Taken More Photos”). And on Sunday, he will step on to the biggest stage yet of his career: theSuper Bowlhalf-time show.‘It’s gonna be a huge party’: Bad Bunny set for Super Bowl stage as Trump skips eventRead moreThat a Spanish-language artist will occupy one of the vanishingly few monocultural venues left in the polarized US feels inevitable yet still improbable. Inevitable, in that Bad Bunny has been themost-streamed artistin the world for four of the past five years, and has broad appeal in the US, where there are about 55 million Spanish speakers – the second-largest population in the world, behind only Mexico. “From the business standpoint, it almost wouldn’t make sense for it to be anyoneotherthan Bad Bunny, especially in a moment when the NFL is trying to reach both global audiences and younger audiences,” said Perry Johnson, amusic scholarat work on a cultural history of the Super Bowl half-time show. Improbable, in that theTrump administrationhas so fiercely demonized Hispanic immigrants and so thoroughly politicized Spanish, that choosing a Spanish-speaking performer seems like an uncharacteristic risk for a brand-safe corporation like the NFL.Unsurprisingly, given that Bad Bunny – an American citizen, as are all Puerto Ricans –skipped the USon his DTMF tour to protect Spanish-speaking fans from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the announcement was immediately met with hostility by members of the US government.“It’s so shameful that they’ve decided to pick somebody who just seems to hate America so much, to represent them at the half-time game,” said the homeland security adviser Corey Lewandowski. The homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, promised that ICE would be “all over”the Super Bowl. In protest,Turning Point USA, the rightwing organization founded by the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk, has planned an alternative “All-American Halftime Show”, starring Donald TrumpallyKid Rock andhypedby JD Vance.Bad Bunny has promised a“huge party”where, according to the jubilanttrailer, “the world will dance”. But no matter the quality of the music (and for the record, it is very danceable), the symbolism of a Puerto Rican performer of Spanish-language music on the biggest stage in US pop culture has already exceeded the show itself. The show “has become more about politics than about music”, said Yarimar Bonilla, the director of the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College.“His very presence on the stage is a statement,” said Petra Rivera-Rideau, co-author of thebookP FKN R: How Bad Bunny Became the Global Voice of Puerto Rican Resistance. “The fact is that we’re currently in a moment where Spanish is seen as a mark of being foreign, of not belonging, where people are getting profiled for being Spanish speakers – that ups the ante and importance. It can’t really be overstated.”Fans race to learn Spanish before Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl half-time showRead moreIntentionally or no, Bad Bunny has found himself at the center of polarized America’s perpetual culture wars, playing out once again at the most American of entertainment spectacles, theSuper Bowl– where, as Johnson says, “ideas around patriotism, citizenship and Americanness get played out”. American football remains freighted with ideas of respectability, race, good old boys. And since the first Super Bowl in Los Angeles in 1967, the half-time show has served as a staging ground for ideas of what does or does not represent “America”.It has thus courtedbacklash, especially along lines of race and gender – think thedisproportionate furorover the infamous exposure of Janet Jackson’s bare breast in 2004. Complaints to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) spike with every Super Bowl, especially as the interests of a white, conservative minority clash with the business interests of the NFL and the public’s preference for the now-global sound of hip-hop. (Andespeciallysince Jay-Z’s Roc Nationcontroversiallytook overthe half-time show in 2019; since then, there have been no white headliners, and viewership has surged.) There was white discomfort with Beyoncé’sBlack Pantherscostumes when she took over Coldplay’s 2016 half-time show with Formation (as memorialized in the SNL skit“The Day Beyoncé Turned Black”.) There was backlash to Shakira and Jennifer Lopez, two Latina women over 40, when theyperformedin English in 2020; backlash toDr Dre and friendsin 2022, withFCC complaintsof “reverse racism”; backlash last year to Kendrick Lamar, whoseinvocationof mass incarceration and anti-Black racismdrew 133.5 million viewers, the most of any Super Bowl half-time show ever.View image in fullscreenBad Bunny at the Super Bowl press conference this week.Photograph: Christopher Victorio/ShutterstockA Spanish-language performer, even a hugely popular one, supercharges all of this, especially when the administration is deliberatelytargetingand terrorizing predominantly Spanish-speaking undocumentedimmigrants. Objection on grounds of “foreignness” or “un-Americanness” – even and especially for Latino US citizens – “happens whenever you have a Latin artist on a stage that’s considered very patriotic”, said Rivera-Rideau. In 1968, the Puerto Rican-born, Harlem-bred musician José Feliciano performed a Latin guitar-tinged national anthem in English at the World Series – only to facecalls for deportationthat nearly derailed his career. (In a full-circle moment, Bad Bunny brought out Feliciano at Coachella.) When Marc Anthony, a New Yorker of Puerto Rican descent, sang God Bless America at the MLB All-Star game in 2013 – again in English – he was met with a string ofsocial mediaabuse. One Twitter user wrote: “Shouldn’t an AMERICAN be singing God Bless America? #getoutofmycountry.”The Turning Point USA half-time show – a “family-friendly, values-driven” event “created for viewers seeking uplifting, patriotic entertainment” – boasts a pop-country lineup that will sing “anything in English”. The phrase echoes the “English Only” movement of the 20th and 21st centuries, an effort toadopt English as the only official US languagewith thinly veiled anti-immigrant and anti-Latino sentiment.The backlash toBad Bunnyis part “of a very old story”, said Frances Negrón-Muntaner, a Puerto Rican film-maker, scholar and author, one which positions Latinos “as foreign, as unassimilable, as people who somehow do not and cannot contribute to American life – even though, factually, that’s not true at all”.From the beginning of his career, Bad Bunny has spoken directly to the purgatorial status of Puerto Rico, which has been a US territory since 1898. (The terms are deliberately confusing – as one defining supreme court caseput it, the archipelago paradoxically “belong[s] to the United States, but [is] not a part of the United States”.) He hassponsored billboardsin Puerto Rico against US statehood. On DTMF, hemournsLo Que le Pasó a Hawaii– “what happened to Hawaii”, which became a state in 1959 and is now a tourist haven thathasutterlymarginalizedthe native population. Last summer, his landmark30-show residencyat San Juan’s Coliseo de Puerto Rico partnered with local hotels to put off Airbnb-ers, prioritized local affordability and kept the first nine showsavailableonly to island residents.But the hyper-specificity of Bad Bunny’s music and persona – the references; the unique frustrations; the slang that is, as Bonillawrote, “full of so many skipped consonants, Spanglish, neologisms and argot that it borders on Creole” – has not blunted its appeal. If anything, the issues that he sings about (success, partying and women, yes – but also mass tourism, gentrification, the pressure to leave and the desire to go home) resonate in the US and beyond. His lyrics “go to the essence of something”, said Negrón-Muntaner. DTMF standoutNuevayol, for example, takes its name and themes from the Boricuan pronunciation of Nueva York, but “even if you’re Mexican or Colombian or Venezuelan or Peruvian or wherever in Latin America, you know what Nueva York is,” she said. “It’s like your version of New York – the immigrant version of New York.”It’s no surprise, then, that US conservatives, who take a hard line on immigration and lump anyone speaking Spanish into one massive “other”, have conflated Bad Bunny’s Puerto Rican-ness with the incoherently amorphous category of “Latino”. Arguably so, too, has the NFL, which is banking on Bad Bunny’s popularity tohelp its expansionoutside the US and with itsfast-growingLatino audience at home. Just as Hollywood sees its future in Asia, the NFL recognizes that “they need to compete at a global scale,” said Negrón-Muntaner. “And if you want to do that, then you want the biggest global star available.”Bad Bunny, usually reticent to take on a position foisted on him, alluded to all that baggage and conflation at the Grammys. Accepting the award for best música urbana album, hesaid, uncharacteristically in English: “ICE out! We’re not savage, we’re not animals, we’re not aliens. We are humans and we are Americans.”Bad Bunny’s Puerto Rico residency is a rare example of fame used for good | Adrian HortonRead moreWhatever he actually meant, “I think what landed was that Latinos who are here and trying to build a life, or who have been born and raised here now for generations, should also be considered Americans, for purposes of rights and responsibilities,” said Negrón-Muntaner.His comments were naturally met with a new round of performative outrage from the Maga chattering class. (I am loath to quote, but here’sMegyn Kelly: “I feel like we might want to send ICE down to his compound. He’s worth a hundred million dollars, reportedly.”) The backlash “is communicating traditional ideas rooted in white supremacy and English speaking”, said Johnson, though the NFL understands that “they will be able to capture audiences who, were it not for Bad Bunny, would not otherwise be tuning in, and there’s immense value in that.” For Maga, said Bonilla, “the fact that the top artist in the world is Spanish-speaking, is American with an asterisk, is not their definition of America, stokes their fears of what America is becoming, and the irrelevance of other forms of American-ness on the global stage.”There is a double-edged element to that, even from thoseeager to embrace Bad Bunnyas a symbol of anti-Trump resistance writ large. “I see so many people on TikTok brushing up on their Spanish, learning the lyrics to the songs, and self-described gringos saying like, ‘OK, I’m going to learn.’ And there is something really beautiful in that,” said Bonilla. “But at the same time, I feel like the specificity of him as a colonial citizen, as someone who has been fighting not for greater rights within the US, but the right to forge our own path, has gotten lost in the messaging.”Migration, melding, shifting tides of influence and power – in their own ways, Maga and Bad Bunny are responding to the same 21st-century phenomenon: the detachment of culture from geography, leaving many people, regardless of physical location, feeling at once adrift and hyper-connected. The dark vision of Maga – one of strident identity protectionism – continues its culture war on all that it deems threatening, different or conveniently worthy of scapegoating. But no matter how Sunday’s performance goes, Bad Bunny, an uncompromising musician who has made an art of interconnection and a meal of expectations, has already won. “It’s going to be fun. It’s going to be easy,” he promised on Thursday, days ahead of the show.

And for the man trying to improve communication with his mom: histherapist prescribes“a mature dating site that connects sensitive cubs with roaring cougars” in case he can’t fix that relationship.From ‘nerdy’ Gemini to ‘edgy’ Grok: how developers are shaping AI behavioursRead moreAll four ads end with the same tagline: “Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude.” There’s no explicit mention ofChatGPT, but the subtext is clear.Even Sam Altman laughed. But he also called the ads “so clearly dishonest” before diving into a lengthy critiqueon X.“Our most important principle for ads says that we won’t do exactly this; we would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them,” Altman wrote. “We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that.”Altman stressed that OpenAI’s decision to include ads, announcedlast month, makes the product more accessible. “We believe everyone deserves to use AI and are committed to free access,” he wrote. And Altman didn’t shy away from taking some shots of his own. “Anthropic serves an expensive product to rich people. We are glad they do that and we are doing that too, but we also feel strongly that we need to bring AI to billions of people who can’t pay for subscriptions,” he wrote. (Claude has afree subscription version, too.)ChatGPT’s ad policy is not live yet, but OpenAI maintainson its websitethat ads will be “separate and clearly labeled” and won’t influence the answers users see. The company also states that it will not share conversations with ChatGPT with advertisers, and is focused on prioritising trust, claiming it will give users the option to turn off personalization or opt for an ad-free paid plan. The company said the chatbot would initially have ads show up at the bottom of answers “when there’s arelevant sponsored product or servicebased on your current conversation”.Altman wasn’t always sold on including ads in ChatGPT’s business model. In October 2024, he dismissed the idea as a “last resort”. But in recent years, as OpenAI invests even more heavily in AI infrastructure, the company’sgrowth in new subscribers has dwindled.Anthropic’s critique of OpenAI didn’t come out of nowhere: Anthropic was founded by former OpenAI researchers who left based on concerns about the company’s directionon AI safety. Anthropic wrote in a 4 Februaryblogpostthat Claude would remain ad-free because doing otherwise would prevent the chatbot from being a “genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking”. The company likened open-ended conversations with AI assistants, which are often deeply personal or complex, to those with a trusted adviser. “The appearance of ads in these contexts would feel incongruous – and, in many cases, inappropriate,” the company wrote.Even if OpenAI says it won’t share user data directly with advertisers, targeted advertising more broadly has been criticized for exploiting users’ vulnerabilities. In this case, that concern could extend to users asking ChatGPT questions about their mental and physical health, similar to the issues shown in Anthropic’s ads. But there’s also a chance targeted advertisingcould helpwith reining in AI’s most toxic attributes. Big corporations that buy in may pull out in response to hateful or egregious content. Many websites and apps, from Google to Instagram, already have ads, so it may not be a huge adjustment for users.It is unclear whether Altman’s attempts to deliver more revenue with ads will drive users to ad-free competitors. But Anthropic is betting on it.Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)AdvertisingChatbotsChatGPTOpenAISam AltmannewsShareReuse this content"

They were hard-fought victories by campaigners, particularly the consent-based element of it,” she added.In the petition, campaigners are also calling for improved relationships and sex education, as well as adequate funding for specialist services, such as the Revenge Porn Helpline, which support intimate image abuse victims.Jodie, who is in her 20s, discovered images of her being used as deepfake pornography in 2021. She and 15 other women testified against the perpetrator, 26-year-old Alex Woolf, after he posted images of women from social media to porn websites. He was convicted and sentenced to 20 weeks in prison.“I had a really difficult route to getting justice because there simply wasn’t a law that really covered what I felt had been done to me,” said Jodie.The offence against creating explicit deepfake images was introduced as an amendment to the Data (Use and Access) Act 2025. While the law received royal assent last July, the offence was not enforced until Friday.Many campaigners, including Jodie, were frustrated by delays to the law coming into effect. “We had these amendments ready to go with royal assent before Christmas,” said Jodie. “They should have brought them in immediately. The delay has caused millions more women to become victims, and they won’t be able to get the justice they desperately want.”In January, Leicestershire police opened an investigation into a case involving sexually explicit deepfake images that were created by Grok AI.Madelaine Thomas, a sex worker and founder of tech forensics companyImage Angel, who has waived her right to anonymity, said it was “a very emotional day” for her and other victims. However, she said the law falls short of protecting sex workers from intimate image abuse.“When commercial sexual images are misused, they’re only seen as a copyright breach. I respect that,” Thomas said. “However, the proportion of available responses doesn’t match the harm that occurs when you experience it. By discounting commercialised intimate image abuse, you are not giving people who are going through absolute hell the opportunity to get the help they need.”For the last seven years, intimate images of her have been shared without her consent almost every day. “When I first found out that my intimate images were shared, I felt suicidal, frankly, and it took a long time to recover from that.”One in three women in the UK have experienced online abuse, according to domestic abuse organisationRefuge.Stop Image-Based Abuse is a movement composed of the End Violence AgainstWomenCoalition, the victim campaign group #NotYourPorn, Glamour UK and Clare McGlynn, a professor of law at Durham University.A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “Weaponising technology to target and exploit people is completely abhorrent. It’s already illegal to share intimate deepfakes – and as of yesterday, creating them is a criminal offence too.“But we’re not stopping there. We’re going after the companies behind these ‘nudification’ apps, banning them outright so we can stop this abuse at source.“The technology secretary has also confirmed that creating non-consensual sexual deepfakes will be made a priority offence under the Online Safety Act, placing extra duties on platforms to proactively prevent this content from appearing.”Explore more on these topicsDeepfakeViolence against women and girlsCrimeWomenInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

It values SpaceX at $1tn and xAI at $250bn, with a stock market flotationexpected in Juneto time with Musk’s birthday and a planetary alignment.However, there are questions over the deal, such as whether it is good for SpaceX’s non-Musk shareholders and whether the technological premise behind it can succeed.Why is Musk linking up rockets and AI?For Musk, a key part of the deal’s rationale is to move datacentres – the central nervous system of AI tools – into space.AI companies are too dependent on earth-bound datacentres that carry immense energy demands, Musk argued this week. The solution, he says, is to put as many as a million satellites into orbit to form vast, solar-powered datacentres.Prof Julie McCann and Prof Matthew Santer, the co-directors of the school of convergence science in space, security and telecoms at Imperial College London, say solar-powered datacentres could be a future option for AI companies. However, there are limits to how much compute power can be mustered by current satellites, they say, so it would need a “planet-wide distributed computer composed of many satellites” – as envisioned by Musk.But even executing the concept might be affected by the quality of connection between the orbiting devices, which will need to operate in tandem in order to replicate terrestrial datacentres as they beam their outputs down to Earth.View image in fullscreenSpaceX launches Starlink satellites from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in October 2025.Photograph: Joe Marino/UPI/ShutterstockThere are other problems to be ironed out, they add, including solar radiation and maintenance. “Datacentres on earth are constantly maintained – component failure is normal. Shipping components to space is complex and expensive, and you would have to be innovative regarding how components are fitted.”Musk talks of these datacentres adding 100 gigawatts of AI capacity annually – currentglobal datacentre capacity is about 59GW– so his vision is ambitious. The world’s richest person believes a merger of rocket hardware and AI software is a winning combination and, in a message to employees, said it would create the “most ambitious, vertically integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth”.“This merger is aimed at creating a new path to generate a low cost of generating AI compute within the next two to three years by bringing together the top internet/space exploration company with top datacentre builders,” says Dan Ives, an analyst at the US financial services company Wedbush Securities.Does xAi need SpaceX’s financial help?Musk’s artificial intelligence company, xAi, is competing with rivals who are spending, and raising, huge sums on the infrastructure – datacentres, computer chips – needed for their products. The company, which has developed the Grok AI tool and also owns the social media network X, reportedly burned through $13bn last year and, unlike Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and Google, does not have a cash-generating legacy business to fund its efforts.View image in fullscreenElon Musk’s xAi is competing with rivals who are spending, and raising, huge sums on the infrastructure needed for their products.Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersCombining with SpaceX will give xAI better access to cash and investors, according to Ross Gerber, an investor in Tesla and SpaceX.“Musk is already running low on capital for xAI and it is competing with companies putting hundreds of billions of dollars into their AI investments. If you merge SpaceX and xAI you can support xAi because SpaceX is an extremely attractive prospect to a lot of investors,” he says.What do SpaceX shareholders think?SpaceX’s technology is complex but it is a straightforward business. It generates revenues from deploying reusable rockets for missions such as launching satellites and restocking the International Space Station. It also operates the Starlink satellite high-speed internet service. SpaceX made about $8bn in profit on $15bn to $16bn of revenue ​last year,according to Reuters.The addition of xAI adds narrative complexity to the SpaceX story, says Michael Sobel, the president and co-founder of Scenic Management, which buys secondary stakes in privately held companies and has invested in the AI company Anthropic.Sobel, who speaks to SpaceX investors regularly, says: “By folding in xAI, which carries a significant monthly cash burn, you change the financial profile of the company overnight. In the secondary market, ‘simple’ is usually rewarded. This merger requires investors to do a lot more homework on how xAI’s cash burn impacts SpaceX’s overall valuation and IPO timeline.”There is also the added burden of X, a social media platform that is a regular subject ofregulatory scrutinyandpolitical ire.Nonetheless, Sobel adds, the argument in favour of the deal is compelling.“For a long-term investor, this secures the most advanced AI ‘brain’ for the most advanced hardware ‘body’ in existence. The upside is a $1.25tn entity that controls the entire stack, from the launchpad to the neural network.”View image in fullscreenThe SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California.Photograph: Daniel Cole/ReutersGerber, who invested in Musk’soriginal buyout of X in 2022when the platform was better known as Twitter, says he welcomes the deal but is less sure about SpaceX investors.“For me as a Twitter shareholder, I could not be happier. I pretty much figured I had lost my money but that has now been parlayed into owning SpaceX shares. It’s awesome for me but if I was a SpaceX shareholder I would be pissed.”What next? A Tesla-SpaceX merger?Musk owns about 44% of the newly enlarged SpaceX business and 17% of Tesla, where he is the chief executive. Is the next step a combination of the two?Ives believes there is a “growing chance” that a one-stop shop for investing in Musk businesses will be created.  “Musk wants to own and control more of the AI ecosystem and step by step the holy grail could be combining SpaceX and Tesla,” he says.View image in fullscreenTesla vehicles in a parking area at the company’s factory in Fremont, California.Photograph: Noah Berger/APGerber believes the timing is right, with both companies currently worth $1.25tn. “This is the time to create a multitrillion-dollar company.

What a surpriseArwa MahdawiThe Obama video should take a toll on the president’s political career – but of course it won’tSat 7 Feb 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 7 Feb 2026 09.02 ESTShareExtra, extra, Trumpdoes racist thing againDespite Donald Trump’s war on woke, he hasn’t (yet) made Black History Month illegal. In fact, on Tuesday the president issued a proclamation declaring February 2026 to be a celebration of Black historyand called“upon public officials, educators, librarians, and all the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities”.Clearly he didn’t get his own memo because, two days later, during one of hisfreneticlate-night Truth Social ranting sessions, the president posted aracistvideo that depictedBarack and Michelle Obamaas apes. The minute-long video, made by a third party, amplified false claims that Trump won the 2020 election and showed the first Black president and first lady superimposed on the bodies of primates in a jungle setting, bobbing their heads to the song The Lion Sleeps Tonight.It would be wrong to call this a mask-off moment because there is no mask with Trump. He has called Somali immigrants “garbage”, talked about “shithole countries”, and described Covid-19 as the “kung flu”. He launched his2016 presidential campaignby calling Mexican immigrants drug dealers, criminals and rapists. He repeatedlyquestionedObama’s birth certificate. He initiated aso-called Muslim banand used the word “Palestinian”as a slur. And Palestinians mean so little to him that a plan to build megacities in the ruins of Gazacirculated in the White House.While Trump’s latest exhibition of racism was hardly surprising, it was still shocking. Indeed, the image was so blatantly racist that even some of Trump’s allies were disgusted. Senator Tim Scott, for example, who was on Trump’s shortlist to be VP in 2024 and is the only Black Republican senator, wrote that the video was the “most racist thing” he has seen from the Trump White House. You should probably pay a little bit more attention then, Tim! There’s plenty of competition for that accolade.A fewother Republicans, including Representative Mike Lawler, Republican of New York, also denounced the post. And a number of Democrats spoke out, with House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, the first Black leader of a party in Congress,calling Trump“a vile, unhinged and malignant bottom feeder”.The White House, meanwhile, responded with their go-to strategy of aggressive gaslighting. “This is from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from the Lion King,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Friday. “Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public.”Shortly after that statement, however, the story coming out of the administration changed. The video was taken down and itwas reportedthat a White House staffer “erroneously made the post”.By rights, the Trump administration deleting the post wouldn’t be the end of this story. By rights, the outrage over this would mount and Trump would face serious consequences for his actions. I’m sure I don’t need to tell you this, but for the benefit of press secretary Leavitt, I’m going to spell it out: Trump’s stupid memes and social media posts matter. They matter because the president helps set the parameters of acceptable discourse. They matter because his bigotry emboldens others. Most of all, they matter because they reflect his policies.But while Trump’s racist video should impact his presidency, it won’t, will it? This is, after all, a convicted felon and adjudicatedsexual predatorwe are talking about. A man who appears to be successfully shrugging off his connections with Jeffrey Epstein, a child rapist. Give it a few days and nobody will remember this story. It will have been eclipsed by another scandal and then another scandal and then another scandal. And, if we’re not careful, we will grow ever more desensitized to these scandals.It’s not just democracy that is dying in the US right now; it is common decency. Every day when I look at the news I wonder what on earth I am supposed to tell my four-year-old about how to succeed in a world where kindness and compassion seem to be hindrances to getting ahead. A world where it is the scum that rises to the top. The idea that we live in a meritocracy (a word coined by a man who used itsatirically) has long beendemonstrablyfalse. Now, however, we seem to live in a malice-ocracy: the nastier, the crueler, the more self-serving you are, the better your chances of success.It has not been a good week for the Norwegian royal family …The son of Norway’s crown princess, Marius Borg Høiby, iscurrently on trialaccused of 38 crimes (which he denies), including four counts of rape, domestic abuse and illegal filming.

Still, good old-fashioned taxis have so much to offerSat 7 Feb 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 7 Feb 2026 15.53 ESTShareIt’s Super Bowl weekend here in America, which means a few things: copious amounts of gut-busting food, controversial half-time show performances, extravagant commercials, and occasionally a bit of football.For the tens of thousands rich enough to afford tickets to the Big Game, transportation to and from Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California, will be paramount. Thankfully, our robotic saviors are here to rescue the throng from the indignity of sharing a ride with an actual human being. This year’s Super Bowl isa test of the driverless taxi industry, currently lorded over by Waymo – a company that’s about to get a$16bn cash injectionto further expand its business to cities all around the world. Smaller American metro areas likeSacramentoandNashvilleare next up to get Waymo service, as are global capitals like London and Tokyo. Fleets of robotaxis are seeming more and more inevitable, yet another soldier in the onslaught of shiny gadgets designed to sand off the sharp edges of modern life.I, for one, welcome our new robot overlords.Self-driving taxis are coming to London – should we be worried? | Jack StilgoeRead moreWith some reservations. When I first tried Waymo after it landed here in Los Angeles, I was prepared to loathe the entire experience. Yet more low-wage workers out of a job thanks to ruthless automation. Efficiency over humanity. Plus, the cars looked stupid. Clunky modified Jaguars with a bunch of bulbous sensors all over the thing. Waymo cars resemble an expensive PC gaming mouse on wheels. Some of them even come splattered withgarish, multicolored graphic artdesigned to make the cars seem more friendly and less like atraveling recession indicator. And yet, I found myself eerily at peace inside the cold, sterile environs of the car. There was no driver, which meant no mystery smells, haggling over the radio, or idle chit-chat.Now, I recognize that interacting with strangers is part of life, especially life in a major city. Adults should be capable of making small talk if necessary. Politeness is something I personally appreciate. But there are limits for even the most well-mannered souls. Most Uber and Lyft drivers are normal, kind and appreciative of the customers making use of their service. Then, there’s the occasional driver who asks too many personal questions, makes lewd jokes, or worse, thinks they might be the Second Coming.After a night out, years ago, my then girlfriend and I were returning home via rideshare. Our driver, who conspicuously ignored the digital driving directions on his phone, managed to turn our 10-minute trip into an extended 20-minute monologue about the nature of existence. At one point, his unprompted Ted Talk landed on the question of whether or not he could be Jesus Christ reborn. I suppose driving a rideshare cab could be considered the modern equivalent of being a carpenter, but I didn’t share that thought in the moment.Waymo’s AI system doesn’t believe itself to be God. At least not yet. That’s one in the plus column.Waymohas not laid out its plan for world domination, and it also allows me to link my Spotify account to the car’s audio. That’s probably another sophisticated data mining operation, feeding their database with every song I’ve ever listened to so it might serve my phone targeted ads for Sabrina Carpenter tickets while I’m on the toilet. But at least I can listen to Espresso as many times as I want in a row without being judged.I’ve now used Waymo multiple times, and I’ve felt slightly less guilty every time. That gives me pause, as I still read stories about Waymosdecimating the taxi industry,hitting peopleorslamming into parked cars.Cabs operated by living drivershit people, too, I say to myself. Every Waymo I’ve ever been in has been more cautious than just about every human cab driver I’ve ever been driven by. Traditional rideshare apps also have a serious issue with sexual assaults perpetrated by their contractors, with Uber recentlyordered by a jury to pay $8.5mto a woman who said she was attacked by a driver. Driverless robotaxis would prevent such horrible incidents from occurring.Still, there are other solutions to this problem that don’t kill jobs – specifically one staring us all right in the face.Just start using taxis again.I’m sure that sounds archaic.A taxi? Like those clunky yellow Priuses that run red lights and have interiors covered in rubber like a sanitarium?Yes, a taxi. Regular taxicabs can be hired via apps just like Uber and Lyft. They are heavily regulated by municipal oversight. Their drivers have a union that ensures fair treatment and equitable wages. Because this is their actual profession rather than a side-hustle mandated by the collapse of the American middle class, they perform their duties with a dash more stoic responsibility and are far less prone to describe their potential for being the Messiah.In the last 20 years, tech barons (and craven politicians) have repeatedly told us that regulations are bad for us, that it slows down innovation and robs the world of the shiny utopia that digital products offer. The reality is, regulations are not bad for us. They’re bad forthem– the billionaires that dream of being trillionaires. Regulations force them to temper their ambitions, to think rationally, and to consider the greater good of society rather than their ever-expanding bank accounts.It all can start to feel rather nihilistic. Last year, the CEO of Waymo told a live audience that societywill accept a hypothetical driverless car deathand it wouldn’t affect their business growth. Other tech CEOs rhapsodize about the possibilities of artificial intelligence todecimate entire industrieswith messianic glee that weirdly reminds me of the spiraling rideshare driver that ruminated on his own divinity. I think I might enjoy riding in Waymos precisely because I’m eager to spend time sealed away from the mass delusion event that is life in 2026. I’m like the protagonist of theGary Numan song, hopelessly addicted to the solitude of the automobile and incapable of interacting with the outside world. Unfortunately for the driver with the Jesus complex, he can’t afford to make his megalomaniacal dreams come true. But for those that can, it’s full steam ahead.Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsWaymoOpinionSelf-driving carsSan FranciscoLos AngelescommentShareReuse this content"

It’s his global political revolutionMark LeonardI am convinced that Europe’s ‘new right’ is a radically contemporary movement. Defeating it means understanding its critique of liberalismSat 7 Feb 2026 02.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 7 Feb 2026 10.15 ESTShareEuropean governments are terrified of Donald Trump’s threats on trade, Greenland and the future of Nato. But the biggest threat is not that Trump invades an ally or leaves Europe at the mercy of Russia. It is that his ideological movement could transform Europe from the inside.A year after Trump’s return to the White House, his “second American revolution” is radiating outward into Europe. The Epstein files reveal how this beganclumsily in 2018 with Steve Bannon; but it has become a much more sophisticated partnership with the second coming of Trump and the rise to power of JD Vance. The USNational Security Strategypublished by the White Housein Novembercalled for strengthening the growing influence of “patriotic” European parties such as Reform UK, Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), Marine Le Pen’sRassemblement National(RN),Fidesz in HungaryandVox in Spain. As with the communist movements of the cold war, these nationalist, populist and in some cases far-right parties are best understood not as isolated national phenomena but as expressions of a shared intellectual project – a movement that is, to varying degrees, now being reinforced by a foreign power.The movement is often portrayed as backward-looking or reactionary, intent on restoring an imagined past. In reality, its strength lies in being radically contemporary – finely tuned to the political, social and intellectual conditions of the 21st century. I have spent the past 18 months trying to understand this movement, talking to everyone from bespectacled Hungarian intellectuals to freshly shaven young RN politicians in France, from Orthodox Jewish political philosophers to Maga diehards in the US. Based on this research, I am convinced that far from being lodged in the past, it is hyper-modern and its standard-bearers have a compelling analysis of the failings of liberal democracy and a pathway to power. Hence the designation “new right”.Central to the movement’s self-understanding is the claim that liberalism has failed, along with the deeply interdependent globalised order it promoted after the cold war. In its telling, citizens have seen their national cultures and economies battered by an unbroken sequence of shocks that come from liberalisation: the global financial crash of 2008, the eurozone crisis two years later, therefugee crisis of 2015, the Covid pandemic in 2020, and the sharp rise in living costs followingRussia’s invasion of Ukrainein 2022. Each crisis, it argues, has exposed the limits of liberal governance, overwhelmed state capacity and fuelled suspicion about whose interests governments were really serving. Governments rescued the banks, they point out, but cut welfare payments and let people’s homes be repossessed. Ordinary people paid the cumulative price of these crises – through lost jobs, strained services or rising bills – while elites were shielded from the consequences.One of the most articulate exponents of this view is Benedikt Kaiser, accused of once moving inneo-Nazi circles,who has embraced electoral politics and is becoming one of the leading voices in the AfD’s intellectual ecosystem. Kaiser told me it was the convergence of these crises that had sapped the legitimacy of the postwar liberal order and mainstream parties, providing the essential opening for political insurgents to capture the political agenda.Off the back of these crises, the movement set out to construct a new electoral coalition, appealing above all to working-class voters who felt they had lost out, experiencing a relative decline in income, security and social standing. This appeal has been distilled into a clear policy agenda spanning immigration, trade, foreign policy and state reform, all bound together by a promise to restore a shared national identity. Borders became a tool for distinguishing the “real” members of the nation from outsiders. Tariffs were recast as a way to rebuild domestic production and elevate the dignity of work. Foreign policy was stripped down to a narrowly defined national interest. And institutional resistance was overcome by attacking the “deep state” and discrediting experts as guardians of a discredited liberal order.The political centre must reinvent itself as the real defenders of national sovereigntyThe success of the new right also rests on its mastery of a fractured media environment – and its use of the algorithmic information space. As the public sphere splintered into online subcultures, it learned to bypass traditional journalism and dominate digital platforms. By advancing a permissive interpretation of “free speech”, it forged alliances with technology magnates such as Elon Musk and saturated the online space with its narratives and slogans. Often armed with “alternative facts” and edgy memes, the new right now dominates the attention economy. I interviewed the US conservative writer Rod Dreher, who cited the case ofIsabel Vaughan-Spruce, a Christian activist who was arrested twice in Birmingham for praying outside an abortion clinic, to illustrate how the mainstream and digital right now inhabit entirely different realities. Although Vaughan-Spruce has become a cult figure in the new-right information sphere, most of the Guardian’s readers will not have heard of her.Perhaps their most effective manoeuvre has been to force mainstream parties into an unwinnable position – casting them as defenders of elites rather than workers, of continuity rather than change. For too long, established parties downplayed the scale of the threat. When they did respond, they often resorted to mimicking the new right’s divisive rhetoric, particularly on migration. Yet imitation has often had the inverse effect of strengthening the challengers instead of neutralising them.Any effective response, then, must begin by acknowledging the force of the new right’s critique of liberalism. This must be paired with a political project that speaks to working-class concerns and uses new methods of engagement, an approach that has worked successfully in Denmark and the Netherlands, as well as in Kentucky and New York.Maybe the clearest lesson comes from figures such as Mark Carney and Anthony Albanese, who have realised that their countries’ populists’ association with Trump’s revolution could be a liability for them.Polling conductedby the European Council on Foreign Relations suggests that Trumpism could follow a similar trajectory: in country after country, clear majorities now see Trump’s re-election as harmful. If centrist forces wake up to the international threat posed by the second American revolution and rally around a strategy that turns the new right’s strengths into vulnerabilities, there is still a chance that the political centre can reinvent itself as the real defenders of national sovereignty and use the links between new right parties and Trump to defeat them.Mark Leonard is the author of the reportThe new right: anatomy of a global political revolution.

It was one of the last things she said. The hospital had no veranda. Who knows which veranda she meant. She had lived in many different houses with verandas. After she died, I sat with her, stroking the skin of her right arm where it was savagely bruised from a fall the night before.Mum loved warm weather. I love the crisp air and diffusive light of winter. We were different enough that it’s not a stretch to call her summer and me winter. We found it hard to get along and never truly resolved our differences. But at times, I think we created a place to meet and share a quiet mutual acceptance, an in-between space not unlike a veranda.Going through photographs in the days before her funeral, I sought out a picture of Mum taking a moment in the sun, sitting in a deck chair in front of the veranda of the weatherboard house on the main street of a small town in north-western Victoria where we lived through the late 70s and early 80s, a town racked by drought more often than it wasn’t.My neighbour, 82, would give everything for just a week with her parents. What she longs to tell them surprises me | Yumi StynesRead moreShe’s not looking at the camera, or at me, 12 years old, holding the Kodak Brownie camera I’d been given for Christmas. Mum is smiling and reaching out to the joey we’d taken in to rear after its mother was killed on the road and the joey rescued from the pouch.I’d been walking around the yard, snapping pictures that would be developed down the street at the chemist when I finished the film.My father was the local butcher, up before dawn in the mornings to unload beasts from a truck, yet also renowned for being compassionate, someone who’d be willing to take home a joey that needed looking after. It was Mum who cared for and bottle-fed the joey, though. The joey stayed close to her, too close at times. One night I woke to her protests as the joey climbed into her bed and curled up over her face. “Fancy, a bloody kangaroo in your bed!” she said in the morning.I like that it was me who took this picture, now murky-toned, square, with rounded edges. It’s material evidence of an instant. When my child-self witnessed her looking happy, even joyful. I see her shaggy perm and can almost smell the green apple shampoo. I take in the terry-towelling dress with shoulder straps, the comfortable outfit she went to on hot days at the weekend. On weekdays, she’d wear her dark-blue shop dress with the front zipper, working at the counter of the butcher shop and coming home afterwards to prepare tea.If I imagine looking behind the camera, there I am, also wearing terry-towelling, shorts and a matching top that Mum’s bought for me. My feet are bare, never mind the scorching concrete and the spiky grass of our front lawn, concealing the sole-piercing prickles of bindi-eyes.Mum’s life was hard when I took the photograph. It’d been hard all along. I’d like to say it became easier and more consistently joyful. But it didn’t. I saw happiness in her face many times in later years, mostly when she was around her grandchildren or meeting up with the women friends who stayed nearby for all her adult life. However, trauma and hardship, with all sorts of sharp and harsh textures, never ended for Mum.She and I didn’t grow closer over time. If anything, our differences became more marked. Yet we could sit down together and enjoy hot drinks (hers coffee, mine tea) and a lemon slice she’d made because she knew I liked it, or pastries I’d bought, eclairs or pink meringues, her old favourites, and we’d talk, sometimes for hours, as long as the subject matter didn’t go anywhere too prickly.She’d go silent if that happened, and if it was bad enough, she’d snap at me and then I’d go silent. The space we shared may not sound like much, and it was far from all we had between us, but I take solace in recalling the small portal of togetherness where for the most part we could sit and be content as mother and daughter.Some people say Mum and I looked alike. I’ve never been able to see it. Yet in that space, maybe we could see ourselves in each other for a while.The weather’s warming up. I’m taking the days gently as I approach my first summer since she died. With Mum gone, the season will surely take on new qualities of light and dark.Indigo Perry is the author of Darkfall and Midnight WaterExplore more on these topicsDeath and dyingOpinionParents and parentingFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

They’ve fanned xenophobia and fear over housing and immigration. They’ve stoked and weaponised societal division over Israel and Gaza.Their daily parliamentary behaviour is emblematic of what goes on behind the scenes.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailBut as the government’s hubris in parliament this week demonstrates, to have an opposition in such disarray is not going to advance our nation.Both major parties seem to forget that is their job.And along with the accountability void, we are amid a dangerous vacuum.One Nationfilling it is a nightmare in the making.Imagine a Senate where Pauline Hanson and Barnaby Joyce have the balance of power, or a One Nation coalition dictating the policies of both the Liberals and Nationals.As I told my Liberal opponent, Tim Wilson, when I called him to concede the seat after a recount, a functioning opposition is critically important to our democracy. I wished him luck in doing that job.Less than a year later, I’m not convinced it’s retrievable. At least not to deliver a reasoned, policy-focused alternative to Labor.Even millions in spending to influence elections via fossil fuel-funded proxies like Advance and Australians for Prosperity,as happened in Goldstein in 2025, will not fix the values deficit between the Nationals and the Liberals. Nor will it solve the flaws in the candidate selection process that is dictated by a handful of members who align with Sky News.View image in fullscreenSussan Ley reacts to Anthony Albanese during question time in parliament.Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAPSome suggest that the community independents have helped create the problem, by removing so-called moderate Liberals.Not so.Those who call themselves moderates are that in name only. They vote along party lines, and I see no evidence that they’ve actively tried to change them. People like me and the other independents stepped forward as an alternative because of this. The so-called moderates have gone with the flow, to the populist right.They’ve now been overtaken by their own strategy, bleeding out to Pauline. They are truly paying the price for allowing theNational partytail to wag the dog, failing to learn that the junior partner’s culture war positions on things like Indigenous rights and climate do not resonate where they need the seats – in the cities.It could be laughable if it wasn’t so serious.Because while this ongoing political drama series plays out, Australians are struggling to pay their bills, our children are weighed down with mental health issues, they can’t buy homes, our nation is flooding and burning, and long-term structural policy change on things like tax, housing and intergenerational equity remain in the too-hard basket for both major parties.It’s no surprise that new data shows that it’s the cross-benchers who drive most of thediscussion about policyin the parliament. But media outlets barely report it, attached as most of them are to the legacy party structure and combative political theatre to drive clicks.Could One Nation be a genuine threat to Australia’s conservative parties?Read moreMeanwhile, the government, while refusing to tackle tough but needed structural change in challenging areas, tinkers at the edges, thinks short-term and grins at its opponent’s apparent collapse, which gives it cover for its own lack of brave reform.Why wouldn’t it? Doing something comes with risk. But so does doing nothing.And I suspect that over time, doing not much won’t be enough for many Australians. This is not, after all, a first-term government any more.For those enduring the day-to-day pressures of ever-higher costs and fewer benefits, for those who foresee that the future will be worse than the past, for those who want and need action over hope, it won’t be enough.In that, One Nation’s rise is a threat to us all. Arguably, new election donation laws that will make it harder for independents to compete compound that threat.When I was US bureau chief for the ABC during the first Trump election and administration, I noted that people across a broad spectrum had voted for Trump.Some had voted for Obama, looking for action through hope.

Step out of the loop, and change your lifeSat 7 Feb 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 7 Feb 2026 05.04 ESTShareYou get a coffee. The barista tells you how much you need to pay. You say thank you. They take your card for payment. They say thank you. They give you the coffee. You say thank you. They say thank you for your thank you. Then you say thank you for their thank you. By this point, the words “thank you” have lost all meaning, and both parties are exhausted by the pointless stream of politeness.Growing up in India, I learned that thank yous are only for distant strangers, and that close friends and family get offended if you thank them. I would say thank you to a speaker delivering a formal talk but never to a friend helping during a crisis or a family member making me dinner. But living in the UK for two decades has forced me to adopt our incessant “thank you” culture. I now find myself saying thank you at least 10 times a day and sometimes many more.Nevertheless,there are some British “thank yous” that I would ban completely, if I could.The passive-aggressive thank you when you have forgotten to do something minor, such as holding a door open for someone. The word is usually lobbed at the back of your head as you walk through the door. It’s loud and pointed – and meant to shame you in public. It’s the least genuinely thankful thank you in the world.Then there is the presumptuous “thanks in advance” in a work email or a letter from the bank, which assumes that you will do the writer’s bidding. Being thanked before you have agreed to anything is like being given a command – you are expected just to roll over and follow someone’s diktat like an obedient dog.Let’s not forget the dismissive “thank you” said with a clipped tone and grim face, usually at work meetings as soon as you have delivered what you think is an excellent presentation or made an intelligent point. It took me years of working in the British corporate world to understand that this usually meant: “Shut up, your point of view is totally irrelevant to me!”There is also the automatic “thank you” reflex that defies all logic. If someone bumps into me on a crowded bus or tube, I automatically say thank you. Clearly I am completely British now.The hill I will die on: Bum gun, bidet or shattaf – whatever you call it, install one now | Mona EltahawyRead moreDon’t get me wrong: I’m not saying that we shouldn’t thank those who help us. The problem is that we thank too many people, often mindlessly, and innumerable times a day. Thank you, shop assistant (whose job it is to help you shop). Thank you, bus driver (who is getting paid to drive the bus). Thank you, cafe owner (whom you are paying for the food you have ordered). By what feels like the hundredth thank you of the day, the words lose their very essence. You end up feeling more resentful than grateful – and it’s adding to the climate crisis, too.Research by UK energy supplier Ovosays that Britons send 64m one-word “thanks” emails a day. If we cut back by just one email a day, we’d save more than 16,433 tonnes of carbon annually, the energy equivalent of 81,000 flights from London to Madrid.Things came to a head when I found myself muttering “thank you” to the self-checkout machine at my local supermarket after buying tomatoes. The week before, I had said thank you to the ATM while it spat out my cash. That’s when I decided: no more never-ending loops of thank you for me. (I’m aware that they might take away my UK passport for this heinous cultural crime.)The next time you find yourself vomiting out your 99th “thank you” of the day, ask yourself this: is that one thank you too many? Would your thank you recipient maybe thank you more for just sayingnothing at all? It will seem difficult and awkward at first, but one day this advice will change your life. Just (please) don’t thank me for it.Sangeeta Pillai is a south Asian feminist activist, author ofBad Daughterand the creator ofMasala PodcastDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

People living close by, however, are taking it in their strideSarah RodriguesSat 7 Feb 2026 10.00 ESTShareAdd the Guardian on GoogleThe four-mile trail from the village of Haworth to Top Withens in West Yorkshire is well trodden; numerous footprints squelched into the boggy ground by those seeking the view said to have inspired the setting for Emily Brontë’s 1847 novel Wuthering Heights.The landscape rolls in desolate waves of brown bracken. A lone tree punctuates the scene. It’s bleakly, hauntingly beautiful.With the release of Emerald Fennell’s new film of the Gothic masterpiece starringMargot Robbieand Jacob Elordi next week, Haworth and many of the filming locations in the Yorkshire Dales national park, where the book is set, are braced for a slew of visitors.The local residents, though, seem distinctly unfazed by the attention.“We’re used to crowds,” shrugs Craig Verity, the landlord at the Kings Arms, a pub at the top of Haworth’s steep cobbled Main Street, just steps from the parsonage where the Brontës were raised.Brontë country has been milking the connection for decades. On a wall in the Kings Arms, a board promotes a selection of Bridgehouse cask ales named Charlotte, Anne, Emily and Branwell, the latter being the lesser-known Brontë brother.In the surrounding streets, there’s the Brontë Hotel and the Brontë Bar and Restaurant, as well as – somewhat tenuously – Brontë Balti.View image in fullscreenHaworth’s steep cobbled Main Street, just steps from the parsonage where the Brontë sisters were raised.Photograph: Ian Dagnall Commercial Collection/AlamyThe Brontë Parsonage, where the sisters lived, wrote and – in Emily and Charlotte’s case – died, is now a museum housing artefacts, personal items and manuscripts, as well as hosting events such as workshops, talks and screenings of adaptations of the books. It draws around 75,000 visitors annually, a number almost sure to rise this year; a screening of 1992’s Wuthering Heightsplanned for 12 February has already sold out.Scenes from this version, starring Ralph Fiennes and Juliet Binoche, were filmed at East Riddlesden Hall, about five miles from Haworth. The exterior of the 17th-century National Trust property also featured in the 2009 mini-series as Wuthering Heights itself, as well as in the now-lost 1920 silent version.The 1939 Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon film was shot in California and on set in Hollywood.“We only know about the use of the property because of a January 1921 article in the Shipley Times and Express,”said Sophie Fawcett, a senior marketing and communications officer with the National Trust.Coinciding with the release of Fennell’s new adaptation, East Riddlesden Hall will be holding a Lights, Camera, Brontë exhibition, which will showcase, for instance, the “vast oak dresser” thought to have inspired the one described in the opening pages of the book. It came originally from Ponden Hall – about an hour’s walk from Haworth and now a bed and breakfast – to which the sisters were frequent visitors.One room here features a box bed and window, likely to have inspired the scene in which the ghost of Cathy appears to a terrified Lockwood.For this new film, the cast stayed at Simonstone Hall, a sumptuous country house hotel inYorkshireDales. It’s a 20-minute drive from here to Swaledale, where many of the scenes were shot.“They were lovely people, and brilliantly undemanding,” said the owner, Jake Dinsdale, noting that Robbie had since been back for a stay with her husband. “Although they’d booked out all 20 rooms, our restaurant was still open to the public, and the cast enjoyed being around the firepit to toast s’mores, or sitting down to a roast dinner or afternoon tea.”View image in fullscreenHaworth, pictured here, and many of the filming locations in the Yorkshire Dales national park are braced for a slew of visitors.Photograph: grough.co.uk/AlamyHis own attitude is equally relaxed. “I don’t know what the film will do,” he said. “It could all be a flash in the pan, and that’s fine. If it sticks, that’s also great. What I do know is that I won’t be renaming any rooms as ‘TheJacob ElordiRoom’ or ‘The Heathcliff Room’.“Commercial naffness isn’t for us – I’ll just be happy if guests understand why so many people love the Yorkshire Dales.”In the meantime, Simonstone Hall is offering a Wuthering Heights Romantic Getaway package until 13 March: two nights for £738 per couple, including champagne on arrival, candlelit dinners, bedtime brandy and truffles, leisurely breakfasts and late checkout. Copies of the novel are also available in the gift shop.Tony Watson, head of economy and tourism for North Yorkshire council, said: “The area has featured in so many films and series; we’re experienced in managing that. Post-Covid, we were already seeing more younger people getting outdoors and exploring the county, and this demographic will doubtless grow as the film showcases the area’s beauty and authenticity.“We’ll have to wait until the release to see whether there’s some iconic shot that people want to replicate. If there is, hopefully it will be somewhere like Aysgarth Falls, which has all of the necessary infrastructure in place – otherwise, we’ll need to suggest alternatives that don’t make mountain rescue unhappy.”Back at The Kings Arms,Jack Greatrex, who lives in the area, is sanguine. “The Brontë sisters shaped this village for future generations, and for lovers of landscape and literature,” he said. “This film could mean that they continue to do so.”Whatever effect the new film has, said Watson, they’re ready for it. “I’m the luckiest head of tourism imaginable – the film is going to do my job for me.”Explore more on these topicsWuthering HeightsYorkshireMargot RobbieJacob ElordiEmily BrontëfeaturesShareReuse this content"

By then, I had already been sexually abused by a teacher for two years, and despite showing all the signs of trauma – night terrors, twitching, wetting the bed, constant stomach aches – I obediently kept his secret. To me, the world was a war zone of pain. I was a shy, awkward, lonely kid, but alone in my bedroom with that piece of music, I found a little bit of light that was just for me. Hearing it for the first time was almost a religious experience.People think classical music is dry, but Bach was anything but. Half of his 20 children died in infancy: there was no way to get rid of that grief other than through his music. Bach composed the Chaconne when his wife died suddenly, and he didn’t get to say goodbye or even go to the funeral. Even if you don’t know any of that, listening to it, on some level you will know. When you think it’s the end, it just carries on, like having one more thing to say to a person after they die. There’s so much truth and so much emotion hidden inside those 16minutes of music.At seven, music offered me a way to deal with what I was feeling but didn’t yet have the words for. I became obsessed. Every night, I would sit in my room listening to recordings of Bach, then Horowitz and Ashkenazy, pretending to play along. It was pure escape, pure fantasy. I could hide inside the music, and it made everything bearable. The Chaconne specifically was like an ancient key that slid into my heart.I had my first piano teacher at 14 and was offered a scholarship to the Guildhall at 18, but my parents wouldn’t let me go, preferring me to attend a “proper university” instead. So I stopped playing for 10 years, and worked in the City in a job I hated. I returned to piano in my late 20s with the same devotion I’d had as a child. Learning as an adult was more difficult, but I was more determined. Feeling as if you owe your life to something that you’ve lived and breathed and inhaled since you were seven carries you further than talent and ambition ever could.I thought: if something this pure exists, then I don’t have to dieAt 31, in a psychiatric ward, I heard another piece of music that changed my life. I had been trying to kill myself. I didn’t want to die, I just couldn’t go on living. A friend smuggled in an iPod nano with Glenn Gould playing the Bach-Marcello Concerto in D minor on it. I’d never heard anything so beautiful in my entire life. I was heavily medicated, but it was as if I was seven years old again, hearing classical music for the first time.That recording told me the same deep truth that the Chaconne had as a child, but now, as an adult, I was able to put it into words: if something this pure exists, then I don’t have to die. It gave me the impetus to get out, to keep living. I must have heard and performed that piece thousands of times, and every time it blows my mind. My first album came out a few years later, and I’ve just released my eighth. I’m playing on the same stages my heroes have played on – at the same venues, sometimes even in the same month and on the same Steinway.My cultural awakening: A Queen song helped me break free from communist CubaRead moreBut sexual abuse as a child is not something you can ever recover from or put behind you. It’s always there. My abuser was eventually arrested and charged with multiple counts of rape. He died before he faced trial. Everyone has their own version of trauma, but somehow we find a way to survive it. Music gave me the tools to feel less alone, to navigate a childhood filled with shame and secrets and power dynamics. In the Chaconne, I heard suffering transformed into something alive and beautiful. In Marcello, I heard hope at the exact moment I needed it. Both pieces taught me that there’s plenty of good in the world if we know where to look for it.Finding that tape was a sliding-doors moment. It’s impossible to say how my life would have been different if I’d never heard the Chaconne, but it probably saved my life, and it has given me a career that I love. As a child, I thought: if something this incredible can exist, then it can’t all be bad. I believed that at seven, and I still believe it now.TheNSPCCoffers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Afew days after Christmas 2022,Bad Bunny, the Puerto Rican reggaetonero, appeared without warning on one of the most unlikely of stages:the roofof a Gulf Oil gas station in San Juan. To a massive crowd singing every word, he performed a surprise concert, along with friend and collaborator Arcángel, that was part hype-ymusic video shoot, part exultant post-tour homecoming, and part pointed critique. He ended the set withEl Apagón(“The Power Outage”), a clubbyprotest anthemabout local displacement andtherollingblackoutsthathaveplagued Puerto Rico, a US “commonwealth” (read: colony), since Hurricane Maria in 2017.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Bad Bunny sang it from a roof on Santurce’s Calle Loíza, a thoroughfare in a former working-class Black neighborhood now dotted with Airbnbs. But you do not need thefull contextto get the show’s contagious energy. Though I have never walked Calle Loíza, nor do I speak Spanish, the gas station show is still my favorite concert to rewatch viaonline fan clips: electric, organic, genuinelypopular.In terms of reach, critical acclaim and longevity, Bad Bunny rivals – andsometimes outsells– the likes of Taylor Swift, Kendrick Lamar, Beyoncé and Drake, though it is hard to imagine those peers appearing so unguarded, sopublic,as he does on that roof.That particular combination of pure charisma, irreducible identity and undeniable beats has propelled Bad Bunny, born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, to the height of global superstardom, transcending language barriers to a heretofore unseen degree in the continental US. His genre-smashing music – all in Caribbean Spanish – flows everywhere from New York street corners to my parents’ kitchen in suburban Ohio, projected and celebrated on a series of bigger and bigger stages: a record-setting US arena tour in 2022, includingtwo sold-out nightsat Yankee Stadium. At Coachella in 2023, where he became thefirst Spanish-language headliner, opening atop a replica of that Gulf gas station. At theGrammys, where just last week he became the first Spanish-language artist towin album of the year, for his homecoming opus Debí Tirar Más Fotos (“I Should Have Taken More Photos”). And on Sunday, he will step on to the biggest stage yet of his career: theSuper Bowlhalf-time show.‘It’s gonna be a huge party’: Bad Bunny set for Super Bowl stage as Trump skips eventRead moreThat a Spanish-language artist will occupy one of the vanishingly few monocultural venues left in the polarized US feels inevitable yet still improbable. Inevitable, in that Bad Bunny has been themost-streamed artistin the world for four of the past five years, and has broad appeal in the US, where there are about 55 million Spanish speakers – the second-largest population in the world, behind only Mexico. “From the business standpoint, it almost wouldn’t make sense for it to be anyoneotherthan Bad Bunny, especially in a moment when the NFL is trying to reach both global audiences and younger audiences,” said Perry Johnson, amusic scholarat work on a cultural history of the Super Bowl half-time show. Improbable, in that theTrump administrationhas so fiercely demonized Hispanic immigrants and so thoroughly politicized Spanish, that choosing a Spanish-speaking performer seems like an uncharacteristic risk for a brand-safe corporation like the NFL.Unsurprisingly, given that Bad Bunny – an American citizen, as are all Puerto Ricans –skipped the USon his DTMF tour to protect Spanish-speaking fans from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the announcement was immediately met with hostility by members of the US government.“It’s so shameful that they’ve decided to pick somebody who just seems to hate America so much, to represent them at the half-time game,” said the homeland security adviser Corey Lewandowski. The homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, promised that ICE would be “all over”the Super Bowl. In protest,Turning Point USA, the rightwing organization founded by the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk, has planned an alternative “All-American Halftime Show”, starring Donald TrumpallyKid Rock andhypedby JD Vance.Bad Bunny has promised a“huge party”where, according to the jubilanttrailer, “the world will dance”. But no matter the quality of the music (and for the record, it is very danceable), the symbolism of a Puerto Rican performer of Spanish-language music on the biggest stage in US pop culture has already exceeded the show itself. The show “has become more about politics than about music”, said Yarimar Bonilla, the director of the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College.“His very presence on the stage is a statement,” said Petra Rivera-Rideau, co-author of thebookP FKN R: How Bad Bunny Became the Global Voice of Puerto Rican Resistance. “The fact is that we’re currently in a moment where Spanish is seen as a mark of being foreign, of not belonging, where people are getting profiled for being Spanish speakers – that ups the ante and importance. It can’t really be overstated.”Fans race to learn Spanish before Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl half-time showRead moreIntentionally or no, Bad Bunny has found himself at the center of polarized America’s perpetual culture wars, playing out once again at the most American of entertainment spectacles, theSuper Bowl– where, as Johnson says, “ideas around patriotism, citizenship and Americanness get played out”. American football remains freighted with ideas of respectability, race, good old boys. And since the first Super Bowl in Los Angeles in 1967, the half-time show has served as a staging ground for ideas of what does or does not represent “America”.It has thus courtedbacklash, especially along lines of race and gender – think thedisproportionate furorover the infamous exposure of Janet Jackson’s bare breast in 2004. Complaints to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) spike with every Super Bowl, especially as the interests of a white, conservative minority clash with the business interests of the NFL and the public’s preference for the now-global sound of hip-hop. (Andespeciallysince Jay-Z’s Roc Nationcontroversiallytook overthe half-time show in 2019; since then, there have been no white headliners, and viewership has surged.) There was white discomfort with Beyoncé’sBlack Pantherscostumes when she took over Coldplay’s 2016 half-time show with Formation (as memorialized in the SNL skit“The Day Beyoncé Turned Black”.) There was backlash to Shakira and Jennifer Lopez, two Latina women over 40, when theyperformedin English in 2020; backlash toDr Dre and friendsin 2022, withFCC complaintsof “reverse racism”; backlash last year to Kendrick Lamar, whoseinvocationof mass incarceration and anti-Black racismdrew 133.5 million viewers, the most of any Super Bowl half-time show ever.View image in fullscreenBad Bunny at the Super Bowl press conference this week.Photograph: Christopher Victorio/ShutterstockA Spanish-language performer, even a hugely popular one, supercharges all of this, especially when the administration is deliberatelytargetingand terrorizing predominantly Spanish-speaking undocumentedimmigrants. Objection on grounds of “foreignness” or “un-Americanness” – even and especially for Latino US citizens – “happens whenever you have a Latin artist on a stage that’s considered very patriotic”, said Rivera-Rideau. In 1968, the Puerto Rican-born, Harlem-bred musician José Feliciano performed a Latin guitar-tinged national anthem in English at the World Series – only to facecalls for deportationthat nearly derailed his career. (In a full-circle moment, Bad Bunny brought out Feliciano at Coachella.) When Marc Anthony, a New Yorker of Puerto Rican descent, sang God Bless America at the MLB All-Star game in 2013 – again in English – he was met with a string ofsocial mediaabuse. One Twitter user wrote: “Shouldn’t an AMERICAN be singing God Bless America? #getoutofmycountry.”The Turning Point USA half-time show – a “family-friendly, values-driven” event “created for viewers seeking uplifting, patriotic entertainment” – boasts a pop-country lineup that will sing “anything in English”. The phrase echoes the “English Only” movement of the 20th and 21st centuries, an effort toadopt English as the only official US languagewith thinly veiled anti-immigrant and anti-Latino sentiment.The backlash toBad Bunnyis part “of a very old story”, said Frances Negrón-Muntaner, a Puerto Rican film-maker, scholar and author, one which positions Latinos “as foreign, as unassimilable, as people who somehow do not and cannot contribute to American life – even though, factually, that’s not true at all”.From the beginning of his career, Bad Bunny has spoken directly to the purgatorial status of Puerto Rico, which has been a US territory since 1898. (The terms are deliberately confusing – as one defining supreme court caseput it, the archipelago paradoxically “belong[s] to the United States, but [is] not a part of the United States”.) He hassponsored billboardsin Puerto Rico against US statehood. On DTMF, hemournsLo Que le Pasó a Hawaii– “what happened to Hawaii”, which became a state in 1959 and is now a tourist haven thathasutterlymarginalizedthe native population. Last summer, his landmark30-show residencyat San Juan’s Coliseo de Puerto Rico partnered with local hotels to put off Airbnb-ers, prioritized local affordability and kept the first nine showsavailableonly to island residents.But the hyper-specificity of Bad Bunny’s music and persona – the references; the unique frustrations; the slang that is, as Bonillawrote, “full of so many skipped consonants, Spanglish, neologisms and argot that it borders on Creole” – has not blunted its appeal. If anything, the issues that he sings about (success, partying and women, yes – but also mass tourism, gentrification, the pressure to leave and the desire to go home) resonate in the US and beyond. His lyrics “go to the essence of something”, said Negrón-Muntaner. DTMF standoutNuevayol, for example, takes its name and themes from the Boricuan pronunciation of Nueva York, but “even if you’re Mexican or Colombian or Venezuelan or Peruvian or wherever in Latin America, you know what Nueva York is,” she said. “It’s like your version of New York – the immigrant version of New York.”It’s no surprise, then, that US conservatives, who take a hard line on immigration and lump anyone speaking Spanish into one massive “other”, have conflated Bad Bunny’s Puerto Rican-ness with the incoherently amorphous category of “Latino”. Arguably so, too, has the NFL, which is banking on Bad Bunny’s popularity tohelp its expansionoutside the US and with itsfast-growingLatino audience at home. Just as Hollywood sees its future in Asia, the NFL recognizes that “they need to compete at a global scale,” said Negrón-Muntaner. “And if you want to do that, then you want the biggest global star available.”Bad Bunny, usually reticent to take on a position foisted on him, alluded to all that baggage and conflation at the Grammys. Accepting the award for best música urbana album, hesaid, uncharacteristically in English: “ICE out! We’re not savage, we’re not animals, we’re not aliens. We are humans and we are Americans.”Bad Bunny’s Puerto Rico residency is a rare example of fame used for good | Adrian HortonRead moreWhatever he actually meant, “I think what landed was that Latinos who are here and trying to build a life, or who have been born and raised here now for generations, should also be considered Americans, for purposes of rights and responsibilities,” said Negrón-Muntaner.His comments were naturally met with a new round of performative outrage from the Maga chattering class. (I am loath to quote, but here’sMegyn Kelly: “I feel like we might want to send ICE down to his compound. He’s worth a hundred million dollars, reportedly.”) The backlash “is communicating traditional ideas rooted in white supremacy and English speaking”, said Johnson, though the NFL understands that “they will be able to capture audiences who, were it not for Bad Bunny, would not otherwise be tuning in, and there’s immense value in that.” For Maga, said Bonilla, “the fact that the top artist in the world is Spanish-speaking, is American with an asterisk, is not their definition of America, stokes their fears of what America is becoming, and the irrelevance of other forms of American-ness on the global stage.”There is a double-edged element to that, even from thoseeager to embrace Bad Bunnyas a symbol of anti-Trump resistance writ large. “I see so many people on TikTok brushing up on their Spanish, learning the lyrics to the songs, and self-described gringos saying like, ‘OK, I’m going to learn.’ And there is something really beautiful in that,” said Bonilla. “But at the same time, I feel like the specificity of him as a colonial citizen, as someone who has been fighting not for greater rights within the US, but the right to forge our own path, has gotten lost in the messaging.”Migration, melding, shifting tides of influence and power – in their own ways, Maga and Bad Bunny are responding to the same 21st-century phenomenon: the detachment of culture from geography, leaving many people, regardless of physical location, feeling at once adrift and hyper-connected. The dark vision of Maga – one of strident identity protectionism – continues its culture war on all that it deems threatening, different or conveniently worthy of scapegoating. But no matter how Sunday’s performance goes, Bad Bunny, an uncompromising musician who has made an art of interconnection and a meal of expectations, has already won. “It’s going to be fun. It’s going to be easy,” he promised on Thursday, days ahead of the show. Backlash or no, the party goes on.Explore more on these topicsBad BunnySuper Bowl LXPuerto RicoSuper BowlUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The novel’s reputation precedes it as a book infamously few ever finish, and those who do tend to belong to a particular breed of college-age guys who talk over you, a sect of pedantic, misunderstood young men for whom, over the course of 30 years, Infinite Jest has become a rite of passage, much as Little Women or Pride and Prejudice might function for aspiring literary young women.Most readers come to the novel in their formative years, but I was a late bloomer. It wasn’t until the winter of 2023 that, at the age of 34, smoking outside a party in Brooklyn, I found myself suddenly motivated to embark on the two-pound tome. A boy I knew from high school brought it up, and as I happened at the time to have developed a casual interest in those works one might attribute to the “lit-bro” canon (Bret Easton Ellis, Hemingway, etc), it seemed the appropriate time to take it on.It’s difficult to pin down what exactly constitutes this canon beyond the readership that tends to gravitate toward it, and by extension the readership it repels, but its defining feature seems to be the centering of male loneliness. A male protagonist, isolated and misunderstood, stands at odds with social norms and expectations and either grapples internally to critique them or identifies the source of ideology and seeks violent revenge against it. The spaces these works operate in are largely male-dominated – war zones, finance offices, fight clubs. They are largely accessible on a stylistic level and deeply familiar on a psychological one and, as such, have proven popular mainstream fare – massive bestsellers, ripe for adaptation, often critically championed besides. In recent years, the backlash against such success, carried out online and in other public discourse, and the backlash against that backlash have done as much as any single intrinsic commonality to create the perception of similitude throughout the canon.View image in fullscreenMichelle Zauner.Photograph: Sam HellmanMy guess is I became interested in this genre because I wanted to see for myself what exactly this community of young men was attracted to. And so I purchased a copy of Infinite Jest at the start of the new year. I aimed to read 50 pages a day. Some days 50 pages felt breezy, cinematic, riveting; other days they felt like a slog. Though neither the Enfield Tennis Academy nor the Ennet House Drug and Alcohol Recovery House is an inherently male-dominated space, the majority of the characters are men, all of them, of course, completely levelled by loneliness, but in terms of pace and accessibility, the novel stands starkly apart from the genre with which I had come to associate it.For one thing, reading is often interrupted by endnotes, of which there are 388 in tiny 8pt font. They range in complexity and salience from a one-word translation of the Québécois word for wheelchair to a nine-page inventory of a fictional film director’s collection of archival footage.“The endnotes are very intentional and they’re in there for certain structural reasons … It’s almost like having a second voice in your head,” Wallace said in an interview with Charlie Rose in 1997. He hesitates to go into more detail lest he appear pretentious, until Rose wheedles him to “quit worrying about how you’re gonna look and just be”.In interviews Wallace often comes across as a kind of Charlie Kaufman protagonist. Isolated by his own intelligence, longing for connection, neurotic but vulnerable, gently well-spoken, often apologising for roundabout answers that nonetheless exhibit great clarity or calling out his own tendency to sweat before someone else can beat him to the chase. “There’s a way, it seems to me, that reality is fractured,” Foster Wallace continues. “The difficulty about writing about that reality is that text is very linear, it’s very unified. I, anyway, am constantly on the lookout for ways to fracture the text that aren’t totally disorienting.”“One of the things I was trying to do in this book was have something be long and difficult but have it be fun enough that somebody would be almost seduced into doing the work.”Contrast, for example, the novel’s opening scene, which reads with the orgasmic intensity of a teen movie on hallucinogenics, with one some 80 pages later, a meeting between a Québécois separatist agent and a government operative set against a backdrop of Arizona shale. What appears to be a lesser endnote, a backstory concerning one of the agent’s superiors is itself twice noted, leading to an eight-page history of the separatist movement in question, narrated in and out of free indirect discourse, in the form of a semi-plagiarised term paper, which of course contains its own notes, one of which, most infuriatingly, requires us to turn an additional eight pages just to connect pimple cream to its chemical formula.Trust-fall into the barbed intricacies of the writing, and you will discover its soft, exquisite humanityA bathos of almost absurd proportions, but cumulatively, all of Infinite Jest’s digressions and pages of impenetrable density test the reader’s attention, conjuring the very irritations and panics and highs and plateaux that Wallace describes at length in the minds of his characters, and then, after long spells of banal tediousness, compensate the diligent with some excruciating, unfathomable detail plucked from the secret interior of a flawed human being pulsing with life. If you allow yourself to trust-fall into the barbed intricacies of the writing, you will discover soft, exquisite humanity as its perennial landing.These many valences of density are part of a larger meditation on life and art in the age of entertainment. For gen X, that mostly meant television, under the hegemony of which they came of age, when concerns about the death of the novel and the idea that fiction’s time had passed felt truly pressing.It is tempting to see Infinite Jest as one final act of heroism in the name of fiction. Certainly, I think it’s no stretch to say it’s unlikely we’ll see another book like this in our lifetimes. Ten years from now, Infinite Jest may exist as an artefact of an era when humans still wrote, from a writer who could describe the weather with detail as compelling as the realists, a work that combines Shakespearean lexical boldness with literary brat-pack druggie precocious cool and mainstream momentum to create one of the enduring literary successes of the 20th century.When I was approached to celebrate the novel’s 30th anniversary edition, it was perhaps hoped that I might assist in assuaging the unfair, outsized connotations of what it means to be aDavid Foster Wallacereader, which, at its worst, has come to signify misogyny, and at its best, someone who’s just slightly annoying.When I emerged from those weeks of dedicated reading I had a feeling of intensified mental acuity, but more importantly, there was the sensation of grief. It was a type of mourning I had not experienced before, one contingent on the fact that this book had demanded so much of my attention for so long a time. I missed these characters. I had lived with Hal, Joelle, Orin, Stice, Pemulis, and meaty, square-head, heart-of-gold Don Gately, witness to their deformities and obsessions so meticulously detailed and made so alive on the page, and suddenly without them I felt hollow. And just as with real grief, I found myself wanting to be surrounded by fellow mourners, to seek them out and convene in our collective memory, people who I realised were defined by a set of attributes wholly different from those I had assumed, people who had committed an act of defiance and tenacity, curiosity and rigour, and after it all, were sad to see its end.A 30th anniversary edition of Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace, introduced by Michelle Zauner, is published by Little, Brown.

It has concluded that the Philadelphia picture was “91% negative” and that the Turin version was “86% negative”.View image in fullscreenThe version of Saint Francis of Assisi Receiving the Stigmata on display in Turin.Photograph: Heritage Images/AlamyTill-Holger Borchert, one of the leading Van Eyck scholars and director of the Suermondt-Ludwig-Museum in Aachen, said the Van Eyck findings supported scholars who had suggested that both versions were studio paintings – produced in the artist’s workshop but not necessarily by him.He said that, although he was “surprised” by the analysis, it posed further questions that needed to be explored.Dr Carina Popovici, Art Recognition’s chief executive, said that such high negative percentages for the paintings were particularly dramatic. In contrast, an analysis of another Van Eyck –The Arnolfini Portrait, which is among the most popular paintings in the National Gallery in London – said it was 89% likely to be authentic.View image in fullscreenPortrait of Giovanni Arnolfini and his Wife, by Jan van Eyck.Photograph: AlamyShe said she had also been taken aback by the findings: “I expected that, if one painting was negative, the other would be positive. But no, both came out negative.”She told the Guardian: “I’m guessing that the Philadelphia and Turin museums won’t be happy. It’s not good news on these paintings.” The Philadelphia and Turin museums have been contacted for comment. Critics have contended that a paintings’ condition and later restorations may affect such AI-based brushstroke analysis.Dr Noah Charney, an art historian who discussed the initial Philadelphia painting’s findings on hispodcast, described Art Recognition’s previous analyses as “remarkably accurate” and said that the negative result for both pictures had been so surprising that deeper tests had been conducted to confirm the results.He said he had expected that the Turin picture would be confirmed as by Van Eyck, and that the Philadelphia version would emerge as a copy, whether from the artist’s workshop or later.“The negative results suggest that both of these pictures are studio works, which may mean that we have a lost original that was more fully by Van Eyck’s hand than these two,” he said.“If a work comes out of Van Eyck’s studio, it doesn’t necessarily mean that he actually physically painted the surface level of all aspects of it,” he said on his podcast. “That’s a misconception that people get from this 19th-century idea of the lone artist in a garret in Paris drinking absinthe, smoking cigarettes, wearing a beret and doing every aspect of the work themselves.”Van Eyck is regarded as one of the pioneers of oil painting. “[Van Eyck] didn’t invent oil painting, but he perfected it so thoroughly that everyone else seemed to be working in his shadow for centuries,” Charney said. “His surfaces shimmer with light in detail so fine you need a magnifying glass to take it all in. Every stone, hair, reflection, and a glint seems to be rendered with a kind of supernatural clarity.“That ability to make the everyday luminous is why many consider him not only a great painter, but one of the great observers of reality in all of western art. And yet for all his fame, Van Eyck’s surviving oeuvre is small: fewer than 20 paintings are universally accepted as by his own hand.”The National Gallery in London is preparing to stage an exhibition of Van Eyck portraits in November.Among previous analyses, Art Recognition detected up to 40 fake paintings that were being offered oneBayin 2024. It also concluded in 2021 that Rubens’Samson and Delilahin the National Gallery was “91% negative”, supporting critics who have long doubted that it was painted by the 17th-century Flemish master.Explore more on these topicsArtJan van EyckItalyPhiladelphiaBelgiumAI (artificial intelligence)EuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Paramount did it with Fatal Attraction, American Gigolo and, shudder, Grease: Rise of the Pink Ladies; Warner gave us animated Gremlins and Aquaman shows, and Universal has tried with Pitch Perfect: Bumper in Berlin and a pickup of Lionsgate’s The Continental: From the World of John Wick. It was all boringly inevitable and predictably pointless, but mercifully, that pipeline has now slowed.Instead, there have been more recent examples of it actually working, film-to-TV extensions with slightly more thought attached. Shows such as The Penguin, Alien: Earth, It: Welcome to Derry, Monarch: Legacy of Monsters, and Ted have found ways to move beyond their source material and focus on the why rather than the just-because. Peacock’s gentle new take on The ’Burbs, a 1989Tom Hankscomedy horror that slowly found cult classic status, isn’t exactly a necessary next step, but it’s a mostly harmless, decently engaging one that only really reveals its limitations at the very end.The Muppet Show review – we all deserve a brief bit of happiness right nowRead moreThe original, directed by Joe Dante in-between his two Gremlins films, holds a warm place for many who grew up rewatching it on VHS, but it doesn’t quite make the most of its fun Rear Window in the suburbs premise. It gives us an appealing world to spend time in, along with an appealing cast that also includes Carrie Fisher, Bruce Dern and Corey Feldman, but leaves us wanting more from it, not a bad baton for a small screen remake to run with. The Seth MacFarlane-produced remake gives the film an Only Murders in the Building-inspired refresh, replacing the goofier horror elements with a broader, drip-feed mystery. While it retains some of the antic-heavy live-action cartoon feel, that pace is harder to sustain over eight episodes, and would also have been exhausting to watch, and so it settles into a more of-the-moment “cosy mystery” vibe.Hanks’s staycationing neurotic has turned into Keke Palmer’s lonely new mother Samira, a recent addition to the white picket-fenced, and mostly white, cul-de-sac community where her husband (Jack Whitehall) grew up (“It’s giving Get Out,” she quips). They moved from the danger of the city to the safety of suburbia, but Samira is suspicious of her new surroundings, in particular the spooky run-down house across the way and a slowly revealing backstory that includes the disappearance of a local teen years earlier. She finds her people in a group of similarly curious outcasts (Paula Pell, Julia Duffy and Mark Proksch), and their regular white wine hangs soon turn into strategy meetings.It’s not as if Only Murders invented, or even did anything that revolutionary with, a certain Sunday afternoon, PG-rated murder mystery subgenre, but its success was such that everyone now wants their own take (if I receive one more book press release with “Only Murders meets ____” … ). That show found its loyal audience not just by tapping into our undying obsession with playing armchair detective but also through high-wattage starpower, the immense charm of Steve Martin and Martin Short powering us through otherwise ho-hum mysteries. Palmer, still riding high after last year’s rare original comedy hitOne of Them Days, has some heavy-lifting to do, but it’s a mostly smart use of her considerable charm. She comfortably nails the zippy Scooby Doo silliness without going too big, an actor of many meme-able expressions knowing how and when to deploy them.But the script can’t always match Palmer or her co-stars, especially Pell, one of our most underrated comedic actors (any one episode of Girls5eva is proof of that), whose delivery and timing demands some far sharper, funnier dialogue (one wonders what a Pell-penned ’Burbs would look like). It’s not hard to enjoy spending time with Palmer, Pell and Duffy and their big glasses of wine, but it would be nice if the writers put as much effort in as their actors. The unfolding plot isjustabout intriguing enough to keep one clicking for the next episode (without anyone else suggesting a better alternative), but the stretched nature – a 101-minute movie eked out to more than three times that – starts to test our patience by the end. The finale, which clumsily forces a cliffhanger that feels like the result of a panicked compromise, is a real bum note to end on and doesn’t leave us all that curious for the second season, an obvious mystery solved in the most obvious of ways.If The ’Burbs works initially, it’s because it seems to find a way to fix some of an imperfect film’s shortcomings, but it soon struggles, like so many shows that have come before it, to truly justify its IP resurrection. It falls into a familiar streaming pattern – dragging out, wearing thin, fading from one’s memory fast – giving us yet another not unpleasant but entirely inessential binge-watch.The ‘Burbs is available on Peacock in the US and Binge in Australia on 8 February with a UK date to be announcedExplore more on these topicsUS televisionTV reviewTelevisionJack WhitehallTV comedyComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

They are tales about an ingenious individual overcoming huge odds, a triumphant metaphor for the human spirit. Here’s a funny thing: castaway stories featuring large groups of people lead to the exact opposite. Forced to self-organise, they end up eating each other. The exception isLost; I don’t know what that was about. Polar bears?Needless to say, I like them all. So it’s exciting to see a new kid on the block – or rather an old boy. William Golding’s novelLord of the Flies, about a group of British schoolboys who crash-land on a desert island, has been part of the UK curriculum for more than 60 years. I wonder if we forget the books we’re forced to study, and are obliged to rediscover them in later life. I know this story well, but am not sure I can say I fully experienced it until this striking new BBC version (Sunday, 9pm, BBC One).Promisingly, it’s adapted byJack Thorne. Every time a new Jack Thorne drama appears, which is no more than a couple of times a month, my writer friends wonder at his prodigious talent. Why does this man write as if he’s running out of time? As if he’s found himself in possession of the last pen on Earth? Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, This Is England, Toxic Town, His Dark Materials, The Swimmers, The Virtues and The Motive and the Cue. You sawAdolescence. Did this man put his fingers in a socket doing DIY, and now electricity pours out of them?Lord of the Flies draws Thorne back to the theme of developing masculinity, with a 1950s spin. Except here’s the thing about desert islands: they stay the same. Without clothes, you lose another marker of time. Aside from wireless hiss over the opening credits, and the occasional use of period language from the book, nothing about this four-parter doesn’t feel contemporary, and painfully so. Think of it as Adolescence: Origins.The mini-series is directed by Bafta-laden film-maker Marc Munden, and from the first episode it takes no prisoners. Televisually, it unmoors the audience from familiar comforts as much as the stranded boys. Dialogue is sparse, shots held for a long time, the fourth wall frequently broken. This happens through repeated closeup portraits of the boys’ faces. They gaze back at us, upward into the lens, expressing – what? Vulnerability? Aggression? The ambiguity is telling.The boys are a diverse group, which isn’t to say there isn’t class analysis, too. The entrance of a troupe of Canterbury cap-clad choristers, processing up a white sand beach to the strains of a religious chant, is an extraordinary, mirage-like image. Posh, confident, reeking of skiing holidays, they are led by the entitled Jack. Having lost the initial leadership election to the more responsible Ralph, Jack decides his followers will be the hunters, a group unto themselves.“I hope no adults come for a week, so we get to have some fun!” crows Jack, played by cherubic newcomer Lox Pratt, who I really hope is as nice in real life. I’ll steer clear of spoilers (although the novel was written in 1954, and has been pumped into kids more often than brown asthma inhalers). Let’s just say we all have different ideas of fun. Some of us like Wordle and banana bread. Others like setting things on fire. The latter tends to have more of an impact on everyone else.It’s almost comical how quickly everything is on fire. “Toilets, water, hut-building, boring!” complains Jack, who wants leadership without guardrails. He could be wearing a “Make Desert Island Great Again” cap; he’s actually wearing a face shroud made of garments salvaged from a dead woman’s suitcase. Is this a story about politics or toxic masculinity? They are one and the same, is the bleak suggestion. The show is excellent, a Joseph Conrad-esque fever, with moments of surreal horror. I felt sick watching it, though. I’ve never been more grateful to live under the rule of law, that ultimate dweeb’s charter.Jack Thorne’s output remains unequalled. Surely he must need a break from this material, to go on holiday or something. Can anyone recommend a quiet beach?Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioThe watcherTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sign up hereGwilym MumfordSat 7 Feb 2026 02.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 7 Feb 2026 02.02 ESTShareTwo very unusual films were released last weekend. One you will have absolutely heard of: Melania, the soft-focushagiocumentaryof the US first lady, which was plonked into thousands and thousands of often entirely empty cinemas across the globe by Amazon and Jeff Bezos in what is widely perceived as a favour-currier to the White House. Melania’s $7m takings in the US were marginally better than forecasted (and far ahead of therisiblenumbersfor the film elsewhere) but, given the documentary’s vast cost, still represents a dramatic loss (especially if the rumour that Amazonpaid for the film to be in some cinemasis true). Then again, this was a rare multimillion dollar film where the primary marker of success was probably not financial.The other unusual film released last weekend you are less likely to have heard of, even though it dwarfed Melania’s takings. Adapted from a video game of the same name, Iron Lung is a grimy post-apocalyptic sci-fi horror in which a convict has to pilot a rusty submarine through an ocean of human blood on a distant planet. That peculiar plotline isn’t the most unusual thing about the film, though. No, what’s really remarkable is that Iron Lung came close to topping the US box office, earning $17m in its opening weekend, despite being entirely self-financed by an American YouTuber.That YouTuber is Mark “Markiplier” Fischbach, who – though I must confess I had never heard of before writing this piece– is a huge figure in the gaming streamer world, attracting millions of views for his playthrough videos and skits. The charismatic, floppy-haired Fischbach firstplayed through Iron Lung, a largely unheralded indie horror game, on his channel in 2022 and clearly liked it enough to sink $3m of his own money into writing, directing and starring in a film adaptation that is playing on thousands of screens across America and many more around the world.View image in fullscreenBlood, sweat and tears … a still from Iron Lung.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyIron Lung hasn’t exactly awed the critics, but then that doesn’t seem terribly relevant here. Because it’s worth underscoring how unlikely this all is. Making a film and then getting it into cinemas at such scale is a matter for studios and experienced distributors, not a lone gamer (Fischbach was turned down by studios and distributors before opting to release Iron Lung himself). The barrier for entry is formidably high, especially when you factor in the usually pricey marketing costs for a release. Though that wasn’t an issue for Fischbach, who stuck to a tight production budget and swerved the usual paid media campaign in favour of promoting the life out of his film on his own platform to an army of engaged fans. Regular viewers of his channel would have been hearing about the film for the best part of two years, an insistent drumbeat of anticipation that must have made its release feel like an event.Those fans, in turn, became active advocates for Iron Lung’s release on as many screens as possible, petitioning their local cinemas to show the film. It turned what might have been a niche release on a handful of screens into something far bigger, attracting the attention of the Regal cinema chain, whoagreed to show the filmat 99% of its US locations, including in the tiny pacific territory of Guam. The result is a indie movie hit of a very modern kind, built on blood, sweat andparasocial relationships.How replicable a hit it is, however, is difficult to say. Self-financing and distributing a film is a forbidding prospect for most people, even those with an army of fans. And Fischbach is far more experienced than most YouTubers in more formal film-making, graduating from online shorts to a self-funded TV series (The Edge of Sleep) to a feature film. Plus it’s hard to imagine many YouTubers being willing to juggle making a full-length film with the already time-consuming job of streaming your life for the world to see (Fischbach found himself making Iron Lung in his spare time on weekends).Equally though, current industry conditions might offer a tiny sliver of opportunity for the budding self-funded film-maker. It’s unlikely Iron Lung – or indeed Melania – would have had the space to show on thousands of screens a decade or more ago when, thanks to longer “theatrical windows”, films stuck around in cinemas for months. But, in an industry landscape where movies disappear on to on-demand in the space of weeks (and where there arefewer of them in cinemasin total than before Covid), there is room for unheralded releases to squeeze on to screens. Let’s hope it means more DIY efforts like Iron Lung – and perhaps fewer Melanias.To read the complete version of this newsletterplease subscribeto receive The Guide in your inbox every FridayExplore more on these topicsCultureThe Guide newsletterGamesMelaniaYouTubenewslettersShareReuse this content"

Lowry was too large for the frame.View image in fullscreenA statue of Lowry can be found propping up the bar in Sam’s Chop House.Photograph: Wirestock, Inc/AlamyI crossed the River Irwell and entered Salford, which has a unique identity and is a city in its own right – not just Manchester’s bit on the side, as is routinely reported.Alongside the Irwell, just a few yards into Salford, standsThe Lowry hotel, which was initially owned by Sir Rocco Forte, whose hotelier father was a Lowry enthusiast. In the hotel’s gym, I realised that the music of the Smiths isn’t conducive to a workout. But on the treadmill I caught a Morrissey lyric about it taking “strength to be gentle”, and it made me think of Lowry, a man brave enough to stick to his everyday scenes at a time arty types in London were calling for more elevated fare.Lowry’s house is unmarked. I’m tempted to consider this regrettable, but it’s probably what he would have wantedI was collected from the hotel byJohn Consterdine, a local legend who does tours of the region in an electric black cab, including one focused on Lowry. We started at Lowry’s endpoint,Southern Cemetery, where the painter has lain since perishing of pneumonia in 1976, at the age of 88. His resting place is marked by a modest stone cross and adorned with paintbrushes. It is shared, fittingly, with his overbearing mother.View image in fullscreenThe writer with taxi tour guide John Consterdine outside the Lowry centre.Photograph: Scott AntcliffeNext, we drove out to a part of town known as Victoria Park. Once a gated community for middle-class Victorians, it’s where Lowry grew up. The house at 14 Pine Grove offers no hint that he lived here until the age of 22, at which point the family were forced to move to Pendlebury, a deprived district of Salford. The relocation was a fall from grace, one that Lowry’s mother would never recover from.Lowry did adapt to his new surroundings, however. Indeed, it was here that he discovered his unlikely muse – Manchester’s industrial landscape – and went to work on the down-to-earth scenes that he would become known for. Again, the house (117 Station Road) is unmarked. I’m tempted to consider this regrettable, but it’s probably what Lowry would have wanted. Theartist refused a knighthood in 1968, and holds the record for most honours declined, turning down five in his lifetime.After a brief stop atPeel Park, which Lowry painted several times, John dropped me at Salford Quays, which would have been as busy as a box of frogs back in the day, before the bottom fell out of the cotton market. Salford was affected badly by the slump and the city entered a long, deep depression, soundtracked by Joy Division. The docks were a wasteland, renewal a pipe dream.I entered a space the size of a squash court, each side and surface alive with Lowry’s artwork … the paintings grow to their subjects’ true height, becoming entire worldsEnter Lowry. Or rather,theLowry: a theatre and gallery complex, conceived by Salford councillors in the late 1980s, who hoped an arts centre would rejuvenate the area. It opened in 2000 and set off a chain reaction. London’sImperial War Museumerected a northern outpost; then the BBC moved to MediaCityUK and told Gary Lineker he’d be dipping his prawns in gravy henceforth. By the time ITV and Corrie moved in, in 2013, Salford Quays was becoming a tourist, retail, residential and leisure hub.At the heart of it was the Lowry, whose halls had been decked with the vast collection of Lowry paintings the local council had been snapping up over the years.I started with a new immersive experience calledLowry 360. I entered a space the size of a squash court, each side and surface alive with Lowry’s artwork – bobbies on the beat, bicycles on the move, matchsticks a go-go – the whole thing elevated by a voiceover from Sophie Willan, star of the sitcom Alma’s Not Normal. By animating Lowry in this way, the paintings grow to their subjects’ true height, becoming entire worlds. This is Lowry in the round, and it works like a dream.View image in fullscreenGoing to the Match, one of Lowry’s most famous works.Photograph: The estate of LS LowryI moved on to the paintings, which felt more alive off the back of the animation. Centre stage is Going to the Match (1953), one of his most famous works featuring signature “matchstick men”, which shows a crowd on their way to a Bolton Wanderers game.The painting has been on quite the journey. When the Lowry opened, it was offered to the gallery on long-term loan by its then owners, the Professional Footballers’ Association. Twenty years later, the PFA suddenly asked for the painting back, because it wanted to flog it at auction. The Lowry was gutted, knowing its prized possession would be lost for good.Enter Andrew Law, a state school lad from Stockport and the sitting CEO of a global hedge fund. He wrote the Lowry a blank cheque and told it to acquire the painting.It did so – for £7.8m. Someone buy that man a shandy!I could bang on about each of the paintings on show at the Lowry, but suffice to say that the whole range is here: mills, streets, churches, parks, a girl in a corset and the deep blue sea. Despite the received wisdom, Lowry is no one-trick pony. When you’ve seen one, you haven’t seen them all.View image in fullscreenNot just matchstick men – the pictures on display show Lowry had range.Photograph: Shaw and ShawIt was time to go to the match. Manchester United were at home to Bournemouth that evening, so off I went to the “Theatre of Dreams”. I took up a position behind the East Stand, part of a thickening congregation as kick-off approached: kids on shoulders, a lady hawking scarves, coppers policing Matt Busby Way.It was some view. There wasn’t a chimney in sight, but I fancy Lowry would have captured the scene nicely nonethelessNot having a ticket, I withdrew toHotel Football, within earshot of the ground. After the game I climbed to the top and looked towards the skyline of Salford and Manchester.It was some view: the skyscrapers ofNew Jackson, the bright cluster of MediaCity, the dark lifted by countless northern lights. There wasn’t a chimney in sight, but I fancy Lowry would have captured the scene nicely nonetheless. He might have added a figure or two – a pair of window cleaners perhaps, harnessed and up high, braving the weather, buffing the glass, improving perspective, allowing others to see.The trip was supported byThe Lowryhotel, which has doubles from £162,room-only.

Of course, the Scots know this. They know how fantastic this genius concoction of pulses, vegetables, oats and spices is; how meaty without being, well, meaty. I began eating it because I share a birthday with Robert Burns (seehaggis kheema) but it deserves to be eaten all year round. Here, I’ve introduced the haggis to another favourite of mine, dan dan noodles, and I’m pleased to report they get on like a house on fire.Haggis dan dan noodlesDo not be put off by the list of ingredients. The first four are stirred together to make a sauce, and the majority are put into a pan, one after another, and come together quickly.Prep15 minCook30 minServes42 tbsp rapeseed oil2 garlic cloves, peeled and minced2cm x 2cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated, to get 1 tbsp454g pack vegetarian haggis(I likeMacsween’s)1 tsp five spice2 tsp dark soy sauce1½ tbsp hoisin sauce1 tbsp shaoxing wine2 pak choi, quartered400g dan dan noodles, or medium wheat noodlesFor the sauce100g light tahini4 tbsp(60ml) light soy sauce2½ tbsp chilli sediment and oil4 tsp black Chinkiang vinegar (black rice vinegar)To finish40g roasted salted peanuts, ground or very finely chopped2 spring onions, whites and greens, very finely slicedPlace all the ingredients for the sauce in a large heatproof bowl, mix really well and leave to one side.To make the haggis topping, put the oil in a wide saucepan on a medium-high heat and, once hot, add the garlic and ginger. Cook for two minutes until fragrant, then crumble in the haggis. Stir frequently for around eight minutes until it starts to brown in spots, then stir in the five spice, followed by the soy and hoisin sauces. Cook for another five minutes, until it looks dry and a little crunchy, then stir through the shaoxing. Take off the heat and leave in a single layer in the pan to cool.Meanwhile, cook the noodles according to packet instructions in plenty of hot water. One minute before the cooking time has finished, carefully remove a mugful of the water and drop in the pak choi. Stir, leave to soften for half a minute, then use a straining spoon or fork to lift out the pak choi.Drain the noodles, put them in the sauce bowl and mix anbd toss using a spaghetti fork or tongs. Add the reserved noodle water a tablespoon at a time (you’ll need between six and 10 tablespoons to make the noodles nice and saucy).Distribute the noodles between four shallow bowls, spoon over the haggis topping and the pak choi, sprinkle over the peanuts and spring onions, and dig in.Explore more on these topicsVegetablesMeera Sodha recipesFoodVegetarian food and drinkBurns NightChinese food and drinkHaggisrecipesShareReuse this content"
