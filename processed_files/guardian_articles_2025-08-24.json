But Coster-Waldau does play William the Conqueror with a phenomenal 70s dad tacheLucy ManganSun 24 Aug 2025 17.00 EDTShareIt is 1066. We are on a battlefield in black and white. Colour has yet to be invented. “William!” shouts the leader of one army. “Harold!” shouts the leader of the other, creating a Proustian rush of Madge Bishop roaring across Ramsay Street at her husband during the glory days of Neighbours. But I wonder what happens next?History, that’s what! But to explain the history that is about to happen we must first go back a bit to, a caption informs us, “years earlier”. This is a little after “bygone times”, a bit before “days of yore” and, as it appears that Edward the Confessor (Eddie Marsan, having the time of his life playing the last monarch of the house of Wessex as a religious fanatic) is about to be crowned, probably around 1043. They can’t say that, though, because then people who know their Harolds from their Haralds, instead of just wanting to make jokes about Cnuts and Harthacnuts, will start getting upset about tweaked timelines. As if an eight-part drama from the BBC withCBSis the right place to be looking for detailed understanding of the reshaping of English society the like of which has never been seen before or since, but anyway, on we go! Colour has been invented, by the way. Apparently, it was just a stylistic choice before.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He is played by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (sister-botherer Jaime Lannister in Game of Thrones) and very well, too, despite the decision to have him sport a tiny bristly moustache that makes him look like a 1970s Everydad. Each time we cut acrossLa Manche, I expect to see him herding kids into a Vauxhall Cavalier to get back to the ferry in time. But, instead, he is being summoned across the water to attend Eddie Confessor/Marsan’s coronation because they are first cousins once removed. He is reluctant because weddings of distant relatives are always so boring – though, as it turns out, that is the least of the problems this particular genetic link is going to bring about. But off he trots.On the other side of the Channel lives Harold (“Harold!”), son of Godwin, Earl of Wessex (Geoff Bell), brother-in-law to Marsan the Confessor (claim to the throne ahoy!), father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife … no, wait, I’ve got my history streams crossed. Go back. Stop after “ahoy!”. OK. He is played by James Norton who, cast essentially as the goodie to Coster-Waldau’s relative baddie, does not have much of interest to do though he gamely gives his best throughout.King and Conqueror starts slowly and never quite attains escape velocity. Like William confronted with Anglo-Saxon troublemakers when he first lands in England, you have to fight your way through a couple of exposition-heavy episodes before the narrative starts flowing with anything like freedom. This is because the BBC/CBS are aware that, unlike the Tudor period or days of yore, the general public does not have much working knowledge of the era. So, people say things like: “Everything is changing … this is a new age. That’s how important the coronation of someone who is not yet known as Edward the Confessor, but will be, is.”Summer sizzlers! It’s the 20 hottest TV shows of the seasonRead moreThe meat of the thing comprises machinations and shenanigans mostly courtesy of Ed’s formidable mother Lady Emma, formidably played by Juliet Stevenson, and King Henry of France (Jean-Marc Barr). Alliances, treacheries, sudden sons and heirs, interfering Mercians and Counts of Flanders abound, along with some semi-decent parts for the women playing the prime movers’ wives and sisters. Clémence Poésy brings striking grit to Matilda, the always brilliant Clare Holman gives us Wessex matriarch Gytha (rightly infuriated by every member of her clan as time goes on), and Emma Beecham provides a flinty Edith. Whether this is commercial ahistorical necessity, woke madness or a return to a truth obscured by centuries of revisionism by the patriarchy, I leave you to discuss animatedly among yourselves.Eventually, eight hours later, we are back on the battlefield, in colour this time. No spoilers but anyone hoping for a sequel starring James Norton as a happily retired earl-king, perhaps solving cosy crimes in a tranquil hamlet west of Lundenwic (London) that nevertheless has a murder rate comparable to 80s Detroit, is doomed to disappointment. Especially if they want him to have two eyes while doing it.You do feel those eight hours, though. King and Conqueror clearly aims to be a ripping yarn. It is not intended to labour points about power, corruption, sacrifice and venality despite their acute relevance. But it hangs a little too heavy. An earnest undertow runs throughout and prevents it ever becoming the combustible fun it could be. A failure to conquer, you might say.King and Conqueror aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewBBCCBSreviewsShareReuse this content"

It introduced mandatory licensing, rules for secure storage and use, and restrictions on semiautomatic rifles and pump action shotguns.There was a buyback scheme for guns that were now classed as illegal. Australians could voluntarily give up weapons in exchange for financial compensation – leading to the surrender of more than 600,000 firearms.Owners would also need a “genuine reason” for having guns, such as hunting or sports shooting, and personal protection was not a valid reason. The agreement specifically states that firearm possession is a privilege, not a right.This sets Australia apart from other countries, most notably the United States, where a right to bear arms is included in its constitution. US Congress and state legislatures have passed some gun control measures, including mandated background checks but, unlike Australia, most states have not banned assault weapons.Gun ownership in the UK is also considered a privilege, not a right, and new laws have similarly responded to mass shootings, including the 1987 Hungerford massacre. Certain semiautomatic rifles were banned and police must consider reasons for ownership before issuing a licence.The effectiveness of Australia’s gun control measures remain a matter of debate, and some elements are yet to be fully enacted almost 30 years later, including the nationwide firearms register.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.In the wake of the shooting, images of truckloads of guns being sent to scrap-metal yards became emblematic of the government response at the time: a dramatic, national gun buyback that removed more than 650,000 weapons from the community.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailAs well as the gun amnesty, the government restricted semiautomatic weapons and introduced tighter licensing requirements, including the need for gun holders to demonstrate a “genuine reason” for ownership – which cannot include self-defence.The world-leading reforms led to an immediate decrease in the number of guns in the community.View image in fullscreenJohn Howard at a memorial service to mark the 10th anniversary of the Port Arthur massacre on 28 April 2006.Photograph: Ian Waldie/AAPBut while Australia has long been heralded as the gold standard for gun control, almost 30 years later, the landscape is shifting.Gun numbers are on the rise – there are now more than 4m firearms in the Australian community, almost double the 2.2m weapons recorded in 2001, after the national firearms agreement, according to a report commissioned by gun safety groups.At least 2,000 new guns are lawfully entering the community every week.Australia’s gun lobby says it’s ‘winning’ the fight against firearm control as numbers surgeRead moreAnd while the number of gun licence holders per capita has gone down as Australia’s population has soared, there is now a larger number of guns in the community per capita than there was in the immediate aftermath of the crackdown.That’s because the number of guns each licence holder has is going up – gun owners now average more than four firearms for each licence. In Sydney New South Wales firearm register data shows that there are more than 70 individuals who own more than 100 firearms. (Crucially, these are not deemed to be collectors, whose weapons are not functional.)And, despite the Howard reforms promising uniform gun laws throughout Australia and the establishment of a national firearm register, 30 years later this is not a reality.The states and territories are creeping towards the establishment of a new national firearms registry but the gun lobby is pushing back as the details of how it will operate are still being negotiated.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In NSW the government is considering enshrining a new “right to hunt” in law, while in WA shooting groups are mobilising against tough new licensing requirements.There are also growing concerns about weapons that circumvent the gun licensing system entirely. 3D-printed firearms of increasing sophistication are now routinely seized by police as Australians tap into an online ecosystem that glorifies a so-called “unlimited right to keep and bear arms”.Why the Australian gun lobby says it’s ‘winning’ – podcastRead more“We all got together after Port Arthur and everybody pulled together with the ban [on some semi-automatic and pump-action firearms] and the buyback,” said Andrew Hemming, an expert in criminal law at the University of Southern Queensland. “Well, the reality is … if anybody can make one, the sands have shifted and it’s only a question of time.”The gun lobby is quick to argue that licensed firearm holders are not the problem, likening the ownership of multiple guns to a golfer having multiple golf clubs.But it is an inescapable fact that legal firearms have been used in many high-profile homicides and are overwhelmingly used in suicides. Over the past decade there have been almost 2,000 suicides by firearm and more than 200 homicides.View image in fullscreenPolice display a homemade submachine gun seized in 2016.Photograph: Dan Peled/AAPEight OECD countries, including the UK, have lower gun homicide rates than Australia.Gun theft is also an ongoing problem. Data compiled by Guardian Australia from state police shows that almost 9,000 firearms – most of them licensed – were stolen from 2020-24, with only a small percentage recovered.“We have done something that will send a signal to people all around this country, that ours is not a gun culture, ours is a culture of peaceful cooperation,” Howard said in 1996 when announcing the national firearm agreement.Almost 30 years on, Australia must grapple again with questions about its “gun culture”.Explore more on these topicsGun controlPort Arthur massacreAustralian politicsJohn HowardCrime - AustraliafeaturesShareReuse this content"

This has long been a place that bustled with outsiders, though they have not always been welcome – the small green common opposite was once named aftera beaconthat local stories say wasbuiltto warn of invasion.Though now wrapped in ugly 1960s extensions that have stripped it of anything approaching charm, the unassuming building – close to agricultural land and a cricket pitch – is an unlikely place to spark a potential political crisis.That is what the government may be facing, however, after thehigh court ruledthis week that the Home Office’s use of the Bell hotel to house asylum seekers breached planning laws. Epping Forest district council had challenged the government after the hotel became a flashpoint for anti-refugee protests, after an Ethiopian man who had been placed there was arrested and charged over the alleged sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl.Local protesters and the Conservative-led council are jubilant but the implications of ousting the hotel’s140 male residentsto as yet unknown locations could be far more widespread.Dozens of local authorities, some of which have also been the focus of protests, are considering similar legal challenges, which could throw the government’s entire asylum projectinto disarrayand which one insider admitted this week has left the Home Office“reeling”.This case may turn on planning law but there are plenty who see this as a much bigger victory, after a febrile summer in whichthousands of peopleagain have crossed the Channel in small boats,anti-migrant protestshavetaken placein more than 40 locations, and nationalistic and anti-refugee rhetoric has been embraced by politicians across the spectrum and amplified by sections of the media.There has not beenwidespread riotingof the kind that occurred last summer, sparked by the murder of three girls at a dance class in Southport andfalse rumoursthat the perpetrator was a Muslim asylum seeker. But as communitiesbraced for further widespread proteststhis weekend, a campaign to raise the flags of St George and the union jack across the countrygathered pace, declaring as patriotism what many others have experienced in their villages or streets as clear intimidation. According to the anti-extremist groupsHope Not Hateand Stand Up to Racism, the apparently spontaneous campaign has in fact been organised by well-known far-right figures.View image in fullscreenProtesters calling for asylum seekers to be removed from the Bell hotel gather outside the council offices in Epping on 8 August.Photograph: Henry Nicholls/AFP/Getty Images“We are in a dangerous moment,” says Lewis Nielsen, an anti-fascist officer at Stand Up to Racism. In the context of increased far-right protests and encouraging political rhetoric, he says, “the ‘Operation Raise the Colours’ was never about flags, it’s about giving confidence to racists and fascists to target refugees and migrants”.Saturday’s protests largely passed without incident. While demonstrators and police clashed in places, there were not the scenes of civil unrest from last summer. However, refugee and even minority communities are experiencing real consequences, illustrated by countless small but terrifying incidents. In Redcar, North Yorkshire, a black man filmed playing with his white granddaughters has beenracially abusedand falsely called a paedophile after the short video clip was amplified online by the far-right activistTommy Robinson. In east Belfast, a small group of vigilantes have beenseeking out dark-skinned mento shout abuse at or demand to see their identity documents.Writingin the Guardianon Friday, the Refugee Council’s chief executive, Enver Solomon, said some food banks that previously served all in need were now turning away perceived “foreigners”. He also described meeting an African man in his 60s in north-east England who had been attacked by a group of men – his arm was broken – and was terrified of leaving his accommodation.This was shortly after Keir Starmer said tough curbs on immigration were needed to prevent Britain becoming an“island of strangers”. Solomon wrote: “Those who have worked with refugees for decades tell me they have never known a time when the hostility has been so strong and the environment so toxic.” Other refugee charities have had toinstall safe roomsor even close their offices in response to death threats and intimidation.Starmer has since said he “deeply regrets” his “island of strangers” remark, but there has been little sign otherwise of a rollback of the rhetoric. This week his spokesperson offered an apparent endorsement of the flag-raising campaign, describing the prime minister as a “patriot” who believed people should “absolutely” fly flags.View image in fullscreenA St George’s cross hangs from a lamp-post in east London.Photograph: Carlos Jasso/AFP/Getty ImagesMeanwhile, the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, has said women areafraid to walk in parksfor fear of being harassed by refugee men “lurking in bushes”. The shadow minister Robert Jenrick, seen as a potential successor as party leader, has been pictured atanti-migrant ralliesattended by known members of the far right, and attaching a flag to a lamp-post in defiance of “Britain-hating” councilswho have asked for them not to be attached to street infrastructure. The Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage,called for widespread protestsoutside other hotels housing new arrivals.Paul Jackson, a professor of history at the University of Northampton whose work includes a focus on far-right extremism, says: “What I find quite concerning is that it’s creating an opportunity for the far right to grow. We’ve seen Labour politicians be supportive in principle of concern around protests at migration hotels, leaning into the populist right. We’ve seen Reform politicians very strongly legitimise these concerns.“There’s a lot of concern about the emboldenment of the far right, and also the limited voices within the political mainstream calling for a different narrative around issues of migration. It would be good to see a little more moral leadership rather than pandering.”Jackson identifies a number of factors behind the current situation, including the ascent of Donald Trump in the US. One fundamental factor, he says, is a collapse in trust in government responses to asylum and migration.“We’ve seen over the last generation a breakdown in trust in government policymaking around migration, and I think that’s partly thanks to mainstream politicians’ failure to speak truthfully on this issue.”View image in fullscreenA search and rescue vessel shadows a small boat as it sets off into the Channel heading for the UK on 15 August.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesSunder Katwala, the director of the thinktankBritish Future, which researches public attitudes on immigration and national identity, points to the lack of government voices pushing back against the protests.“The Labour government is very quiet about racism this year compared to last, because it doesn’t want to accidentally sound as if it’s criticising people with legitimate concerns and so on,” he says. “The mainstream right and the mainstream centre-left have stopped doing the boundary-calling, and I think Reform, the Conservatives and sometimes the government are now crossing the line, because they’re unwilling to criticise anybody, whatever they’re saying.”Katwala stresses there has been no repeat of last year’s violence at protests, which for the most part have been numerically small, and points topollingshowing that a similar proportion of people have “a lot” of sympathy for people crossing the Channel as have not much or no sympathy at all. Other polls show similar proportions of people think the UK should accept fewer refugees as think it should take more, (though the percentage who are welcoming has fallen since 2023,according to YouGov).Politics may be tilting right and the voices of those opposed to migration may be louder, but Katwala says: “The long-term trends in British society on tolerance of people across ethnic and faith lines are powerfully and strongly in a pro-tolerance, pro-liberal direction” – and markedly stronger in the UK than elsewhere in Europe or the US.No voice has been more striking on this than the family of Bebe King, one of the girls murdered in Southport, who hit out at the “despicable” actions of the far right who had “tried to make political gain from our tragedy”.Speaking to the Guardianearlier this month, Bebe’s grandfather Michael Weston King urged ministers to reconsider plans to change the law to give the ethnicity of suspects, describing it as “apparent kowtowing to the likes of Farage and Reform, [which] is extremely disappointing, though perhaps not surprising”.A significant silent majority is tolerant and welcoming of refugees, says Katwala, but ongoing dysfunction in the asylum system does not help. “Chaos isn’t good for advocates of refugee protection. So the left of this debate has definitely got an interest in the government showing it can control asylum while taking refugees,” he says.“I think the government really does have to get a grip on the visible lack of control in the Channel itself and in hotels in the towns where people live. If we don’t do that, there are political risks to them, but also there are risks to the principle of refugee protection.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

But then theRiverfordveg box founder is not your typical farmer, despite still living only a few miles from the farm where he was born.Unlike most farmers, Singh-Watson says we need to eat less meat, that large-scale farmers should pay inheritance tax and that Brexit has been “a complete and utter fuck-up”. He has opposed foxhunting,banned the badger cullfrom his land and supported theclimate protesters of Extinction Rebellion. He once even voted for Jeremy Corbyn. When it comes to the challenges agriculture faces, he is the most brutally honest farmer in the UK.Ploughing this lonely furrow has not limited his success. Riverford, now owned by its employees, had a turnover of £113m in 2023-24 and made a profit of £5.7m. He has also been awarded farmer of the year by the BBC twice.But how did Singh-Watson come to follow this path? In a long conversation outside the Riverford Field Kitchen restaurant, he talked to the Guardian about his unconventional father, a mother who made good food the beating heart of the farm and revealed his autism, diagnosed formally only recently.Cucumber stewGillian and John Watson arrived at Riverford Farm in 1951, both from colonial families returning home as the British empire faded. “My parents wanted to do something useful with their lives, and at a time when there was still food rationing,” says Singh-Watson.“They were Liberals all their life, in quite an old-school, perhaps almost patronising way … They had a social conscience and believed that being wealthy and privileged came with responsibilities.” This was not a given, he says. “My father’s family were absolutely hideous – the worst sort of rich, wealthy twats and racists. But he made something better from that.”View image in fullscreenGuy Singh-Watson with a handful of borlotti beans at Riverford Farm.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianHis father was always unconventional. “He never really wanted to do things the way other people did and was always experimenting with different things – we were the first people to have a combine harvester in the village. Then he got into pigs in a big way. He was always building different housing setups for them, most of which didn’t work.”The farm did, like most others, intensify, embracing pesticides and fertilisers. “Then, in the 1970s, reading Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring and through his own observation, he was starting to question farming intensively.”Singh-Watson says his father was an “awful cook”, remembering his cucumber stew at one meal. His mother had a degree in agriculture and wanted to farm, “but those were chauvinist times and she was just the most amazing cook”. She made bread and hams, and grew herbs, but was also an experimenter. “She was making kombucha in about 1980,” he says.View image in fullscreenGuy in the field c. 1986 harvesting and moving some of the first organic veg grown at RiverfordPhotograph: Riverford.co.uk“My mum didn’t survive to eat in theField Kitchen,” he says. The Riverford restaurant, now celebrating its 20th year, is the most exceptional part of the business in his opinion. “If she had, I think she would have absolutely loved it. It was very much based on that experience of growing up in a busy farmhouse with a big, long table, where the whole family and half a dozen people from the farm would come and eat together: great food from really good ingredients, mostly from the farm.”‘I was unemployable’The Riverford organic veg business began in 1986 when Singh-Watson returned to the family farm for Christmas after giving up a management consultancy job in New York. “I had decided by then that I was unemployable, that I really couldn’t work for anyone else,” he says. “I’m just too pigheaded and stubborn to ever work for anyone else. I also knew I wanted to be outside.View image in fullscreenGuy Singh-Watson  at Riverford Farm.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The Guardian“People seemed to be talking about organic vegetables and I thought, there’s an opportunity here,” he says. He started with three acres. His short business career had taught him that controlling the access to market was key and in 1993 he decided to deliver the veg direct to customers in an old yellow Citroën Dyane.“That was definitely a plan, and also an emotional thing, that no one was going to fuck me over like I was fucked over by supermarkets and their very unpleasant buyers,” he says. The break came when he told a Safeway’s buyer where they couldstick their measly 6p per lettuce. Since then, Riverford has gone from selling only veg from its own farm to founding a co-operative of south Devon organic farms in the late 1990s to today, when it works with more than 100 suppliers in the UK and Europe to fill its boxes.Singh-Watson got a formal diagnosis of autism in April. “It made me feel all the more that I don’t have to live by other people’s rules,” he says. “I’m different – so what? I find it really difficult to understand how people are able to just lie so easily, and to serve their own ends.”He cites fossil fuel and chemical company boards covering up evidence of harm. “I mean, who the fuck makes those decisions, knowing that they are fucking the planet for their children.” He said the autism diagnosis had helped him understand why this upset him so much and why he had never needed the approval of others: “I don’t really care.”But Singh-Watson says he has softened with time and the help of therapy. “I was definitely like, ‘I’m going to say this because it’s true, and I don’t give a fuck if you find it offensive’. But I try not to do that now because offending people gratuitously is just stupid and childish really.”‘Just eat less meat’Singh-Watson may believe he has softened. But for many years he has been an iconoclastic voice among farmers. Take meat: most British farmers reject calls to eat less red meat to reduce damage to the environment and people’s health. Singh-Watson says eat good meat but less often: just 5% of what Riverford sells is meat. He had shared an organic chicken with eight people the previous evening: “I probably won’t buy another one for a month.”View image in fullscreenGuy Singh-Watson in the agro-forestry field at Riverford Farm.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The Guardian“I spent a lot of time looking at the evidence on [the impact of meat] and it was overwhelming,” he says. “Ten billion people can’t live sustainably on this planet if we are eating anything like the level of meat consumed in a western diet. The only answer is we just eat less meat, dairy and eggs.”“[Some cattle and sheep farmers] will tell you that that grassland is sequestering as much carbon as a rainforest – it’s absolutely fucking tosh but it doesn’t stop them saying it,” he says.Singh-Watson’s parents were livestock farmers, and his four siblings all work in meat and dairy businesses. “I love seeing the cows and sheep in the fields, and I’m not a vegan or vegetarian,” he says. “I just think we should try harder to eat less meat and to farm in a better way.”‘Emotive tosh’That approach has made Singh-Watson a rich man: he sold his last share of Riverford to its 1,000 employeesfor £10m in 2023and owns a 150-acre farm nearby.So his support for the Labour government’s move to end an exclusion from inheritance tax for farms worth more than £1m once again put him at odds with his peers. In January, he called protests against the tax change “emotive tosh”.“My starting point is that we desperately need to raise tax revenue to rebuild our country and rich people, the ones who have been the beneficiaries of all the growth the last 20 years, are the people who should be paying it,” he says, although he says he would have set the threshold higher than £1m.Under the new rules inheritance tax will be levied at 20% – half the standard rate – and with 10 years interest-free to pay. “That is a pretty major concession, and if you give your land to your children seven years before you die, they don’t pay inheritance tax anyway,” Singh-Watson says.“If you’re a farmer owning a farmhouse and 200 acres of land, you’re going to be worth at least £3.2m – that puts you in the top 1% of wealth in this country,” he says. “And if you’re farming 500-acres-plus, and you’re worth £10m, you should pay the whole fucking lot – forget the 50% discount. You should just pay your tax like anyone else. They are immensely wealthy, and though they are relatively poor in terms of income, they do have options. You can sell a field.” He says the children of parents owning a family pub, bakery or brewery may be just as invested in their business as farmers, but do not get any tax breaks.View image in fullscreenGuy Singh-Watson with artichokes.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianSingh-Watson also backs a wealth tax: “The rich need to pay their share to restore the services that are wanted. That’s why I’m a member ofPatriotic Millionaires UK.”“But the easiest way to get money out of the farming sector would be to capture the 100-fold increase in land value when planning permission is granted to build houses on it,” he says. “I don’t see why the farmer should be the beneficiary of that. Maybe they should get double the agricultural value, but the rest of it should go into the public purse.” His rough estimate of how much that would raise when the government’s target of 300,000 new homes are built is £10bn – 25 times more than the inheritance tax changes.‘Crawling back to Europe’Of all the positions he has taken, opposing Brexit brought him the most hate, he says. “But just about everything that I said has turned out to be true: it has been a complete and utter fuck-up. How can anyone argue anything else? Now we’re having to crawl back to Europe.”He excoriates the rise of Nigel Farage’s Reform UK. “This alliance between the working poor and a load of rich rightwing toffs has been the basis of fascism for a century. How can we still be living it out? I find it really upsetting.”Singh-Watson says he usually votes Liberal Democrat or Green: “But when I was registered in London for a bit, when I was living with my wife there, I actually voted for [local MP] Jeremy Corbyn. I’m unsure how I feel about him now.”He says the EU’s common agricultural policy was “appalling”, but with farming making up only 1% of the UK’s GDP, was not a justification for Brexit by itself.“The biggest problem with Brexit is just how incredibly disruptive it has been,” he says. “Businesses mostly want government to piss off and leave them alone with a stable [regulatory] environment, whether that’s workers’ rights, environmental legislation, trading agreements – they just want a stable base, and I think Labour have done better than the Tories on that.”View image in fullscreenThe Riverford Field Kitchen.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianSingh-Watson has no time for the National Farmers’ Union, by far the loudest voice for agriculture in the UK: “I disengaged with the NFU a long time ago – all they seem to do is want to protect the status quo.“They represent the older, richer, more conservative farmers,” he says. “But there are a lot of young people who have a much more radical approach to farming but who don’t have access to land. I want to hear their voices, but I think they’re completely unrepresented by the NFU.”Expensive luxury?A common critique of the kind of organic veg Riverford supplies is that it is an expensive luxury, affordable to relatively few people. The real problem, counters Singh-Watson, is low incomes and supermarket profits.“The phrase ‘food poverty’ infuriates me. We have a real issue with poverty, but very little of it has to do with food,” he says. “Most peoplespend 10% of their income on foodand for poorer people, it might be 15%.”“But for everyone it’s still less than they pay on rent, and how much do we talk about ‘rent poverty’?” he says. “The reason people are poor is because they’re not paid enough and because housing is too expensive in this country. All the research suggests that most people, even people on lower incomes, want to feed their families better and they are prepared to pay a bit more for it.”“And what about the supermarkets? Why aren’t we talking about what they are sucking out of the food chain?” he asks. “Vegetables prices are typically multiplied four times between leaving the field and arriving on the supermarket shelf. We’re talking about the wrong thing.”Nonetheless, Riverford recently cut the price of 20 staple items in its veg boxes. How? “We’re going to make less money,” Singh-Watson says.“We were very affordable for a long time – cheaper than conventional veg in Tesco – but that came with compromises” on staff pay and being green, he says. “Arguably, over the last five to 10 years, we’ve swung the other way, and we’re absolutely uncompromising.”Forty years on from its founding, what does Singh-Watson hope the coming decades will bring for Riverford? “In an ideal world, it would be commercially successful without compromising on its values, and thereby show that it is possible to do business in a different way,” he says. “The No 1 thing I want to show is that unregulated, brutal capitalism is not the way forward, and that we can behave another way. I would go as far as to say the future of our planet depends on it.”View image in fullscreenGuy, his father and his siblings L-R Rachel Watson who was marketing director at Riverford until 2021, Guy’s father and brother Oliver who runs Riverford Dairy with sister Louise (bottom right) Ben (bottom left) who run Ben’s Farm shops, 2012Photograph: Riverford.co.ukThe last chapter of his late father’s life was establishing a low-carbon commune, collecting waifs and strays, says Singh-Watson. Now at 65, he says: “I don’t want to retire but I like doing stuff that I can get my arms around and say I did that. I’ve been building stone walls for the last month, and nothing makes me happier.”Going around the fields picking veg and then going home to cook it, as his mother did, also makes him very happy. As for the cardoons, Singh-Watson recommends frying the tough, bitterleaf stems in breadcrumbswith a Sicilian dip called bagna cauda, made of olive oil, garlic and anchovies: “All the best food is peasant food.”Explore more on these topicsFarmingOrganicsDevonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s worse than Brexit. In fact I could cope with that better.”Another veteran Labour MP backed up her comments saying that, in their experience, hostility towards politicians was worse now than it had ever been.Another MP said: “I’ve had some pretty unpleasant abuse. One [person] asked recently why I was hosting and supporting child rapists.” They added that the police had assured them those carrying out the abuse were “only a small online community”.Newer MPs also reported feeling the impact of a recent rise in tensions over issues including grooming gangs, small boats and asylum seeker hotels.The Green party co-leader and MP for Bristol Central, Carla Denyer, said the abuse she is sent had become “noticeably worse” in the last few months, “escalating in some cases to violent threats”, which she had reported to the police.“As a leftwing and queer woman MP who speaks up frequently in support of refugees and LGBTIQA+ issues, I attract a lot of misogynist and homophobic abuse,” she said. “I wish I was surprised, but sadly it feels inevitable in the current political environment as the far right in the UK and across the world feels more and more emboldened and validated by other political parties dancing to their tune.”She added: “It doesn’t matter how much you disagree with someone, threats of violence are never, ever appropriate. And they won’t silence me.”“It’s horrendous,” said another MP who was elected last year. “I’m having to deal with daily lies about asylum seeker hotels and HMOs, which are entirely fabricated and are leading to huge anger and fear.”Another female MP said: “I have received death threats in the last six months. The misogyny and the hate hasn’t really stopped since I was elected [last year], so it always feels like it has been pretty intense and is constant.”Many of the MPs who voiced concerns asked to remain anonymous, fearing they would attract further abuse if they spoke publicly about the issue.A speaker’s conference on the security of MPs found only just over half (52%) of those who responded to a survey felt safe in their role. The biggest concern reported by MPs was online abuse, followed by being recognised and abused in public.“I’ve fought four general elections and feel things sank to all time low – so far – in this last 2024 one,” another Labour MP, Rupa Huq, said.“The speaker’s conference, which I serve on, is investigating these issues and our witnesses have included Meta and X to the Electoral Commission, but their focus is during electoral campaigning or contests when, sadly, these issues rear their heads in between elections.”On Saturday, the MP Anna Dixon saidpolice were investigating death threatsover her position on a national inquiry into grooming gangs after Moore claimed she had been “dismissing calls for an inquiry since day one”.Dixon said she only voted against a Tory proposal for a national inquiry into grooming gangs because it included an amendment to the children’s wellbeing and schools bill. Moore said he condemned any threats of violence, but insisted he had raised “legitimate concerns”.Brendan Cox, the co-founder of the Together Coalition and the husband of the MP Jo Cox, who was murdered by a far-right terrorist in 2016, said mainstream politicians were fanning the flames of division. He said “difficult policy positions” needed to be debated more civilly.“Threats to MPs don’t come from nowhere,” he said. “When mainstream politicians use violent or extreme rhetoric, dehumanisation of opponents increases and violence becomes more likely.”On Sunday, protests continued against the use of hotels to house asylum seekers, with demonstrators decked in flags gathered outside the Castle Bromwich Holiday Inn in Birmingham and police in London standing guard outside the Britannia hotel in Canary Wharf.This weekend there was also acampaign to put up union jack and Saint George’s cross flagsacross the country gather pace. According to the anti-extremist groupsHope Not Hateand Stand Up to Racism, the campaign called “operation raise the colours” has been partly organised by well-known far-right figures.On Saturday, police in Basildon in Essex arrested a 33-year-old man on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offence and conspiracy to commit criminal damage, after a video appeared to show racist abuse being shouted as red crosses were painted on the walls of a row of white buildings in the town.In Stevenage, a man claimed he was attacked with a petrol bomb in the early hours of Saturday morning while hanging flags from lamp-posts. “It appears that the victim was struck by a glass bottle containing a lit rag and sustained a cut to his head,” Chf Insp Sarah Gilbertson of Hertfordshire police said, appealing for anyone with information to come forward.Amid the febrile atmosphere, the government has set out plans to introduce a fast-track asylum appeals process, which will speed up the removal of people with no right to be in the UK. Labour has also pledged to end the use of asylum hotels by 2029.“We cannot carry on with these completely unacceptable delays in appeals as a result of the system we have inherited, which mean that failed asylum seekers stay in the system for years on end at huge cost to the taxpayer,” said the home secretary, Yvette Cooper.Dan Jarvis, the security minister and chair of the defending democracy taskforce, said: “Vile threats and the intimidation of those who serve in public life is utterly unacceptable.“We are absolutely determined to ensure all elected representatives can carry out their democratic duties without suffering harassment and the defending democracy taskforce works to ensure a whole-of-government response to the threats to our democracy.“While there will always be a place for robust debate, there will never be a place for fear in our democracy.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumThe far rightOnline abuseLabourConservativesnewsShareReuse this content"

The IAEA has repeatedly warned of the risks of fighting near nuclear plants afterRussialaunched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.Russia’s defence ministry said at least 95 Ukrainian drones had been intercepted across more than a dozen Russian regions on Sunday, whenUkrainecelebrated its 1991 declaration of independence.Map showing location of drone strikes across RussiaUkrainian drones were also shot down over areas far from the frontline, including St Petersburg in the north-west. Firefighters responded to a blaze at the port of Ust-Luga in Russia’s Leningrad region, home to a large fuel export terminal. The regional governor said approximately 10 Ukrainian drones were shot down, and debris had ignited the fire.Ukraine’s outgunned army has relied heavily on drones to respond to Russia’s invasion, notably targeting oil infrastructure to hit one of the main sources of Moscow’s revenues for funding the war.Ukraine, meanwhile, said Russia had attacked with a ballistic missile and 72 Iranian-made Shahed attack drones, 48 of which the air force said had been shot down.A Russian drone strike killed a 47-year-old woman in Dnipropetrovsk, the eastern region’s governor said.Russia has recently claimed new advances in the war, including taking two villages in the eastern Donetsk region on Saturday.The Ukrainian commander-in-chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said on Sunday that Kyiv’s forces had reclaimed three other villages in Donetsk, which has emerged as the focal point for peace talks.The Ukrainian president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said at a ceremony to mark the anniversary of the country’s independence: “This is how Ukraine strikes when its calls for peace are ignored.”He added: “Today, both the US andEuropeagree: Ukraine has not yet fully won, but it will certainly not lose.

In 2022, Giuffre and the prince reached an out-of-court settlement after she sued him for sexual assault.Knopf’s statement includes an email Giuffre wrote to Wallace 25 days before her death, stating that it was her “heartfelt wish” the memoir be released “regardless” of her circumstances.“The content of this book is crucial, as it aims to shed light on the systemic failures that allow the trafficking of vulnerable individuals across borders,” the email reads. “It is imperative that the truth is understood and that the issues surrounding this topic are addressed, both for the sake of justice and awareness.”Giuffre had been hospitalised after a serious accident on 24 March, Knopf said, and sent the email on 1 April. She died on 25 April at her farm in Western Australia, where she had lived for several years.“In the event of my passing, I would like to ensure that Nobody’s Girl is still released. I believe it has the potential to impact many lives and foster necessary discussions about these grave injustices,” she wrote to Wallace.Knopf’s statement says the book contains “intimate, disturbing, and heartbreaking new details about her time with Epstein, Maxwell and their many well-known friends, including Prince Andrew, about whom she speaks publicly for the first time since their out-of-court settlement in 2022.”Knopf editor-in-chief, Jordan Pavlin, said Nobody’s Girl was a “raw and shocking” journey and “the story of a fierce spirit struggling to break free”.In 2023, the New York Post reported that Giuffre had reached a deal “believed to be worth millions” with an undisclosed publisher.Knopf spokesperson Todd Doughty told AP that she initially agreed to a seven-figure contract with Penguin Press, but moved with acquiring editor Emily Cunningham after she was hired by Knopf as executive editor last year.Doughty declined to provide further details about the Epstein associates featured in Nobody’s Girl, but confirmed that Giuffre made “no allegations of abuse against [Donald] Trump”, who continues to face questions about the disgraced financier and his former friend.Nobody’s Girl is distinct from Giuffre’s unpublished memoir The Billionaire’s Playboy Club, referenced in previous court filings and unsealed in 2019. Through Doughty, Wallace says she began working with Giuffre on a new memoir in spring 2021.“Nobody’s Girl was both vigorously fact-checked and legally vetted,” a Knopf statement reads.Giuffre’s co-author on her memoir, Wallace, is an award-winning magazine and newspaper reporter whose work has appeared in the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times, among other publications.A representative for Andrew did not immediately return the AP’s request for comment.

There was no information on when the launch would be rescheduled.This was Starship’s 10th launch attempt. Of its nine previous uncrewed outings, dating to April 2023, failures have outnumbered the successes. All three test flights this year ended in huge explosions and debris raining down onCaribbean islandsfrom the Bahamas to the Turks and Caicos in January and March, and theIndian Ocean in May.Sunday night’s test flight, from SpaceX’s sprawling complex in Starbase, Texas,formerly known as Boca Chica, had various mission objectives, including the first successful deployment of Starlink communications satellite simulators.Inside Elon Musk’s plan to rain SpaceX’s rocket debris over Hawaii’s pristine watersRead moreMusk had remained uncharacteristically quiet ahead of the mission. “Getting ready to launch Starship,” heposted on Thursdayto the X platform he also owns, alongside images of the rocket assembly moving into position. SpaceX has not achieved a safe return landing of the upper stage of Starship, which Musk is hoping to have certified for human spaceflight as early as next year.SpaceX engineers have made a number of changes following reviews of the rocket’s previous failures, which include “acatastrophic explosion” that destroyed a Starship rocket during a ground test in June. The company is testing a variety of new heat-resistant tiles designed to stand the stresses of re-entry, and aims to return the upper stage to its landing site for the first time.The entire Starship stack, at 403ft (123 meters), is considerably larger and more powerful than Nasa’s Apollo-era Saturn V rocket that last took humans to the moon in 1972.Musk’s vision is a fully reusable space vehicle capable of repeated return trips to Marsbeginning in late 2026without astronauts, then with crews making the six-month space voyage as early as 2029. Ultimately, the SpaceX and Tesla founder aims to build athriving city for humanson the red planet in the coming two to three decades.Experts say it is a hugely ambitious undertaking. First, Musk needs to proveSpaceXcan launch and recover Starship’s components safely from short hops into the atmosphere, to say nothing of a journey to the moon.Only four Starship launches have been considered successful, although the company has made progress in recovering the first-stage Super Heavy rocket booster by capturing it in a giant pair of robotic armsnicknamed the chopsticks.SpaceX had said it would not attempt to catch the booster from Sunday’s flight because the component would instead be used for in-flight experiments “to gather real-world performance data on future flight profiles and off-nominal scenarios”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When he left the government, Musk said he would return to his businesses. He has since backtracked on the pledge and said he will start a new political party, though he may already bebacking off the initiative.Ethics watchdogs havequestioned Musk’s former role for the White House, in which he slashed tens of thousands of government jobs in the name of efficiency while preserving and benefiting from billions of dollars in federal contracts.Donald Trump said this month heplanned to relax regulationsthat will allow Musk, and fellow billionaires with space ambitions such as the Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos, to avoid reviews previously required by the National Environmental Policy Act (Nepa) before launch permits can be granted.Authorities and environmentalists have expressed concerns over the environmental impacts of SpaceX operationsin Mexico, after the explosion near its border in June, and in Hawaii, where authorities and environmentalistsfear the impact on its sensitive marine ecosystemfrom new rules that will allow Musk to launch 25 Starship flights from Texas instead of just five.Explore more on these topicsSpaceXElon MuskSpacenewsShareReuse this content"

Kushner would be summoned to the foreign ministry on Monday, it added.Kushner’s letter follows another sent to Macron by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this week in which Netanyahu accused Macron of contributing to antisemitism by calling for international recognition of a Palestinian state, according to the Jerusalem Post.Macron has emerged as one of the more forceful critics of Netanyahu’s prosecution of the war in Gaza, particularly with regard to Palestinian civilian casualties, while Trump has steadfastly supported the Israeli leader.“Public statements haranguing Israel and gestures toward recognition of a Palestinian state embolden extremists, fuel violence, and endanger Jewish life in France. In today’s world, anti-Zionism is antisemitism – plain and simple,” Kushner wrote.Kushner’s son Jared Kushner is married to Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump, who converted to Judaism before their wedding in 2009. They have three children who are being raised Jewish.Macron has publicly criticized antisemitism as antithetical to French values and increased security to protect synagogues and other Jewish centres in response to antisemitic incidents linked to the Gaza conflict.France is home to western Europe’s largest Jewish population at around half a million people, as well as a significant Muslim community sensitive to the plight of the Palestinian people in Gaza.Both communities have reported a spike in hate crimes since Israel’s retaliatory offensive against the Palestinian militant group Hamas in the besieged coastal strip.Macron’s announcement that France would formally recognise a Palestinian state during a UN meeting in September drew a swift rebuke from Israel at the time.With the move, France is set to join a list of nations that has grown since the start of the Gaza war nearly two years ago.France is among at least 147 of the 193 UN members that now recognise or plan to recognise a Palestinian state, according to a recentNew York Times report.AFP contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsFranceUS foreign policyTrump administrationAntisemitismEuropeUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Because, even before I’ve gone to Notting Hill carnival, I’ve heard about it so many times. It’s something you see on TV, your friends tell you about it, and say: ‘You should come. It’s a different vibe.’”View image in fullscreenThree children in carnival costumes at Notting Hill carnival on Sunday.Photograph: Victoria Jones/ShutterstockBolt said he had learned a lot about its origins as a free street party during his visit. Addressing calls to make it a ticketed event, and even to move it out of its spiritual home in one of the traditional centres of London’s black community, he said: “It wouldn’t be the same. It wouldn’t be the same, for sure.“Knowing what carnival is – it’s about marching and the vibes and the energy – to put it in one space where people can’t move, it’s not going to be the same … I think it would definitely kill. A lot of people probably wouldn’t go that much.”Speaking in his Mayfair hotel room after his appearance at carnival, as part of a sponsorship deal with the clothing brand Puma, he said: “It was something I’ve never really experienced – a vibe where we come together and build something different.”View image in fullscreenRevellers at Notting Hill carnival on Sunday.Photograph: Toby Melville/ReutersSunday is traditionally family day at carnival. This year, it began with the J’ouvert celebration, with people covering each other in paint, coloured powder and chocolate.The festivities started in the morning on Great Western Road, where judges stood in a stall to watch the colourful float procession. A woman on glittering golden stilts walked past as an enthusiastic soca MC had the crowd jumping with their hands in the air.Fast-paced drumming could be heard and felt before the first parade arrived. The street was decorated with flutes, brass instruments, steel drums and costumes including giant colourful wings.View image in fullscreenCarnival attenders with orange paint and smoke grenades on Sunday.Photograph: Sopa Images/LightRocket/Getty ImagesFlags representing countries from Venezuela to Trinidad and Tobago were draped across the shoulders of people who danced and cheered down the road. A mixture of adults and children dressed in jewels, glittery wings, belts and headdresses leapt down the street followed by floats pumping out bass and music.As the Paddington Arts float drove past, the side of the lorry reading Let’s Dance Not Fight, the MC spoke of connection to the crowd and the dancers dressed in iridescent purples and blues for its Under the Sea theme.Along the side streets were rows of food and drink stalls serving jerk chicken, curry goat, Red Stripe and rum punch cocktails. On other streets, towering sound systems and stages had been set up playing reggae, dub and drum’n’bass. Locals leaned out of their balconies and windows and watched the celebrations below.This was Claudette Sparen’s eighth visit to carnival. Originally from Curaçao but living in the Netherlands, the medical worker said she loved everything about it. “The people are so nice, so polite, so happy – they are the best people I have ever met,” she said. “We love to be here. It’s bigger [than before] and there are a lot of young people. Everybody is having fun and you see different culture together. I love that.”View image in fullscreenThe children’s parade at Notting Hill carnival on Sunday.Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/Future Publishing/Getty ImagesSabina Challenger, from Hackney in east London, took part in the Perpetual Beauty float with her child. “Carnival is about unity and about bringing people together, about reminding the community what the West Indian community has brought to the UK,” she said.“It also helps us to remind us of where we came from. It stems from slavery and oppression but it’s a celebration in terms of how far we have come in not just the UK but the world.”All major music and sound systems were switched off at 3pm for three minutes to honour those who were killed in the 2017 fire in Grenfell Tower, which is still clad in scaffolding and wrapping, and looms over the carnival route. People also honoured Kelso Cochrane, who was murdered in a racially motivated attack in Notting Hill in 1959.Explore more on these topicsNotting Hill carnivalUsain BoltFestivalsLondonCaribbean food and drinkRacenewsShareReuse this content"

Adler “passed peacefully in his sleep”, Paradigm Talent Agency’s Sarah Shulman said on behalf of his family. No immediate cause was given.Among Adler’s acting credits areThe Sopranos, on which he played Tony Soprano adviser Hesh Rabkin across all six seasons, andThe Good Wife, where he played law partner Howard Lyman. But before Adler had ever stepped in front of a film or television camera, he had 53 Broadway productions to his name – all behind the scenes, serving as a stage manager, producer or director.He hailed from an entertainment family with deep roots in Jewish and Yiddish theater, as he told the Jewish Ledger in 2014. His father, Philip Adler, was a general manager for the famed Group Theatre andBroadwayproductions, and his cousin Stella Adler was a legendary acting teacher.“I’m a creature of nepotism,” Adler told TheaterMania in 2015. “I got my first job when I was at Syracuse University and my father, the general manager of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, called me [because] there was an opening for an assistant stage manager. I skipped school.”After a long theater career, which included the original production of My Fair Lady and working with the likes of Marlene Dietrich, Julie Andrews and Richard Burton, among many others, Adler left Broadway during its 1980s slump. He moved to California, where he worked on television productions such as the soap opera Santa Barbara.“I was really getting into the twilight of a mediocre career,” he told theNew YorkTimes in 1992.But the retirement he was contemplating was staved off when Donna Isaacson, the casting director for The Public Eye and a longtime friend of one of Adler’s daughters, had a hunch about how to cast a hard-to-fill role, as the New York Times reported then. Adler had been on the other side of auditions, and, curious to experience how actors felt, agreed to try out. Director Howard Franklin, who auditioned dozens of actors for the role of a newspaper columnist in the Joe Pesci-starring film, had “chills” when Adler read for the part, the newspaper reported.So began an acting career that had him working consistently in front of the camera for more than 30 years. An early role on the David Chase-written Northern Exposure paved the way for his time on a future Chase project,The Sopranos.“When David was going to do the pilot for The Sopranos he called and asked me if I would do a cameo of Hesh. It was just supposed to be a one-shot,” he told Forward in 2015. “But when they picked up the show they liked the character, and I would come on every fourth week.”Films included Woody Allen’sManhattan Murder Mystery, but Adler was perhaps best known for his television work. Those credits included stints on Rescue Me, Mad About You, Transparent and guest spots on shows ranging from The West Wing to Broad City.He even returned to Broadway, this time onstage, in Elaine May’s Taller Than a Dwarf in 2000. In 2015, he appeared in Larry David’s writing and acting stage debut,Fish in the Dark.“I do it because I really enjoy it. I think retirement is a road to nowhere,” Adler told Forward, on the subject of the play. “I wouldn’t know what to do if I were retired. I guess if nobody calls anymore, that’s when I’ll be retired. Meanwhile this is great.”Adler published a memoir, Too Funny for Words: Backstage Tales from Broadway,Television, and the Movies, last year. “I’m ready to go at a moment’s notice,” he told CT Insider then, when asked if he’d take more acting roles. In recent years, he and his wife, Joan Laxman, relocated from Connecticut back to his hometown of New York. Survivors include his four daughters, Shulman said.For Adler, who once thought he was “too goofy-looking” to act, seeing himself on screen was odd, at least initially. And in multiple interviews with various outlets, he expressed how strange it was to be recognized by the public after spending so many years working behind the scenes. There was at least one advantage to being preserved on film, though, as he told the New York Times back in 1992.“I’m immortal,” he said.Explore more on these topicsUS newsTelevisionBroadwayThe SopranosThe Good WifeTheatreUS televisionnewsShareReuse this content"

But then Trump came forCalifornia, and its governor dropped the niceties.With a flood of all-caps social media posts, a counterpunching redistricting proposal and a string of lawsuits challenging the new administration, Newsom is not just taking on Trump, he’s stealing his tactics:fight, fight, fight.“We’ve got to wake up, disabuse ourselves as Democrats,” Newsomsaidon a podcast last week. “I’m sick of being weak. I’m sick of being effete. I’m sick of being non-consequential. It’s not good enough to say it – it’s time to do.”Newsom has charged on to the national stage as a recast political brawler willing to wield power as ruthlessly as the other side. On Thursday, he signed redistricting legislation establishing a special election to ask voters to temporarily redraw the state’s congressional boundaries and give Democrats as many as five additional US House seats in next year’s midterm elections.California’s governor signed a redistricting plan. What happens next?Read moreThe ballot measure is a direct attempt to “neuter and neutralize” Texas’s partisan gerrymander, engineered at Trump’s behest, to safeguard Republicans’ fragile House majority. At a bill-signing ceremony on Thursday, Newsom cited the president’s claim that he was “entitled” to five additional congressional seats in the Lone Star state: “That should put chills up your spine.”Now theCaliforniareferendum transforms an off-cycle election year into a high-stakes national showdown that could determine control of Congress – and set the stage for 2028. For Newsom, who’s term-limited and widely viewed as a presidential contender, the success – or failure – of this 11-week sprint could carry major consequences for his political future.The November special election gives voters in deep-blue California a chance to strike back at Trump, who has relentlessly tormented the state since returning to the White House. But by temporarily overriding California’s independent redistricting commission – long a point of pride in the Golden state – Democrats are being asked to “compromise their own values,” saidKim Nalder,a political science professor at California State University, Sacramento.“That’s been a guiding light for a lot of Democrats – the whole ‘they go low, we go high’ idea,” she said. “One of the risks is that the Democratic party – and Newsom himself – become associated with this all-out brawl, no-holds-barred fighting, rather than having a particular set of political principles that they stand by no matter what.”How Californians will decide remains uncertain. A Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies pollreleasedon Friday shows 48% of registered voters in the state support Newsom’s redistricting plan, compared with 32% who oppose it. Another 20% are undecided, providing an opening for either campaign to make their pitch.“If Proposition 50 passes, and Californians succeed in adding more House seats, and is partially, if not completely, responsible for flipping the House next year, he’s a hero, plain and simple,” saidBill Whalen,a Hoover Institution fellow who was a speechwriter for Pete Wilson, the former Republican governor of California.Even if the initiative falls short in November, Whalen believes Newsom still benefits. “He still gets credit among those same Democrats for fighting the good fight,” he said. “I don’t see how he fails.”The all-out political war between the president and California’s governor erupted earlier this summer, when Trump seized control of California’s national guard and deployed US marines to Los Angeles, over Newsom’s objections, to suppress protests against the federal immigration crackdown. The raids are ongoing, and Trump has targeted the state in other ways: an attempt to strip federal funding from UCLA, andtariffsthat threaten California’s economy – the fourth largest in the world.Newsom has argued that Trump was not just a threat to his state – but to the entire 249-year-old American project. While his approach might offend virtue-minded Democrats, he says the moment demands it.“Yes, I’ve changed,” hesaidrecently in a local news interview. “The facts have changed. We need to change.”In recent weeks, as Newsom has stepped up his attacks on Trump as a “weak” and a “failed” leader, his social media team has trolled the president online – unleashing a jumble of unfiltered, stream-of-consciousness rants, AI-generated political fan art and schoolyard taunts, some of it signed with the governor’s initials, GCN, meant to parody the president’s own chaotic posting style.View image in fullscreenNational guard troops and a group of protesters in Los Angeles, California, on 10 June.Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty ImagesNewsom says he’s simply holding up a mirror. “If you’ve got issues with what I’m putting out,” he told reporters last week, “you sure as hell should have concerns about what he’s putting out as president.”The posts have gone viral – racking up millions of views, thousands of comments and driving a flood of engagement. They’ve also caught the attention of the right. Fox News hosts,Kid Rock, JD Vance and even Trump himself have all taken the bait, provoking what the governor’s staff gleefully dubbed “Maga meltdowns”.“JESSE WATTERS KEPT CALLING ME ‘DADDY’ (VERY WEIRD, NOT INTERESTED, BUT THANK YOU!)” his office clapped back, in an 188-word tweet about Fox News’s breathless coverage of Newsom’s furious posting streak.“Gavin Newsom can mimicDonald Trumpall that he wants to,” Vance told Fox News host Laura Ingraham, “they’re still going to lose unless they get better policies that actually serve the American people.”Trump, for his part, weighed in on his own social media platform, Truth Social, vowing to save “the Once Great State of California” from “Newscum”.“Triggered?” Newsomreplied with a wink.The Berkley poll suggested that California voters back his gloves-off strategy with the president by a nearly two-to-one margin, with just 29% saying they’d prefer a more cooperative approach. The tougher posture lands especially well with younger voters: 71% of Californians under 30 say they approve.In a blitz of media appearances last week, Newsom escalated his rhetoric.“We’re fighting fire with fire,” he said onThe Siren podcast. “And we’re going to punch these sons of bitches in the mouth.”The response was telling: no ​Democratic moralizing, no rebuke from party leaders, no pressure on Newsom to apologize. Instead, his teampromotedthe interview to his legions of new followers and supporters replied withMAGAesque AI imagesof the governor as a superhero.“People are just not used to seeing this kind of rough around the edges, non-poll-tested messaging coming from Democrats,” saidOlivia Julianna, a 22-year-old Democratic activist from Texas and social media influencer who interviewed Newsom for the episode. “It’s real, it’s raw, it’s authentic, and it shows that he’s a fighter.”As Democrats brace for the loss of up to five US House seats in her state, under the redistricting planapproved by the Texas legislature on Saturday, Julianna said voters alarmed by Trump’s increasingly brazen power grabs are desperate for leaders who offer more than just fighting words.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Earlier this year, Newsom declared the Democratic brand “toxic” in an interview with provocateur Bill Maher – a diagnosisbacked by pollingandvoter registration trends, but striking language for the leader of the largest blue state who could seek that same party’s nomination.He enraged progressives – already wary of his record on housing and homelessness – when he questioned the fairness of transgender athletes competing in women’s sports. The comments, during a conversation with rightwing agitator Charlie Kirk on the inaugural episode ofthe governor’s podcast, This Is Gavin Newsom, marked a split from other top Democrats on the issue and rattled some of his LGBTQ+ allies.In response to aGuardian storyabout the loss of care for trans youth in California, a Newsom spokesperson said critics should point the finger at Trump, not at a governor whose “record supporting the trans community is unmatched”.“Everyone wants to blame Gavin Newsom for everything. But instead of indulging in Newsom derangement syndrome, maybe folks should look to Washington,” the spokesperson said – invoking a pejorative phrase, “derangement syndrome”, used by Trump supporters to mock the president’s detractors.While his sharper tone has angered some on the left, the redistricting gambit has managed to unite progressives and establishment Democrats – sending Newsom’s once-stalled approval ratingsoaring.His redistricting plan has drawn praise from across the party, including Barack Obama, who called it “a responsible approach”, the formerHouse speaker Nancy Pelosiand the entire congressional delegation of California Democrats. With the ballot initiative in motion, he challenged other blue state leaders to follow suit, laying down the gauntlet for fellow Democratic governors with presidential ambitions as Trump expands his push to secure Republican advantages in states such as Indiana, Ohio and Missouri.That aggressive posture – in effect becoming an “anti-Trump troll” – has been cathartic for many Democrats, Nalder said.“Democrats nationwide have been feeling like theTrump administrationhas been punching their values and their party and democracy itself in the face repeatedly day after day and they’re just ready for somebody to punch the bully back,” she said. “And Newsom right now looks like he could be that guy.”View image in fullscreenGavin Newsom greets Donald and Melania Trump in Los Angeles on 24 January as the newly elected president arrives to inspect wildfire damage.Photograph: Mark Schiefelbein/APNewsom’s campaign faces mounting opposition from Republicans, including those not in Trump’s Maga camp. The popular former Republican governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, a longtime Trump critic and advocate of independent redistricting, haspromised toTERMINATE GERRYMANDERING”.Former House speaker Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, has also vowed to pump money into what some observerspredictcould quickly become one of the most expensive contests in Golden state history.“The voters of California have a say,” he said in an interview on CNN. “If you truly believe in your power of your own vote, you should vote against this.”Newsom has raised more than $6.2m from 200,000 donations in the week since heofficially launchedthe ballot campaign at a rally in Los Angeles last week, according to his team.There, Newsom stood side by side with labor leaders, members of the teacher’s union and the head of California’s Planned Parenthood. His redistrticting plan even earned the endorsement of Sara Sadhwani, a Democrat who served on California’s 2020 independent redistricting commission. Making the case for tossing out her work, she declared: “Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures”.As Newsom spoke at the Japanese American National Museum’s National Center for the Preservation of Democracy earlier this month, federal agents, armed and masked, fanned out across the complex. Newsom said their presence could not have been coincidental, though a Trump administration official called the accusation “misinformed”.The next day, the governor’s office filed a freedom of information request seeking details on the administration’s involvement in the decision to send border patrol agents to that location.It was just more fuel for Newsom’s argument: his campaign is not just about congressional districts, but a referendum on Trump – and American democracy.“Donald Trump, you have poked the bear,” Newsom says in anew adfor the redistricting campaign, as the camera flashes to the grizzly on the state’s flag. “And we will punch back.”Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaGavin NewsomDonald TrumpUS immigrationTrump administrationUS politicsWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

Almost all of the 3,700-odd supporters inside the Mazuma Stadium are still dancing wildly, Mark Swindlehurst’s words barely registering.He has beenMorecambeFootball Club’s volunteer announcer for 32 years, and his speech is dripping in emotion. Seconds earlier, in the eighth of 10 added minutes, the substitute Daniel Ogwuru secured a precious winner.As Morecambe broke, Ashvir Singh Johal, whoreplaced Derek Adams as manageronly on Monday, placed his hands on his head. As the net burst, and with it the home terrace, he galloped giddily down the touchline.Championship roundup: Coventry celebrate stadium news with 7-1 rout of QPRRead more“The only thing we didn’t practise was going to a 5-3-2,” Johal said later, composure regained. “The players came to me, and I wrote on a bit of paper to show them. We scored on the counterattack from that situation.” A grin emerges. “I was quite pleased with that!”Even before the late twist, Saturday was inked in as a day of celebration. An early-season match againstAltrinchamwould not ordinarily be greeted with such enthusiasm, but this was, if not the most important fixture in the English professional game this season, then certainly the most critical in the club’s 105-year history.Having lost Football League status in April, the club and the town were a shrimp’s shell’s breadth from losing so much more. A convoluted takeover, one delayed and delayed by the former owner Jason Whittingham and his Bond Group, left the club days from being removed from the National League.Last Sunday, the suspension was lifted and the Panjab Warriors, who gained English Football League approval for the purchase in early June, were finally able to complete their investment.The wait must have felt worthwhile as their representatives celebrated gleefully from the directors’ box as a result manifested earlier by the club DJ played out. Kick-off was still 90 minutes away when D:Ream started playing. The lyrics “Things can only get better” were apt.Keith, a fan who has been taking the drum hung by his side to games for three decades, said of the previous uncertainty: “I went through tears and anger – those were the two extremes. It was like part of my life had gone. Football is a game at the end of the day, but it is a huge part of people’s lives and the whole community.”Jeff Calvert, present at Wembley when Morecambe won the 1974 FA Trophy, arrived early with son Paul, his wife, his daughter and his three grandsons. “It’s magical,” he said. “Still surreal at the moment. Thank goodness for Panjab Warriors.”“I’ve been checking Facebook constantly for months – I’ve got a repetitive strain injury in my thumb,” Paul added, smiling.View image in fullscreenMorecambe manager Ashvir Singh Johal applauds the fans at the final whistle.Photograph: Gary Oakley/PAIn a swirling ocean of red and black, familiar faces greeted each other and early arrivers were buoyed up by the news that club staff had stuck £500 behind the ground’s bars. “I never stopped believing,” Anne told her friends in the queue. Some of them did.Come 11.30am the instantly recognisable dull ring of a PA system preparing for duty sounded. “The turnstiles are now open.” Sweet, sweet words. Simultaneously, the team sheet confirmed that the five senior players on the books last week would line up alongside six newbies.Even Craig David could not do lyrical justice to Morecambe’s seven days.

They all went weeks ago at a pop-up event run by the kit supplier Terrace on the promenade.Ten minutes before the start, Morecambe’s new custodians were introduced to the crowd. Unsurprisingly, the reception received was rapturous and rousing. Johal was afforded a similar ovation.Talk about dropping from a height into roaring flames. Not only is this Johal’s maiden senior role, but also, aged 30, he is the youngest manager across English football’s top five tiers. Oh, and he is the first Sikh to manage a professional British club.He has a fine record in youth football, though, including time spent with Cesc Fàbregas in Como, and was Kolo Touré’s assistant during a brief stint at Wigan. Management is his dream. “This is not a learning experience for me, because I’m not here to learn,” he said. “I’m here to win and be the best manager I can be.”View image in fullscreenDaniel Ogwuru celebrates after scoring Morecambe’s late winner.Photograph: Gary Oakley/PAAt 12.36pm, the seemingly impossible happened: Ben Tollitt, one of last season’s survivors, nudged Morecambe ahead. Johal, his assistant Lee Tomlin and the entire bench shared warm, meaningful embraces, as did friends, loved ones and strangers around the ground. Can you just imagine? Seven days ago most of them couldn’t.Given training amounted to 120 minutes across two sessions, Morecambe were excellent. True, they conceded a first-half equaliser and by the end suffered a cramp epidemic, but they held on. And then some. Post match, Bring Me Sunshine, a song synonymous with the area thanks to the comedy duo Morecambe and Wise, was aired. It was sung with gusto by almost everyone.In future, Whittingham’s tenure – the good (spoiler: not much) and the disastrous (spoiler: plenty) – will be discussed in local watering holes and amusement arcades till the cockles come home.But all that really matters now, like truly, properly, actually, matters, is that a community’s metronome remains ticking. If Morecambe can flip attention into momentum, a bright future awaits. First, though, Aldershot away on a bank holiday Monday. A 524-mile round trip, thank you very much. 5am coach, you say?

When the police told Asher a taxi was on its way, she pleaded for them to send officers instead, telling them: “I can’t do this by myself”. That was the last time the police spoke with her. The taxi, meanwhile, went to the wrong address.Sometime after 9pm, Woodhouse and her adult son picked up Asher, who was unknown to them, walking through the streets, lightly dressed, and took her home.There, Woodhouse and her late partner, Bobbie Carroll, tried to make Asher comfortable. She showered, put on Carroll’s blue robe, and ate, all the while begging the couple not to call the police. Woodhouse made up the couch – the same one she sits on today – into a bed for Asher, and turned out the lights just after midnight.View image in fullscreenJulia Woodhouse of Black Sands Lodge was one of the last people to see Iraena Asher on the night she disappeared.Photograph: Fiona Goodall/The Guardian“I hadn’t even got undressed and I heard a noise on the driveway,” Woodhouse says. She saw her son waving to Asher, trying to coax her back into the house. “He said, ‘Mum call the cops, there is something seriously wrong with this woman’.” Then, Asher fled.Another Piha couple last saw Asher raise her naked arms towards a streetlight, kiss the ground and turn towards the roaring beach. And then, the night swallowed her whole.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailAsher’s story is one of New Zealand’s most enduring mysteries and has left a deep wound in Piha, but it is not the only one haunting the community.Five others have disappeared in the region over the past three decades.In 1992, Quentin Godwin, a curious and lively 18-year-old with bipolar disorder left his home in Titirangi, 30 minutes from Piha, and was never seen again. In 2012, Cherie Vousden, a 42-year-old mother, disappeared on the Mercer Bay loop track – a trail near Piha. She was last seen walking along the track with a bottle of wine. Three years later, Kim Bambus, a 21-year-old nurse from Auckland vanished on the same track, after telling her flatmates she was going there to run. An extensive search of the area led to nothing.They have gone without a trace – without a shoe, without a bagSir Bob HarveyIn 2019, Guoquan (Laurence) Wu’s car was found at Piha, but the 22-year-old has never been seen again. His ex-girlfriend told the coroner he had expressed a desire to end his life, but Wu’s family did not believe he would deliberately harm himself. Then, in 2020, French student and keen hiker, Eloi Rolland, 18, was last seen walking the long road towards Piha, before he vanished. He had booked a flight home to France earlier than planned and had promised to bring home some of Piha’s black sand. Police believe he may have become lost in the bush surrounding the coast.No clothing or remains of any of the missing peoplehave ever been found.View image in fullscreenIn the telling of Piha’s missing people, the story of Hinerangi – of whom a statue has been erected – is often referenced as a haunting echo.Photograph: Fiona Goodall/The GuardianThe coroner found Bambus and Wu likely died by suicide, while Asher most likely drowned and Vousden likely fell to her death. The cause of Godwin’s death was inconclusive and Rolland’s case remains open.Little has connected the cases beyond the place they occurred, until a true-crime documentary changed that.Black Coast Vanishings, released in New Zealand in 2024 and now available in Australia on DocPlay, now asks: could these cases be linked? Are sinister forces at play? Do they warrant further investigation?Over four episodes, co-directors Candida Beveridgeand Megan Jones interrogate the disappearances, interview family members and present theories and testimony from Piha locals to paint a picture of a small community grappling with tragedy, while pulsing with a troubling history of drugs, sexual violence and secrets.But tension has emerged in Piha over the series’ depiction of the cases.For some in the community, the series provided an opportunity to set their story straight, and reveal an undiscovered truth. But for others, Piha, with its tragedies and moody landscapes, had become the latest casualty of the wildly popular true-crime genre.‘A community under speculation’On an early July morning, on the road west from Auckland to Piha, large arterial routes give way to narrow winding roads and as houses recede, the vast Waitākere rainforest – cloaked in a low dense mist – closes in.When the rainforest thins, a smattering of houses appear, perched on the ridge lines, before the expansive west coast suddenly opens up. Lion Rock juts out of the shore, winged by the black sands of Piha. Imposing cliffs rear up from the ocean and the horizon fades into the grey-blue of the Tasman Sea.Any visitor to Piha will describe its majesty and its danger; how the membrane between the earthly and spiritual realms feels porous here.View image in fullscreen‘We have to look at ourselves – not look at the landscape, not for a demon – but at ourselves,’ says Pita Turei, artist, film-maker and Piha local.Standing on the cliffs is a statue, or pou, of Hinerangi, an early ancestor of the local tribe, Te Kawerau ā Maki. In the telling of Piha’s missing people, Hinerangi’s story is often referenced as a haunting echo. After her husband drowned fishing on the rocks, Hinerangi sat on the headland longing for his return. For days she waited until, heartbroken, she too disappeared to join the journey of the spirits.Roughly 900 people live in Piha. Its residents are an eclectic mix of artists, surfers, people living off-grid, nature-lovers, families and a growing middle-class. Over summer, the population explodes with tourists, surfers and holidaymakers.Today, the settlement is quiet. A few people walk their dogs, and a group of surf club volunteers train in the pounding waves. The sand, whipped up by the wind, skips over the beach like sprites.“Piha is a really spiritual place,” shouts Peter Brown, the president of the south Piha surf club, over theroar of the ocean. “It has a lot of history, a lot of mana [presence].”It is beautiful and treacherous. Piha ranks as the country’s second-most dangerous ‘black spot’ for accidentaldrownings.It is “a big piece of water” and “very, very dangerous”, Brown says.When someone disappears, the club helps scour the coast for clues. Usually, the sea gives up the bodies and Brown knows enough about the currents to predict where they might emerge. If a body is damaged by rocks or sharks it may never surface, but even Brown, armed with this knowledge, can’t fathom the disappearances.“How can six people disappear and we can’t find them then and there, we can’t find them in a month … we can’t find them in 20 years? How can that ever be?”With no answers, the community started looking over their shoulders, Brown says. “It changed people’s comfort,” he says. “In a small place, everyone knows everyone, and everyone has a theory.”View image in fullscreenThe Mercer Bay Loop is a popular walking and running track.Some whisper those theories; others voice them loudly.Sir Bob Harvey, 85, the former long-running mayor of Waitākere, lifeguard and local stalwart was one of the first to propose a connection between some of the cases, in a piece written for Metro magazine in 2018.Despite the coroner’s rulings, Harvey is convinced they have been abducted.“They have gone without a trace – without a shoe, without a bag,” he says. “Someone, or some people, out here know more.”Harvey features heavily throughout the series, suggesting “they all met foul play” – a theory he bases, in part, on no bodies being found and broad similarities in the appearances of those who have vanished.“They all look handsome, beautiful, gentle, kind, so if I have to believe there is a serial killer at work – I do, I do,” he says in the documentary.Speculation like this prompted Beveridge, a Piha-based British film-maker and Auckland-based Jones to make the series. They wanted to understand whether there was any legitimacy to the rumours, to learn how the tragedies had affected the families and the community and examine what the police might have missed.“It was kind of meant to be a portrait of a community under speculation,” Beveridge tells the Guardian. “This certainly wasn’t a flippant … superficial dive into what happened.”The directors started questioning whether other people had been involved and if there had been “a cover-up in the community” when four more people disappeared after Asher.View image in fullscreenPeter Brown, president of Piha Surf Club, asks: ‘How can six people disappear and we can’t find them?’The directors are aware of somepushback against the series, but say they did not set out to prove there was a serial killer, or a connection between cases “although there were similarities between some of them, not least they all happened in the same small geographical area”.“What became clear from our investigations – and this is something we didn’t expect to emerge – was a pattern of women being stalked and predated on in the area,” Beveridge said.The series traversed the history of drug use and gang activity in the community and included accounts from women claiming they were chased, drugged and raped in Piha – testimonies the film-makers hoped would compel police to investigate the disappearances further.“It is really disappointing the police haven’t followed up a lot of what was in our series,” Jones says.The police declined the Guardian’s request for an interview but in a statement said they do not believe the incidents are linked and no tipoffs after the show aired warranted further investigation.True crime has become one of the most popular genres of books, documentary, TV and podcasts. While the public has always had an appetite for dark, “real life” mysteries, the current boom might be traced to the worldwide smash hit podcastSerial, which launched more than a decade ago, and spawned countless other popular crime series.But when true-crime turns its lens on an issue, communities can suddenly find themselves under a public microscope, watching as their most extreme stories, settings and personalities are offered up for entertainment.If not done carefully, it risks opening wounds for those who have lived through a tragedy, says Dr Gregory Stratton, a senior lecturer in criminology at RMIT.“There needs to be a purpose behind it, and if the purpose is just extractive … that can be really problematic for communities,” Stratton says.View image in fullscreenThe dramatic scenery of Piha beach has attracted many visitors.True crime can provide justice for victims or exonerate wrongfully convicted people, while allowing families and communities to share their stories, Stratton says. For audiences, meanwhile, the genre can be “sense-making”, and build our understanding of where dangers could possibly lie.It can also lead to an outsized fear of crime, Stratton says, one that feeds on fear and public anxiety “but is not necessarily about the realities of how crime happens every day”.Like any small community, rumours are rife in Piha and old grudges surface quickly. But a deeply ingrained sense of care is also evident, and the inference Piha may be harbouring dark secrets has riled people.Despite her misgivings about the series, Woodhouse does not regret appearing in the show. It was the first time she had a chance to say “out loud, and in public, that the police fucked up” Asher’s case.But portraying Piha as a dangerous place, she says – “It’s not what Piha is, and it’s certainly not what it is now”.It is a sentiment shared by others with deep ties to the area. Sandra Coney, a former investigative journalist and local politician said people now think of Piha as “a warped little community on the fringe of the Earth” – but that was wrong.View image in fullscreenLocal politician Sandra Coney at her home in Titirangi. Coney says Piha is a supportive community.Photograph: Fiona Goodall/The Guardian“Everything is run by people at Piha, there is a huge volunteer ethic …. It’s a good-humoured, forgiving community.”Coney wrote to the New Zealand Film Commission in 2021 urging it to withdraw funding from the documentaryproject, warning its speculation was “tasteless and gratuitous”.“I knew enough about the cases to know that it was a beat up,” she says, sitting in her Titirangi home, surrounded by paintings of Piha.Further, Coney argues, it glosses over suicide – tragedies that cast a long shadow in Piha and nationally.“Because we have policies around not reporting on suicides in New Zealand, it has become hidden,” Coney says, adding that park rangers have responded to a high number of incidents over the years.New Zealand has one of the highest youth suicide rates in the OECD and a high rate of accidental fatal drownings.For Pita Turei, a Māori artist, film-maker and local iwi (tribal) advocate, those tragedies and the documentary have affected the community more than the disappearances.“The inference of the program as a whole is that there is a demon,” Turei says over coffee at the local cafe. “It’s bullshit for the purpose of sensationalism and attention,” he says.“We have to look at ourselves – not look at the landscape, not for a demon – but at ourselves.”Black Coast Vanishings is streaming now on DocPlay.In Australia, the crisis support serviceLifelineis 13 11 14.

That’s why, five years ago, his comedy trio Aunty Donna establishedGrouse House: a YouTube platform launched to support up-and-coming comedians, who can leverage off Aunty Donna’s existing fanbase rather than getting stuck in the weeds of promotion and distribution.Grouse House has been ticking along ever since, hosting absurdist, experimental comedy that shares the Aunty Donna DNA, such asGocsy’s Classics– a nostalgic TV parody series from Aaron Gocs, sending up retro TV faves like Round the Twist and Heartbreak High; quizshowThe Most Upsetting Guessing Game in the World, featuring names like Daniel Sloss and Nick Cody; and comedy sci-fi seriesDescentfrom Millie Holten, Madi Savage and Ella Lawry.But it’s crunch time. If Aunty Donna and their production house,Haven’t You Done Well, want to seriously provide a leg-up for comedians, they have to independently invest in their development rather than relying on grants, which means stumping up production costs and a modest salary for everyone working on their next wave of shows. That’s why much of the proceeds ofAunty Donna’s Drem World Tour, which has just kicked off in Hobart, will go toward Grouse House; and it’s why they’ve also added a commercial arm to Haven’t You Done Well, creating sketches, podcasts and creator partnerships for brands.In the UK, the BBC has always had a culture of experimentation ... The ABC just doesn’t have that cultureThe three members of Aunty Donna – Kelly, Mark Bonanno and Zachary Ruane – are talking to Guardian Australia at their HQ in Brunswick, Melbourne, in a meeting room filled with lollies and coloured Post-It notes. Since they formed in 2011, their success has spanned tours, TV shows and viral videos. Netflix US commissioned a series,the Big Ol’ House of Fun, in 2020, as did the ABC in 2023 (Aunty Donna’s Coffee Cafe), but their focus now is on forging a new model.“We could feel the writing was on the wall with network comedy in Australia,” says Kelly. “There are two that do it – 10 and ABC2 – but it’s Lord-of-the-Rings-style odyssey shit to get commissioned. Our experience is that when we were given the green light to either go make a pilot or a proof of concept, it needed to be everything to everyone, and we’d receive heavy rounds of notes.”View image in fullscreenAunty Donna’s Coffee Cafe, the trio’s show on the ABC.Photograph: ABCAunty Donna’s relationship with the ABC started with the network’s Fresh Blood initiative in 2014, when they were selected to create sketches for ABC iview. One sketch,Bikie Wars, garnered 1.5m views on YouTube and a pilot was commissioned, but not a series (it is now on 4m). That’s one of the main problems in their view: networks will often take a punt at the beginning, but there’s little long-term nurturing or risk-taking.“In the UK, the BBC has always had a culture of experimentation,” says Bonanno. “The Mighty Boosh got three seasons; they got to play. The ABC just doesn’t have that culture. It did in the 90s and even the early 00s, then it became super safe. In my dream scenario, the ABC is a playground – and it should be, because they’re not having to satisfy advertisers.”Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningWe meet a week after the Logie awards, at whichthe ABC had a strong night– but Aunty Donna have something to say about awards, too. “With the Oscars, if you win best director or best picture, you can have a career because there’s an industry there to support it,” says Bonanno. “What frustrates me about the Logies, the Awgies and Aactas is we give these awards out, but then what? There’s no room to grow. I won an Awgie for sitcom writing, and it did less for my career than before I had one.”In 2023, the ABC screened the six-part series Aunty Donna’s Coffee Cafe, but the overall viewing numbers were eclipsed by onereal estate sketch, shot over a few hours for $500, which Aunty Donna uploaded to YouTube.“You’ve got to forget what 14-year-old you would want for your career, because allwewanted was an ABC2 show,” says Kelly. “By the time we got one, we put it out on a platform that was inept and did a bad job of promoting it.” (The ABC did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment.)View image in fullscreenRuane, Kelly and Bonanno with Kia Stevens on Aunty Donna’s Big Ol’ House of Fun, their show with Netflix.Photograph: Adam Rose/NetflixAnd so, Aunty Donna aspire to be “platform agnostic”, or as Bonanno puts it: “Never build your house in someone else’s back yard.” If they had put all their eggs into the YouTube basket, they might have suffered whenadvertising revenue dropped for many creators. If they had focused only on touring, Covid could have been their death knell. “Defining yourself by your means of distribution is a strange thing to do,” says Ruane.And even YouTube doesn’t seem as sturdy as it once was. No one’s clear on whether theAustralian government’s ban on YouTube accounts for under-16s, which kicks in on 10 December, willbe effective or enforceable. Will young Australian subscribers suddenly disappear from Grouse House’s tally? They’re not too worried. Enough of their audience is over 18, or comes from overseas – and they’re about to launch their own platform anyway.In the next few months, Grouse House will trial a subscription service (hard launching in early 2026), similar to the independent streaming platform Dropout TV, which arose out of CollegeHumor. Most of the content will still be available for free on YouTube, but they’re confident that a percentage of fans will be happy to pay, say, $6 a month for exclusives and a community.The top-line goal is to make Australia’s comedy identity as pronounced as it was when they themselves were growing up, glued to Full Frontal, Kath and Kim, Lano and Woodley, and Big Girl’s Blouse.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Our biggest exports outside comedy are things like Baz Luhrmann and Mad Max, King Gizzard, Amyl and the Sniffers – weird, tasteless [or] crazy. The rest of the world knows that about us, but we need to learn that ourselves.”In March this year, Lee Naimo joined Grouse House as head of creative, from Screen Australia, where he had been instrumental in funding Grouse House’s first series,Hug the Sun.“We want to build out shows that we could take on live tours or move into video games,” Naimo says. “We’re trying to get that brand recognition. Like when you see something that’s from Adult Swim, you know exactly what you’re going to get.”Grouse House does pay the talent it nurtures (“not enough to quit your day job,” Naimo warns), but the current focus is on small-budget “shiny-floor” productions: gameshows, improv and interview shows, rather than long-form scripted shows with big crews.Demi Lardner’s new game show with Grouse House, titled So You Wanna Win a P*nis Pump (SYWWAPP).One such shiny-floor show is Demi Lardner’s newly launched So You Wanna Win a P*nis Pump? (SYWWAPP), described as “what happens if you leave Taskmaster and Game Changer too close to the heater and they melt”. The first four-episode season was recorded over two days, with guests including US comedy stalwart Paul F Tompkins as well as locals Tom Cardy and Becky Lucas.They trust me completely and I trust them. They’re a lot more willing to take risksComedian Greg Larsen on Grouse HouseGrouse House provided financial and moral support, Lardner tells Guardian Australia, allowing her to take the show from her Twitch channel to a much larger audience. She’s frustrated that TV networks tend to stick to the same faces: “We’realsoworking very hard. We’ve been provably successful, and we have a following.”And in September, Grouse House will host six pilot episodes fromGreg Larsen– a project that can itself be read as commentary on the importance of pilots in Australia. They range from an interview show where he and guest comedian Michelle Brasier play video games and talk about trauma, to a show called Mark Bonanno Shows His Anus. Grouse House is putting “time, effort and money” into getting projects up, Larsen says. “They trust me completely, and I trust them. They’re a lot more willing to take risks.”Aunty Donna’s agility will probably keep them safe amid shifting landscapes. Kelly attributes their nimbleness to the fact that they never became household names. “Our secret recipe is that we were never actually that big,” he says. “We were big enough to sustain, but we never blew up. I was talking to someone who was very famous in comedy in their mid-20s, and he said every week he worries about being irrelevant. And we’ve genuinely never felt that. We’ve seen enough ebbs and flows to know that it comes and goes.”Aunty Donna’s Drem World Tourcontinues through Australia, NZ, the US and the UK until the end of the year.

Why it could be your superpowerSome people spend their lives feeling out of place in groups – but this tendency comes with unique opportunitiesRami KaminskiSun 24 Aug 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 24 Aug 2025 19.46 EDTShare‘Ican’t explain it. He is a sweetheart. A beautiful boy inside and out, and so brilliant.” This was how a session with N, a longtime patient of mine, began some years ago. Her son, A, was a young teenager, and in spite of coming from a warm, loving family with attentive parents, he had started having social  difficulties.He wasn’t being bullied or left out at school. He wasn’t depressed, moody or anxious. In fact, he was popular, well liked and constantly being invited to parties, to basketball games, and to hang out with groups of young people. The problem was, he turned all these invitations down, and N couldn’t understand why.Three weeks later, I sat with A in my office. I asked him to describe his experience of attending parties and other social events. “I just feel weird,” he said, “like I’m not part of it, which is odd as these are all my friends. I know they like me and are happy I’m there, but I still don’t feel connected. I only feel lonely or bored when I’m with many people, and not when I’m with one or two close friends or when I’m alone.” Then he added: “I don’t like to say those things because it makes me sound like an alien. Do you think there’s something wrong with me?”I did not. In my 40-plus years as a practising physician and psychiatrist, I have worked with world leaders, performing artists and professionals at the top of their fields. It often emerges that they have gone through life feeling just as A described.These are people who always prefer to have dinner with a friend one-on-one rather than attend a dinner party. When they have to attend large gatherings, they are the figure standing off to the side, deep in conversation with another person, rather than “working the room”. They would rather do work assignments individually than in a group, despise playing team sports, and find the shared traditions or rituals of communal life – office parties, graduation ceremonies, even religious holidays – difficult and even baffling. They are soloists who cannot play in an orchestra. And I count myself as one of them.At school, teachers are trained to take notice of students who seem ‘socially maladjusted’The vast majority of these people have no psychiatric diagnosis. They aren’t socially maladjusted or even socially anxious. After many years spent observing and researching these characteristics, I have come to understand that they are rooted in a trait present in people of every ethnicity, culture and gender: one distinguished by the lack of a communal impulse – in other words, non-belonging.As I started writing about what I discovered, I searched for a word to describe this deeply misunderstood personality type. Most people are familiar with Carl Jung’s concepts of extrovert (“one who faces outward”) and introvert (“one who faces inward”). But the fundamental orientation of a non-belonger is defined by the fact that it is rarely the same direction that everyone else is facing. That is how I came up with the term “otrovert” (in Spanish, “otro” means “other”).Many otroverts have gone through life assuming that their lack of interest in parties and other such social activities must mean they are an introvert. But otroverts differ from introverts in a number of key ways: whereas introverts tend to be quiet and reserved, otroverts, like my patient A, can be quite gregarious and outgoing. An introvert wouldn’t typically be the first person to speak up assertively at a work meeting. But otroverts have no trouble standing up and confidently stating their point of view. Unlike introverts, most of whom would be completely drained from hours spent in a quiet corner of a pub talking with their closest friend, otroverts tend togainenergy from these kinds of deep conversations. Otroverts enjoy solitary time just like introverts do, but not out of the need to detach or recharge; rather, to avoid the loneliness and disconnection they feel when surrounded by others.For parents, children like A are often a source of confusion and concern. Given that most have themselves been conditioned to view group membership as the foundation of a successful life, many such parents push their children to be more “social.” At school, where teachers are trained to take notice of students who seem “socially maladjusted”, a child who doesn’t join others in the playground will often trigger phone calls home, visits to school counsellors or even a therapist.Our culture puts a premium on joining. Evidence of this priority begins very early in life, when we are taught to share, play nicely with other children, and align our behaviour with the behaviour of those around us. When others form a line, we are directed to stand in it. When others are talking quietly, we are told to lower our voices. Throughout our lives, our social conditioning reinforces the one immutable cultural principle in our society: that group membership is a prerequisite for a rich and rewarding life. And while this is true for many people, it is not true for otroverts.We put so much stock in communality that a different stance is understood as pathology. Otroverts are perceived as weird and wrong for preferring solitude over socialising, and subjected to peer pressure from well-meaning people who genuinely desire their companionship or who would hate for them to “miss out” on all the fun. What these people fail to realise is that for otroverts, there is great freedom and fulfilment in sitting on the sidelines.With this realisation, we can give ourselves permission to opt out of things that cause discomfort, to embrace our authentic selvesIn recent years, there has been much hand-wringing about the record levels of loneliness, alienation, and polarisation that plague our society. Writers, thinkers, policymakers, and even the US surgeon general have cited the decline of communal life as a principal cause of poor mental health and proposed solutions ranging from getting off social media to expanding our social support networks. In theory, these ideas are not without merit. But in practice, we are having more and more conversations about the importance of community, while continuing to become lonelier and more divided than ever.Otroverts are well equipped not only to thrive in our fractured, angry world, but also to show others the way. The reason is simple: they see people, including themselves, as individuals, not just faceless members of a tribe. It is easy to hate a formless group that you are taught to perceive as different, inferior, or threatening. But it is much harder to generalise your hostility when you view people for who they actually are.Because they don’t feel an obligation to endorse the collective position, opinion, or point of view, otroverts are fiercely independent, outside-the-box thinkers who approach problems from new angles, often leading to creative discoveries and unique contributions. And because they define success by what they achieve, not what they achieve in relation to others, they are more fulfilled creatively and professionally too.The big idea: should we embrace boredom?Read moreFor an otrovert, accepting what we think of as the cliched statement “It’s OK to be you” is a monumental shift. So many of us otroverts have lived our whole lives with the experience of being misunderstood. When we finally understand that there is nothing wrong with who we are, it is cathartic in a truly profound way.With this realisation, we can give ourselves permission to opt out of things that cause discomfort, forge even deeper and more loving relationships with those we feel close to, and embrace our authentic selves. We discover that, as Friedrich Nietzsche, the quintessential otrovert, once wrote; “No one can construct for you the bridge upon which precisely you must cross the stream of life, no one but you yourself alone.”Today, A has truly blossomed. Now 24, he is getting a PhD in psychology, recently got engaged to his college girlfriend, and remains close with his best childhood friends. In some ways, he’ll always remain an observer of the group and never a true participant. But he is a full participant in his own life: deeply satisfied in the things he chooses to do and the people he chooses to be with. In a world designed for joiners, this is the otrovert’s ideal path.Dr Rami Kaminski is a psychiatrist and author ofThe Gift of Not Belonging(Scribe).Further readingSocial: Why Our Brains Are Wired to Connect by Matthew Lieberman (Oxford, £15.49)The Good Life: Lessons from the World’s Longest Study on Happiness by Robert Waldinger and Marc Schulz (Rider, £12.99)Insight: How to Succeed by Seeing Yourself Clearly by Tasha Eurich (Pan, £12.99)Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingThe big ideaPhilosophy booksSociety booksPsychologyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This is how they can survive – with their souls intactJacob Hale Russell & Dennis PattersonSun 24 Aug 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 24 Aug 2025 10.07 EDTShareView image in fullscreenIt is no secret that American universities are in the fight of a lifetime. With billions of dollars in federal support on the line, their ability to fund their research activities is clearly at stake. But for the biggest targets, such as Harvard, their pockets are unfathomably deep. While cuts may be painful, no financial threat is likely to be existential. What is harder to know is whether universities can come out of their current predicament with their souls intact.The groundwork for this situation has been in the making for more than a decade. While the destruction is a bipartisan phenomenon, early warning signs appeared in “cancel culture”, the left’s version of campus censoriousness. More recently, the right’s version has been even more brazen, as seen in boorish attempts by the Trump administration and some state governors to control what is taught in university classrooms.The response from universities is similarly dispiriting. Universities have not articulated what they are fighting for, and are not even particularly clear how much they are willing to fight against. Feckless administrators, along with faculty who have lost their intellectual curiosity, have left the university a punching bag for competing factions: angry students, entitled donors and opportunistic politicians. Large settlement payments by Ivy League colleges may be an expedient way to restore federal funding, but hardly demonstrate much backbone or conviction about academic integrity. Worse, monitoring agreements, such as the oneColumbia has agreed to, raise troubling questions about the extent to which schools are willing to compromise academic freedom in exchange for turning the money spouts back on.When universities are heard the loudest in response to controversies swirling around them, it is through the blandest of AI-generated, crisis-communication-consultant-approved, focus group-workshopped statements. These statements please nobody. Even worse, they are antithetical to what a university does, which is to provide open spaces to test and to contest deep, complex, unresolved disagreements. In an era of quick takes and easy outrage, this is a void both harder and more important to fill than ever.Universities need to reclaim their core value – academic freedom – and to adopt a stance of institutional neutrality in order to regain public trust and credibilityMeanwhile, Americans report plummeting levels of trust in the ivory tower. The political scientist Greg Conti has termed the result the rise of the “sectarian university”. Universities will not die: Harvard, with its nearly $50bn endowment, is not meaningfully imperiled by criticism from Congress, the public or even Trump. But the perception of these institutions as out of touch means “their authority will grow more brittle and their appeal more sectarian.” Sectarian universities will be like molecular gastronomy, isolated to rarified elite circles. The result is the loss of one of America’s great inventions: the research university, dedicated to the production of knowledge that can be used by all.What is to be done? Universities need to reclaim their core value – academic freedom – and to adopt a stance of institutional neutrality in order to regain public trust and credibility. This does not mean cracking down on speech or protest. On the contrary, individual faculty or students should be able to be as active as they want to be. But the university itself – the administration tasked with creating a scholarly and educational oasis – must concern itself exclusively with providing an environment where research and learning can flourish.Universities are now swinging back and forth in their suppression of speech, all in response to pressure from the government. In an example of an unimaginable overcorrection, since 2020 more than 1,000 US studentshave been punishedfor pro-Palestinian speech. Safetyism, once the province of the left that rejected certain forms of speech as violence, has now been co-opted by the right, fueling crackdowns on pro-Palestinian activism and a growing range of expression. To be clear, speech that veers toward intimidation has no place in the university. But this requires administrators to take a coherent position on where to draw such lines, and then vigorously defend free speech in instances where harassment and intimidation are not at play.If there is any hope of returning universities to their traditional role of spaces where political speech is protected, neutrality must reign – not opportunistic and selective defense of some speech over others.As longtime defenders of free speech used to recognize, if you do not protect all speech – not just speech you happen to agree with – it is only a matter of time before you risk a challenge to your own freedom to speak out.At its heart, a university is a gamble on what happens when an institution shows an uncompromising commitment to free speech. Academic freedom is not just another rule in a policy manual. It is perhapstheconstitutive feature of the modern American university, which is envied the world over. Yet few universities have come to a full-throated defense of that value. Few administrators seem to publicly espouse it; faculty openly question it; and the public hardly has reason to believe in it if universities themselves do not. For the university to save its soul, attitudes will have to change.View image in fullscreenWhither academic freedom?Consider two key trends of recent years. First, Americans’ trust in universities hasplummeted– from 57% in 2015 to 36% in 2023. Second, Americans, especially those on college campuses, feel less free to speak their minds than ever before. According to a poll conducted in 2022, whose findings are consistent with other surveys, only a third of Americans believed we all enjoyed complete freedom of speech in the United States, and some 84% said there was a “serious” problem of people being afraid to speak out in their everyday lives. In polling, students and faculty consistently say that they self-censor frequently. So much for healthy debate of the issues, a hallmark of what university life used to be.How are these two trends linked? The university has become suspect because it seems partisan. Many critics argue that research coming out of many universities is not the result of a marketplace of ideas, but rather a sales product corrupted by political bias. Whether or not that accusation is fair, it is the result of a collapse of the core institutional design feature of a university; academic freedom.Academic freedom’s modern history can be traced to the beginning of the 20th century, the result of a fraught debate at Stanford over the populist writings of Edward Ross, an economics professor. The university’s benefactor, Jane Stanford, urged the professor be fired, presumably because his support of free silver was achallengeto the wealth and power held by her and other monopolists. A handful of professors resigned in the wake of the controversy. Not long after, several of the dissidents founded the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), which remains to this day a lead defender – albeitwith a mixed record in recent years– of faculty autonomy and free speech on campus.As schools take on more positions on social and political issues, faculty and students feel less free to express themselvesThe AAUP’s1915 declaration of principleson academic freedom and tenure acknowledged that most 20th-century universities defended researchers’ freedom of inquiry, but that a number of incidents had undermined professors’ freedom to express political opinions freely. That ability, the AAUP reasoned, was essential because faculty must “not be in a position of dependence upon the favor of any social class”. That independence was essential, the thinking went, to protect the credibility of their research.Today’s campus climate hardly lives up to that ideal. In some cases, academic freedom and tenure protections have been directly assaulted. Part of it is more subtle: as schools take on more positions on social and political issues, faculty and students feel less free to express themselves.The direct assaults come from both within and without. Universities themselves have undermined tenure, and treated non-tenured faculty with complete disregard for academic freedom. In Minnesota, an art history professor wasdismissed from Hamline Universityafter showing a painting of the prophet Muhammad in class. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the Stanford faculty senatecensureda Hoover senior fellow for his opinions shared while advising Trump. More recently, the fraught debates over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have seen Muhlenberg College, University of Illinois, Columbia Law School, and Hobart and William Smith Collegespush out faculty– including several tenured professors – for expressing pro-Palestinian views.Such “sanction attempts” were rare in 2000 (four), but are now commonplace: 145 in 2022, according to academic freedom watchdog Fire. Most such attempts resulted in actual sanction – including 225 terminations, 60 of which involved tenure.The attacks from outside have intensified, too. Alongside Trump’s existential attacks, which seek to condition billions of dollars in university funding on schools restricting pro-Palestinian speech, legislation such as Florida’s Stop Woke Act directly seeks to control what can and cannot be discussed in Florida classrooms. At least 10 states have moved forward with legislation thatwould weaken or eliminate tenurein state schools.But we believe that a more insidious form of suppression of academic freedom comes from the self-silencing of professors across America. Although hard to measure, asurvey last yearfound that nearly all – 91% – of faculty agree that academic freedom is under threat in higher education, with respondents expressing particular hesitance to discuss the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and issues relating to diversity, equity and inclusion.Institutional attitudes play a key role here. First, there is the adoption of official policies, such as the use of DEI statements in faculty hiring. Although this policy has ebbed in recent years – especially since the Trump administration’s assault on diversity, equity and inclusion programs – many universities in recent years began to subject all applicants to a faculty position to review by a separate “DEI committee”. Anyone who did not pass muster with the committee was not forwarded to the department for consideration. Conformity to a political agenda was more important than the quality of one’s research and teaching.Second, many faculty share the perception that universities no longer have their back. A few years ago, some students at our universitybegan organizing againsta faculty member who had allegedly not policed the use of a racial epithet, used in the context of a direct quote from a published judicial decision, by a student during office hours. The incident raised many important questions about free speech in the classroom. These conversations were worthwhile. What was surprising and alarming, however, was how unwilling law school administrators were to defend the faculty member. Indeed, the administration mainly undermined the faculty member, and one senior administrator remarked that it was not the job of the administration to look after the needs of the faculty. This disdain was a telling indicator of the current culture, one that was confirmed when university presidents testifying on antisemitism before Congress seemed alltoo willingto throw their faculty under the bus.View image in fullscreenThe university should be more than a real estate operationThe key principle that can save universities is “institutional neutrality”. This idea is often attributed to a1967 document called the Kalven report, written by a committee at the University of Chicago charged with reviewing the school’s role in social and political issues. The university itself, the report announced, must be neutral on those matters. Individualswithinthe university were free to be loud critics of society. In fact, their criticism was essential, and only made possible because of the university’s unique commitment to an institutional design of utter neutrality and openness. There was no room, the report emphasized, for the university as an entity to engage in “collective action”. That would undermine the space the university needed to make for all voices of dissent.Though the principle emerged during the fraught decade of the 1960s, it is equally appropriate for today. The essential gambit of a university is that almost everything is worth the cost of preserving room for difference. In rare instances, that space may be where a Galileo is born; more commonly, it may help the majority to refine its arguments by working through counter arguments; and in all cases, it creates the kind of atmosphere that is conducive to novel and thorough thought.Part of why universities may have a hard time advocating for themselves is that their core purpose is somewhat unique. Unlike businesses that can maximize efficiency, or activist groups that have a particular cause, a university’s core value is structural, not substantive. A university, at its best, is just a place carefully set up to allow other things to happen within. Beyond that, it does not have a role, a goal, a purpose, an identity, an agenda. It is not “for” anything – except academic inquiry and excellence – or “against” anything.Neutrality may play a role elsewhere, but it is not the essence. In the for-profit sphere, recent years have seen extensive debate about whether businesses should take political stances. These parallel debates may be important. But they are not existential. They are over whether political activism is bad for business, because it alienates customers, or makes a particular company a better or less good place to work, or over how much impact businesses can have on social policy. But the debates are ultimately ancillary. We do not wonder if Nike is meaningfully still Nike if it talks more or less about social justice. Nike is, in the end, a clothing manufacturer. The university is different. A university that cannot create the kind of space where ideas can thrive is just an expensive real estate deal with a tax break.When the presidents of Penn, Harvard and MIT were famously questioned by a House panel on antisemitism on campus, part of what made their appearance so unfortunate was that they seemed to stand for nothing in particular. They did not, as the Chicago principles (a more modern followup to the Kalven report), articulate the idea that a university could not censor even the most “offensive, unwise, immoral, or wrong-headed” views. But what they did – neither giving innorstanding up for anything in particular, and showing little intellectual sophistication – made it impossible for anyone to like.When Stanford students noisily protested a conservative judge who spoke on campus a few years ago, the dean of the law school showed what a commitment to neutrality entailed. She did not comment on the substance of the students’ protest or the speaker’s talk, but focused only on the disruption to campus free speech.Howshe did so is just as telling. In a10-page, citation laden memorandumthat cited key caselaw, she educated students about the history and nature of free speech. Her response was written as an academic to other academically inclined members of her community, rather than a focus-grouped PR message.Universities are not great at being activists. When they try, they infuriate their opponents and do little to please the constituencies they are trying to placateNeutrality can be hard to advocate for. In 2011, a Harvard dean had the idea to ask freshmen to sign a “kindness” pledge – the first required pledge of any kind in the college’s history. Thankfully, a former dean ledvigorous oppositionto kill the measure, arguing in an essay that “the right to be annoying is precious, as is the right to think unkind thoughts”. As he pointed out, he was entirely in favor of kindness. The problem he was pointing to was that a pledge – no matter how innocuous sounding – could undermine the very nature of a university. (Did kindness mean a student should not point out an intellectual error in someone else’s reasoning? Was having an unkind thought a violation of the code?) Meaningful neutrality means administrators should not impose even the most innocuous-sounding pledge on students. This is why we see it as a constitutive value – one that is especially hard to grasp on the outside, and that therefore requires vigorous defenders from within.The university is a gamble on the importance of this kind of space. The gamble is backed up by some pretty radical institutional design features – tenure, for example. The idea of tenure is that great ideas need a special climate and are worth the cost. For every 100 clunkers of a paper, or academics who check out and just use it as job security, someone writes a paper or makes a discovery that makes up for those losses. We like to think the gamble is a good one. Certainly tech and creative companies have thought so at times; some of what they did to encourage employee freedom – although they have pulled back on it – was a gamble on certain types of atmosphere, while expensive to maintain, and produced worthwhile results. Whether or not the gamble is a good one, it is really the only premise behind a university.Universities are not great at being activists, as the last decade has shown. When they try, they infuriate their opponents and do little to please the constituencies they are trying to placate. Institutional neutrality is a return to their core strength.View image in fullscreenRestoring healthy debateTrump’s attack on research funds is an attempt to dictate what is taught and by whom it is taught. Some think Harvard had it coming. Whatever fault universities bear in their current predicament, it does not make Trump’s solutions right. While many think (as we do) that diversity in thought is the soul of a university, having the government dictate education policy takes a page out of Mao’s Little Red Book. This has to be thoroughly rejected.But the problem is that universities gave credibility to conservative complaints about free speech. This has left them an easy target for their traditional defenders: donors and alumni. Meanwhile, schools that start adopting institutional neutrality now –almost 150, according to one count, have adopted it since 7 October 2023– run the risk of looking compromised, like they adopted it as a convenient response to an inconvenient moment, or to suppress particular types of speech they do not like, rather than out of a deep commitment to a core feature of institutional design.Unfortunately, in a campus where groupthink is common, it is not just controversial ideas that will suffer – it is creativity. Faculty bear their share of responsibility for this.At elite institutions, liberal ideological dominance is more pronounced than at community colleges and professional schools. More than 80% of faculty at Harvard identify as liberal, including almost 40% as “very liberal”, whereas less than 1.5% choose the moniker conservative. And only 9% of incoming students at Harvard describe themselves as conservative. The issue is not just that the faculty has sorted that way but also that many on the faculty want it sorted that way. Forty percent would bar anyone who worked in the Trump administration from holding a faculty appointment. A third oppose hiring conservative professors to increase ideological diversity, suggesting a low regard for pluralism in faculty research.Too many of us approach diverging viewpoints with the attitude of a child being forced to try broccoliAcademic departments have the right to hire whomever they choose – that’s academic freedom – but such lopsided ideological commitments risk both rendering the university irrelevant and depriving universities of the spirited debate needed for intellectual growth. A few years ago, a group of faculty on our campuses at Rutgers University started a reading group, engaging with texts that had become canonical or had a widespread influence on law, legal thought and public policy. Texts came from a wide range of fields, including history, philosophy and political science. The group was remarkably successful, but when it was suggested we read the philosopher Robert Nozick’s Anarchy, State, and Utopia, a classic defense of libertarianism, several colleagues said they disagreed with Nozick’s policies and had no interest in engaging with the book. Had they read it? No, but they knew what it said. We have received similar pushback about inviting faculty with conservative perspectives, such as originalist constitutional thinkers, to our faculty workshops. Again, the excuse from several colleagues tends to be that they already know what they thought and know they disagree, so why bother? Such responses are perplexing to us because neither of us is an originalist – which is precisely why we would want to hear from one.This “pushback” does not resemble censorship or anything like it. Nobody threatened us or denied our right to invite such speakers, nor would they have – our colleagues are not like that. They were perfectly content to let us read Nozick. Rather, it was the utter indifference to competing viewpoints that surprised us. To be fair to our colleagues, many did show up when we had an originalist speaker come and engaged in substantive and thoughtful questioning. But too many of us approach diverging viewpoints with the attitude of a child being forced to try broccoli.We believe there is more thirst for debate than it may appear. When we published some early articles during the pandemic that questioned school closures – a view that is of course now widespread, but was controversial at the time – we received emails from colleagues at other schools expressing surprise and gratitude that we were “brave” enough to do so. Given our own tenure protections, we were surprised anyone would think this was “brave”. Yet the reaction was telling about the climate that academics live in today. Interestingly, we got very little direct pushback from other academics, which speaks to a different form of avoidance in today’s academic culture. The pushback we heard about was nearly always behind our backs, in the form of criticism delivered to others, such as editors and deans.Save the university’s soulHow did we get here? Part of the blame, perhaps more than a little, lies with the elite class, one inhabited by university professors. In our recent book, The Weaponization of Expertise, we identify three dimensions of a flawed elite mindset that are as pervasive as they are corrosive. The first is condescension: because of a misguided faith in meritocracy, elites see their country plagued by the scourge of ignorance and the failure of common folk to trust their intellectual betters. Second is technocratic paternalism, a mindset that presumes our most important fights are over facts. Elites wrongly believe that if we can agree on the facts, agreement on policy will follow. The third mindset is intellectual tyranny. Elites see doubt and dissent as the result of faulty processes, if not outright corruption. This view paves the way for an intellectual culture that brooks no dissent and assumes one’s non-intellectual or non-elite opponents engage in bad faith. Each of these three views is interrelated, stemming from the same valorization of credentials and merit – and each is equally corrosive.The key to understanding Trump? It’s not what you thinkRead moreMaintaining institutional neutrality does not discourage faculty or students from making moral judgments. Rather, neutrality and free speech yield communities that will produce useful knowledge and train informed citizens. The alternative yields too many people unequipped and afraid to grapple with complex and dissenting ideas, making the university look like a political actor with little authority.The alternative is, as happened at our university, a president who issued three insipid statements on the conflict in Israel within two weeks. These platitude-laden pronouncements bore little resemblance to the traditional fare of a university, which is slow, steady and research-intensive. These aspired to public relations rather than thoughtful scholarship. Of course, they did not work. As should have been no surprise, none of the statements satisfied anyone on any side. Instead, with each new statement, more demands arose for the president to issue yet more statements.By contrast, we think the old-fashioned conception of universities as neutral and open spaces for free inquiry understands the institutional strengths and limitations of a university. Universities are not very good at politics. Theyaregood at allowing competing ideas, including terrible ones, to be thoroughly hashed out. They are good at equipping students with the skills to question and debate difficult ideas by providing an environment that encourages questions and debate. That is the soul of the university, and the only one worth fighting for.Jacob Hale Russell is professor of law at Rutgers University.

Welcome to England 2025John HarrisThe rapid spread of these banners is unsettling – and shows how the hard right is reaching people and places the left cannotSun 24 Aug 2025 07.17 EDTLast modified on Sun 24 Aug 2025 14.30 EDTShareIt was a sun-soaked weekday in the West Country, and all I could think about was the flags. Around the sedate Wiltshire town of Devizes, they fluttered from trees and upstairs windows, with crude versions sprayed across roundabouts. In my adopted home town in Somerset, meanwhile, local desperadoes had vandalised a pedestrian crossing close to a school, which had sparked an online row, partly because they had jettisoned their paint cans down a nearby alley. “Apart from the paint being dumped, I applaud them,” said one Facebook post. There was talk of more St George’s crosses appearing at the car park near the GP surgery – and, in among scenes I usually associate with calm and quiet, a sudden and unsettling sense of mischief and menace.Such is the impact ofOperation Raise the Colours, a campaign which seems to have begun in the suburbs of Birmingham. Its origins apparently lie in a few flags being cleared from lamp-posts as the city council tried to install LED lighting. In the hands of online provocateurs, that was enough to confirm stories about woke local bureaucrats denying people their national identity. That narrative has quickly ballooned, with sometimes grimly comical consequences: the dependably restrained Reform UK MPLee Anderson saysthat any elected official who supports removing British or English flags “should be removed from office for betraying the very country they serve”, while hisparty’s council leaderin Northamptonshire insists that for health and safety reasons, “we may need to take them down in the best interests of our residents”.That very small subplot is probably the only halfway amusing part of the story: everything else is deadly serious. Despite claims that it is all about patriotism rather than prejudice, what has materialised up and down the country feels like an unauthorised version of what the Home Office used to call the hostile environment, as if football hooligans have taken control of road markings and street furniture. And the relevant mood music is not exactly subtle. On the campaign’sFacebook page, there are enthusiastic looks ahead to September’s “free speech” rally fronted by the far-right figurehead Tommy Robinson, notices about looming protests outside hotels used to house asylum seekers and terse allusions to the usual conspiracy theories (“our masters have sold us to Islam … the replacement has begun”).The anti-racist group Hope Not Hatepoints to known far-right activistswho are involved. Picking through it all, one thought repeatedly hits home – that whatever this self-styled operation’s apparently haphazard beginnings, it marks yet another instalment of a story that could not be more serious: the long march of a politics full of audacity and ambition, which is now reaching people and places that the left gets nowhere near.The result is a self-evident political emergency. For proof, look at Reform UK’s stubborn lead in the opinion polls, and the very real prospect of Nigel Farage becoming prime minister. Consider also the post-Brexit transformation of English Conservatism, and the fact that many Tories’ hopes now lie with Robert Jenrick, the aspiring leader whoserecent visit to a protest in Eppingput him in close proximity to an infamous far-right activist, and who hasloudly endorsedOperation Raise the Colours (Kemi Badenochsoon followed suit, in yet another example of who is really in charge of her party). But also bear in mind something much more frightening: the fact that what is afoot goes far deeper than the manoeuvrings of politicians and parties. It goes into the cultural spaces where people live their lives.Some of this is all about the grim synergy between the right’s use of disinformation and provocation, and how politics has changed in ways that most of its practitioners seem to barely understand. In the past, orthodox television and what we now call the legacy media ensured that people who supported the merchants of hard-right ideas were exposed to arguments against them. But the 21st century does not work like that: radicalisation happens in sealed-off onlinespaces that operate according to their own deranged logic, opening a path from unthinking first steps to full-blown conversion. One minuteyou might be spraying the road just for the likes; the next, you could be disappearing into a mob surrounding a mosque. From the outside, that is a very difficult cycle to break.But that is not to say that no one should try. At the moment, the new right’s bark is probably worse than its bite: once again, compared with all the talk of mass uprisings and social breakdown, this weekend’s hotel protests were a thoroughlydamp squib. But one of the most depressing aspects of this summer has been the sense of progressive forces so dumbfounded and confused by what is happening that they seem almost completely unable to respond, and a feeling that many people in positions of power now accept that ridiculous proposition that England is now the country Farage et al say it is. The Labour party, needless to say, either meekly echoes Farage’s talking points or makes the laughable claim that people shouldn’t support him or his party because of hisviews on the NHS. Even the trade unions, whose workplace reps and conveners presumably understand people’s support for the new right as a matter of everyday experience, are bafflingly quiet.Asylum seekers are being targeted – and so are those who help them. It’s a disturbing new reality | Enver SolomonRead moreAnd what of any fight on the terrain of popular culture? Older readers will recall a rightward cultural shift and the brief surge of the National Front in the late 1970s, which was met by the inspirational work ofRock Against Racismand the Anti-Nazi League, choking off the far right’s appeal to the young. I can well remember the anxiety and alarm triggered by the surge in popularity of the fascist British National party, which happened twice: 15 or so years ago, when it was undone bydogged Labour campaigningand its own ineptitude, and circa 1994, when the election of a single BNP councillor in east London sparked ahuge anti-racism concert, acres of coverage in the music press and the revival of Rock Against Racism’s old spirit.I know: that was a very long time ago, and comparing then with now risks ignoring how much popular culture has since been diluted and weakened. But there are still musicians with huge platforms and devoted fans, and organisations – such asLove Music Hate Racism– ready to play their part. The prominence of Palestine flags at this year’s festivals proves that music’s radical edges have not been completely blunted; even the most apolitical artists surely understand that what they do is a product of exactly the kind of cultural mixing and open attitudes that the new right wants to squash.Something else keeps nagging at me. Up until a few years ago, we heard a lot of talk aboutprogressive patriotism, a new vision of England that was truer to 21st-century reality, and the final wresting away of symbols of nationhood from people with the most malign and nasty ideas. It was right that we did: the fact that these conversations never really went anywhere might be one of the reasons we are in such a mess. The noise the new flag-wavers make is getting louder; there are increasingly brazen links between thugs and supposedly mainstream politicians that need to be called out.

Hearing loss runs in my family. My mother was profoundly deaf, and so were my grandfather and great uncles. And yet when we were told our daughter had a moderate to severe hearing loss and would have to wearhearing aidsfor the rest of her life, I felt as if I had been hit by a bus. I was dead.It was 1996, and we were sitting in a spartan doctor’s office in downtown New York. It wasn’t a warm and cozy environment like our paediatrician’s – there were no pictures of dinosaurs on the walls or puzzles strewn about. No low, cushioned seats for the kids to sit on. The consulting room was dark, with one blinking fluorescent light, a metal desk and a couple of wooden chairs. The centre was a not-for-profit that cared for those withhearing loss and deafness. What they lacked in decor they more than made up for in their mission.We were here because there was something about Zoe, our two-year-old daughter, that gave me pause. At home she was the life of the party but whenever we left the house she became painfully shy. This is not exactly a textbook symptom of hearing loss, but given my family history I knew it could be.My husband and I were both seated at the desk, and Zoe was sitting on my lap. In this lifeless room she was a burst of colour. Dressed in her signature style of head-to-toe pink, she was wearing one of the three dresses she cycled through every week, accessorised by an oversized bedazzled bow that sparkled every time she twirled (which was constantly). She was adorable.As I watched the audiologist fit her with the kind of behind-the-ear aids my grandfather wore, I cried. She was so little and these beige medical devices were enormous. I am ashamed to admit it, but all I could think at that moment was: “Who will ever take Zoe to the prom with these big clunky things sticking out of her ears?”The audiologist saw my face and said a profound thing to me that has stayed with me through the years: “The hearing aids get smaller as the child gets bigger.”Back then I had no idea what she was talking about – or what a salve this advice would come to be. My head was spinning as I imagined all the kids pointing to Zoe’s ears and wondering what those ugly things were– they were like a billboard for Zoe’s disability. I worried she would become self-conscious and ultimately embarrassed about who she was. As if I had a crystal ball, I envisioned her as an insecure adult unable to form meaningful relationships.The doctor held the hearing aids up to her own ears and said: “See? Not so big.” And I had to admit she had a point. Then she gave me a mirror and suggested I hold them up to my own ears, and I was even more convinced that she was right.I stopped fidgeting and tapping my foot.But she wasn’t done.She opened her desk drawer and pulled out several pairs of hearing aids. She lined them up, the oldest model to the latest, and explained: “This is how far the technology has come in just four years.” I was shocked at how much smaller the most recently designed aids were. But it wasn’t only size that differentiated them: the newest ones looked, well, cool. Like something Apple would have designed.“I have no doubt the technology will keep evolving,” she reassured me.How I support families coming to terms with being told their child is deafRead moreThe doctor’s words rang true both literally and metaphorically. Zoe would grow up and those clunky things behind her ears would become almost unnoticeable. But even more, the big bad thing I thought would define my daughter would also fade into the background. Zoe would always be hard of hearing, but as I came to terms with her hearing loss, it became clear that would only be one data point in her life. She would also be hilarious, mathematical and steadfast in her belief thatLove Actuallyis the best movie ever made.Over the years, that conversation with the audiologist became a reminder that we had done right by our daughter. Fitting her at age two with big clunky hearing aids might have felt like a loss at the time, but early intervention meant Zoe did not become speech delayed and miss out on crucial developmental and socialisation milestones.Sixteen years after I sat in that office chair wondering if anyone would ever take my daughter to the prom, Zoe was stepping into a long pink gown and fluorescent pink heels on her way to the dance. The truth is it was never about the prom but about wanting Zoe to fit in. Her doctor’s words spoke to the moment, but they reverberated for years to come. Whenever I catch myself jumping to conclusions or pretending to know how others will react, I stop and remember what a wise, kind audiologist once said: “The hearing aids get smaller as the child gets bigger.” Nothing is static and everything is in a constant state of change.

Admittedly, as someone with no discernible people skills, I would always hate it, but I’ve been imagining the awkward HR meetings behind the scenes of the recent wave of “what is acceptable workplace behaviour” rulings from UK employment tribunals recently, and … oof!I’m thinking, particularly, of last week’s ruling on whetheryounger chatty workers disturbing an older colleagueconstitutes age discrimination (it didn’t), but there are many more.Comparing a colleague to Darth Vaderin an online personality test resulted in a £30,000 compensation award.Leaving someone out of the tea roundcould contribute to unfair constructive dismissal.Sighing at a colleaguecould be discriminatory.An air kisswasn’t harassment and neither was telling a manager hiswork was messy. Allocating a senior employee a “low-status desk” can be seen as a demotion.Of course, any acrimonious departure is about more than one thing. These are mostly cherrypicked contributory factors; easy headlines about situations that surely involved a complex brew of circumstances and personalities. But it does look like more cases considering how we should behave at work in quite granular ways are reaching tribunals. So, what’s going on?For a start, is workplace behaviour getting worse? That old “Covid meant we forgot our manners” cliche is certainly applied to workplaces – the idea being that too much time in slippers and sweats made us ruder and more self-centred, and we are now bringing rather too much of our unpalatable “whole selves” to work. But as a veteran of a variety of office environments, 1997-2010, I doubt this is the explanation. From flying office equipment to heavy lunchtime drinking and a litany of extremely off-colour personal comments, I witnessed some truly lawless behaviour (including from lawyers). People have never needed the excuse of a global pandemic to hang their sweaty shorts on the office door knob or make each other cry – there’s a reason I was congratulated by LinkedIn recently on my many years of self-employment. (OK, the reason is I was made redundant after writing about my colleagues on my blog – I didn’t say I was immune to behaving badly – but the stuff I saw certainly made me less keen to find another office-based job.)Actually, I suspect shifting mores (plus decades of anti-discrimination legislation) mean behaviour in most British workplaces is far better than it used to be. So, are we getting less tolerant of co-workers and the minor irritations sharing a workplace inevitably involve? These rulings are often framed as either “Gen Z are oversensitive snowflakes” or “today’s workers are lazy, cynical outrage-mongers looking for a payout”. On the former, there probably is a degree of generational friction – we have a highly intergenerational workforce (51% of businesses employ three or more generations) and surveys suggest that has meantmore age-based conflicts around communication style and working methods(it’s also something you often hear anecdotally). But most of these cases don’t even involve gen Z workers. The second complaint feels like a riff on the age-old, always fallacious “nobody wants to work” discourse, rehashed back through the 19th century and beyond (surely one day we’ll discover a Mesopotamian tablet on which someone has chiselled this exact complaint).People do want (and need) to work – just differently. Covid didn’t make us feral slobs, but it was an inflection point, showing that work need not be business as usual. Employees regularly express a desire formore work-life balanceand flexibility, but instead, many employers arehustling them back on site, and an expanding culture of workplace surveillance (HSBC is the latest employer to go down this unpopular route according to aReuters’ recent report) further erodes trust and goodwill. Meanwhile, jobs that were traditionally vocations – teaching, healing, caring – are made harder and less rewarding every year by hollowed-out budgets. When you are not particularly happy at work – onlyone in three workers report they’re thriving and employee wellbeing is decliningaccording to recent Gallup research – small grievances and annoyances become harder to overlook: the microwave smells worse; being left off the team bowling invitation rankles more; the no-headphones calls in the open plan office seem louder and longer.

Barely a day passes without the chancellor,Rachel Reeves, waking to another newspaper headline about possible tax-raising options for her autumn budget.After the bonanza of June’s spending review, Reeveshad been warnedthat uncertainty about the public finances would set tongues wagging. Britain’s economy has far from shot the lights out since, the global backdrop remains fairly bleak, borrowing costs are high, and inflationary pressures are building.This week marks the point at which November becomes the earliest date the chancellor can hold her budget, given the 10 weeks’ notice she must provide theOffice for Budget Responsibility(OBR) to prepare its forecasts.Between now and then will feel like a near carbon copy of Labour’s first months in office, packed with rumours about a tax-laden autumn budget, only worse: this time the feelgoodspending decisionshave already been announced.Within the Treasury officials are running the rule over several options. However, forecasters are unclear about just how much needs to be done; causing a headache forLabourby sending the rumour mill into overdrive.On the most extreme estimates, Reeves is facing ashortfall of as much as £50bnto maintain the same headroom against her self-imposed fiscal rules as she had left herself in the spring. Others say the sum could be as little as £17bn.Any talk of such a “black hole” is still obviously bad news. After Reevesblasted Jeremy Hunt for leaving Labour a £22bn shortfallahead of the last autumn budget, deflecting blame will be tougher a second time around.Still, the uncertainty ought to be illustrative.Forecasting the British economy at the moment is a fool’s errand. On the one hand,inflationary pressuresare building andunemploymentis rising. Growth remains weak and Donald Trump’s trade war looms in the background. On the other hand, wage settlements are still robust, and business activity, consumer sentiment and public borrowing levels appearstronger than anticipated.Mired in the fog, the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee required anunprecedented two rounds of votingthis month to overcome a split decision on interest rates. A slim majority on the nine-strong panel felt that a weak economic outlook required a cut in borrowing costs, while others – including the MPC’s deputy governor, Clare Lombardelli, and the Bank’s chief economist, Huw Pill – felt that growth was resilient enough, and feared inflationary pressures.Woeful data quality from theOffice for National Statistics– where several key economic indicators are bogged down with issues – is making matters worse, with the Newport-based agency openly described by experienced economists as “a shower” and “in chaos”.Ahead of the autumn budget, the OBR is working to update its assessment of the economy’s productive capacity. Most economists predict a hefty downgrade, whichcould add £20bn to Reeves’s budget shortfall. But two key datasets for the measurement of output per hour of work, GDP and the labour force survey, are prone to revision or are being fixed because of quality issues.Taking all of this together, analysts at the Japanese bank Mizuho last week warned global investors looking at Britain: “It’s hard to know if we’re looking at a truthful message. Forget summer holidays, it’s survival camp and the compass is broken.”But while extracting the signal from the noise – as economists describe the job of translating messy data – is a thankless task, somebody has to do it. And the danger is that missteps will be made as policymakers rush to turn around years of underperformance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But because she left slim headroom against her fiscal rules at the spring statement, even small negative developments have the capacity to blow things off course. While Labour hassignalled that it will roll the pitchto manage budget expectations, so far it hasleft tax speculation to fester. That approach is one that cannot last.Economists have warned Reeves repeatedly against fine-tuning her fiscal plans against highly changeable forecasts. Like most forecasters, the OBR often gets things wrong, and always updates its view. Given the higher degree of uncertainty than normal, an even more cautious approach is warranted this time.As Prof Jagjit Chadha, the Cambridge University economist and former director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, told me: “Should you be driving a car with mechanical problems as fast as you’re trying to drive it? The answer is no.”As she prepares for a high-stakes budget, Reeves could look to the Bank, her former employer, for guidance. Threadneedle Street has taken its fair share of flak over recent years for its communication. But, unusually, its message is currently spot-on. Andrew Bailey, the governor, has spoken of the need for a “gradual and careful” approach to cutting interest rates given the uncertain outlook and conflicting messages from official data sources.For Reeves, the trouble is that Britain has been through years of chaos and uncertainty, having been jolted through external shocks and self-inflicted wounds under a merry-go-round of incompetent Tory administrations.After Labour’s promise of “change”, voters are impatient to see a turnaround. Waiting for a clearer economic picture to emerge is incompatible with the job of governing. To quell the summer of speculation the chancellor will need to start sending a few signals soon.Explore more on these topicsEconomicsEconomics viewpointRachel ReevesLabourBudget deficitInflationTax and spendingBudgetcommentShareReuse this content"

These are good odds!Making sense of itis a column about spirituality and how it can be used to navigate everyday lifeSun 24 Aug 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 24 Aug 2025 19.17 EDTShareIonce had a therapist who laughed – not just a chuckle but an unrestrained, full-bodied laughter. Initially, it took me by surprise. I thought therapy was a solemn endeavour, a place to unearth my deepest fears and sorrows. On a significant birthday she asked to see photos of my party, her eyes sparkling with excitement. She joked that we could have had a bottle of champagne in our session to celebrate (we didn’t but I appreciated the sentiment). She never missed an opportunity for shared joy.Of course, we also did the hard work. She witnessed tears, frustration and confusion – often before 9.45am. She had seen a lot and had sat through a lot. She had been a tireless advocate, frustrated with a system that abandoned many of its vulnerable in the name of efficiency.Years later, as I prepared to lead a presentation on what Buddhists callmudita– often translated as appreciative joy, or rejoicing in the happiness of yourself and others – her laughter came back to me. On the morning of the talk I went for a walk and vowed to notice joy in the world around me. I stopped and watched brown ducks shaking their feathers by the lake. I watched children climbing precarious-looking play equipment and received an unprompted smile from a stranger.These weren’t remarkable moments. And yet the more I lingered, replaying them in my mind’s eye, the more I couldn’t stop smiling.Appreciative joy, sometimes also referred to as sympathetic joy, is one of thefour qualitiesthe Buddha encouraged practitioners to cultivate, alongside loving kindness, compassion and equanimity. It is often described as a state of mind that rejoices at the wholesome happiness of the self and others, and extends to all beings, including strangers and (as hard as this might be) our enemies.It is not superficial excitement or uncritical Pollyanna positivity, nor is it pleasure that arises from engaging in or witnessing self-centred gratification or unethical gains. It is a joy that is grounded, steady and sometimes subtle. Contrast it with envy; a widespread social emotion that damages society’spsychological health and wellbeing.Yet appreciative joy is often overlooked in modern Buddhism, which has tended to focus more on compassion and love (also important, of course). It is under-researched in psychology, where empathy is studied mainly in relation to suffering. Most social institutionsemphasise empathic sorrow, not empathic joy or what is now referred to as “positive empathy”. We are encouraged to care for others’ pain but not to celebrate their success and happiness.Appreciative joy is low-hanging fruit: it’s free, simple and immediate.Research also suggests thattraining in positive empathy can reduce social media-induced envyand lead to greater life satisfaction.This is echoed not only in psychology, but also in spiritual traditions. TheDalai Lamaonce said that when we rejoice in others’ happiness and success, we multiply our chances by billions. These are good odds!And yet the spirit of appreciative joy runs counter to many of our habitual ways of relating to the world. As the sociologistPierre Bourdieuobserved, in a stratified society we are often conditioned to see another’s success as a threat to our own status. Social media canintensify this, fuelling “upward social comparisons” which are linked to increased anxiety, depression andFomo.Of course, appreciative joy on its own will not fix structural or global injustices, nor will it solve complex social issues. But it can provide those of us caring for others and advocating for change with nourishment and connection, which can sometimes feel out of reach.It moves us beyond a narrow self-care framework into mutual celebration and solidarity. It is one way we can apply Buddhist ideas in contemporary times that canguard against burnoutand sustain the work of care and courageous advocacy. As the social commentator Rebecca Solnit writes: “Joy doesn’t betray but sustains activism. And when you face a politics that aspires to make you fearful, alienated, and isolated, joy is a fine act of insurrection.”And here’s the secret: you don’t have to be happy to practise appreciative joy. You can unapologetically draw on others’ successes to gladden your heart. As a pessimist, I would have once rolled my eyes at this idea but I can’t deny that it helps you sit with difficulty, yours and others – and it shifts you out of negative, ineffective mental states that cause unnecessary harm to the world around you.The evening after my talk, I had a realisation. Even if my lecture didn’t land as I’d hoped, I could still drop my fretting and focus on my students’ accomplishments: their wisdom, their moments of peace and their hard-earned successes. I didn’t have to be the centre of my own happiness. And I laughed, the raucous laugh of my dear therapist, who knew that joy isn’t optional – it’s a necessity.Dr Nadine Levy is a senior lecturer at theNan Tien Institute.

But that’s what some psychologists in Spainare calling the childcare burdenfaced by older people in that country, where 35% of people over the age of 65take care of their grandchildrenseveral days a week. In my London neighbourhood, the sight of a grandparent pushing a baby in a buggy, or a toddler in a swing, is fairly common, but in Madrid, even more so. The latest Europe-wide survey, in 2016, found the proportion of over 65s undertaking childcare at least several days a week in southern European countries – Spain especially, but also in Italy and Greece –is much higherthan in France (13%) and Germany (15%) or the UK (18%).This is the result of historical cultural norms of shared care between generations, but now some Spanish grandparents are fighting back. After working all their lives, and years spent raising their own children, they hadn’t bargained for spending their retirements engaged in unpaid childcare, and they are not alone in that.Anyone who lurks on parenting internet forums will observe that these faultlines are emerging across the western world, with some parents saddened and frustrated at the lack of input or interest from grandparents (“they’d rather spend their money on cruises!”) and, on the other side, grandparents worn down and exhausted by the expectation, and sometimes entitlement, levied upon them by their children. I’ve seen memes and video content claiming that boomers are the most selfish generation of grandparents ever, but also had conversations with burnt-out older people who simply don’t have the energy to care for small, rambunctious children.Every situation is of course unique, but it’s an issue that has played out in many families in one way or another, mine included. My mother was very present in the first year of my son’s life, and that time was very special for all of us. Yet I wish I had been more mindful of the toll caring for a small baby can take.I still carry some guilt for how I handled things, most of all the fact that she was sleeping on the sofa. She claimed that it was comfortable, but if I could go back in time, I’d have invested in a really good-quality sofabed.“Looking after babies is for the young,” my aunt said to me. I spent my childhood in a small Welsh community where it wasn’t unusual to meet women in their early 40s who were grandmothers. As women have babies later and later, first-time grandparents are getting older, and with that, they have less energy and often greater health needs. There are many good reasons to delay parenthood – I did it myself – but it comes with a price, too. I sometimes wonder if I would have had children earlier, had I feared less the toll it would take on my education, career and finances, and had the system been more hospitable. It is not a system that was built for women of reproductive age, yet we are forced to try to work within it.Let’s not forget, either, that this is a gender issue. Most often, the grandparent doing the childcare is the grandmother. Her own pregnancies and births may have brought their own health issues. Often, she will still be working. She may have other care responsibilities, either her own parents, a partner, or offspring. For women, retirement from paid work doesn’t mean the unpaid care work stops. I’m not surprised that Carmen Díez, one of the Spanish grandmothers interviewed, enjoys her peace, saying: “I love my empty nest.”I don’t blame older women for fighting back, and in some cases saying that they deserve a salary. It doesn’t mean that they don’t love their grandchildren, and of course there are grandmothers – and grandfathers – who would be insulted by offers of payment. But even they would acknowledge that looking after small children can be physically and emotionally draining. My son now weighs more than 18kg, and I am lifting him daily. What grandparents are able to do does have limits.Often, grandmothers are running themselves ragged to support their own daughters’ careers – it is the mother who so often pays the penalty, career-wise, still. Dr Terri Apter, the author of Grandparenting: On Love and Relationships Across Generations, has pointed out that it’s often the feminist grandmothers who help out the most, because they know what a struggle it is.That capitalism thrives on the unpaid domestic labour of women isn’t exactly news, but the grandparental revolt is a new manifestation of it. Love shouldn’t come with a price, but the care work that comes with love: why shouldn’t it? Why should mostly older women be propping up insufficient childcare systems?I don’t blame parents for being frustrated. Whether they are in Spain, Germany, or the UK, they have all to some extent been shortchanged on the expectation of a family life that is easier than the generations that came before. Almost every parent I speak to is completely burned out. Meanwhile,politicians trytowork out howthey can improve dwindling birthrates.Despite the fraught internet forum threads, I don’t think what parents, and grandparents, want is actually all that different: quality family time that doesn’t feel like an endless slog, and a system that supports, rather than hinders, that. It’s sad that it feels so out of reach for so many.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsParents and parentingRepublic of ParenthoodGrandparents and grandparentingChildrenFamilySpainEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

Righto. An extremely confusing study of San Francisco’s transport services has found that not only are people completelyon board with driverless taxis, they are also willing to pay 50% more and wait significantly longer for them. Whyever could this be, eh? Most of the mooted explanations have been largely practical – driverless taxis areproven to be safer(until the machines rise up as one and wipe out humanity). They can’t be over the limit, on their phone at the wheel or give in to road rage. And yes, these are technically valid reasons, but come on. The real answer, which no one is admitting, is that driverless taxis mean we don’t have to talk to anybody.It’s not surprising that many of us would happily put our lives in robot hands to dodge the horror of panic-asking a living, breathing cabbie if he has been busy tonight. We exist in a time whenthe majority of Britonswould rather receive a text than a phone call. So many salons, all over the globe, now offersilent haircuts– where it’s pre-agreed there will be no chat – that they barely register as unusual any more. Self-service checkouts – the driverless taxi of the supermarket – are more labour intensive, more annoying, yet still exceptionally popular. Keeping stumm now seems to be our society’s raison d’etre.One of my friends painstakingly picks slivers of mushroom out of his favourite takeaway dish one by one because there is no option to remove them on the food delivery app. If he rang the restaurant to order it, he could ask them to exclude mushrooms, but he won’t consider it. A former colleague nearly had an embarrassing accident on a long flight because she didn’t want to ask the man in the next seat to let her out to use the loo, in case it opened a conversational channel between them. When she told this story in the office, everyone nodded sagely, accepting her decision as perfectly rational. It appears that some of us will go to just about any lengths to avoid talking to people.You can mute – but you can never leave. Why have WhatsApp groups become so stressful? | Polly HudsonRead moreSeveral tactics can be used to deter your fellow man or woman from speaking to you. The classic is to pretend to be on the phone, but this can be perilous and requires you to know your angles. If the other party is afforded a glimpse of your screen, and has ever seen a phone before, they will immediately recognise your lock display and the jig will be up. The greater danger is that you get a phone call in the middle of your faux call, making it clear you were faking. A lower risk/lower reward strategy is wearing headphones, particularly if combined with an engrossed expression, but they can be removed quickly and easily so success can’t be guaranteed. Further methods include fast walking – you are in too much of a hurry to stop and chat – and looking sad/worried – you are in too much turmoil to stop and chat.However, there are times – glorious, effortless times – when there’s no need to plot and plan. The planets align and magic occurs – simultaneously, two people who do not want to talk act as if they haven’t seen each other. It doesn’t mean they don’t like one another, or that there isn’t respect or even admiration between them – they simply can’t be bothered right now because life is a lot. This mutual ghosting isn’t arranged, but unspoken, instinctive, written in the stars. In the best cases, it is almost choreographed, as the two move around, giving the widest berth possible without making it conspicuous, lost in thought, simply not noticing anything or anybody, honest guv. The bond between these souls is precious, sacred, but fragile. If it snaps, if one person messes up and accidentally catches the other’s eye, they will both have to endure an excruciating performance: “Oh, my goodness – I didn’t see you there! What a surprise! Hello!”Examples of this tense tango can be witnessed at bus stops and train platforms all over the country, especially during the morning or evening commute. You have to look out for them closely, though –but don’t do that, obviously, because then you might see someone you know and have to speak to them.Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

Yet now the country is choosing tocede that leadership, letting Chinadominate and control the clean-energy market across the world. It’s no surprise that people are scratching their heads, wondering what happened.Our president is obsessed withfossil fuels. He wants to resuscitate what everyone knows is a dying coal sector while turning a blind eye to the health, environmental, and economic downsides of theclimate crisis. Coupled with inconsistent threats of increased tariffs against virtually all our allies, he has isolated the US and amplified threats to global security.Donald Trump’s giant budget bill, signed right before the horrific floods in Texas, North Carolina and New Mexico, ignores threats to communities from escalating climate risks while it cuts healthcare, raises energy costs, and puts the safety of our loved ones in harm’s way. And the administration’s executive orders,Environmental Protection Agency announcements, and efforts to gut our federal workforce make it abundantly clear our federal leaders are not working for the American people.But I have never been one to back down from a challenge, certainly not when it comes to protecting my kids and grandkids. And I am not alone. Millions of Americans across the country have no intention of letting this administration dictate our fate at home or abroad. We simply refuse to let this be the United States of America.States and institutions are still fighting in court when this administration disregards science and weakens federal efforts to protect people and our environment. Folks are still listening and speaking up at neighborhood gatherings, town hall meetings, and public hearings on issues such as the weakening of air, water and power plant pollution rules that increase risks to families. They are still fighting for our lives, our communities and our democracy.The US immigration system is being militarized. Now is the time to stand up | Kica MatosRead moreStates, cities and local communities have authority to act boldly and work with industries to advance market innovation and install clean energy that creates jobs and lowers the cost of living for families. They still have clean vehicle fleets for cities to purchase and EV charging projects to pursue. They still have tax credits for solar, wind and batteries. There’s more than a decade of geothermal and battery storage tax credits available for cities, schools and health clinics, as well as many more clean energy opportunities we can and must grab.California, the fourth largest economy in the world, ran on clean energy for 219 days last year. Florida built more large-scale solar infrastructure than California last year. Even in oil country, Texas is setting records for solar, wind and battery capacity.More than 40 states have green banks and clean energy financing institutions. Twenty-four states are committed to the goals of theParis climate agreement. They’re developing bilateral climate partnerships with countries that understand the threat of the climate crisis and the opportunity that clean energy provides.US leaders I have worked with for decades during international climate negotiations continue to work with colleagues in the United Nations, the European Union, India, China, development banks and the private sector to identify policies and strategies that allow the world to mobilize capital for climate projects. Why? Because the cost of not investing in resilience and decarbonization is far too high.Mike Bloomberg and Bloomberg Philanthropies have given our country a seat at the global table. America Is All In, partnering with the US Climate Alliance, Climate Mayors, Ceres and others, will be at the forthcoming UN climate negotiations in Brazil to showcase leadership on infrastructure, transportation, buildings, land use and more that protects our communities and cuts pollution.Mayors and governors will use this platform to inform negotiations, build new partnerships, and pursue creative financing for more projects at home, while US investors continue to explore opportunities to address the heartbreaking food and water challenges across the global south.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

But there’s no guarantee they will be genuinely affordableSun 24 Aug 2025 12.30 EDTLast modified on Sun 24 Aug 2025 16.32 EDTShareTo an outside eye, English cities might seem deliberately designed to foment a housing crisis. Unconstrained by craggy topography or fortified ramparts, their Victorian developers built endless streets of low-rise terraces. Cities that expanded during the Industrial Revolution are less dense than their European equivalents and have far fewer flats. Their private rental sectors are fragmented, dominated by small-time landlords for whom property ownership is often a second career.In recent years, large investors have begun bankrolling high-rise apartment blocks that promise to create the type of housing that English cities need. These “build-to-rent” developments are transforming the skylines of Manchester and London, and have added about14,000 new homeseach year since 2020. For a Labour government thathopes to build 1.5m homes, the sector’s growth looks like a blessing. Clive Betts, the Labour MP who chairs a build-to-rent taskforce,has describedsuch developments as “good-quality housing with a real future”.Labour’s pledge to “build, build, build” rests on the idea that supplying more homes will make housing more affordable. If only it were so straightforward. The housing researcherAdam Almeidarecently found that in Brent, Ealing and Newham, London boroughs with the greatest number of these rental property developments, rents have increased by 48% to 52% since 2015, exceeding the city-wide average. Brent saw the highest rise. The borough is home to Britain’s largest build-to-rent development, in Wembley. Two-bedroom flats at this outer London development are priced between £2,471 and £3,370 per month. It is plausible that other landlords in the area may have seen these prices, and raised theirs accordingly.Build-to-rent is attractive to governments allergic to public spending. The coalition government was keen to encourage the sector, commissioning a2012 reviewthat found such developments were already taking off overseas and in UK student housing. Evidence from both contexts is mixed. Residents inAmsterdam,BerlinandCopenhagenhave accused large investors of helping to fuel the housing crisis, while newly built student apartments in Britain are often unaffordable for British students. The cheapest room at the Edinburgh branch of IQ, one of theUK’s largest student housing groups, currently costs £10,717 for a year’s term-time accommodation; the typical annual Scottish maintenance loan is£8,400.The companies behind these schemes argue that they can offer tenants a better service. Many provide luxurious amenities. Given the choice betweenon-site dog spasand genuinely affordable housing, however, it seems likely that most tenants would choose affordability. Polling byYouGov in 2024found that support for rent controls vastly outnumbered opposition. But such limits, of course, are antithetical to investors’ bottom line. Even in European cities with rent controls, new apartment developments are frequently exempted from them.Labour’s housing plans risk sacrificing real affordability by relying on investors who naturally prioritise their own returns. A corrosive legacy of Thatcherite policy was the evisceration of genuinely affordable social housing through right to buy. While local authorities can technicallyborrowto build more homes, tenants are still allowed to buy these at a significant discount. Labour plans toreform(but not scrap) this policy. Its proposals for affordable social housingremain hazy.Until it delivers, renters will continue getting squeezed.Explore more on these topicsHousingOpinionLabourRenting propertyPropertyStudentscommentShareReuse this content"

It was a grim portrait of her home town – its vitality ebbing as the forces of modern life drained it of young people, polluted its water, exploited its resources and even turned the local school into a pigsty. Its quarter of a million sales reflected not just her distinctive writing, but the familiarity of the story. As urban China prospered with the Communist party’s turn to the market, 350 million villagers migrated to the cities, leaving behind increasingly desolate settlements.Now Beijing is promoting “rural revitalisation”. State media run a steady stream of articles lauding city dwellers who have returned to their home towns to set up cafes or run home-stays. The expansion of transport and telecommunications infrastructure has allowed rural inhabitants to expand their horizons. First came the“Taobao villages”, where at least a 10th of households were using Alibaba’s e-commerce platform. More recently, farmershave taken to livestreaming– selling fruit or flowers direct to urbanites.The push factors are equally potent.Disenchantedurbanites tired of the pressures of city life are seeking to take it easier inthe countryside, just as hippies in the west rejected their parents’ materialistic dreams in the 1960s. Some just aren’t willing to work round the clock; others see increasingly scant rewards for doing so. Some are turning to rural entrepreneurship because of thehigh youth unemployment rate. And the bulge in working-age citizens that fuelled China’s boom years is now becoming a wave of retirees.Migrant remittances were critical to lifting rural incomes. But thehukouorhousehold registration system,tying rights to benefits and services to your home town, forced working parents to leave their children with grandparents – fracturing families andblighting the prospects of many in the next generation. Now it prevents them fromretiring in the cities.China announced in 2020 that it haderadicated extreme poverty, which it characterised as entirely rural. That reflectedremarkable improvements in the lives of tens of millions of peoplethrough official programmes – even if the means used were often crude, such as forced relocation, and the headline target was reached because it was measured on extremely specific criteria.But new opportunities should not be overstated. Remote areas are unlikely to benefit as those near major roads or close to affluent urban centres are doing. Many policies are focused on towns – small by Chinese standards, not so by western ones – rather than villages. And disgruntled city dwellers who seek a rural idyll may find,as many in the west have, that they cannot make a go of it or that the novelty wears off.In fact, projections suggest that the rural labour force will continue contracting until 2035, with the urban labour forceexpected to grow.Increasingly, the government’s vision is of development being driven by hi-tech industries, while the countryside continues to provide cheap labour for the cities when needed and troops for the People’s Liberation Army. China needs better social protection and services – going beyond itshukoureforms to abolish the system, and investing more in education in the villages as well as the cities that house its cutting-edge enterprises. Otherwise, most will continue to see the countryside as a place to leave behind.Explore more on these topicsChinaOpinionAsia PacificChinese economyChinese literatureeditorialsShareReuse this content"

They were a necessity during the two world wars, after which Britain had never been leaner, fitter or taller.Today, we are not as hungry as our ancestors were and life is convenient. However, we are in the throes of obesity, diabetes and mental health crises, we stand on the edge of food supply catastrophe (for example, the tomato crisis of early 2023) and climate change is heavily affecting farmers. I had three children under three and I took on an allotment in my village when war in Ukraine broke out because I wanted to learn, and I wanted to be less reliant on a fragile food system that supplies tasteless fruit and vegetables. I knew little about growing, but quickly came to see that vegetable growing is hard work.Nothing looked like it did in the fancy seed catalogues, nothing grew exactly as I thought it would, beasts and pests ate everything and the vegetables were often tougher than supermarket imports, but they were sweeter too. I wrote about the experience in my second book My Family and Other Seedlings .My children are a little older now, but we still work at it together. We often fail, but we have lost so much of what our ancestors knew about growing food that I can’t help but feel that through failure comes understanding. It doesn’t have to be perfect and, frankly, having a go is probably more climate-friendly than recycling.Lalage SnowRimpton, SomersetI too know the relief of admitting that you are not green-fingered and should probably not be left in charge of a garden or allotment. I’ve found that I can still live out that fantasy by joining a community garden (though not while also carrying a baby in a sling). It’s perfect for me – I get to be muddy and enjoy the unique satisfaction of eating something I grew, but if I can’t go for a couple of weeks, everything is fine.Weeding’s always better when you’re with someone to talk to. For me, being part of a group takes away all my gardening shame and brings me only joy. I recommend it.Laurie NettleLondonNicola Slawson shouldn’t beat herself up for leaving her allotment. Here in Hanwell, west London, as in most areas, unbribable plot inspectors frequently issue “non-cultivation” notices, but always offer the option of downsizing from a 10-pole plot to a five- or even 2.5-pole one.It is also true that some crops – peas and parsnips, for example – can be hard to bring to harvest, but any five-year-old can manage tomatoes and runner beans.The benefits of exercise and the joyous consumption of fresh fruit and veg are delights indeed, and I do hope that Nicola will once again slip on her boots and head for the oasis of tranquillity that may be found in the heart of even the meanest city.Stephen PoundChair, Framfield Allotment AssociationHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

In my 20 years of working in the third sector, I helped run school uniform reuse schemes that made a real difference to struggling families.But too often these efforts were undermined by schools themselves. Minor tweaks to logos, ties or blazers – introduced every year or two – meant perfectly good clothing could no longer be reused. It is a practice that benefits suppliers, not children, and it leaves parents paying the price.If uniforms are meant to level the playing field, schools must stop treating them as branding exercises. Consistency, not constant change, is what families need.Antony David DaviesShrewsbury, ShropshireThe sentiment expressed by Lucy Pasha-Robinson is one that is rarely heard in these conformist days, but one I agree with (School uniforms were meant to be the great leveller – how does a £400 bill do that?, 21 August). School uniform was not universal when I was a child nor when my children went to school. As a new teacher in Sheffield in the early 1980s, the children did not wear uniforms. Now that it is so expensive it seems very unfair.Another problem with uniforms is difficulty identifying the owners. There was always confusion over which piece of uniform belonged to which child – names sometimes never having been put on or being washed out. Imagine having to find the right piece of uniform for the right child after a PE lesson with three- and four-year-olds.I am pleased to hear that my granddaughter is to start at a school with no uniform.Cath WhittinghamBrigg,LincolnshirePerhaps the answer to spiralling uniform costs, until such time that it is regulated, is for parents to protest by buying an alternative uniform for their children – much like the “dresses for boys” protests that pop up perennially in hot weather.If every parent were to participate in this, the school could hardly exclude all the children! Plus it would teach children a valuable lesson in the power of collective, peaceful protest.William BartramHampton, LondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The problem, according to United’s manager, was his team trying to shut up shop after scoring their second‑half opener via a Rodrigo Muniz own goal.“I think we scored the goal and then we forgot about how we play,” Amorim said of his United side, who remain winless from their opening two games. They were well matched by an impressiveFulham. “We want to win so badly, and that is a good feeling. We scored a goal and everyone on the pitch was thinking: ‘Let’s hold on to the advantage and try to win the game.’Emile Smith Rowe’s instant impact for Fulham denies Manchester UnitedRead more“We have to grow up a lot as a team. For me the most important thing is that during the week they were working really hard, today we worked really hard, and we are going to improve.”Bruno Fernandes missed a first‑half penalty, ballooning the ball over Bernd Leno’s goal, going against his usual more measured technique. Amorim put the miss down to nerves: “Fernandes has so much responsibility with him that … he was thinking in the past.”Fernandes himself put his uncharacteristic miss down to Chris Kavanagh, the referee, bumping into him before he took his kick. “I was upset,” he said. “As a penalty taker, you have your own routines, your own things that you do. It upset me because the referee didn’t apologise. That is what triggered me in that moment, but that’s not the excuse for missing the penalty. I put my foot too under the ball and that’s why it ended up going over the bar.”After a bright start in which Matheus Cunha twice went close, United lost momentum. “From that moment, no more big chances for United,” said Marco Silva, the Fulham manager. “In the second half we were better, even when they scored it was in our best moment in the game.

I did feel different coming into it this year. I felt like I was doing the right things day to day, but still, it’s in the back of your head. So I’m just very pleased to have overcome that.”With the victory, the British No 1 is now 20-4 against lower-ranked players over the past year and her ability to consistently win favourable match-ups has been a key part of her steady rise up the rankings. She will next face the qualifier Janice Tjen, who toppled the 24th seed Veronika Kudermetova 6-4, 4-6, 6-4.It also signified a confidence-building first grand slam victory alongside her new Spanish coach, Francisco Roig, who again offered his charge a constant stream of positive reinforcement from a corner of Louis Armstrong Stadium. Roig was joined in Raducanu’s player box by Jerome Poupel, a chiropractor who has been helping Raducanu with her continued back injury.“He’s been helping me for the last year, I would say. I’ve had back problems for the last year, so he’s just really helped with that,” Raducanu said.“As I’ve been playing more tennis and training more, it’s just important for me to stay on top of that. It’s cool, you know, he’s worked in F1, he’s worked with horses, so it’s very different. But I’m just enjoying having him around. He’s a great, calm but eccentric kind of character.”During their time working together, Poupel has offered Raducanu unique insights on her character. “He said that my character is similar to a horse,” she said. “Can be quite stubborn, dig their heels in. He’s got experience. Hopefully he can read me. And also they kind of wear their emotion on their sleeve.View image in fullscreenEmma Raducanu stretches to return a shot during her first-round match.Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty Images“If they’re not feeling like they want to do something they probably won’t do it. I’m just happy to have him around. He’s got so much different, diverse experience that it’s great to have that insight.”This was a good first-round draw for Raducanu, but Shibahara is an interesting figure in her own right. An American-born Japanese player, the 27-year-old is a former top four doubles player and the 2022 French Open mixed doubles champion. Shibahara only opted to prioritise singles last year and she has performed admirably, rising from outside the top 500 to her current ranking of No 128. However, she has never defeated a top-50 opponent and this contest marked just the second grand slam main draw appearance of her career.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As she rolled through the match, she found a nice balance between imposing herself with her early ball striking and remaining solid against an erratic opponent who finished the match with 36 unforced errors. While Raducanu once spent a significant amount of time scouting opponents, she puts part of her success down to finding solutions within herself.“I like watching the opponents,” Raducanu said. “I think I’m probably watching less now. I just have a good awareness of the opponent, what they like to do, and a lot more centred around me. I think I’m trusting myself, trusting my own abilities a lot more and I know what I need to do on the court as well, not necessarily searching so much to the box, asking for what to do, only if I feel like I really need it. I think that’s helped me keep my head in the match, rather than looking up, getting distracted, and kind of searching for something.”Before the tournament, Raducanuspoke in depthabout how the US Open has generated conflicting emotions for her over the years. Her first‑round defeat against Kenin last year was a particularly low point, and Raducanu broke down in tears during her post-match press conference.Things are clearly different now. This summer Raducanu has become a more match tough and confident player than at any point in the past four years. Now she will try to turn that conviction and contentment into another positive run in New York.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025Emma RaducanuUS Open tennisTennisUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Instead, the Englishman had to see off the burden of recent history. Fleetwood prevailed, taking his maidenPGA Tourtitle on his 164th start. Sometimes the good guys win. East Lake delivered one of the most heartwarming tales of the sporting year, a victory for persistence and proof that a relatable golfer can be a triumphant one.Fleetwood displayed magnificent mental strength to brush aside scar tissue caused by falling short, agonisingly so, twice since late June. The most remarkable thing about this success was how unremarkable it all looked. Fleetwood’s closing 68 was so blissfully simple.Keegan Bradley agonising over whether to be a playing Ryder Cup captain for USRead moreAmusingly, for a golfer who had endured so many near misses in the United States, Fleetwood actually lifted two trophies at East Lake. He is the latest winner of the FedEx Cup. The acclaim that met Fleetwood, in a land so far from home and in direct competition with Americans, served to demonstrate his huge popularity. “Tommy, Tommy,” chanted the adoring crowd as he approached the final green. Even those nudged into lesser leaderboard positions could not reasonably deny Fleetwood his moment. He is a nearly man no more.LeBron James postedwords of celebration towards the Southport man. LeBron James!“There was Travelers, there was Memphis, obviously plenty before,” Fleetwood said of ones that got away. “This probably wasn’t the most comfortable I’ve been because, as they rack up, you obviously start to think of [negative] things.“I’m proud of what I’ve done before. Whether I’ve won or not, I’ve still been proud of my career so far, knowing that I still have a long way to go and lots of learning. This doesn’t change that really. This is hopefully just one win, the first of many to come. You cannot win plenty if you don’t win the first one. I’ll continue to try to get better and be the best I can be.” Indeed, with an orangutan removed from his back, Fleetwood is seriously dangerous.A further endearing element is added by the fact Fleetwood still had his life long friend Ian Finnis on the bag for the biggest victory of his career. Golfers of less substance would have blamed and sacked caddies as the wait went on. Finnis has sampled the pain and now the glory.By the time Fleetwood took to the 71st tee, he held a three shot lead. Cantlay had erred at the 16th just when Fleetwood had blinked with a bogey at the hole before. Fleetwood split the fairway with a superb drive at the 17th. Cantlay refused to wilt, hitting his approach shot to 8ft. When Cantlay’s birdie try, a tame effort, fell short Fleetwood had one hand and four fingers upon the tournament. “When you have had a few close calls and let a few trophies slip, a three shot lead doesn’t feel like much,” said Fleetwood with a smile later. A straightforward par at the last meant he won by that margin, at 18 under par, Cantlay sharing second with Henley. Cantlay’s wait for a ninth PGA Tour victory stretches back to 2022.Scheffler’s stunning PGA Tour season closed with a 68 for 14 under in total. The world No 1 tied Corey Conners, who shot a 62, and Cameron Young. For Young, a Ryder Cup wildcard pick seems inevitable. Keegan Bradley, who will captain the US at Bethpage next month, closed on 13 under alongside Sam Burns and Justin Thomas. The latter duo are also likely to feature at Bethpage, with the lingering question for the coming days involving whether Bradley will pick himself. To his credit, Bradley hung around here to congratulate Fleetwood as he headed for scoring duties. Shane Lowry, Harry Hall and Justin Rose provided European flavour by doing likewise.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

McIlroy, who will next appear at back-to-back events in Europe, revealed he was reduced to tears by the Masters during his latest visit to Georgia. “I actually did a couple of things for Augusta National this week,” McIlroy said. “I didn’t go there but there was a couple things I had to do. I had the Green Jacket on for a few hours on Wednesday doing something. It was nice to reminisce. They made me cry again.” Grown men were blubbing with joy as Fleetwood ended his drought.

But now, finally, the future is here. If Goodison Park was a temple to Everton’s rich and storied past,Hill Dickinson Stadiumrepresents something long desired for the future, a great leap forward in their ambition to host a world-class football team. In truth, it is much needed.Proud though Evertonians are of their club’s sleeping giant status, the club have too long traded on the former glories chronicled in songs of the Glwadys Street end.Everton send Brighton packing as Jack Grealish ignites win in club’s new homeRead moreHere, on asun-drenched afternoon on the banks of the River Mersey, change and optimism was the tune of the day – and the architect Dan Meis’s 52,000-seat stadium, a sleek, stylish construction of glass and steel feels like the right place to harness that spirit.It is a long time to spend in one place, 133 years. Perhaps it was the sheer newness of it all that had fans ambling at half speed, seemingly awestruck up Regent Road, the site of their new ground, stopping for family selfies and to take videos for social media.More likely it was the stadium itself, which seems to rise out of the river when approached from the nearby Eldonian Village estate, that gave early arrivals their moment for pause.Its roof, a flowing arch of polished steel, glints like a swallow’s wing in the early afternoon sunlight. A successful season cannot be guaranteed by the move into their new home – as Everton’s opening defeat at Leeds showed – but there is undoubtedly a feeling of joy around this place.Inside, families swept around the spacious concourse which flows around the stadium almost in homage to the rolling river behind. It is a marked departure from the visceral experience of navigating entry to Goodison – a weekly ritual of charting a course through a crush of people meandering out of narrow streets, dodging chip wrappers, parked cars and plastic pint glasses along the way. Although the experience on Sunday wasn’t faultless, with some fans complaining of long queues for the bar and bottlenecks in busy areas.View image in fullscreenFans walked slowly up to their new stadium, ‘seemingly awestruck’ and stopping for selfies.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianBut of course the true test of Hill Dickinson Stadium’s suitability would be what happened inside. With 10 minutes to kick-off came evidence of one thing the designers had thought about very carefully. As a booming sound system dialled up, nervous energy in the stands soon became a simmering anticipation. Acoustics is not a word which often comes up in conversations among football fans – Evertonians may rightly be more concerned with their lack of full-backs than a world-class PA system – but the way Hill Dickinson Stadium retains the thrum of fan excitement invoked a physical response here.There She Goes, the 90s indie song by the scouser band the La’s, is now a fan anthem after it became part of Goodison Park’s swan song. Here it was the first song roared in unison by the packed stadium in full voice. It is magnificent – a bittersweet goodbye turned soundtrack for the future, exactly what the occasion called for.And then, as kick-off approached, this roomy, comfortable feat of 21st-century design felt all of a sudden very familiar – old school, even. The Evertonians went through the usual pre-match routine of songs, before the old battle cry went up. A roar for Z-Cars bolstered by the 10,000 or so extra voices all this modernity can accommodate.Those who knew Goodison will know that its silences could be as deafening as its crescendos – the clattering of wooden seats announcing an early half-time pint after a disappointing start. How those moments of disillusion play out in this new, more sanitary environment, we will have to wait to find out.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their game effort was rewarded when Jack Grealish,surely a cult-hero in the making, set up the first goal of this new era – finding Iliman Ndiaye, whose finish induced the kind roar which would test the mettle of any roof.That outpouring of elation and relief, which are often the same thing where Everton are concerned, were only matched when Jordan Pickford – a cult hero firmly established – saved a penalty which all but guaranteed a victorious start to life by the river.Here was a thoroughly Everton afternoon. Not perfect, by any means. But a step forward, willed into being by the support of a faithful blue army of fans who finally got their moment in the sun.They may no longer reside among the terrace houses of L4 but they are, as another of those old songs says, the Goodison gang. A new postcode does not appear to have changed that.Explore more on these topicsEvertonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He is due to meet both in the coming days, although the Forest manager insisted that he has no intention of walking out.Crystal Palace 1-1 Nottingham Forest: Premier League – as it happenedRead more“This narrative is absurd,” Nuno said after Callum Hudson-Odoi’s equaliser ensured Forest made it 10 league games without defeat againstCrystal Palaceas they survived a cauldron of noise created by the home supporters still seething at their demotion from the Europa League.However, asked whether he is confident of still being Forest manager after this month, he said: “I cannot answer that question, but what I know is that I’m working and trying to do my job the best that I can. Of course the situation has to be solved and we are responsible players and we’re going to have a good conversation to try to create more than anything a good platform for what is more important, the team.”Marinakis, who has been blamed by Palace for his role in the decision after Forest wrote to Uefa urging them to investigate whether their Premier League rivals had breached multi-club ownership regulations, did not attendthe 1-1 drawwhere a banner was unveiled midway through the first half which took aim at the Greek billionaire. Edu was at ­Selhurst Park as Nuno brought four new signings off the bench in the second half but admitted he would like to bring in more players before the window closes.“I believe so,” he responded when asked if he can repair his relationship with Marinakis. “Everybody wants the best for Forest. Me first, the president first and all the club wants the best for Forest. And I always, during my career, I think it’s the first time that I’m facing a situation and being asked these things. It’s not helpful, but I believe work with conflict doesn’t work out. What we did last season together will stick forever in our memories. This is the responsibility that we have to our club. Ignore the noise and work hard.”Oliver Glasner is also desperate for investment in Palace’s squad after Eberechi Eze’s club record sale to Arsenal and he seemed hopeful that they will get their business ­completed in time after new American billionaire co-owner Woody Johnson was spotted mingling with fans before the game.“I don’t talk about the players we are looking for because it just makes it more expensive. It’s pretty clear what we need,” he said. “We are competing in four competitions this season and if you lose one of your top stars who had 14 goals and 12 assists [last season] then it’s pretty clear we need to replace him with a starter. This is what we are looking for and I’m pretty sure we will get it done.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are about to find out. Arsenal’s battling run to Lisbon and subsequentvictory over Barcelonaended a north London trophy drought, yet it has still been six years since the most decorated women’s team in England won a Women’s Super League title. Back-to-back League Cup wins in 2023 and 2024 ensured the cupboard was filled somewhat during that time, but those were widely viewed as not enough for a club with such an illustrious history, and certainly did not match up with the level of investment being pumped into the team.Arsenal launch meet-and-greet prize draw for fans after WSL matchesRead moreEnding Chelsea’s dominance of the WSL is the focus of every team looking to challenge at the top and Arsenal are no different. For the latest challenge they boast players riding high on the crest of a trophy-laden wave, with five European champions for club and country in their squad followingEngland’s triumph in Switzerland. The key is finding consistency across the four competitions that have eluded them in recent years. Renée Slegers’ squad has been strengthened, with the world-record fee paid for Olivia Smith a real statement of intent. It has, however, also suffered the blow ofLeah Williamson being ruled outfor the start of the campaign following a knee procedure.Arsenal have for some time weathered accusations that they can sell out crowds but can’t win trophies. May’s glory in Lisbon has quashed that narrative, but the onus is on them now to deliver domestic success. All the ingredients for success are there and, in Slegers, they have a manager clearly capable of bringing them together and cooking up a treat.Arsenal’s league placing since 2021.Arsenal’s league placing since 2021The managerSlegers’ time at the helm following the departure of Jonas Eidevall in October has rightly led to a place on the shortlist for the Ballon d’Or women’s coach of the year award for the 36-year-old. At the start of last season, Slegers was a relative unknown; an assistant coach at Arsenal who stepped into the breach following a poor start to the season that led to Eidevall’s resignation. An unbeaten run up to the winter break and qualification for the Champions League knockout stage prompted a permanent contract and Arsenal flourished, her inclusive approach and the culture she has encouraged yielding remarkable results. Now Slegers has had the chance to further shape the team the way she wants it.Off-field pictureThe decision to host all WSL games at the Emirates Stadium this season will further elevate Arsenal’s financial position. The club have sold 15,000 season tickets for the main stadium, having increased the number of fixtures they’ve played at the ground year on year. From the 2023 financial year to 2024, Arsenal’s matchday turnover rose from £2.7m to £4.4m; the impact of last season’s games at the Emirates on the club’s finances will be evident next year and the full effects of a permanent WSL-related move to the ground will be seen in the 2027 filings. The scale of the crowds at the Emirates is of benefit to other WSL clubs too, with players from across the world wanting to play there.Star signingView image in fullscreenOlivia Smith became the most expensive player in the world with her move from Liverpool.Photograph: David Price/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesThe recruitment of Chloe Kelly on a permanent deal following the conclusion of her successful loan spell from Manchester City is significant, but the signing of Smith is a huge statement of intent. After missing out on Naomi Girma and Keira Walsh, who joined Chelsea, and having reportedly failed with record bids for Mary Earps and Alessia Russo (before the latter was signed on a free), Arsenal needed a big transfer. Smith shone at Liverpool and was named the Professional Footballers’ Association young player of the year earlier this month. She is a star.Stepping upKyra Cooney-Cross made 19 WSL appearances for Arsenal last season, starting 10 times, and displayed maturity and confidence on the ball. The 23-year-old has spent time during the summer training with Myles Lewis-Skelly as she looks to ramp up her influence on the side. Supplanting the mercurial Kim Little and the defensive-midfield maestro Lia Wälti is no mean feat but Cooney-Cross is undoubtedly snapping at their heels. This season could well be the year where the Australian shakes off the prospect label and becomes a mainstay.It was a good summer for …It would be neglectful to pick out one of Arsenal’s victorious Lionesses given all of them were influential in a bruising and thrilling Euros campaign. Kelly was the gamechanger, Russo led the line, Beth Mead was hugely impactful and, despite not playing a minute of football, Lotte Wubben-Moy’s influence on the side is held in high regard. Then there was Williamson, the captain, and Michelle Agyemang, who was the tournament’s breakout star and has departed for another loan spell at Brighton as part of the 19-year-old’s ongoing development. Agyemang will no doubt return to Arsenal given how highly rated she is in north London.Arsenal’s results from the 2024-25 season.Arsenal’s results from the 2024-25 seasonMain initiative to attract more fansView image in fullscreenArsenal are breaking attendance record after attendance record.Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty ImagesThe decision to host all WSL games at the Emirates has been in the works for some time, part of a long-term strategy that has led to large crowds for the women’s games in N5, and it is no accident Arsenal have broken attendance record after attendance record. The decision to play Champions League group-stage games at Borehamwood may feel like a step back, but with Arsenal struggling to maintain their high attendances on weekday evenings, there is logic to the decision.The next phase is managing player access with so many more fans in attendance, and the club will draw from a ballot of season-ticket holders and six-game bundle buyers before each game fora meet-and-greetto curb the growing pressure on players to spend up to an hour or more signing autographs and taking photos after games.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueArsenal WomenWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Black Ferns finished with 13 players on the pitch.New Zealand’s director of performance, Allan Bunting, had no update on either player after the game as they are waiting for them to be assessed. The lock Alana Bremner said she was proud of how they adapted.Bremner said: “We were talking after and said ‘we didn’t realise we were 13 for a couple of minutes there’. When they realised our game drivers really stepped up. It was awesome to see the way we did that and a lot of heart was shown, especially on defence. When you are two women down you have to work harder for each other.”It blighted a fairly positive outing for the six-time winners during which the World Cup record try-scorer ­Portia Woodman-Wickliffe added to her tally after being introduced in the second half.Brazil fans enjoy carnival atmosphere despite World Cup rout by South Africa | Luke McLaughlinRead moreThe scoreboard did not sufficiently tell the game’s story, where at times the Black Ferns were undone by their own mistakes. It was a mildly frustrating first half littered with hand­ling errors and was underlined by the entire squad included in a huddle before they hit the changing rooms. In the second half they sprinted away from Spain, who are 10 places below New Zealand in the world rankings.A brighter note for the Black Ferns was Jorja Miller’s solid performance, despite being substituted at the interval. The sevens player of the year has already won Olympic gold and Sevens World Cup silver, but made her 15s World Cup debut and scored two tries.“I was stoked,” Miller said. “Even just running out and putting the ­jersey on, it was a really special moment. As you see on the side [of the shirt which shows six World Cup wins] it shows how much legacy and history this team has created at Rugby World Cups.

Spain’s Amàlia Argudo kicked three points to round off the half.While the Black Ferns continued to be stifled by their own errors they were the first to score in the second half through Leti-I’iga. They were in again with Georgia Ponsonby and Leti‑I’iga crossed for her second just after ­Olsen‑Baker’s injury.

It’s not quite like that in rugby, and their women’s 15s team created history simply by running on to the turf.The first Brazil team to qualify for a men’s or women’s Rugby World Cup had played only 16 times before this, winning five matches, including a playoff against Colombia that secured qualification. Their prize, if you can call it that, was an intimidating opener against the famously powerful South Africa.Ireland open with six-try win over Japan to give them hope of making last eightRead more“Our first Brazil fan of the day,” one of the friendly volunteers outside Northampton train station declared just before 10am, as supporters began to drift from the platforms towards the venue. There would be more.The throb of drums was audible approaching the stadium, too. Although it may be stretching it to suggest Northampton was rocking to a samba beat courtesy of the World Rugby-sanctioned percussionists positioned outside Gate Three.There was more than a whiff of carnival atmosphere in the air, though, as the fans welcomed Japan and Ireland for their first instalment of the Franklin’s Gardens double‑header. There were patches of Brazilian gold and green visible around the packed stadium, and judging by the roars, every neutral fan in the place was praying for a gargantuan upset.After three early tries, one disallowed, for South Africa it looked like a cricket score might materialise but the lowest-ranked team in the tournament defended doggedly, and a sweetly struck penalty from Raquel Kochhann got them on the board. Kochhann is a cancer survivor as well as a three‑time Olympian, in sevens, and personifies the squad’s character.View image in fullscreenLibbie Janse van Rensburg celebrates after scoring a try for South Africa.Photograph: Sam Mellish/Getty Images“I just made the kick,” Kochhann said. “It was the result of a jackal, so the whole team worked to get those points. They are team points because everyone needed to work hard. If we are not so skilful – yet – we have a lot of heart. And we put all that on the field.”Aseza Hele, the dynamic Springbok No 8, personified the size of Brazil’s task, and scored two superb tries before half-time. Nadine Roos, Ayanda Malinga and Libbie Janse van Rensburg also crossed, making it 26-3 at the break, but Brazil stayed firmly in the fight. The half‑time numbers told the story: Brazil had made 130 tackles against 25 for South Africa.View image in fullscreenThe lowest-ranked team in the tournament, Brazil were required to dig in defensively.Photograph: Rob Newell/CameraSport/Getty ImagesGaps were always likely to open up and three minutes after half-time the sprightly Roos skipped around a would-be tackler and chipped into the Brazil 22, where Byrhandré Dolf snaffled the bouncing ball and sensed Hele on her left shoulder. The irrepressible No 8 raced under the sticks to seal a hat-trick.Van Rensburg went over again, and Aphiwe Ngwevu added an eighth try, as the second half wore on and the Brazil team wore out. But Kochhann, to symbolise their continued desire, added a second penalty on 57min.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Red Roses star produced a great performance against the USA in England's opener, scoring a brilliant try and coming up with scrum and breakdown penalties. The Bristol player believes she has room to improve at this tournament and beyond, however.'I’ve worked really hard over the offseason to get into some decent shape,' Botterman (pictured) said. 'I don’t want to be shy about the fact that I want to be the best loosehead prop in the world. I want to cement that this tournament. For me, that was a good start, but I feel like I’ve still got a lot more I can give.''I don’t want it to be questioned, if I’m honest. I think I am within the conversation and now I just want to push on and keep improving', the 26-year-old added. 'Everyone can improve everywhere, but for a long time my scrummaging wasn’t the best. I’ve really worked on that and I think that is an area of strength now. Attacking wise, I’m happy; defensively I think I can be a bit stronger and chuck my weight around a bit more. I feel physically in a really good spot.'Another name that could be included among the best looseheads in the world is the USA's Hope Rogers, who played against Botterman on Friday night. The game was a record-breaker with 42,723 fans at Sunderland's Stadium of Light – the biggest attendance for a Women's Rugby World Cup opening game.'I don't think we probably quite knew how big it was going to be,' Botterman added. 'When we turned up and started seeing the crowds, when we walked out with all the flames, it started to feel a bit real. We fed off the crowd well.'Sarah RendellPhotograph: Steve Taylor/Shutterstock EditorialWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Ferreira’s three children – Fergus, Bella and Laura – confirmed they, too, were proud even as the South Africa points continued to rain down. It became 10 tries in total, Lerato Makua rounding off the scoring. Malinga and Van Rensburg both scored twice and Dolf finished with eight conversions.“Very satisfactory performance,” the Springboks head coach, Swys de Bruin, said. “Their defence was good, but so was our attack.”Of South Africa’s experience in the early days of this tournament De Bruin said: “I tell you it’s fantastic. It’s the first time for these girls, in a lot of things, and that’s why they’re blessed, humble, and grateful. It’s a nice day to be a South African.”It was a nice day, and a proud day, to be a Brazilian too.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Rugby World Cup 2025Women's rugby unionRugby unionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While it remains unclear when Saka will return to the fold, the early indications are thought to be positive for the 23-year-old – and it is understood that it is not anticipated he will be sidelined for a similar timeframe as last season.Arteta reveals Eze call, frets over ‘significant’ Saka injury and Ødegaard blowRead moreArsenal, who have won both of their matches so far, head to Anfield next Sunday to face the Premier League champions Liverpool.Martin Ødegaard, the Arsenal captain, was also substituted in the win against Leeds after he fell awkwardly on his right shoulder. He was withdrawn from a fan signing event at the Emirates Stadium on Monday as he focuses on his recovery. But, like Saka, it is not expected that the Norway international will face a sustained period away from action.Meanwhile, the new Arsenal signing Eberechi Eze will create “magic moments” and take the club to a different level, the manager,Mikel Arteta, has claimed. Eze was presented to the Emirates Stadium crowd in the minutes before Arsenal’s demolition job of Leeds which fired the Gunners to an early sight of the Premier League summit.Arteta said of his latest recruit: “He [Eze] has the capacity to create these magic moments. He can do it from different positions, different situations. He’s got that flair and he’s got that charisma about him that is very contagious.“It shows how much we want to take this club to a different level. His talent is unquestionable. He’s experienced in this league. The personality is unbelievable. He can play different positions. We know he can play as an attacking midfielder, right or left. He doesn’t care. And you can tell that what happened on that pitch [before the game] meant the world to him so I am delighted to have him.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Meanwhile, tanks shelled houses and roads in the nearby Sabra neighbourhood and several buildings were blown up in the northern area of Jabaliya.Fire lit the skies from the direction of the explosions, causing panic and prompting some families to stream out of the city. Other residents said they would prefer to die and not leave.About half of Gaza’s roughly 2 million people currently live inGazaCity.

If they suddenly begin the invasion, they will use heavy fire.”Others said they would not leave, despite the explosions. “We are not leaving, let them bomb us at home,” said Aya, 31, who had a family of eight, adding that they could not afford to buy a tent or pay for the transportation, even if they did try to leave. “We are hungry, afraid and don’t have money.”Israel approved a plan earlier this month foran expanded military offensiveto seize control of Gaza City. It is not expected to move forces into the largely destroyed city centre for a few weeks, leaving room for mediators Egypt and Qatar to try to resume ceasefire talks.Still, Israeli forces have bombed the city and surrounding areas, and said on Sunday that forces had returned to combat in the Jabaliya area in recent days.Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, on Sunday vowed to press on with the offensive, which has raised alarm abroad and objections at home. On Friday, Katz said that Gaza City would be razed unless Hamas militants agreed to end the war on Israel’s terms and release all the hostages it still holds.Hamas said in a statement on Sunday that Israel’s plan to take over Gaza City showed it was not serious about a ceasefire. It said a ceasefire agreement was “the only way to return the hostages”, holding the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, responsible for their lives.UN-backed expertsdeclared on Fridaythat an “entirely man-made” famine is taking place in Gaza’s largest city and its surrounding area amid deteriorating conditions that threaten increasing deaths across the devastated territory.“This famineis entirely man-made, it can be halted and reversed,” the report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) said. “The time for debate and hesitation has passed, starvation is present and is rapidly spreading … If a ceasefire is not implemented to allow humanitarian aid to reach everyone in the Gaza Strip, and if essential food supplies and basic health, nutrition and [sanitation and water] services are not restored immediately, avoidable deaths will increase exponentially.”1:03UN agency says Gaza famine is direct result of Israel’s actions – videoOn Sunday, the Gaza health ministry said eight more people had died of malnutrition and starvation, raising deaths from such causes to 289 people, including 115 children, since the war started.Gaza’s civil defence agency reported at least 42 people had been killed in Israeli attacks on Sunday​.​Spokes​p​erson Mahmud Bassal said there had been several airstrikes around Gaza City​, including one in Sabra that killed eight people.​Attacks were also reported elsewhere across the territory, he said, with the “total tally currently rising to 42 dead”.Israel is fighting allegations at the world’s top court of committinggenocide in Gaza, where it has killed more than 60,000 people. Separately, the international criminal court (ICC) hasissued arrest warrantsfor Netanyahu and his former defence minister Yoav Gallant. It also issued an arrest warrant for the Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif, but later withdrew it after he was killed.‘Very sick and very tired’: the reality of famine for Gaza’s most vulnerableRead moreThe Associated Press reported that Israeli forces had killed four people seeking food aid on Sunday as they travelled through a military zone south of Gaza City – an area regularly used by Palestinians trying to reach a food distribution point.Al-Awda hospital and two witnesses told the Associated Press that the four Palestinians were killed when troops opened fire on a crowd heading to a site run by the Israeli-backed US contractor Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) in the Netzarim corridor area. It occurred hundreds of metres away from the site, the witnesses said.“The gunfire was indiscriminate,” Mohamed Abed, a father of two from the Bureij refugee camp, told Associated Press, adding that while many had fled, some people fell to the ground after being shot.Abed and Aymed Sayyad, another Palestinian seeking food among the crowd, said troops opened fire when a group near the front of the crowd pushed forward toward a distribution site before its scheduled opening.The Israeli military and GHF did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Reuters andthe Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Israel has responded with strikes on Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, including the vital Hodeidah port.Abdul Qader al-Murtada, a senior Houthi official, said on Sunday the Houthis, who control much of Yemen’s population, would continue to act in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.“(Israel) must know that we will not abandon our brothers in Gaza, whatever the sacrifices,” he said on X.Explore more on these topicsYemenIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

She reviews sentences highlighted by members of the public and refers those she believes appear unduly lenient to the court of appeal.According to government figures, 62% of the sentences increased by the court of appeal in the first half of this year were for rape and serious sexual offences.This was up from 30% in the second half of 2024 and 41% in the first half. In 2023, the figures were 25% for the second half of the year and 30% in the first six months.The proportion of sentences for rape and serious sexual offences flagged as unduly lenient by the public and the attorney general’s office has also risen.In the first half of this year, 34% of sentences flagged by the public were for such crimes, and comprised 55% of sentences referred by the attorney general’s office to the court of appeal.In 2024 and 2023 the proportion of such sentences referred by the public to the unduly lenient scheme ranged between 21% and 27%.Of the sentences then referred on to judges by the attorney general’s office, 29% were for rape and sexual offences in the second half of last year, compared with 33% in the first half. In 2023, the figures were 29% in the second half of the year and 27% in the first half.Rigby, who is part of the 2024 intake of Labour MPs and was promoted to her ministerial role in December, said in an interview with the Guardian that ministers were “finally treating this incredibly serious issue as the national emergency that it is”.“It’s not just violent sexual offences where we see sentence increases. We’ve actually seen sentence increases forcontrolling and coercive behaviouras well, which commands a lower sentence than rape,” Rigby said. “The court of appeal is sending a message as to how it will deal with these type of offences.“It’s vital that we examine the causes of violence against women and girls, as well as dealing with the offences themselves … It goes to technology. It goes to education. It’s a true cross-government issue.”Asked aboutReform UK’s campaign on crimeand women’s safety, Rigby said Nigel Farage’s party was “all protest and no plan”. “They stoke anger. They’ve got absolutely no answers. It’s not leadership, it’s just empty theatrics,” she said.But she added that crime was something that “comes up again and again” when she spoke to her constituents and that the Conservative government’s handling of the criminal justice system had undermined public confidence and “weakened the perception of the rule of law”.A total of 28 criminals found guilty of violent and sexual offences against women and girls had their sentences increased by the court of appeal in the first half of this year after referrals to the unduly lenient sentence scheme.They included Adrian Revill, who repeatedly sexually abused a teenager and had his three-year sentence tripled. Gagandeep Gulati, who filmed himself raping a woman in Leicester city centre before sharing the video with others, had his sentence increased from six years to nine.In May, three men – Ibrar Hussain and brothers Imtiaz and Fayaz Ahmed – who raped a vulnerable teenager in West Yorkshire over several years in the 1990shad their sentences increasedafter a referral by Rigby.The government has promised tohalve violence against women and girls by 2034.Explore more on these topicsRape and sexual assaultSentencingCrimeEnglandWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

Without further action, we will run out of prison places in months, courts would halt trials and the police cancel arrests.“That is why as part of our plan for change, we are overhauling sentencing to make sure we always have the prison places needed to keep the country safe.”England andWalestogether have the highest per capita prison population in western Europe. Gauke has said that without change, prisons could run out of space again by spring.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Air assets have also been deployed, including multiple helicopters for targeted water drops and air tankers for fire retardant.The cause of the fire was still under investigation.According toCal Fire, there has been no confirmation of structures damages and or destroyed, although damage assessment remains ongoing. Because the fire is burning in rugged terrain, plus a weather forecast over next few days with hot and dry conditions, it will make sustained efforts “crucial for containment”.An air quality alert has been put in place through multiple counties including Napa, Sonoma and Solano until Monday.“If possible, and temperatures allow, stay inside with windows and doors closed until smoke levels subside. Residents can also reduce their exposure to smoke by setting their car vent systems to re-circulate to prevent outside air from moving inside. The use of indoor air filtration or going to a Clean Air Center or other location with filtered air, such as a library or mall, can also help reduce smoke exposure,” the Bay Area Air Districtsaidon Saturday.Residents of the western United States have been sweltering in a heat wave that hospitalized some people, with temperatures forecast to hit dangerous levels throughout the weekend in Washington, Oregon, southern California, Nevada and Arizona.Clay said the weather has moderated since the fire broke out, with Sunday’s high expected to be 94F (34C). But as the day goes on, humidity levels were expected to drop and the winds to pick up in the afternoon.“That’s been a driving factor in the afternoons since we’ve seen the fire activity pick up for the last three days,” Clay said, adding that “support from all up and down California has been critical to our efforts”.The fire began in the same area as the much larger Glass Fire in 2020, which crossed into Sonoma county and eventually burned about 105 sq miles (272 sq km) and more than 1,500 structures.That fire was driven by wind, while the current fire is fueled by dry vegetation on steep slopes – some of it dead and downed trees left over from the Glass Fire and some of it grass and brush that grew back and then dried out again, said Clay.In Oregon, the Flat Fire in Deschutes and Jefferson counties had grown to almost 34 sq miles (88 sq km), with no containment, and threatened nearly 4,000 homes, according to the state Fire Marshal’s Office. About 10,000 people were under some sort of evacuation notice.The fire began Thursday night and grew quickly amid hot, gusty conditions. Fire officials were keeping an eye on isolated thunderstorms in Southern Oregon that could drift north on Sunday, spokesman Chris Schimmer said in a video posted to Facebook.In a Sunday update, Central Oregon Fire Info (Cofi) said that night shift crew were able to establish initial lines along the southern head of the fire and made additional progress along portions of the north and wester perimeter of the fire.Cofi added that crew were also able to burnout unburnt vegetation in the Carcass Creek area to slow the fire’s spread.We were able to cut in some rough breaks around the fire to stop the spread around key areas and homes,”saidEric Perkins, Oregon’s Department of Forestry Complex Incident Management Team 3 operations section chief.“We still have a lot of work ahead of us to improve lines and tie them together,” he added.Sunday’s conditions of fighting fires in Oregon include an extreme heat warning, as well as low relative humidities, an unstable air mass as well as temperatures expected to reach triple digits.“Today we’re looking much better, we have high hopes that we can stop the forward progression of this fire,” Perkinssaidin a Facebook video, adding: “Having said that, we are in a fire fight and the weather’s not that favorable … It’s more favorable for the fire than the firefighters today.”Temporary flight restrictions from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have been put in place across the fire area, with authorities warning that all illegal drone use will be reported to law enforcement.Meanwhile, air quality alerts have beenissuedacross multiple communities in central Oregon, including Beaver Marsh, Bend, Crescent, Deschutes River Woods, La Pine, Madras, Prineville, Redville, Silver Lake, Sunrise and Three River.According to IQAir, current air quality levels ranged between 150 and 200, which fall into the categories of unhealthy to very unhealthy conditions for residents.Although it’s difficult to directly tie a single fire or weather event directly to climate change, scientists say human-caused warming from burning fossil fuels like coal and gas is causing more intense heatwaves and droughts, which in turn set the stage for more destructive wildfires.Explore more on these topicsUS newsWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

They grab on to the guide rope to help lower the balloon to a safe spot, helping it to avoid crashing into houses or parked cars.Georgia Balać, whose partner assisted with the landing using an emergency line thrown down by the pilot, told the Bedford Independent: “It was extraordinary. It came down quickly and uncontrollably, very nearly missing the terraced houses and pylons.“It made a near-perfect landing between parked cars on either side.”The British Balloon and Airship Club confirmed to the BBC it “landed without incident” and everyone was OK.Only 98 incidents involving hot air balloons occurred in the UK between 1976 and 2004, according to a report by ScienceDirect.The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is the independent aviation regulator in the UK. All ballooning operations must comply with strict CAA regulations to ensure optimal safety for passengers and crew members.One of the main requirements for commercial balloonists is a commercial balloon pilot licence.In April, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said it wasinvestigatingafter receiving a report about a collision in Essex caused by a malfunction with a hot air balloon’s aircraft’s envelope – the large, airtight, balloon-shaped bag where the hot air goes.Explore more on these topicsBedfordshireEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

There will be increasing amounts of sunshine and temperatures continuing to climb.“On Monday it will be a very warm and sunny picture for most. It will start to go downhill and rain will start to move in for Northern Ireland into the afternoon.”People planning to head to beaches on Monday or Tuesday are being advised to go to those with lifeguards as big waves are expected.From Tuesday onwards, spells of rain will be moving across all parts of the country, and it will be wettest in the west, Snell said.He downplayed the potential impact of Hurricane Erin on UK shores, which is now a category 2 storm moving eastwards across the North Atlantic.“It will be heavy at times in the west, but at the moment we’re not expecting too many impacts, and it may for farmers or anyone who needs the rain be welcome,” he added.On Wednesday, a band of rain will move across the whole country, and low pressure will remain until the weekend with further spells of rain.Hurrican Erin has lost some strength in the past week as it moved along the east coast of North America, having been classified previously as a category 5 storm, but has still caused more than2,000 people to be evacuated in North Carolinaand at least 60 swimmers to be rescued from rip currents at Wrightsville Beach on the state’s southern coast on Monday.Explore more on these topicsUK weatherNotting Hill carnivalnewsShareReuse this content"

Not even just from MPs. I actually don’t think it’s that many MPs. I think it’s two to three people out of 120. That’s nothing. But online as well. People used to talk about Trump derangement syndrome. I think there’s a Kemi derangement syndrome: ‘How could she possibly have done this?’.”She added that on social media, “there’s a lot of ethno-nationalism creeping up, lots of stuff about my race and my ethnicity and the tropes around, ‘well, she couldn’t possibly have done this all by herself’”.Badenoch, who was born in Wimbledon but grew up in Nigeria before moving back to the UK aged 16, rarely talks at length about her race or heritage. She said recently she no longer felt Nigerian and has frequently criticised anti-racism campaigners and critical race theory.She told the Sunday Times: “I always try to think of every possible explanation before I go to race and racism. I think that is a healthy way to run a society. I remember when I stood up a few years ago and said Britain is not a racist country – ethnic minorities do very well here, it is white working-class boys who are actually struggling on a lot of metrics, and I got pilloried for that.“My view is that there are people out there who will say whatever it is, they will throw whatever kind of mud at you and they will hope that it sticks.”Badenoch faces a pivotal few months in the job as she prepares to deliver her first party conference speech as Tory leader and tries to fend off a potential leadership challenge from her shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick. The party sits in third place in the polls on 17%.Asked about claims by Jenrick’s supporters that he will soon be leading the party, she said: “I think it’s wishful thinking.“There will always be people who are sore losers, our candidate didn’t win, and so on, and sour grapes … When I hear those things, I can tell those people are not focused on the country at all. Many of those people having those conversations think this is a game. But the lives of people in this country aren’t a game.”Badenoch defended Jenrick, however, saying: “I think even Rob himself finds it distressing, but it’s just something that we deal with.”Explore more on these topicsKemi BadenochRaceConservativesnewsShareReuse this content"

In a videopostedon TikTok, staff at Hook and Catch near Glasgow can be seen dipping M&S’s controversial “Strawberry and Creme” sandwich into batter, before deep-frying it, slicing it in half and serving with strawberry sauce.A staff member from the chip shop based in Bearsden in East Dunbartonshire said: “We love putting a playful Scottish chippy twist on things people already recognise. When the M&S strawberries buzz kicked off, we thought, why not try them hot, crispy, and a bit cheeky? The strawberry sandwich was our way of leaning into summer with something fun, surprising and very Hook and Catch.”The clip has attracted thousands of views, with commenters describing the treat as a “crazy creation”. Staff say they have already had multiple people come in to try the sandwich, and say they love seeing the reactions.“The reaction’s been brilliant – lots of curious first-timers, plenty of ‘no way … OK, maybe’ moments, and a fair few instant converts,” said a representative. “It’s been a proper conversation starter in the shop and online, and we’ve had people coming in just to try it and film their first bite.“We’ve always had fun with desserts – our famous Glaswegian doughnut has been a customer favourite for ages. It’s our tongue-in-cheek take on the American-style deep-fried doughnut, but done the Glasgow way.”Its Glaswegian doughnut consists of a crispy battered roll stuffed with Nutella and strawberry jam and coated in sugar.

The Department is a planning organization and is continuously working with other agency partners on plans to protect federal assets and personnel,” a Department of Defense official said, according to ABC.Earlier on Sunday, Hakeem Jeffries, House minority leader and New York Democratic congressman, saidDonald Trumphas “manufactured a crisis” to justify sending federalized national guard troopsinto Chicagonext, over the heads of local leaders.Jeffries, appearing on CNN’s State of the Union, accused the US president of “playing games with the lives of Americans” with his unprecedented domestic deployment of the military, which has escalated to include thearming of troopscurrently patrolling Washington, DC – aftersendingtroops into Los Angeles in June.The mayor of Chicago, Brandon Johnson, said any such plan from Trump was perpetrating “the most flagrant violation of our constitution in the 21st century”.Late on Friday, Pentagon officials confirmed to Fox News that up to 1,700 men and women of the national guardwere poisedto mobilize in 19 mostly Republican states to support Trump’santi-immigration crackdownby assisting the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (Ice) with “logistical support and clerical functions”.Trump targets Chicago and New York as Hegseth orders weapons for DC troopsRead moreJeffries said he supported astatementissued by the Democratic governor of Illinois, JB Pritzker, that Trump was “abusing his power” in talking about sending the national guard to Chicago, and distracting from the pain he said the president was causing American families.The national guard isnormally underthe authority of the individual states, deployed at the request of the state governor and only federalized – or deployed by the federal government – in a national emergency and at the request of a governor.Jeffries said in an interview with CNN on Sunday morning: “We should continue to support local law enforcement and not simply allowDonald Trumpto play games with the lives of the American people as part of his effort to manufacture a crisis and create a distraction because he’s deeply unpopular.”He continued: “I strongly support the statement that was issued by Governor Pritzker making clear that there’s no basis, no authority for Donald Trump to potentially try to drop federal troops into the city of Chicago.”The White House has been working on plans to send national guard to Chicago, the third largest US city, dominated by Democratic voters in a Democratic state, to take a hard line on crime, homelessness and immigrants, theWashington Post reported.View image in fullscreenHakeem Jeffries speaks during a news conference in Washington DC on 1 July.Photograph: Mariam Zuhaib/APPritzker issued astatementon Saturday night that began: “The State of Illinois at this time has received no requests or outreach from the federal government asking if we need assistance, and we have made no requests for federal intervention.”Trump has argued that a military crackdown was necessary in the nation’s capital, and elsewhere, to quell what he said were out of control levels of crime, even though statistics show that serious and violent crime in Washington, and many other American cities,has actually plummeted.Talking to reporters in the Oval Office on Friday the president insisted that “the people in Chicago are screaming for us to come” as he laid out his plan to send troops there, and that they would later “help with New York”.“When ready, we will start in Chicago … Chicago is a mess,” Trump said.Johnson, in an appearance on Sunday on MSNBC, said shootings had dropped by almost 40% in his city in the last year alone, and he and Pritzker said any plan by the White House to override local authority and deploy troopswould be illegal.“The president has repeated this petulant presentation since he assumed office. What he is proposing at this point would be the most flagrant violation of our constitution in the 21st century,” Johnson said.Californiasued the federalgovernment when it deployed national guard and US marines to parts of Los Angeles in June overprotestsagainstIce raids, but a court refused to block the troops.Main target cities mentioned by Trump are not only majority Democratic in their voting but also run by Black mayors, includingWashington, DC, Chicago, New York,Baltimore, Los Angeles and Oakland.Trump visits DC police station and boasts of success of crime crackdownRead moreRahm Emanuel, a Democratic former Illinois congressman, chief of staff to former president Barack Obama, and a former mayor of Chicago, also appeared on CNN on Sunday urging people to reflect that Trump, in two terms of office, had only ever deployed US troops in American cities, never overseas.Emanuel said if he was still mayor he would call on the president to act like a partner and, although crime was coming down, to “work with us on public safety” to combat carjackings, gun crime and gangs and not “come in and act like we can be an occupied city”.He added about Trump’s agenda: “He gave his speech in Iowa, he said ‘I hate’ Democrats, and this may be a reflection of that.” Thespeech was in July, when Trump excoriated Democrats in Congress who refused to vote for his One Big Beautiful Bill, the flagshiplegislationof the second Trump administration so farthat focuses ontax cuts for the wealthy, massive boosts for the anti-immigrationagendaand benefits cuts to programs such as Medicaid, which provides health insurance for poor Americans.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationHakeem JeffriesUS politicsUS militaryChicagoDonald TrumpDemocratsnewsShareReuse this content"

That, what we think of as this precious great film music is … we’re remembering it in some kind of nostalgic way …“Just the idea that film music has the same place in the concert hall as the best music in the canon is a mistaken notion, I think.”He added: “A lot of [film music] is ephemeral. It’s certainly fragmentary and, until somebody reconstructs it, it isn’t anything that we can even consider as a concert piece.”Among the more than 100 movies he has scored are the Indiana Jones films, ET, Schindler’s List and the first three Harry Potter films.He is the world’s most nominated living Oscar recipient, with a record 54 nominations, recognising that his music has played a crucial role in enhancing and heightening a film’s emotion and atmosphere.With two haunting notes, he captured the chilling threat of the Great White Shark in Jaws, while his mournful Jewish lament in Steven Spielberg’s Schindler’s List conveyed the heartbreak of the Holocaust.View image in fullscreenWilliams conducting a concert in Washington DC in 2023.Photograph: Shannon Finney/Getty ImagesHe was interviewed by Tim Greiving for a biography,John Williams: A Composer’s Life, to be published by Oxford University Press in September.Greiving was taken aback by Williams’s dismissal of film music: “His comments are sort of shocking, and they are not false modesty. He is genuinely self-deprecating, and deprecating of ‘film music’ in general.”He said Williams referred to his film-scoring assignments, including the high-profile and much-lauded ones, as “just a job”. He added: “But I also don’t think we should necessarily take his words at face value. He clearly took the job of composing music for films as seriously as anyone in history ever has.“He has this internalised prejudice against film music. It’s a functional type of music, which is funny because I consider his film music to be kind of sublime art at its best. That’s not modesty. He’s just saying it’s a lesser art form. Typically that is true, though. It is written much quicker and much more economically. But I do think his music defies that. He perfected the art of film scoring. He took it to its greatest heights. He elevated film music to a high art form.”Despite the acclaim, Williams is self-critical, telling Greiving: “If I had it all to do over again, I would have made a cleaner job of it – of having the film music and the concert music all being more me, whatever that is, or more unified in some way. But none of it ever happened that way. The film thing was a job to do, or an opportunity to accept.”In the book, he also talks about working with Spielberg, for whom he scored Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Saving Private Ryan, among other movies.Williams was frustrated early in his career by directors who did not understand music, a typical complaint among film composers.With Spielberg, he has had a “very special collaboration”, he said. “He’s more … musically educated than most of the directors that I’ve worked with. He grew up with his mother who played … Clementi and Bach and Chopin and so on. And she took him to concerts … He played a little clarinet. And he is very musical.”Away from film, Williams has composed dozens of concerti, fanfare and other concert works. He was music director of the Boston Pops for more than a decade, inspiring countless children to pursue a career in the orchestra and winning the respect of the classical community worldwide, Greiving said.Williams has personally approved a new concert performance of his most famous scores, includingStar Warsand Schindler’s List.TitledJohn Williams Reimaginedand featuring new arrangements for flute, cello and piano, it will take place at Cadogan Hall in London on 27 October, with an accompanying album.Williams said: “Pianist Simone Pedroni, flutist Sara Andon and cellist Cécilia Tsan have enhanced and elevated my music and that brings me great joy.”Explore more on these topicsJohn WilliamsSteven SpielbergJawsStar WarsSchindler's ListnewsShareReuse this content"

Would they ever find a safe space?Arundhati RoySun 24 Aug 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 24 Aug 2025 07.53 EDTShareAteacher was what my mother had always wanted to be, what she was qualified to be. During the years she was married and living with our father, who had a job as an assistant manager on a remote tea estate in Assam, the dream of pursuing a career of any kind atrophied and fell away. It was rekindled (as nightmare more than dream) when she realised that her husband, like many young men who worked on lonely tea estates, was hopelessly addicted to alcohol.When war broke out betweenIndiaand China in October 1962, women and children were evacuated from border districts. We moved to Calcutta. Once we got there, my mother decided that she would not return to Assam. From Calcutta we travelled across the country, all the way south to Ootacamund – Ooty – a small hill station in the state of Tamil Nadu. My brother, LKC – Lalith Kumar Christopher Roy – was four and a half years old, and I was a month away from my third birthday. We did not see or hear from our father again until we were in our 20s.In Ooty we lived in one half of a “holiday” cottage that belonged to our maternal grandfather, who had retired as a senior government servant – an Imperial Entomologist – with the British government in Delhi. He and my grandmother were estranged. He had severed links with her and his children years ago. He died the year I was born.I don’t know how we got into that cottage. Maybe the tenant who lived in the other half had a key. Maybe we broke in. The cottage was dank and gloomy with cold, cracked cement floors and an asbestos ceiling. A plywood partition separated our half from rooms occupied by the tenant. She was an old English lady called Mrs Patmore. She wore her hair in a high, puffy style, which made us wonder what was hidden inside it. Wasps, we thought, my brother and I. At night she had bad dreams and would scream and moan. I’m not sure if she paid any rent. She might not have known who to pay it to. We, certainly, paid no rent. We were squatters, interlopers – not tenants. We lived like fugitives amid huge wooden trunks packed full of the dead Imperial Entomologist’s opulent clothes – silk ties, dress shirts, three-piece suits.I remember my mother, my brother and me holding hands, running through the town in panic, trying to find a lawyerWe found an old biscuit tin full of cufflinks. Later, when my brother and I were old enough to understand, we would be told the legendary family stories about him: about his vanity (he had a portrait of himself taken in a Hollywood photo studio) and his violence (he whipped his children, turned them out of the house regularly, and split my grandmother’s scalp open with a brass vase). It was to get away from him, our mother told us, that she married the first man who proposed to her.Quite soon after we arrived, she got a teaching job at a local school called Breeks. Ooty was, at the time, swarming with schools, some of them run by British missionaries who had chosen to stay on in India after independence. She became friends with a group of them who taught at an all-white school called Lushington, which catered to the children of British missionaries working in India. She managed to persuade them to let her sit in on their classes when she had time off from her job. She hungrily absorbed their innovative teaching methods while being simultaneously disturbed by their kindly, well-meaning racism towards Indians and India.A few months into our fugitive life, my grandmother (the Entomologist’s widow) and her oldest son – my mother’s older brother, G Isaac – arrived from Kerala to evict us. I hadn’t seen either of them before. They told my mother that under the Travancore Christian Succession Act, daughters had no right to their father’s property and that we were to leave the house immediately.View image in fullscreenRoy in 1963 in Ootacamund, with her mother and brother.Photograph: courtesy of Arundhati RoyIt didn’t seem to matter to them that we had nowhere to go. My grandmother didn’t say much, but she scared me. She had conical corneas and wore opaque sunglasses. I remember my mother, my brother and me holding hands, running through the town in panic, trying to find a lawyer. In my memory it was night and the streets were dark. But it couldn’t have been. Because we did manage to find a lawyer, who told us that the Travancore act applied only in the state of Kerala, not Tamil Nadu, and that even squatters had rights. He said if anyone tried to evict us, we could call the police. We returned to the cottage shaking but triumphant.Our uncle G Isaac could not have known then that, by trying to evict his younger sister from their father’s cottage, he was laying the ground for his own downfall. It would be years before my mother had the means and the standing to challenge the Travancore Christian Succession Act and demand an equal share of her father’s property in Kerala. Until then, she would shield and safeguard this memory of her mortification as though it were a precious family heirloom, which, in a way, it was.After our legal coup we expanded into the cottage, made ourselves some space. My mother gave away the Imperial Entomologist’s suits and cufflinks to taxi drivers at the taxi stand near the market, and for a while Ooty had the best-dressed taxi drivers in the world.Despite our hard-won but still tentative sense of security, things didn’t go our way. The cold, wet climate in Ooty aggravated my mother’s asthma. She would lie under a thick metallic-pink quilt on a high iron cot, breathing great, heaving breaths, bedridden for days on end. We thought she was going to die. She didn’t like us standing around staring at her and would order us out of her room. So my brother and I would go off to find something else to stare at.Mostly, we swung on the low, rickety gate at the corner of the triangular compound, watching newlywed couples on their honeymoon holding hands and walking past our home on their way to romance each other in Ooty’s famous botanical gardens. Sometimes they stopped and talked to us. They gave us sweets and peanuts. A man gave us a catapult. We spent days perfecting our aim. We made friends with strangers. Once, one of them grabbed my hand and marched me back into the house. He told my mother sternly that her daughter had chickenpox. He made me show her the blister on my stomach, which I had been showing off to anybody who cared to examine it. My mother was furious. After he left, she smacked me hard on my cheek and told me I was never to lift my dress and show my stomach to strangers. Especially men.It could have been her illness or the medication, but she became extremely bad-tempered and began to hit us often. When she did this my brother would run away and only come home after dark. He was a quiet boy. He never cried. When he was upset he would put his head down on the dining table and pretend to be asleep. When he was happy, which wasn’t often, he would dance around me boxing the air, saying he was Cassius Clay. I don’t know how he knew who Cassius Clay was; I didn’t. Maybe our father told him. I think those years in Ooty were harder for him than for me because he remembered things. He remembered a better life. He remembered our father and the big house we had lived in on the tea estate. He remembered being loved. Fortunately, I didn’t.It was Kurussammal who taught us what love was. What dependability was. What being hugged wasView image in fullscreenMy brother started school before me. He went to Lushington, the white-people’s school, for a few months. (It must have been a favour to my mother from the missionaries.) But when he began to call local children like ourselves “those Indian children” she pulled him out and enrolled him in Breeks, the school that she taught in.On days when her asthma was really bad, my mother would write out a shopping list of vegetables and provisions, put it into a basket and send us into town with it. Ooty was a safe, small town then, with little traffic. The policemen knew us. The shopkeepers were always kind and sometimes even gave us credit. The kindest of them all was a lady called Kurussammal, who worked in the Knitting Shop. She knitted two polo‑neck sweaters for us. Bottle-green for my brother. Plum for me.When my mother became completely bedridden for a few weeks, Kurussammal moved in with us. Our edgy lifestyle came to an end. It was Kurussammal who taught us what love was. What dependability was. What being hugged was. She would cook for us and bathe us outdoors in the bitter Ooty cold with water she boiled in a huge pot on a wood fire. To this day, my brother and I need to be almost boiled to feel properly bathed.Before she bathed us, she combed the lice out of our hair and showed us how to kill them. I loved killing them. They made a satisfying sound when I squashed them with my thumbnail. Apart from being a lightning-quick knitter, Kurussammal was a superb cook. She specialised in producing food from almost no ingredients. Even boiled rice with salt and a fresh green chilli tasted good when she put it on our plates. Kurussammal’s name meant “mother of the cross” in Tamil. Her husband was Yesuratnam (“Jesus jewel”, “jewel of jewels”). He had a goitre on his neck that he hid with his woollen muffler. He, like us, always smelled of wood smoke.Eventually my mother grew too sick to hold down her job. Even the steroids she was on didn’t help. We ran out of money. My brother and I grew undernourished and developed primary tuberculosis. After a few more grim months of fighting on all fronts, my mother gave up. She decided to swallow her pride and return to Kerala, to Ayemenem, our grandmother’s village. She was out of options.As our train crossed the border from Tamil Nadu into Kerala, the land turned from brown to green. Everything, including the electric poles, was smothered with plants and creepers. Everything glistened. Almost all the people who slid past the train window, both men and women, wore white and carried black umbrellas.My heart sang.And then sank.View image in fullscreenAs soon as the shouting began, I would flee. The river was my refuge. It made up for everything that was wrong in my lifeWe arrived in Ayemenem uninvited and manifestly unwelcome. The house whose doorstep we appeared on with our invisible begging bowl belonged to my grandmother’s older sister, Miss Kurien. She would have been in her 60s then. Her thin, wavy grey hair was cut in a style that used to be called a pageboy. She wore starched, papery saris with big, loose blouses. Miss Kurien was far ahead of most women of her time. She was single, held a master’s degree in English literature and had taught at a college in Sri Lanka (then Ceylon).My mother assured her that we would stay only as long as it took for her to find a job. Miss Kurien, who prided herself on being a good Christian, agreed to let us stay, but made no effort to hide her disapproval of us and our situation. She did this by ignoring us and showering her delicate affections on other relatives’ children who visited her. She gave them gifts, played her piano and sang to them in her quavering voice. Even though she made it clear that she did not like us (which made us not like her), she was the one person who helped us out and gave us a roof over our heads when we most needed it.My grandmother lived with her, too. She was almost blind by then and still wore her dark glasses. Even at night. She had a ridge that ran across her scalp – her famous brass-vase scar. Sometimes she let me run my finger over it. Every evening she would sit on the veranda and play her violin. She had taken music lessons when her Imperial Entomologist husband was posted to Vienna. When her tutor told him that his wife had the potential to become a concert-class violinist, he stopped the lessons and, in a fit of jealous rage, smashed the first violin she owned.I was too young to tell how well she played, but as darkness fell in Ayemenem and the sound of crickets swelled, her music made the evenings and the very dark nights more melancholic than they already were.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

At first, I was terrified of him. I only knew him as the tall, fat, angry man who had tried to turn us out of our home in Ooty. In Ayemenem, though, I grew to love him after he began to take my brother and me down to the river and teach me to swim. G Isaac was one of India’s first Rhodes scholars. His subject was Greek and Roman mythology. At the dining table he would suddenly say things like: “Isn’t it wonderful to have a god of wine and ecstasy?” Everybody would look at him blankly. And he would tell us about Dionysus, or whoever his god of the day was.After teaching for a few years in a college in Madras, he gave up his academic career to return to his roots and start a pickle, jam and curry powder factory with his mother. It was called Malabar Coast Products. They ran it out of the Imperial Entomologist’s family home in Kottayam town, which was a short bus ride away. (This was the house that would become the centre of the dispute when my mother challenged the Travancore Christian Succession Act.) G Isaac, notwithstanding his keen interest in inheritance and private property, was a Marxist. He said he had given up his career to start a factory to promote small industry and generate local employment. Fed up with his nonsense, his Swedish wife, Cecilia, whom he had met in Oxford, left him and returned to Sweden with their three young sons. In these strange and manifold ways, this constellation of extraordinary, eccentric, cosmopolitan people, defeated by life, converged on the tiny village of Ayemenem.Life there was like living on a ledge that we could be nudged off at any moment. Even Kochu Maria, the cook, would tell me that we had no right to be living there. She would mutter and grumble about the shamefulness of having fatherless children living under the same roof as decent people. Every few days the Cosmopolitans would quarrel. When they fought, the whole house shook. Plates would be smashed; doors broken down.View image in fullscreenI found it impossible to gauge what would anger my mother and what would please herAs soon as the shouting began, I would flee. The river was my refuge. It made up for everything that was wrong in my life. I spent hours on its banks and came to be on intimate, first-name terms with the fish, the worms, the birds and the plants. I became close friends with other children (and some adults) in the village. I picked up Malayalam quickly and was soon able to communicate with everybody quite easily. They inhabited a different universe from mine. Most of them worked in nearby paddy fields and rubber plantations, or picking coconuts or working as house-help. They lived in mud-and- thatch-roofed houses. Many of them belonged to castes that were considered “untouchable”. I didn’t know much about this horror at the time, because everybody in the Ayemenem house was too busy fighting with one another to bother about indoctrinating me.One young man who lived in Ayemenem but worked in Kottayam in Malabar Coast Products became my most beloved friend. We spent a lot of time together. He made me a fishing rod out of a culm of bamboo and showed me where to find the best earthworms to use as bait. He taught me to fish; he taught me to stay still and be quiet. He fried the tiny fish I caught, and we ate them together as though we were feasting at a banquet. He was the inspiration for the character called Velutha, Ammu’s lover, inThe God of Small Things.Within months of being in Ayemenem, I turned into a part of its landscape – a wild child with calloused feet who knew every hidden path and shortcut in the village that led to the river. I lived outdoors and went home as seldom as possible. In the non-human category, my closest companion was a striped palm squirrel who lived on my shoulder and whispered in my ear. We shared secrets. She wasn’t my pet. She had her own life, but chose to share it with me. She would disappear often because she had things to do. At mealtimes she would appear, perch on my plate and nibble at my food. She was constantly watchful, eternally alert to every possibility of looming danger. She taught me things.My mother unloaded the burden of her quarrels and the daily dose of indignity that she had to endure on to my brother and me. We were the only safe harbour she had. Her temper, already bad, became irrational and uncontrollable. I found it impossible to predict or gauge what would anger her and what would please her. I had to pick my way through that minefield without a map. When she got angry with me, she would mimic my way of speaking. She was a good mimic and made me sound ridiculous to myself. I clearly remember everything about every instance she did that. Even what I was wearing. It felt as though she had cut me out – cut my shape out – of a picture book with a sharp pair of scissors and then torn me up.The first time it happened was on our way home from Madras, where we had been for two weeks. Her older sister, Mrs Joseph, had asked if my mother could look after her three children while she and her husband were away on holiday. My mother agreed. She must have felt that she would – at least nominally – be earning her keep while she was there.View image in fullscreenA cold, furry moth on a frightened heart. That moth was my constant companionUnlike the quarrelsome Ayemenem Cosmopolitans, Mrs Joseph had a proper husband, who was a pilot for Indian Airlines; proper children; and a proper house with servants. Mrs Joseph was acutely conscious of the fact that in these matters she had succeeded where her siblings had failed. She was good-looking, with a high, smug voice that matched her starched, ironed saris and her neat hairstyle. She had a tight, knowing smile and always sounded as though she were confiding in the person she was talking to. There was no resemblance at all, neither physical nor temperamental, between her and my mother.When Mrs Joseph came back from her holiday, the sisters had a terrible spat about something. We returned to Kerala the next day by plane. My aunt’s pilot husband had a quota of free tickets. We hadn’t been in a plane before. Once we were seated, intending to conduct a reasonable, adult conversation as should be conducted by co-passengers on an airplane, I asked my mother how, if Mrs Joseph was her real sister, was Mrs Joseph so thin?My mother turned on me in a rage. I felt myself shrinking from my own skin and draining away, swirling like water down a sink until I was gone. Then she said: “By the time you are my age you’ll be three times my size.” I knew I had said something terrible, but I wasn’t sure what. (I was too young for “fat” and “thin” to be value judgments.) It was only years later, when I managed to think about it clearly without dwelling on my own feelings, that I finally realised how hurtful what I said must have been.The steroids my mother was on had made her suddenly gain weight. She had developed a typical cortisone moon-face. Her striking, fine-featured face had disappeared behind puffy cheeks and a double chin. She must have been feeling forlorn and hopeless after her visit to her slimmer sister’s perfect home. Her triumphant career was still ahead of her, but there was no sign of it then.My question to my mother about her thin sister would have felt like vinegar on an open wound. Careless words from a careless child. So she turned on me and mimicked my six-year-old’s way of speaking. And I turned on myself. I remember the colour of my dress. Sky-blue with polka dots. A perfect hand-me-down from my perfect cousin with straight hair and big doe eyes. I saw that the dress didn’t match my knees, which were full of scars and cuts – a comprehensive logbook of my wild, imperfect, fatherless, pilotless life on the banks of the Meenachil River in Ayemenem.I staged an imaginary competition with my perfect cousin, which I won hands down. She had a pilot father. And lovely hair. But I had a green river. (With fish in it, with the sky and trees in it and at night the broken yellow moon in it.) And a squirrel. I looked at my feet and saw that they didn’t belong in the sandals they wore.It was a horrible plane full of horrible people in a horrible sky. I wanted it to crash and for all of us to die. I especially hated the spoiled children with doting parents. But in a while my mother said: “I’m your mother and your father and I love you double.”And then the plane was all right. The sky was all right. But my feet were still strangers to the sandals they wore. And there were still some unresolved issues.If I was going to be three times her size, I would need three seats to sit on. So, three free tickets. Double. Triple. A maths class. A sum to solve. What is double-love divided by triple-my-size multiplied by free tickets divided by careless words? A cold, furry moth on a frightened heart. That moth was my constant companion.I learned early that the safest place can be the most dangerous. And that even when it isn’t, I make it so.This is an edited extract from Mother Mary Comes to Me by Arundhati Roy, published by Hamish Hamilton at £20.To support the Guardian buy a copy atguardianbookshop.com.

In June, heshut down New York’s Times Squarewith a set to announce his new album, Same Day Cleaning, followed by headlining his first North American stadium show. “It didn’t feel real, I was freaking out,” says Virji, still in disbelief.Also real:the tens of thousands singing alongas he spliced the dreamy intro of Radiohead’s Everything in Its Right Place with his 2023 trackIf U Need Itat this year’s Coachella. The 28-year-old from the market town of Witney, Oxfordshire, made his debut on the California festival’s second-largest stage in April. It was “the most nervous I’ve ever been,” says Virji, on a phone call from LA ahead of another festival set, “but I converted that into excitement and I was able to enjoy myself.”View image in fullscreenEnjoying himself … at Lollapalooza in Chicago this month.Photograph: Josh Brasted/FilmMagicThis bashful bass star has the demeanour of a nice young chap who is just genuinely gassed to be up there, giving massive grins and thumbs ups during his sets as if he almost can’t believe his luck. “I often don’t say what my aspirations are out loud because then it treats [music] like a business,” he says. “I’ve gone past what I always wanted to achieve – the most unachievable thing to me was doinga tunewith [bassline star] Flava D. And then the next most unbelievable thing would be getting in the studio with Skrillex, and then that happened. The whole thing’s very surreal.”In the past two years, he’s become dance music’s next golden boy off the back of a viral setat DJ Mag’s HQ, setting off the office fire alarm with a selection that called back to the2010s heyday of UK bass. But beyond the meme-able catchphrases (“it’s Virji, isn’t it”) and technical mastery, he’s most renowned for his well-crafted arsenal of self-made bangers. “Sammy’s tracks are an amazing hybrid of massively heavy-sounding but also catchy, joyous and fun to dance to,” says Dan Snaith, AKA Caribou/Daphni, who often deploys Virji’s big-hitters in his DJ sets, as do fellow dance A-listers Four Tet and Fred Again. “He has a kind of alchemy that makes his tracks bigger and bolder than anyone else’s.”Virji casts himself as “definitely a producer before I’m a DJ”, spot-welding the swinging drums and chopped-up vocal samples found in the UK garage of the mid-90s onwards to the four-to-the-floor rhythm of itsbassline sub-genre, which originated in West Yorkshire and the Midlands. Add in the melodiousness of house music, the cheeky womps of dubstep, the gruff superstyling of a soundsystem MC, elements of grime and speed it all up: you’ve got a formula for bridging the UK club underground with American EDM.Virji’s father Fayyaz is a trombonist who played on The Miseducation of Lauryn HillVirji has spent years perfecting his sound. Early on, Virji’s father Fayyaz – a trombonist who played onThe Miseducation of Lauryn Hill– introduced his son to production software Logic and Virji started off making “bad dubstep”, an attempt to emulatethe classic Rinse compilationshe discovered in primary school. By his teenage years, he had gravitated towards bassline, in thrall to Flava D, DJ Q and Dr Cryptic. With his 2020 debut album, Spice Up My Life, Virji cemented his transition to garage, and he’s released an impressive number of tracks since, such as 2023 masterpiece Shella Verse.There’s a certain irony to his music finding an audience in the US when the original UKG never did. “There seems to be a huge crowd ready to experience UK garage and bassline for the first time,” says Kieran Hebden, AKA Four Tet. “[It’s] the perfect next thing for the tech house and EDM fans.” Virji politely wonders whether it’s because his sound offers “a breath of fresh air” at festivals full of house and EDM, but it could also be the brightly lit positivity of his productions. “Optimism is very important, especially now,” Virji says.Hebden sees Virji’s real strength as “his musicality, taste and production skills – it’s not like he just picked the right genre and won. The clever stuff is in the sonics, melodies, dynamics, arrangements. He could be doing techno, jungle [or] psytrance and it would probably still be good. It’s exciting to have another UK producer cut through everything and make it all feel alive.”On Same Day Cleaning, Virji collaborates with UK rap royalty Giggs and Skepta, and Virji was fascinated by the latter MC’s creative process for their track Cops and Robbers. “He created the mood, put a UKG documentary on mute,” says Virji. “We must have sat there for half an hour with the beat on repeat, no one saying anything, until he goes, ‘OK, I’m ready to record.’ He hadn’t written anything down, he had it all in his head.”Virji also links up with UK garage pioneers of old, namely MJ Cole and returning duo Tuff Jam. “So many people don’t know how important these legends are,” says Virji. “As much as my role is about having fun and making people dance, it’s pointless doing it unless you’re helping to give them some history.”But while he recently released a 90s-trance-laced summer smash called Nostalgia, Virji would rather focus on what’s new. “There’s so many things that get recycled, everything’s trying to sound old,” he notes. “But if you can make something original that’s going to be used in the future,that’spretty cool.”Same Day Cleaning is released via Capitol on 19 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsDance musicElectronic musicClub cultureinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Was ‘Baroness Eloise,’ Known as ‘Crazy Panties,’ Who Ruled the Island With a Gun and Love, Murdered by One of Her Love Slaves After She Had Driven the Other to His Death? And Why is Frau Ritter Going Back to What She Once Called ‘Hell’s Volcano?’ – the Mystery of the Galapagos Island Which Germany Covets, to Be Solved At Last?”This florid passage from a tabloid newspaper caught the eye of the authorAbbott Kahlerdecades after it was published in 1941.“Basically it was the equivalent of a record scratch,” she recalls. “I was thinking: what the hell is the story?”The answer revolves around a group of Europeans from the 1930s who attempted to start anew on the remote island of Floreana, only to encounter the human frailties they hoped to escape: chaos, blackmail, betrayal, disappearances and murder. The enduring mystery of what exactly happened is known as “the Galápagos Affair”.Eden review – Ron Howard’s nasty, starry survival thriller falls over the edgeRead moreKahler became so obsessed that she wrote a book about it calledEden Undone. And she is not alone.Ron Howard, the Oscar-winning film director, learned about the story when he saw some photos at a museum in the Galápagos. This led him to makeEden, a movie starring Jude Law, Ana de Armas, Sydney Sweeney and Vanessa Kirby released on Friday.Kahler understands the Hollywood potential.“I’ve made a career of writing about stranger-than-fiction true stories and this is by far the strangest one I’ve ever come across,” she adds. “Just aside from the incredible cast of characters, it has timeless themes that still resonate today.”Indeed, Howard’s film opens with the blunt statement: “Fascism is spreading.” Germany between the wars faced mass poverty, social unrest and extremism that gave rise to the Nazi party. Some people looked for a way out and a new way of living free from societal constraints.TheGalápagos Islandsoff the coast of Ecuador, famed for scientist Charles Darwin’s expedition, were thought of as the last great unspoiled territory. Floreana, however, is not everyone’s idea of paradise. It is arid, rough and rugged and had historically served as a stopping point for pirates collecting tortoises for food.A German doctor called Friedrich Ritter left his wife and travelled to Floreana with a married woman, Dore Strauch. The austere, misanthropic Ritter was driven by Nietzschean ideals and a desire to escape civilisation and come up with a radical philosophy to save humanity from itself.Ritter was a strict vegetarian and extracted all his teeth and replaced them with steel dentures before leaving. He showed little sympathy to Strauch, his former patient, who was suffering from multiple sclerosis.A visiting US scientific party were fascinated by this “modern day Adam and Eve” and effectively publicised their lives for the press back home, attracting more utopia-seekers such as Heinz Wittmer, a veteran of the first world war, with his second wife Margret and young son. Margret was pregnant and gave birth to the first child officially born on the island.Tensions between the two families were further exacerbated when Eloise Bosquet de Wagner Wehrhorn, an adventuress who called herself the Baroness, arrived with her two lovers, Rudolf Lorenz and Robert Phillipson. The Baroness’s flamboyant lifestyle, declarations of being “empress of Floreana” and plans for a luxury hotel directly clashed with the other settlers’ visions.View image in fullscreenAna de Armas in Eden.Photograph: Jasin Boland / VerticalKahler says: “She shows up on Floreana in 1932 and immediately starts making enemies. The first thing she does is go to Heinz and Margret Wittmer’s home – they were pretty much the only truly stable people there – and wash her feet in their drinking water. That’s strike one.“Then she announces that she’s going to turn Floreana into the next Miami: she’s going to build a lavish hotel that’s going to cater to millionaires around the world. All of these other people who had gone there wanted solitude and to be away from civilisation and here she was directly saying that her goal is the opposite and she wants as many visitors as possible. She made it very clear that she felt the island was hers to do whatever she wanted to do with.”It’s people left to their own devices away from the rules of civilisation … What kind of lawlessness do they concoct?Abbott Kahler, author of Eden UndoneThe Baroness’s hedonism was jarringly at odds with Ritter’s asceticism. Kahler writes how the Baroness wielded a riding crop and pearl-handled revolver, staged fights between her lovers and had sex with American tourists. “She pretty much seduced anybody she could. One visitor called her hotel, the Hacienda Paradiso, a ‘festering sex complex’.”The remote and harsh environment of Floreana intensified the inherent tensions. Food scarcity and the constant struggle for survival amplified mistrust. The community descended into jealousy and animosity. Ritter became increasingly autocratic and the Wittmers struggled to survive amid the discord.Kahler observes:“It’s people left to their own devices away from the rules of civilisation. What kind of rules will they concoct? Or what kind of lawlessness do they concoct?”In March 1934 the Baroness and Phillipson mysteriously vanished. While the Wittmers claimed they left for Tahiti, no evidence of their departure or arrival was ever found, leading to strong suspicions of foul play.Lorenz, now isolated and fearful, fled Floreana. His decomposed body was found on a nearby deserted island months later, adding another layer to the mystery. Not long after, Ritter died from eating spoiled potted meat, despite his professed vegetarianism. Rumours circulated that Strauch had poisoned him.View image in fullscreenVanessa Kirby in Eden.Photograph: Jasin Boland / VerticalKahler comments: “Two people end up missing and two people end up dead.This is why it reminded me of the Agatha Christie novelAnd Then There Were None. A bunch of people show up on a remote island and not everybody makes it out alive.”The lack of definitive proof and conflicting accounts from memoirs by Strauch and Wittmer fuelled the mystery. Strauch returned to Germany, where she died from complications from multiple sclerosis in 1943. Margret Wittmer remained on Floreana until her death in 2000 at the age of 96; her descendants still run a small hotel on the island.When you get a bunch of people together whose visions of utopia clash, what happens?Abbott KahlerFor Kahler, the Galápagos affair taps into a universal human yearning to get off the grid, even if it turned into a grownup version of Lord of the Flies.“Everybody is always dreaming of escaping the drudgery and stress of their daily lives and going somewhere fresh where nobody knows their name and they can leave their problems behind and fashion a brand new utopia for themselves.“Of course, plenty of examples in history suggest that’s not possible. Wherever you go, there you are – that old adage certainly was true of those settlers in this story. Everybody has a different idea of what utopia is or might be and, when you get a bunch of people together whose visions of utopia clash, what happens? That’s also something that we see time and again throughout history. I’m not surprised it attracted Hollywood.”The screenplay for Eden was written by Noah Pink, who has previously tackled subjects such as the gameTetris’s unlikely journeyfrom the Soviet Union to global hit. He was introduced to the story by Howard in 2019 and became intrigued by the idea of three factions fleeing Europe with three very different philosophies.Pink says via Zoom from Toronto, Canada: “I’m boiling it down: Dr Ritter, the purpose of life is pain; Baroness, the purpose of life is pleasure; and the Wittmers, the purpose of life is family. Very simple and when you watch those three philosophies collide, that’s where the fun happens.”View image in fullscreenThe Floreana coastline.Photograph: Rory Stansbury/Global Wildlife ConservationWhat does he hope audiences will take away from the film? “One is the importance of sticking by your loved ones and, whether that’s chosen family or family, especially in these times when things are seemingly very dark around us, we need to stick together and stick to our community and help each other out.“It’s also that running away is not the answer because you cannot run away from yourself. If we want to fix things, we have to stay and we have to fix things.”The intrigue of Floreana also inspired a 2013 documentary,The Galapagos Affair: Satan Came to Eden, directed byDan Geller and Dayna Goldfine. Goldfine says they were particularly drawn to the “vibrant characters” and the “underlying theme of trying to escape oneself and escape civilisation only to bring your own baggage with you”.She continues: “It was that perennial humanity’s thirst for paradise and the philosophical issues around it, this notion of what if you actually do follow through on the dream to go off into the sunset and on whatever some paradise island and you get there and other people arrive with their own different notions of paradise.”Eden is out in US cinemas now and in the UK and Australia soonExplore more on these topicsFilmRon HowardJude LawSydney SweeneyDrama filmsThrillersVanessa KirbyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The two tracks released so far, She Explains Things To Me and Everybody Laughs, have proved to be sweetly sunny and driven by acoustic guitar. The accompanying tour – due to reach Europe next year – will apparently “blend visual art, storytelling and music into one compelling live performance”.Released 5 SeptemberSaint Etienne – InternationalSaint Etienne have been an endlessly fascinating fixture on the leftfield of pop for 25 years, spawning everything from Top 10 singles to documentaries about the Lea Valley and the South Bank. Their most recent albums I’ve Been Trying To Tell You and The Night have delved into concept-driven ambient experimental territory with hugely rewarding results, but International is to betheir final release. Something of the breadth of their approach is revealed by the list of collaborators, which stretches from DJ Erol Alkan to 80s heart-throb Nick Heyward.Released 5 SeptemberJade – That’s Showbiz BabyView image in fullscreen‘Eagerly awaited’ … Jade.Photograph: Stephanie Sian Smith/The GuardianJade Thirlwall’s former band Little Mix made a clutch of great hits but nothing that could prepare you for the deeply idiosyncratic charms of Thirwall’s tempo-shifting Puppet On a String-sampling Angel of My Dreams. If subsequent releases haven’t quite bent the rules in such a striking manner, then they’ve certainly been of an impressively high quality, pushing her debut solo album into the “eagerly awaited” category.Released 12 SeptemberSelf EsteemRebecca Taylor’s third album as Self Esteem,A Complicated Woman, didn’t propel her into pop’s big league in the way some people expected, but no matter. The high-concept, tightly choreographed live shows she’s thus far performed around it – in a West End theatre shortly before its release and at a packed-out Park stage at Glastonbury shortly after – were rapturously received and understandably so: a sometime actor, Taylor has a keen sense of theatricality, but she’s also a straightforwardly commanding, hugely engaging performer.Tour begins 15 September, 02 Academy BirminghamCardi B – Am I the Drama?The follow-up to a debut album that came out in 2018 – the rapper has been concentrating on motherhood in the intervening period – Am I the Drama? has been so long in the pipeline that at least one of the singles confirmed as part of the tracklisting, the chart-topping, controversy-generating Megan Thee Stallion collaboration WAP, isfive years old.

Its contents were frequently gorgeous – blissful single Sweetie is a hot afternoon in musical form – but when playing live, the band really come into their own: the danceability is amped up, the fluid virtuosity of the musicianship becomes even more evident.Tour begins 19 September, Leeds Project HouseRobert Plant – Saving GraceRobert Plant’s “new” band – formed with musicians local to his home on the Welsh borders – first debuted six years ago with a handful of small UK gigs at which they performed an intriguing range of covers and a couple of Led Zeppelin classics. A similar approach informs their debut album, intermittently recorded over six years, with the admirably eclectic Plant and co essaying tracks by everyone from Memphis Minnie to Moby Grape to Low.Released 26 SeptemberLady GagaView image in fullscreen‘A theatrical extravaganza’ … Lady Gaga kicks off the Mayhem Ball tour in Las Vegas in July.Photograph: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Live NationThe noisy electronics, big pop choruses and dancefloor-facing beats of Lady Gaga’s last albumMayhemfelt like a restatement of her core pop values after the commercial and creative wobble of her appearance inJoker: Folie à Deuxand her accompanying jazz-infused album Harlequin. If US reviews are anything to go by, the Mayhem Ball tour offers a suitably eye-popping high-camp, high-production-value theatrical extravaganza, described by one unexpected concert-goer, Nancy Pelosi, as “the most fun I’ve had in a long time”.Tour begins 29 September, London O2 ArenaCMATPop is a notoriously tricky business to predict, but you wouldn’t bet against CMAT’s third album Euro-Country being a hit on a scale that far outstrips her past work. It’s musically more expansive than its country-infused predecessors and stuffed with fantastic, provocative songs, as evidenced by the viral success of Take a Sexy Picture of Me. And, as anyone who caught her Glastonbury appearance knows, she is absolutely fantastic live: sharp, exceptionally funny, blessed with an incredible voice and quite unlike anyone else around.Tour beings 2 October, O2 Academy BrixtonTaylor Swift – The Life of a ShowgirlView image in fullscreen‘Pop’s most high-achieving workaholic’ … Taylor Swift’s The Life of a Showgirl.Photograph: Republic RecordsRumblings of a new Swift album seemed impossible: the glitter from the Eras tour had only just settled; she had a new album just last year. Underrate pop’s most high-achieving workaholic at your peril: she recently revealed that she recorded her 12th album between Eras dates, flying to Sweden to record with Max Martin and Shellback – the co-architects of her most laser-guided pop smashes from Red, 1989 and Reputation. No one’s heard a peep, but she’s promised “melodies that [are] so infectious you’re almost angry … and lyrics that are just as vivid”.Released 3 OctoberLittle SimzSimz’s sixth album, Lotus, was not an easy listen: it emerged from a period of turmoil in which she started and scrapped four different full-length projects and ended up suing herformer chief collaborator Inflo; its angry, diaristic lyrics were matched with raw, occasionally rock-facing production. But it seems to have done nothing to halt the rapper’s continuing rise: after she curated and performed at this year’s Meltdown festival on the South Bank, she’s ascended to arenas for this autumn tour.Tour begins 16 October, Manchester Co-op LiveJalen NgondaIf your tastes run to classic soul, then US-born, UK-based singer-songwriter Jalen Ngonda represents the real deal. His voice is incredible – there are shades of Marvin Gaye and David Ruffin about his delivery, but his sound is his own – and he’s a skilled songwriter, as his 2023 debut album Come Around and Love Me and the handful of singles he’s released since displayed. He’s also reliably fantastic live: relentless touring means tickets are already running low for these UK shows.Tour begins 16 October, Newcastle City HallJasmine.4.tJasmine Cruickshank’s You Are the Morning is one of 2025’s finest debut albums. She has what would once have been called “heavy friends” on board – it was produced by Boygenius, whose Phoebe Bridgers signed Cruickshank to her Saddest Factory label – but, in truth, she doesn’t need the endorsement of alt-rock royalty. She’s a fantastic songwriter in the old-fashioned, rough-hewn indie manner, who’s transformed tough personal challenges into powerful and ultimately joy-bringing music.Tour begins 11 November, London ScalaKneecapView image in fullscreen‘More controversy’ … Kneecap.Photograph: Peadar Ó GoillSomewhere underneath the continual tumult surroundingKneecap, there lurks a band who are exceptionally good at what they do, not that the attendant furore has dented their popularity. Quite the opposite: a July gig in Glasgow sold out in 80 seconds after they were dropped from the Trnsmt festival, while this tour is bookended by a September date at Wembley Arena – which provoked more controversy after a poster advertising the show was banned from the London Underground – and two sold-out arena dates in Dublin.Tour begins 18 September at the OVO Arena Wembley LondonLordeLorde debuted her fourth album Virgin, in its entirety, at a not-so-secret performance at this summer’s Glastonbury, her first live appearance in the UK for three years. That it attracted a mixed response tells you more about playing 40 minutes of unheard material to a festival audience than said material’s quality: Virgin is an impressively dark, emotionally ragged restatement of the dance-pop sound of 2017’s Melodrama – and expectations understandably run high for her tour.Tour begins 15 November, Manchester Co-op LiveStereolabAfter a decade-long hiatus, Stereolab returned to a pop world that seemed to have come around to their way of thinking, at least a little. Critically revered outliers in the 90s – lyrics influenced by Marxist critical theory, music by Krautrock and esoteric electronica – they now find themselves acclaimed by Tyler, the Creator and Pharrell Williams, their motorik sound a regular rock trope, and their critiques of late-stage capitalism mainstreamed. And yet they still sound entirely unique and wonderful: comeback albumInstant Holograms on Metal Filmis a gem.Tour begins 15 December at Royal Festival Hall, LondonClassicalThe Dream of GerontiusView image in fullscreenDreaming … Kazuki Yamada.Photograph: Marco BorggreveA homecoming for Elgar’s mighty oratorio – the greatest of his choral works.

The show,nominated for an Edinburgh comedy award, takes the temperature of a divided America, and – even less fashionable, this – proposes how it might be healed.It’s not a perfect set: Jay has a diffident manner at the microphone, so there are punchlines that aren’t audible, far less impactful. But the range, ambition – and sometimes quality – of her thinking makes something distinctive, certainly at this year’s fringe, of this cool diagnosis of America’s ills.A marker of Jay’s intention to do things differently is put down early with a routine questioning “non-binary” as a gender category. Are we in the realms ofDave Chappelle-alike transphobic comedy? We are not. But looking at her country, Jay – herself black and gay – argues that the pace of change is alienating potential sympathisers, that people need to step out of their silos and meet halfway, that culture wars are “people fighting for what they understand”. She goes to a rodeo, and apprehends the gulf between red-state America and her world of veganism and trans bathrooms. She brings Jeffrey Dahmer in from the cold. She interrogates black people’s culpability for the state of her nation. (“We celebrated OJ too hard.”)Sometimes, these are useful as well as funny ideas. Sometimes, they’re arresting but glib – as with her argument for a return to a state of nature, or the arrogance v insecurity she identifies in colonialism v chattel slavery. But how thrilling to be, as that reference implies, at a show bandying big concepts around. And making them so provocatively funny, as with Jay’s extended riff on “fucked farmers” and alien abduction, or her visit to the UK to encounter whiteness at its zenith.The pleasure, at the performance I saw, was undermined by a bewilderingly abrupt ending. But We the People remains an eye-catching set from a comic who’s found lots to say, and lots to laugh about, in the not-ostensibly-amusing condition of modern America.AtPleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Edinburgh festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

Her show riffs on the Friday afternoon reward for schoolchildren of an hour’s golden time – but only for those who have earned it by being good all week.The initial vibe is club meets classroom. We take our seats to thumping dance music and Giulia Grillo’s production grows akin to a lesson with a favourite teacher as Ireland asks for our memories of those Fridays. (No need for hands in the air.) There’s a blackboard of sorts, used for projections as well as creative captioning, still rare at the fringe. We are given a quick history lesson on the concept of “better behaviour through golden time” devised by education consultant Jenny Mosley and Ireland remembers how she was denied the reward, left staring at the blackboard in a purgatorial state.View image in fullscreenA performer who shines … Kate Ireland.Photograph: Beckett Guimaraes-TolleyWhen she returns to primary school as a teaching assistant, Ireland identifies with a vividly drawn neurodivergent pupil placed on “amber” in the class’s traffic-light system for golden time. Ireland takes us through a week in the job – she may be grown up, but the school system drains and confines her in the same ways as when she was young. Her bond with the young girl helps them both get through the days.All of this is captured with some lovely image-making: pupils with hands in the air “like windscreen wipers”, her unnamed young ally’s bloody knee, resembling a teacher’s red cross; the time-loop scrawled by the child when asked to depict their future. That last one leads to a head-rush flow of performance poetry that ties together, a little too explicitly, the show’s themes. By then Ireland has deftly conveyed the shortfalls of one-size-fits-all thinking, the march of productivity, ranking and targets not just in school but wider society.A dose more of that poetry would be welcome and balance out what sometimes feels like a workshop. But you leave feeling lighter, thanks in part to an exercise where the audience are encouraged to remember for themselves carefree times without constraints and then share those memories with Ireland. The room fills with afternoon scenes of dancing with siblings, playing football and talking to pet guinea pigs. Properly golden hours, conjured by a performer who shines too.AtPleasance Dome, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreComedy (Culture)Edinburgh festivalSchoolsPoetryComedy (Stage)reviewsShareReuse this content"

Their circus routines are interspersed with moves from 50s dance crazes but the concept really takes off with Jackie Wilson’s Reet Petite. Here, the singer’s distinctive vocal range and zany word stretching perfectly complement the men’s evident joy in testing their limits and winning our whoops. “Look-a there, ooh wee!”An overlong scene-setting intro in Alexander Sunny’s production, choreographed by Electra Preisner and Ahara Bischoff, finds the guys on a train station, having missed their connection to Chicago. Macs, hats and shades are taken off but Bilal Musa Huka, Rashid Amini Kulembwa, Seif Mohamed Mlevi, Peter Mnyamosi Obunde and Mohamed Salim Mwakidudu remain in otherwise formal attire.View image in fullscreenHuman pyramids are their speciality … Black Blues Brothers.Photograph: Gabriele TomeThe routines are performed as if a simple way to kill time while they wait for the next train. In a recurring gag, coins are used to either spin another record on the jukebox or call a lover who is being left behind. All of this is done through act-outs: the men remain as tight-lipped as they are loose-limbed.Human pyramids are their speciality: one may rest upside down on another’s head while their neighbour dangles from the side with look-no-hands glee. Buttocks are there for drumming; lower backs become springboards. The doo-wop of the Marcels adds comedy to the troupe’s towering attempt to reach a blue moon while Elvis Presley’s A Little Less Conversation powers a frenzy of hoop diving.But the scenario begins to feel stuck in a groove, the jokes repetitive, and it’s not just the soundtrack that’s a throwback to the 50s. A nagging female voice on the phone is an overdone joke. When a woman from the front row is brought on stage for the men to woo, it’s instantly cringy and the resulting scene has little to offer.Happily the songs keep coming, such as Choo Choo Ch’Boogie, and the men steam on with rope tricks, somersaults and limbo feats. It’s all the more impressive as they’re at the end of a gruelling festival run – and they never even undo those ties.AtMcEwan Hall, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalComedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)CircusreviewsShareReuse this content"

In caps, goggles and bathing suits, Alexander Burnett and Ellie Whittaker recount our abiding passion for the water, from the earliest forms of life to Napoleon diving into an especially wet misremembering of Waterloo, and on to an amusing pitch for The Great British Swim-Off. It’s a supremely silly sequence that could even withstand a few more laps of absurdity.The show’s focus, though, is on two contestants going head to head: Meeta (Burnett), drilled for competition since birth, and Steve (Whittaker), rehabilitated from a wayward youth by a newfound love of swimming. (He still has an over-developed right arm from throwing stones.) Meeta emits discipline and icy focus; have-a-go Steve is a bag of nerves, goggle-eyed even without the swim glasses.View image in fullscreenNever treads water … The Crawl.Photograph: PRIn a nice touch, Burnett and Whittaker are competitive with each other about how this story will be told and they also play overly fussy, antagonistic race organisers and buffoonish commentators. As for the other competitors, coaches, lifeguards and so on – they are all played by us, thanks to the most affably handled audience participation I’ve seen this fringe.With bombastic music from Andrés Hernandez, Olivia Zerphy’s production never treads water and the limber, Lecoq-trained performers are suitably synchronised. Who needs props when they can play gym equipment, a library or a glacier themselves?This is a genially amusing hour, never quite reaching hysterical heights, but with plenty of clever, goofy touches and a wide appeal (it’s for over-eights) even if the moral could probably be elucidated for younger audiences. The story grows surprisingly sweet and shows there’s more than one way to win in life.AtPleasance Dome, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Stage)TheatreComedy (Culture)Edinburgh festivalSwimming (Sport)Swimming (Life and style)reviewsShareReuse this content"

She discusses her surprising path to fame – and how much of her personal life she is willing to put into her musicSun 24 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTShareOne mark of whether someone has the boldness to be a good pop star is how they respond to overhearing someone slagging them off. A few weeks ago, the Icelandic-Chinese jazz-pop phenomenon Laufey was at a coffee shop close to her Los Angeles home when her ears pricked up at the mention of her name (it’s pronounced “Lay-vay”, by the way). “I used to love her,” a young woman told her friends. “I’ve met her and she’s so sweet, but her music is unlistenable now.”In that split-second, Laufey realised that she could do the Normal Person Thing (slink away unnoticed and furiously text her group chat), or do the Pop Star Thing. She spun around to face the group. “I’m so sorry,” Laufey said, her voice dripping with honeyed sarcasm. “I try my best.”The thought of being confronted by a celebrity you are gossiping about is enough to send most of us into an early grave, and I nervously laugh as Laufey tells me the story one morning in New York. She laughs too, perhaps a little shocked by her ballsiness. “I wasn’t even trying to clap back,” she says. “They didn’t know what to say, they were so dumbfounded.”This goes against much of what I thought I knew about Laufey. The 26-year-old has drawn an obsessive fanbase for winsome love songs that marry her jazz and classical training with sticky pop hooks. Her music is a giddy tumble into a retro-modern world of soft teen romance, with aurora skies, sunset kisses and crushes who leave you on “read”. It surges with the big feelings of modern young womanhood, swaddling them in tulle and sending them airborne amid cascading orchestration.Over the peppy bossa nova of her breakout, TikTok-buoyed hitFrom the Start,she comes across as an Austen heroine who speaks internet, tortured by the “burning pain” of listening to a crush “blah blah blah”-ing interminably about a new partner. Her fans, often young women, are drawn into Laufey-land by her big-sister energy: an edition of her 2023 album Bewitched came with a themed board game. At first glance, with her retro jazz-influenced sound, you might not peg Laufey as the most likely superstar, one who has racked up nearly 5bn Spotify streams and a string of sellout shows across the world. But you could also see her music as a lighter and more literal take on the vintage-hued introspection that has made Lana Del Rey and Billie Eilish stadium-fillers around the globe.I had a more shocking kind of success than I thought I would ever have. It got a bit hard for me to keep up mentallyNow Laufey is keen to rough up her reputation as gen-Z’s favourite jazz savant, at least a little. Her new album A Matter of Time splits the difference between sugar-plum symphonics with imperfect notes and vocals that crack with emotion. One song has jolting strings that she compares to a scream. “I wanted to make more of a statement on this album,” she says. “I’ve become known as a bit of a soft singer. I am that, but I also want to show parts of myself that aren’t that pretty.”She arrived in the hotel lobby this morning on time and as neat as a pin, with a cardigan-wearing bunny rabbit dangling from her handbag. (The critter, named Mei Mei, is Laufey’s mascot and alias of sorts – she releasesalternative versionsof her songs under its name, and it is alsoavailable to buy, with a portion of the proceeds aiding music education as part of the Laufey Foundation.) “Do you want to go in there?” she asks, leading me into a side room and getting out the best biscuits: “It’s the guests-only lounge.” The place is done up like a hunting lodge, with artfully oxidised mirrors, a wall-mounted antelope head and, most bizarrely, given that it is summer, a burning log fire. When I comment on the strangeness, Laufey says, wryly: “Well, it’s now reached a very cool 24 degrees.”View image in fullscreenAll that jazz … Laufey on stage earlier this year.Photograph: Tommaso Boddi/Getty Images/Gold HouseAfter beating Bruce Springsteen to take home the 2024 Grammy award for best traditional pop vocal album, Laufey’s career has gone into overdrive. She’s now a fashion week fixture, trading air kisses with Naomi Campbell on the front row of the Chanel show in July, and has celebrity pals in Olivia Rodrigo, Chappell Roan, PinkPantheress and the indie sensation Clairo, whom she recently challenged to a spicy chicken wing-eating contest ona Hot Ones episode. She has won over industry legends: earlier this year, she duetted with Barbra Streisand on aheartfelt coverof her song Letter to My 13 Year Old Self. “It’s beautiful to see a young artist inspired by jazz greats like Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday make such a deep connection with her fans,” said Streisand. This autumn, Laufey will embark on her firstarena tour, with two nights at Madison Square Garden.She says she was driven by a “hunger” to imbue the new experiences of a whirlwind few years into her new album. It radiates a sense of adventure, dovetailing between twangy campfire country to swoony ballads and sherbert-spiked pop. The record is produced by Laufey and longtime collaborator Spencer Stewart: between them, they can play just about any instrument you have heard of, as well as some you may not have. I was unfamiliar with the celesta, an obscure kind of idiophone that Stewart and Laufey play on the record (it sounds like a child’s musical jewellery box). On the Busby Berkeley-worthy confectionLover Girl, she knowingly leans into her Cupid-struck image, while on Carousel, Laufey reckons with inviting a partner into her circus-like life while a seasick accordion plays. The rapturous Forget-Me-Not, recorded with the Iceland Symphony Orchestra (for which she was a teenage cello soloist), is her most accomplished work of composition to date; her voice soars among flurries of flutes.View image in fullscreenKey phase … Laufey.Photograph: Erlendur Sveinsson“I wanted the album to reflect all sides of my emotional scale,” she says, huddling in air-con that has apparently been set to “Himalayan”. “Within one day, I will have a happy hour and a crying hour. I have no interest in making an album that’s one vibe throughout.” But there is, she says, an emotional through-line about learning to accept yourself while falling in love with someone else. She won’t talk about her relationship status today though, and I ask if internet scrutiny makes it hard to write candidly about her dating experiences. “There’s always a line of ambiguity,” Laufey says, before smiling mischievously. “But if you get into a situation with me, you kind of know that I might write about it.”There’s a playful looseness to Laufey that suggests she has settled into her success. She says that hasn’t always been easy. After her Grammy win, she struggled to balance the new attention with a punishing touring schedule. “I was a little bit scared,” she says. “I had a more shocking kind of success than I thought I would ever have. With the flurry of it all, it got a bit hard for me to keep up mentally.” It wasn’t just the shows; it was that being a pop star means being a piñata for online opinion. “It was the battle of seeing a bad photo of yourself online, or hearing bad comments about yourself,” she says. “It was tough.”View image in fullscreenSing when you’re winning … Laufey with her Grammy in 2024.Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty ImagesLaufey Lín Bing Jónsdóttir always knew what it meant to work. She was born in Reykjavík to a mother who is a professional violinist for the Iceland Symphony Orchestra, with maternal grandparents who are music professors. Aged four, Laufey began piano lessons, then added cello lessons at eight, cramming schoolwork around a dizzying schedule of rehearsals and performances. She credits that relentless regimen with giving her the strength – vocal, mental and muscular – to play for extended periods. When we meet, she’s in the middle of a six-date summer run of orchestral shows across the eastern United States.After an early brush with the spotlight as a finalist inÍsland (Iceland) Got Talent in 2014, Laufey won a scholarship to the prestigious Berklee School of Music in Boston, and began posting performances of jazz standards from her dorm room. In 2021, she released her debut EP, Typical of Me, which drew from the music of 20th-century Tin Pan Alley and found fans in Billie Eilish and Willow Smith.I literally have a career because an audience on social media showed me there was a space for the type of music I makeA Matter of Time marks her creative world opening up. Two spry new songs were created with Taylor Swift collaborator and the National founder member Aaron Dessner at his Long Pond Studios, in an experience that Laufey says “opened a third musical eye”. And she is more lighthearted than ever on Mr Eclectic, a bossa nova-inspired track featuring Clairo that pokes fun at men who mansplain classical music to her. “I just think it’s funny to be the type of man who performatively reads a beaten-up paperback outside a coffee shop,” she says, her nose wrinkling. “I’ve dated guys like that, but this is a forever type of man. Why do you think all philosophers are men? They just had the platform and the audacity.”Laufey’s spicy side makes me like her a whole lot more, not least because it feels refreshing after years of interviewing media-trained artists who won’t tell you their favourite colour in case it conflicts with their Dulux brand deal. That candour can also be seen in A Matter of Time’s waltzing Snow White, which addresses what she calls her lifelong struggle with body image and identity.In the video, set amid the jaw-dropping Icelandic tundra, she sings, “I don’t think I’m pretty, it’s not up for debate,” into a mirror while pulling at the side of her left eye to emphasise its shape.Today, she feels that her insecurity about her looks is as under control as anyone’s. (“We all have our moments,” she says.) She enjoys fashion, and attended the Met Gala last year wearing a custom veil featuring the notation of a favourite Bach classical piece. She can’t remember which violin fugue it was in the moment and pulls up the Spotify app on her phone. “It was this,” she says, as a delicate composition tinnily plays. “But it’s on guitar for some reason.” That won’t do. “Come on, violin!” she whoops, scrolling on.Laufey hopes that someone will be doing the same thing with her music a few centuries from now. “I think often about how artists in the past were not led by external sources,” she says. “Ella Fitzgerald wasn’t putting a 20-second clip of her new song out and having people read it to filth. I try so hard to not let [social media] shape my art.”View image in fullscreenDress to impress … Laufey at the Met Gala in 2024.Photograph: Gotham/Getty ImagesI wonder if that’s a challenge, given that social media has helped to power her fairytale rise since the very beginning. “Honestly” – her voice drops to a whisper – “I love it. I literally have a career because an audience on social media showed me there was a space for the type of music I make. I know that if I had gone to a label six years ago and said: ‘I’m going to make music that’s a mix of jazz and classical and about my own experiences, and I’m gonna play arenas one day,’ they would have said, ‘Bullshit.’ They would not have put a dollar down on my name.“I don’t know what miracle happened that I get to have this career,” she says. She’s determined to make every moment of it count. She drains the last of her iced coffee and heads off to a fitting for her upcoming tour. After that, she’ll go to Electric Lady Studios to work on more music – no matter that her new album isn’t even out on the day we speak. She jumps into a car with blacked-out windows, nattering away to her assistant in Icelandic. I can’t understand what she is saying, but it sounds like Laufey is planning her next move.A Matter of Time isout now.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockTikTokJazzinterviewsShareReuse this content"

What drew him to his subjects - and what do they tell us about a changing world?ByMartin Parr.  Introduction: Wendy JonesSun 24 Aug 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 24 Aug 2025 01.19 EDTShareIf you sawMartin Parrand didn’t know who he was, you would barely notice him. He is Mr Invisible and Mr Normal rolled into one, in his sensible jumper – probably from Marks & Spencer – and sensible socks and sandals. He has a neat side parting and neatly cut hair. He has a mild and conventional manner and a mild and conventional appearance. There is something of the naff birdwatcher about him. But do not be fooled. This is the disguise of a man who is seeing far more than most of us ever see, and he’s hiding in plain sight. He is a genius who has changed photography, one of the great artists of our time.So who is Martin Parr? And what would he say if we listened? His life is, in many ways, an everyman’s life: he’s born into a family of mixed characters and classes; he has a devoted grandparent; he is undistinguished at school – perhaps not having the happiest of childhoods; he’s a silly boy; he goes to college; mucks around, tries new things, gets a girlfriend, has some holiday jobs. He enters adulthood in an inauspicious way, works hard, sees something of the world; gets married, becomes a father, builds up his career, travels; has conflict, success, illness, recovery; becomes a grandfather, gains wisdom and respect. An ordinary life that follows an ordinary arc.Martin Parr’s life is also a life of its century. He was there in the great freeze of 1962 – he records it with his first photo. He’s a grammar school boy who trainspots the last steam engines, then a hippy student with long hair in the 70s. He’s in Ireland during the Troubles, then, in the 80s, he’s capturing fashion, luxury, consumerism and British Conservatism. He sees the fall of communism in the 90s, the rise of McDonald’s and the explosion in international tourism. In the new millennium, he watches India transforming, industry dying in the Black Country, the traditional English village enduring. He sees South Africa after apartheid and the growth in the standard of living worldwide. He lives through the arrival of digital photography, mobile phones, selfies. He sees Gay Pride marches and Black Lives Matter protests, meets the elderly queen and survives the pandemic.Decks appeal: Martin Parr captures life on a cruise liner – photo essayRead moreAnd he photographs it all. He’s like a photographic Forrest Gump. In the mid-80s, like the film of The Wizard of Oz, his work burst into colour, not in a wonderland like Oz but in a downtrodden, dirty, unglamorous seaside resort near Liverpool called New Brighton. He photographed gulls, litter, sunbathers on cement walkways, babies crying and chip shops. Not for him the luscious aesthetic of 1930s seaside posters. This was a working-class day out, and Martin displayed it in vibrant, flash-induced, saturated colour. In New Brighton, Martin became the photographer we know him to be now – vivid, demanding our attention, socially aware and pulling us in like a magnet.Many years ago, I approached Martin and asked if I could write his biography. He said yes. We tried, we failed. I asked questions; he replied quickly and briskly. I asked the same questions again, I tried to dig deeper. I failed. I wanted to write something analytical, deep, full of myth, id and ego. Martin talked about birdwatching and regularly said the worst phrase a biographer can hear: “That’s all I’ve got to say about that.” How could I write a book with so few words? I couldn’t. Nearly all of Martin is in his pictures, not words.Fifteen years later, I went back to him and said, “How about you tell your life story through photographs and you talk about your photos?” And he said yes.Martin is older now, a statesman in his world. He has the air of someone who’s seen everything – which, in a way, he has. But he’s still at it. He recently held an exhibition of his photos on smoking, exploring the difficult borders between comfort and discomfort. He has work to do, an ever-changing world to document, boring things to find that he’s going to make us interested in.So if you see a mild-mannered man walking along and he points his camera at you – especially if you’re doing something unremarkable, such as standing at the checkout, having a cup of tea, taking a selfie or even just waiting in a queue – you may have been Parr-ed.WJFrozen Stream, Chessington, England, 1962-3View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosThe first photo I remember taking is this one, of my father on a frozen stream. I used to play here, next to our house. I would have been 10 when I took this during the great freeze of 1962–3. I remember helping my father sweep the snow outside our house and people thanking us – everyone was being nice to each other because it was a very cold winter.You can see my father’s got his binoculars on. He was a great birdwatcher, as was my mother, which meant all our trips out were to birdwatching places – to Thursley Common to see the Dartford warbler, and down to Pagham, looking for waders.We would go to Hersham Sewage Works, where I spent many Saturdays looking for migratory birds, because a lot came there to feed. It was smelly and we wore wellingtons. There were tomatoes growing. We used to pick green ones that had grown in human shit. They would never ripen; they were always green. We’d pick them and my mother used to make green tomato chutney.Birdwatchers, Surrey Bird Club, England, 1972View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosWhen I went home during the college breaks, I would take pictures of my father’s birdwatching trips with the Surrey Bird Club – my father was the president. He made lists of the birds, and the Dartford warbler was his specialism. This picture was taken when the bird club was having its picnic lunch. I guess this photo works because you’ve got these two couples, both with binoculars, so it looks quite surreal. They look like owls themselves.I was beginning to look at scenes that were familiar in a slightly remote way. And there’s humour in it – it was the first photo I could clearly see the humour in.Susie Mitchell, Paris, France, 1978View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosDespite being “utterly inattentive and lazy” in French at school (to quote one school report), in the late 70s I began to go on trips to France. I went to see Jean-Claude Lemagny, who was in charge of the photography collection of the Bibliothèque Nationale de France in Paris. He bought many early black-and-white prints from me – for bargain prices, but it was a great thrill. The trips were very exciting and helped build up my reputation in France. And Susie came along, because she could speak French.This was taken in one of those classic French bistros. Susie didn’t like being photographed by me at all. She’d put her hand up in front of her face. She has always said she looks awful, which is absolute rubbish. Her skin is beautiful. She still puts her hand up now. It doesn’t stop me taking pictures, so it’s a bit useless. I can easily outwit her. I’ve got lots of photos of Susie in the archive. We’ve been married for 45 years.Colour and Flash, New Brighton, England, 1983-85View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Parr/Magnum Photos, taken from The Last ResortIn 1982 Susie got a job in Liverpool and we found a house overlooking the Mersey. I knew the seaside resort New Brighton was a mile down the road and would be great for me to explore photographically. It was a tradition; people came here from all over Merseyside for a day out on the beach – if you could call it a beach. It was shabby, but it had an ice-cream parlour, an amusement arcade and funfair rides.I kept working in black and white because colour photography wasn’t taken seriously in the UK. In the 40s and 50s, it was regarded as commercial and trivial, used for family snapshots because you could get cheap colour cameras. Then, in the late 70s, I saw images from America of serious photography being done in colour: the likes of Stephen Shore, William Eggleston and Joel Meyerowitz were getting shows in the big museums. I thought, I must go to colour.I knew I was on to something with this combination of colour, flash and New Brighton. I could tell these were good pictures. It made me realise colour really had potential to express my attitude and subjectivity much more efficiently than anything else. Colour is real, isn’t it? It’s right in your face. It just looks great. I still love black and white, but once I moved to colour, I never went back.Something That Seems Ordinary, Salford, England, 1986View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Parr/Magnum Photos, taken from Spending TimeI was hanging around a petrol station like a pervert. Photographers at the time would have said that this was the craziest place to take a picture. Because it’s a very unglamorous subject matter. Boring. There’s no drama here. But there’s something very interesting about boring. Something that seems very ordinary at the time becomes interesting when you look back at it later, almost 40 years later: the pump has changed, the clothes have changed, the car has changed. It tells us something about consumerism, and how we depend on fuel, oil and petrol.Conservative Midsummer Madness Party, Bath, England, 1988View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Parr/Magnum Photos, taken from The Cost of LivingI went to the Conservative Party Association in Bath and asked if there was any chance of getting access to events happening in people’s gardens and houses. They said, “Yes, here’s a list.” They were so very agreeable. Access, back in the 80s, was a much easier game to play. I guess now they would look me up and would be horrified by my reputation.Every little component of this picture works – and that’s an unusual achievement. The men are dressed up in suits and ties, and they look very smug. This lady’s hair is like a helmet. It looks solid. It doesn’t look like it would blow in the wind in the Midsummer Madness.Small World, Kleine Scheidegg, Switzerland, 1990View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Parr/Magnum Photos, taken from Small WorldIn 1992, I had an exhibition of my ongoing project on tourism, Small World, in Paris. One of the guests wasHenri Cartier-Bresson, probably the most famous photographer in the world, and a founder of Magnum. He was so annoyed by the exhibition that when he got home he sent me a fax saying, “I don’t see your viewpoint. Your work is from a different planet. We belong to two different solar systems.” I thought, oh, this is fantastic. I replied, “I acknowledge there is a large gap between your celebration of life and my implied criticism of it … What I would query with you is: why shoot the messenger?” He was photographing the old style of life; I was photographing modern things. I usually relish criticism and opposition. When I realised people were against me, I thought: I must be doing something right.Lost ball, Chew Stoke, England, 1992View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Parr/Magnum Photos, taken from Chew Stoke: A Year in the Life of an English VillageIt’s classic to play cricket in summer in Britain, yet things can go badly wrong. It’s not a professional match. Everybody’s mucking in to find the ball so the game can continue.McDonald’s, Moscow, Russia, 1992View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosWhen the first McDonald’s in the USSR opened in Pushkin Square, Moscow, there was a queue of a thousand people trying to get in. I still remember the excitement and thrill of the diners. It was the largest McDonald’s in the world, with 600 seats. It was nicknamed Bolshoi Mac and heralded as an amazing advance; because of Gorbachev’s glasnost policy, the USSR let this icon of America in.This was the only time I have been allowed to photograph in McDonald’s. I’ve often taken pictures without permission; being thrown out by a faintly embarrassed duty manager gives a certain satisfaction.Pyongyang, North Korea, 1997View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosI’ve always been fascinated by North Korea. Finally, in 1997, I saw an advertisement in the Times for a trip that was leaving from Beijing and going to North Korea. I applied and said I was a lecturer – which I was; it wasn’t a lie – and they gave me a visa. We were a coachload of 20 people driven around all the propaganda sites, which were like film sets. There were no cars anywhere. We knew there was a lot of starvation, but we didn’t see evidence of that. Still, it felt poor.We were controlled the whole time, in what we did, where we went, and we had to have an interpreter or a guide with us constantly. They were OK with me having quite a big camera. They must have realised I was a photographer, but they didn’t stop me from photographing anything, because it was all so curated you could only take pleasant photographs, really. It was propaganda of the first order. Occasionally, like here, I had an opportunity to sneak an uncurated picture through the coach window. North Korea was the most surreal experience of my life.A perfect cup of tea, Sand Bay, England, 1997View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Parr/Magnum Photos, taken from Common SenseI’ve done many other pictures of cups of tea but this is the best: every component is correct. It’s a perfect cup of tea in a perfect Wedgwood cup and saucer on a perfect red gingham tablecloth.It was taken in a cafe near Weston-super-Mare that Susie and I used to frequent, called Monk’s Rest, on a hill overlooking the sea. Sometimes we would have poached eggs on toast, and sometimes sardines on toast, and one day someone put this cup of tea on the table and I took a photo of it. It’s a simple picture that’s become very well known, licensed and used many, many times.It’s very rewarding to take an iconic image. I have taken millions of photos, and I’m always looking to take one that will survive on its own without context, without the narrative.Benidorm, Spain, 1997View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Parr/Magnum Photos, taken from Common SenseI was very excited about going to Benidorm with a macro lens for the first time, because it meant I could take photos at close range. And the scale of the beach in Benidorm is quite amazing. It’s huge. It must be three miles long, with three different beaches, and there’s this long path by the water where the Spanish go promenading during the day, particularly in the morning. It’s quite an event. I call it the motorway.I took the picture of this woman very quickly. She was fast asleep. Those blue things are eye shields. It was one of those rare moments when everything fell into place. I was very close to her. I only took one frame and then moved on. I had a hunch that this would be a good photo, and it is now one of my most famous pictures.I’ve since had two people write to me and say, “That’s a photo of my grandmother.” They weren’t able to prove it. The woman hasn’t ever come forward.Senegalese street seller, Dakar, 2001View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Parr/Magnum Photos, taken from Fashion MagazineI went to Dakar for a fashion shoot for Rebel, a French fashion magazine. I had accessories to photograph: handbags, sunglasses and a Louis Vuitton cigarette case – the silver square in the front row. Every fashion picture is about solving a problem: how to make the picture look good while showing the item of clothing.This guy was selling his wares on the street for two or three dollars. I negotiated to pay him to take his photo – I can’t remember how much – and I placed the cigarette case into the tray. And Bob’s your uncle.It’s all cheap stuff, apart from the Louis Vuitton cigarette case, which is an expensive French luxury good. It devalues it. It’s ironic, isn’t it, really? I put it there as a form of subversion, because everything else on that tray would be worth under $10. And that Louis Vuitton cigarette case is going to be worth $1,000. Minimum.Shalfleet Church Fete, Isle of Wight, England, 2007View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosI have been to so many country fetes over the years. I can’t get enough of them, in particular church fetes, ideally in the vicar’s garden. It’s like stepping back in time to the 1950s. You can’t help but admire the notice here: “Do take ONE cherry tomato with your roll.” It’s a shame these days the food is often covered in clingfilm. I can get an interesting photo of the reflections when I’m using flash, but clingfilm just annoys me. You don’t need it. The food’s only going to be in the open air for a couple of hours before it’s eaten. It’s health and safety gone mad.Spectators in Switzerland Watching Polo, St Moritz, 2011View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Parr/Magnum Photos, taken from LuxuryI wasn’t interested in the polo. I wanted the spectators. And they’re very much spectating, wearing their sunglasses and watching intently. The way the dog is integrated into the fur works well, and I like the other dog, also paying attention.Employee of the Month, Rochester, New York, US, 2012View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Parr/Magnum Photos, taken from Tim Montondo is Employee of the Month at Wards Natural Science for the month of April. This is his sixth timeIn 2012, Magnum initiated a project called Postcards from America, in which photographers were sent to different towns in the US for 10 days. I was sent to Rochester, where I came across Tim Montondo. The sign tells the story: he’s Employee of the Month. It’s his sixth time. I love that he’s holding his cup, the way it’s held in one hand and the other just drops down. I wanted him to look very proud. I had to tell him not to smile. I wanted to take it seriously. People assume for a portrait you should smile. The opposite is the case. I want the subject to show dignity.The queen visiting Drapers’ Hall, London, England, 2014View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Parr/Magnum Photos, taken from Unseen CityThe Drapers’ Livery company said, “We’ve got the queen coming to lunch to celebrate our 650th birthday. Would you be happy to take pictures of the event?” and I immediately said yes. The livery companies in London are trade guilds, or professional associations, and they are famously very wealthy. They are also typically very male, very white and very old. But still they go on. Still rich. Still giving out money. Still having their dinners.As opposed to most of the times I’ve photographed the queen at public events, this time I was the only photographer, and I followed her around.Here she is leaving the event. By this time, a good few pedestrians had twigged that she was in the building. Hence, you see people with their phones trying to take pictures of her. The trouble is they’ll have me in them, with my camera. Sorry about that, folks.This has become a very popular image. It’s interesting in that the queen is perhaps the only person who’s recognisable from behind. She’s got that classic hat and a slight hunch. I’m sure she was photographed from behind many times, but here, it really works.Tomato Soup, Royal Infirmary, Bristol, England, 2021View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosParamedics came to pick me up because I was vomiting and there was something wrong with my stomach. I had to have an emergency operation because something had come loose – I’m not sure exactly what happened. Anyway, by coincidence, when they were doing the scans for that they found “nodules on the spine”. And when they say that it means it’s cancer.They removed my stem cells, gave me a blast of chemo, and put the stem cells back in. Then I had to remain in a highly controlled room for two weeks while my immune system was maintained. The only person allowed in was Susie, who came every day, God bless her. After that, I was in the ward. It took a long time for my bowel to start working again. I had to have food pumped in to me to keep me alive, it was nil by mouth. Then at some point they decided I was ready to eat.The first food I had in three weeks was tomato soup – I think it was Heinz – orange juice and an ice-cream. NHS ice-cream was surprisingly good. During those three weeks I could only drink sips of water. I remember getting my first cup of tea. It was the best cup of tea I had ever drunk.Amusement Arcade, New Brighton, England, 2023View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosBack in New Brighton, I saw this mother with her five kids in their green outfits. I said, “Is there any chance I can take your picture?” She agreed and didn’t ask why. She must have been proud of her brood, so it made sense I’d want to take their photo.New Brighton has changed, probably for the better. It’s virtually litter-free now, and there’s actually a beach, properly laid out. The amusement arcade hasn’t changed much, though: it’s brash, noisy and good fun. It’s the new New Brighton. Gentrification is the name of the game.Autoportrait, Hanoi Studio, Havana, Cuba, 2001View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosMy autoportrait project has run over 40 years. The aim is to demonstrate the different ways in which you can have your portrait done in a studio or public space, as well as the different techniques photographers employ. The only reason I use myself as the subject is because I’m the one person who’s consistently there. Hanoi Studio took five black and white shots of me in different poses, and in one they gave me naff sunglasses. They then did a montage, printed in black and white, and hand-coloured.I’m uninterested in how I look, as long as I’m presentable. I look in the mirror once a day – I have no choice, as I’ve got to comb my hair. I guess that’s interesting given I do fashion photography. I’m not interested in clothes, I just wear what’s comfortable. Socks with sandals is a good combination before it gets to the hottest part of the year. I guess you could call it my spring look …I have had a wonderful life with photography. From North Korea, to a vicar’s garden party in Somerset, or shooting Mar del Plata beach in Argentina – what a privilege it has been to see the world and record my response. I had a funny one in Morecambe last summer. I was taking photos and this couple came up and said, “That’s a nice camera. What are you doing around here?” I replied, “I’m documenting Morecambe.” They said, “You mean like Martin Parr?” I said, “I am Martin Parr.” They were rather surprised.I’ve been taking photos for almost 70 years, and in that time we’ve seen the amazing transformation from analogue film to the digital era, and I’ve got a lot older. We live in a difficult but inspiring world, and there is so much out there I want to photograph.This is an edited extract from Utterly Lazy and Inattentive by Martin Parr and Wendy Jones, published by Penguin at £30.

But for Nicholas Blincoe, the story is much closer to home. He reveals an astonishing family historyNicholas BlincoeSun 24 Aug 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 24 Aug 2025 09.14 EDTShareFor almost my entire life, I’ve known there’s a connection between my family and Oliver Twist. There’s little chance I could forget it. Charles Dickens’s story has exploded into an Oliver multimedia universe, with as many as a hundred screen adaptations, the brilliant Lionel Bart musical, two current TV shows based on the frenmity of Fagin and the Artful Dodger, and an Audible dramatisation starring Brian Cox and Daniel Kaluuya.I remember one Easter Sunday we were watching Oliver! on TV when my father snapped out of his post-lunch stupor to announce: “Oliver Twist was a Blincoe. He’s my great-great-grandfather.” The original Robert Blincoe was a foundling, abandoned in London’s St Pancras district in around 1792. He spent his early years in the care of the parish, entering the workhouse at four years old. By seven, he was one of 30 “parish apprentices” contracted to work in a Nottinghamshire cotton mill without pay until the age of 21. London’s parish councils shipped thousands of pauper children north between the 1790s and 1830s, but little was known of their lives until Robert’s memoir. His account of brutality, sadism, sexual abuse and starvation became a national sensation, running to five editions between 1828 and 1833.Twenty years ago, the historian John Waller wrote a new biography, The Real Oliver Twist, which traced Robert’s role in the early battle for workers’ rights. But only when I wrote my own history, Oliver Twist and Me, did I really understand how Dickens’s best-loved novel came about, which in turn brought me closer to my great-great-great-grandfather.My father knew nothing of Robert’s life when he enrolled at Manchester University in the early 1960s, but he had the good fortune to catch a new wave of social history, inspired by EP Thompson’s declaration that “the working class was present at its own making”. A lecturer named Albert Musson was researching a labour organiser of the 1820s and 1830s named John Doherty, an Irish-born Catholic who Musson describes as “the most outstanding Trade Union leader of that period”. Doherty shaped the emerging working-class identity not only through unions and strikes, but by publishing their stories. In 1832, he brought out a new edition of Robert’s memoir in support of the Ten-Hour Movement, the campaign for a shorter working day. At university, my father was asked if he was related tothatRobert Blincoe. He doubted it, but was prompted to hunt down Doherty’s publications in Manchester Central Library. He found letters and testimonials from people who knew Robert, alongside updates on his later life. There were references to Robert’s son, another Robert, born in 1826, who my father knew was his great-grandfather. Robert Jr had gone on to Queens’ College, Cambridge, before being ordained as a priest at Lichfield in 1848, and in 1853 becoming curate of St Luke’s Old Street, London.I discovered that my ancestor's memoir had been published on Fleet Street, out of a bookshop that Dickens passed dailyOn my desk is a scrapbook, passed down through my family, that the young vicar started in his days at St Luke’s. I coincidentally moved to Old Street, east London, while writing Oliver Twist and Me, and discovered from a wedding certificate tucked inside the scrapbook’s cover that my great-great-grandmother had lived just a few doors from my new home. After four generations and 160 years, a Blincoe has circled back to old family haunts. Yet given this strange proximity, it’s odd that we knew nothing of the original Robert Blincoe until my father went to university.Musson’s rediscovery of Robert Blincoe’s memoir was a source of pride for my father in 1960s Manchester, but the book was a blight on the life of an ambitious Victorian cleric. Robert Jr would not give his enemies any more reasons to look down on him. His scrapbook reveals a bitter man, once celebrated as a young preacher, who found his chances of preferment blocked, something he blamed on the jealousy of his superiors. Towards the end of his life he moved his family back north, where he was supported by a wealthier older sister, Martha, the wife of a mill owner. John Waller tracked down Martha’s ancestors to New Zealand and discovered they had always known the story of Robert and the workhouse. Only we had been kept in the dark.The Reverend Robert was also the chaplain of St Luke’s workhouse, which appears in David Copperfield. The Micawbers do a flit from their home opposite the workhouse, abandoning their orphan servant in the street. In real life, too, Dickens’s mother Elizabeth callously dumped the family maid in Camden. The girl was a parish apprentice, recruited from a workhouse. His mother’s cruelty explains Dickens’s deep feelings for both parish orphans and teenage prostitutes, the likely fate of their maid. The character Nancy is his archetype of an exploited girl.View image in fullscreenLeanne Rowe and Jamie Foreman as Nancy and Bill Sikes in the 2005 film of Oliver Twist.Photograph: R.p. Productions/AllstarRobert Blincoe’s memoir has remained in print since the late 1960s and the claim that it is the source for Oliver Twist has become well established. There is solid textual evidence for it. The workhouse chapters that open each book introduce the same events in the same order, ending with a dramatic confrontation with the local chimneysweeps. I discovered that the 1828 edition of the memoir had been published on Fleet Street, out of a bookshop that Dickens passed daily, running between his shorthand shifts at a courtroom near St Paul’s and his night shifts at parliament, where he worked for a rival to Hansard. Dickens was employed there when Doherty’s work was debated, and when Robert appeared as a witness at a parliamentary inquiry.The relationship between Robert’s memoir and Dickens’s novel is strengthened by a personal connection between Dickens and John Doherty’s circle in Manchester, through the reformer Lord Shaftesbury (then Lord Ashley). In the late 1830s, Shaftesbury organised tours to view the working conditions in Manchester’s factories, with Doherty as a guide. Dickens accepted Shaftesbury’s invitation in November 1838, one of a series of public events Dickens undertook with his illustrator, in a pairing known as Boz and Phiz. During the trip, Dickens – who had grown tired of sharing the limelight – abruptly returned to London and halted the printing of the stand-alone edition of Oliver Twist changing the author’s name from Boz to Charles Dickens.Two months after Dickens, rival novelist Frances Trollope also took Shaftesbury’s tour. Her meeting with Doherty went well, according to her son Thomas (brother of the author Anthony). Dickens felt Frances was dogging his footsteps. She turned her tour into a promotional vehicle for her new book Michael Armstrong, the Factory Boy, which began its serialisation on her arrival in Manchester. The novel lifts scenes from Robert’s memoirs, including a devastating account of starving children stealing from a pigsty. Dickens felt compelled to alter his plans for his next book, Nicholas Nickleby, to avoid repeating Trollope’s account of the factory system.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Yet, he appropriated the stories of parentless children to burnish his image as a self-made creative. On his Shaftesbury-funded trip to Manchester, he was given a snuff box which proclaimed him, “The Inimitable”. He turned this incident into a piece of branding: from then on, he was the Inimitable, a true original who owed nothing to anyone else.Twenty years ago, I saw Waller’s biography of Robert Blincoe as the story of a self-made man. He walked to Manchester crippled and penniless, starting on the lowest rung as a dealer in waste rags. He arrived at a time when even the abomination of slave cotton could not keep up with world consumption. The price of rags steadily increased, not least because of their use in the paper industry, booming thanks to writers like Dickens. Robert became a loved and respected figure around Manchester, seeing one of his daughters marry well, and his son become a vicar. It was a remarkable turnaround.But these days I feel I misinterpreted his story, and a different picture has revealed itself. Dickens frequently spoke of “conviviality”, the fellow-feeling that enhances life. This was a value also held in high esteem by Robert, who saw his friendships as a political bulwark against the brutality of Manchester’s factory system. He was proud that his partnership with John Doherty made him an emblem for the working man. Doherty commissioned a woodcut of Robert from the artist William Knight Keeling, which was used as a banner at a rally for the Ten-Hour Movement: Robert was literally the poster boy for an emerging working-class identity. But he never separated himself from the world of his upbringing. His memoir was a collaboration, combining his story, told through interviews, with letters from other parish apprentices.Thinking of Robert’s memoir as a group effort has made me reassess Dickens’s work. In the period around publication of Oliver Twist, he created his own legend as the great singular author. But his writing continues to hold such power because it blossomed into a multiverse thanks to contributions that came later, like Oliver!. Dickens lives not because he is unique, but because he has become part of a collective endeavour. God bless us, everyone.Oliver Twist & Me by Nicholas Blincoe is published by Bridge Street.

So when he asked me to be his girlfriend one month in, I wasn’t sure at first. But I was sure about him, and I liked how he’d phrased it (“I know you’re having fun, and I don’t want to put pressure on you”), with my freedom being a positive thing.My ex-boyfriend was jealous and controlling and wanted to keep me in a box. He felt threatened that I had exes and had had sex with others. He hated me staying out late and questioned why I put on nice underwear for work, suspecting that must mean I was sleeping with a colleague. So it was refreshing to be with someone who celebrated my sexuality.The safety I feel with Finn means the sex we have feels safe, too, and we can explore freely. We experiment with power dynamics, and I find the danger exciting, but it never feels like Finn is dominant in an uncaring way. He once said, “I don’t want to act too dominant in case you think I don’t love you,” which I thought was very romantic.Finn is usually the one to initiate sex, but I always want it. He’s playful – he’ll put his hands down my pants when we’re out!I’ve heard that there are two ways of experiencing desire. Some people can just be doing the washing up and want to have sex – that’s Finn. The other is becoming turned on once you start being intimate – that’s me. So Finn is usually the one to initiate sex, but I always want it. He’s playful – he’ll put his hands down my pants when we’re out! He once fingered me in a car while driving down a winding road, and when cyclists overtook us, it was thrilling.We’ve both said past relationships were things that just happened to us, whereas we’ve chosen each other. It has surprised us both how open we are. When we were on holiday last year, we spent the whole time talking about how lucky we are.We’re about to move in together, and I can’t wait to do boring, domestic, adult things with him all the time.

We’ve had sex in the sea, in a field, in a photo boothI wanted a break from dating apps and was about to delete them when I started speaking to Mabel. After our first date, we went back to hers and had great sex, but we had to be quiet because her flatmate was next door, so Mabel covered my mouth with her hand. Usually, she’s quite vocal, which turns me on.On our second date, I cooked for her at mine, which felt like a big gesture. I was seeing other people casually, but it felt different with Mabel; it was so easy. Even though I wanted to say, “Let’s see each other loads,” we played it cool.In previous relationships, even if the sex was good, I’d doubt how compatible we were. I’d seek novelty, and still do, but Mabel offers me thatThis is how we do it: ‘Our first sexual experience was like everyone’s: bad. We were so awkward’Read moreWe have sex every time we see each other, about four times a week, which hasn’t decreased since we’ve been together. Our sex life has become more adventurous, and we’ve done things neither of us has done before. We’ve had sex in the sea, in a field, in a photo booth. I used to worry about someone seeing us, and Mabel would tease me about being cautious, but now I suggest it too.In previous relationships, even if the sex was good, I’d doubt how compatible we were. I’d seek novelty, and I still do, but Mabel offers me that. We’ve settled into more of a routine, but it still feels exciting. Maybe I’ve worked out what I want, or it could be our relationship is more interesting than my previous ones.My relationships have never lasted longer than two years, and I’ve avoided conversations about marriage and kids. When I was 21, I had a toxic relationship and a messy break-up, where I cheated, and my partner became possessive and insecure, which affected my ability to commit to others. But Mabel and I speak about spending the rest of our lives together. Maybe it’s the age we met at – we don’t need to wait. It’s the best sex of my life, and the possibility of having that for ever makes me feel very lucky.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThis is how we do itSexRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Not ideal when you’re going to meet your new boyfriend!I was taking stock of my washed-out appearance in the airport bathroom mirror when a glamorous flight attendant strolled in. She was putting on some lipstick and, not having remembered to pack any of my own, I bemoaned how terrible I looked and asked her if I could borrow some. I wouldn’t normally have asked someone for their lipstick because it’s such a personal thing, but desperate times call for desperate measures.The kindness of strangers: as I was sobbing in a rack of bras, a grandmotherly shop assistant soothed meRead moreShe went one better than just loaning me hers. Out of her purse she pulled a brand-new tube of lipstick and handed it to me, telling me I could keep it. I put it on and immediately felt much better, emboldened to go and meet my American beau in the pickup area.I kept her tube of lipstick for years because it reminded me of that very generous gesture. I was in a vulnerable state, not feeling my best, and her act touched me.Things didn’t work out with the boyfriend – long distance is tricky – but I never forgot that small but impactful gift from a stranger.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Skin on the body is thicker and more hard wearing than on the face, so it can generally deal with stronger perfumes and oils that would cause your face to go nuclear. But it’s important to choose a moisturiser that suits your skin type, lifestyle and personal preferences.I’ve put the best body moisturisers on the market to the test, ranking them on their hydration levels, ingredients and their feel on application. Here are my top nine recommendations for all skin types, budgets and concerns, as well as tips from dermatologists and skincare experts.At a glanceBest body moisturiser overall:CeraVe intensive moisturising lotion£17.60 for 473ml at Cult BeautyBest budget body moisturiser:Garnier Vitamin C Nutri-Glow body cream£4.99 for 380ml at SuperdrugBest smoothing body moisturiser:Ameliorate Transforming body lotion£14.50 for 100ml at AmazonBest body moisturiser for sensitive skin:Green People scent-free body lotion£29 for 150ml at Green PeopleBest body moisturiser for crepey skin:Charlotte Tilbury Magic body cream£39.20 for 200ml at Cult BeautyWhy you should trust meI’ve spent the past four years testing beauty products, including body care. In that time, I’ve worked my way through endless tubs of body creams, some dreamy, others a sticky nightmare.But everyone’s skin is different, and what works for me might not for someone else, so before testing these products, I completed a course in cosmetic science, which gave me a deeper knowledge of moisturisers for different skin types and textures.How I testedView image in fullscreenA moisture reader was used to check skin hydration levels.Photograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianI tested 20 body moisturisers from household-name brands and cult favourites for this roundup. As I tested, I made notes on ingredients, skin moisture levels and the feeling on application.I looked out for particular high-achieving ingredients, such as hydrating hyaluronic acids, smoothing salicylic acid and soothing antioxidant vitamin E. This gave me a good idea about how effective each moisturiser is at targeting specific concerns – someone with eczema will need very different ingredients from a person hoping to firm up skin. I also noted any potential nasties in the formulas, such as artificial fragrances and drying alcohols.The final step was testing my skin moisture level. A less scientific way to test this at home is by pinching the skin on the back of the hand and seeing whether it snaps back into place quickly. But I wanted something more precise, so I used amoisture readerto check my skin’s hydration levels.I took multiple readings for each moisturiser, starting with one immediately before application on freshly washed, dry skin. A second measurement was taken 10 minutes after application, then every three hours with a final reading 12 hours later. This gave me a clear idea of how long the hydrating effects of each moisturiser will last. I ran the hydration tests twice for each moisturiser and at least four times for the best performers featured here. Any creams that didn’t provide lasting hydration were cut from the list. Read on for my nine favourite body moisturisers from my tests.The best body moisturisers in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianBest body moisturiser overall:CeraVe intensive moisturising lotionView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£16.50 for 473ml at Look Fantastic£17.60 for 473ml at Cult BeautyThe CeraVe intensive moisturising lotion is a safe bet if you want a simple formula that gives your skin everything it needs. It’s designed to hydrate and repair very dry, itchy skin, but it’s the number one choice here because it’s suitable for everyone – even those with sensitive or mature skin.Why we love itCeraVe moisturisers are best known for including ceramides in their formula. These important fatty ingredients are found naturally in the skin and are known as the “building blocks” of the skin barrier – a protective top layer on the skin that prevents moisture loss. Those with dry skin often have compromised skin barriers. Using creams with ceramides, such as this one, will help restore skin to its former glory and keep it healthy.The intensive moisturising lotion also uses 5% hydro-urea and cholesterol, natural ingredients that help boost moisture retention and keep skin healthy without overwhelming it. As with most good moisturisers, you’ll also find glycerine and hyaluronic acid – humectants that help draw moisture into the skin.This was one of the few moisturisers to give me a completely consistent moisture level reading: my skin was hydrated immediately after application and remained so over the day’s testing period. That suggests the cream’s humectants worked effectively to draw in moisture, and the ceramides and natural moisturising factors kept it locked in – particularly helpful if you have dry skin. Despite the intense moisturising quality of this lotion, it had an impressively light texture that was quick to absorb.Coincidentally, this cream includes all the gentlest ingredients recommended by the dermatologists I interviewed, excluding peptides. It also contains no fragrance or drying alcohols, making it an easy recommendation for all ages and dry skin types.It’s a shame that …it’s completely fragrance-free, so those looking for an indulgent scent won’t find it here. It also uses isopropyl palmitate, which can block pores, making it potentially tricky for oily or acne-prone skin.Price per ml:from 3pKey ingredients:ceramides, hyaluronic acid, urea, cholesterol, glycerineVegan:noCertified cruelty-free:noBest budget body moisturiser:Garnier Vitamin C Nutri-Glow body creamView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£4.99 for 380ml at Superdrug£8.99 for 300ml at AmazonIf you want bang for your buck, this enormous tub of cream is an affordable way to give your skin a boost, costing from just over a penny per ml at the time of writing.Why we love itThe cream’s star ingredient is mango fruit extract, which is rich in vitamins A, C and E, helping to brighten and smooth skin. In addition to this is softening shea butter and glycerine.In my tests, the cream had a nice, refreshing feel as soon as I applied it, helped along by the sweet mango scent. It dried quickly too, meaning I could get on with my day without feeling sticky. I loved using it on my legs: it helped minimise shaving bumps while softening the skin. It also performed well in my moisture level tests, with improved hydration levels sustained for six hours, dropping by only 3% by the end of the day.It’s a shame that …it has ingredients with a high comedogenic index. This is a scale from zero to five that tells us how likely an ingredient is to cause comedones (AKA blackheads and whiteheads); a higher score indicates a higher risk. This formulation includes the emollient myristyl myristate (five out of five on the index) and isopropyl palmitate (four out of five). The high concentration of these means those with acne-prone skin may find it causes breakouts on areas where skin is thinner, such as the chest and neck.Price per ml:from 1pKey ingredients:vitamin C, shea butter, sunflower seed oil, glycerineVegan:yesCertified cruelty-free:yesBest smoothing body moisturiser:Ameliorate Transforming body lotionView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£24 for 200ml at Ameliorate£14.50 for 100ml at AmazonA good body moisturiser can help to smooth out texture over time, especially if you have uneven skin. The Ameliorate Transforming body lotion is gently exfoliating and smoothing without being irritating or clogging – perfect for helping those with keratosis pilaris (rough, bumpy skin).Why we love itThis lotion has an incredibly lightweight feel, making it perfect for summer. The gently exfoliating lactic acid helps remove dead skin cells; humectant glycerine hydrates; and there are sufficient emollients to lock moisture into the skin. It was one of the longest-lasting during my hydration tests, which was surprising for such a lightweight moisturiser.If you like a little extra glow in the summer, the cream is also available in an“illuminating glow” bronzing version. This isn’ta gradual or fake tan, but gives a subtle bronze sheen that won’t go patchy or stain the skin.It’s a shame that …there’s a slight medicinal scent, despite it being lightly fragranced. This doesn’t linger, but if you want something totally odourless or more perfumed, then this might not work for you.Price per ml:from 12pKey ingredients:lactic acid, glycerine, sodium lactateVegan:noCertified cruelty-free:yesBest body moisturiser for sensitive skin:Green People scent-free body lotionView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£29 for 150ml at Green People£28.99 for 150ml at AmazonWhile skin on the body is typically tougher than on the face, you’ll still need a gentle body moisturiser if you have very sensitive skin, eczema or psoriasis. Green People’s hypoallergenic scent-free body lotion is suitable for sensitive skin conditions while also providing the gentle hydration skin needs.Why we love itJust because a formula is simple doesn’t mean it can’t include powerful ingredients. This cream contains olive squalane to improve skin health, glycerine to hydrate, and shea butter to soften. You’ll also find calming chamomile and balancing prebiotics, with omega-3 fatty acid-rich perilla oil to repair skin.This no-nasties moisturiser comes in a handy pump bottle and applied to my skin smoothly without making it feel sticky. It provided lasting hydration over my testing period and didn’t smell medicinal or artificial like many fragrance-free sensitive creams.It’s a shame that …it’s on the expensive side and isn’t as widely stocked as other moisturisers.Price per ml:19pKey ingredients:squalane, chamomile, glycerine, shea butterVegan:yesCertified cruelty-free:yesAnti-ageing products that actually work: Sali Hughes on the 30 best serums, creams and treatmentsRead moreBest body moisturiser for crepey skin:Charlotte Tilbury Magic body creamView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£39.20 for 200ml at Cult Beauty£49 for 200ml at John LewisCrepey skin, with a thin, loose and wrinkled texture, is common in those with mature skin. It’s caused by the gradual loss of collagen and elastin as we age. When I asked dermatologists about how best to tackle this, they agreed you should look for ingredients to calm inflammation, support hydration and promote skin barrier health. Peptides are brilliant for this, and the Charlotte Tilbury Magic body cream – the successor to the brand’s viral magic face cream – has peptides and other powerful ingredients to help smooth, soothe and plump mature skin.Why we love itThis gorgeous, lightweight formula contains a patented “Algaktiv Uplift” complex, developed using algae and clinically proven to help tighten and lift the skin. This works together with caffeine to brighten the skin to reduce the look of cellulite. The formula also has hydrating humectants, soothing floral oils and shea butter to add a smoothing emollient layer to the skin.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

It was quick to sink in all over my body, and I enjoyed its light, rosy, floral scent.It’s a shame that …the formula doesn’t include any ingredients from the retinoid family, so its anti-ageing benefits are gentler.

It spreads across the skin easily, turning from a fluffy mousse to a lightweight hydrating oil when applied. It sinks in quickly without leaving a sticky layer – all that’s left after application is a calming cherry blossom scent.Surprisingly, it’s also one of the more hydrating creams I tested, with moisture levels dropping by only 1% 12 hours after the initial application, which is probably down to the glycerine. You’ll also find softening shea butter and nourishing rice milk, while the cherry blossom provides antioxidant benefits to soothe irritation and reduce redness.It didn’t make the final cut because …there are a lot of perfuming ingredients in this, but its scent doesn’t last as long as thicker body creams. Also, its lightweight formula doesn’t feel as luxurious as a richer cream.Price per ml:from 9p;key ingredients:rice milk, cherry blossom, shea butter;vegan:yes;certified cruelty-free:yesCetaphil Gentle Exfoliating SAlotionView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£16.50 for 473ml at Look Fantastic£9.97 for 236ml at AmazonBest for:an affordable option for sensitive skinIf you have sensitive skin that’s also rough and bumpy, a simple hydrating cream won’t cut the mustard. This Cetaphil sensitive-skin-friendly lotion uses salicylic acid, a gentle exfoliator that unclogs pores and softens rough, dry skin. Salicylic acid is also recommended for treating blemishes as it gets the job done without compromising the skin’s delicate barrier.You’ll also find niacinamide to soothe, glycerine to hydrate and shea butter for softness. It’s free from fragrance and drying alcohols, with a simple ingredients list and light formula. I also personally love the convenience of using a pump bottle and found the lotion ideal for clearing and calming the sensitive skin on my chest and arms.It didn’t make the final cut because …in my tests,it wasn’t as hydrating as the Green People cream, and the Ameliorate pipped it to the post on smoothing.

It’s not just a hit in my household – originally launched in a limited-edition collection, it was recently brought back permanently due to popular demand.It’s beautifully scented with Yoshino cherry, white flowers, amber and vanilla, which mix to bring a warm, sophisticated yet uplifting aroma that sticks on the skin. The cream itself comes in a removable plastic casing inside the purple tub, which can be replaced with a £20refill(when it’s in stock, that is), cutting down on plastic use and reducing overall cost.It didn’t make the final cut because …it didn’t have the same hydrating power as other options listed, or the tailored ingredients for treating a specific skin concern. It’s a great all-rounder, though, and it will make a lovely indulgent addition to a body care routine.Price per ml:9p;key ingredients:glycerine, vitamin E, sunflower oil, black rice extract;vegan:yes;certified cruelty-free:yesWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianHow much should I spend on a body moisturiser?The experts I interviewed unanimously agreed that there’s no need to overspend on a body moisturiser: basic formulas usually get the job done.“There are some really good and affordable options out there,” says Dr Ahmed El Muntasar,cosmetics doctor and GP.“You can find effective products between £10 and £25. For more advanced or active formulas, you might spend up to about £50.” Make sure you pay attention to how much moisturiser you’re getting for the price, though.What are the best ingredients for body moisturisers?“Ceramides are absolutely great for helping with the skin barrier, and they’re good for all skin types. Ingredients such as hyaluronic acid and glycerine are fantastic for moisture,” says El Muntasar. For softening, he also recommends shea butter and cocoa butter.If you’re concerned about the environmental impact of your products, facialist and product formulator Karen MacDonald says to “avoid mineral oils, [polyethylene glycols] and preservatives such as phenoxyethanol (usually derived from petrochemicals) to keep your environmental footprint low”.What are the best ingredients for very dry skin?Dry skin can be itchy, sensitive and even painful. “The goal is to restore moisture, strengthen the skin barrier and prevent water loss,” says skincare expert and facialist Laura Porter. “The best ingredients for this are those that hydrate deeply, lock in moisture and support long-term skin health.”She advises looking for ingredients such as glycerine, hyaluronic acid, urea, ceramides, shea butter, squalane, panthenol and colloidal oatmeal.What are the best ingredients for older skin?“Ingredients such as niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, squalane and peptides are phenomenal for older skin,” says El Muntasar. In order, these ingredients help improve elasticity, hydrate, soften, and boost collagen and elastin production in the skin, giving skin a plumper, smoother look over time.Porter also suggests looking for retinol, since it “boosts collagen production, smooths fine lines and improves skin texture”. It’s a brilliant, well-researched anti-ageing ingredient, but it can be strong, so “start with lower strengths if you’re new to it or have sensitive skin”, she says.Also, make sure you’re usinga good SPFalongside any moisturiser containing retinol because the new cells it helps to generate are more susceptible to sun damage. Left unprotected, your skin will end up with more irritation and sun spots long-term.Should I use a different body moisturiser in summer and winter?In short, yes.“Seasonality matters,” says El Muntasar. “You change your wardrobe, so you should also change your skincare. In winter, you want thicker and more occlusive formulas. Look for ingredients such as shea butter and ceramides.” The CeraVe intensive moisturising lotion and Green People scent-free body lotion listed above are fantastic choices for this.“In summer, choose lighter products such as lotions or gels with hydrating ingredients such as hyaluronic acid and glycerine,” says El Muntasar. I recommend the Ameliorate Transforming body lotion, the Charlotte Tilbury Magic body cream and Malin+Goetz Eucalyptus smoothing body gel for the summer.Sarah Matthews is aconsumer journalistand skincare enthusiast who can’t quite believe she gets to spend her days reviewing beauty products.

These crunchy batons of firm, creamy fish in soft white bread, often topped with a tangy sauce, are surely the UK equivalent of Mexican fish tacos or West African fish rolls – a quick, nutritious and very satisfying light meal or snack.View image in fullscreenSigne Johansen’s sandwich uses readymade fish fingers. All thumbnail photographs by Felicity Cloake.(NB: if you’re skim-reading this before leaping below the line to demand to know who needs a recipe for a fish finger sandwich, I can assure you a lot of people online seem to feel there’s a demand.) Given their popularity (indeed, this column was a reader request), I must echoHelen Graves, who prefaces her recipe thus: “I am bracing myself for the comeback on this one, because everyone (or at least everyone in the UK) has an opinion on what makes the perfect fish finger sandwich.” As ever, all feedback much appreciated!The fishThe classic and, of course, the easiest choice is to use readymade fish fingers,as Signe Johansen recommendsin her book Solo. For some, nostalgia makes this the only option, and I certainly wouldn’t knock it; modern fish fingers tend to be much chunkier than the weedy grey sticks of my childhood, in which the filling always looked mysteriously ready-chewed.However, there are advantages to making your own, principally that you can choose your own fish and precision engineer the coating. Most recipes I find call for cod or haddock, or both if you’re Graves, but Edinburgh’s Little Chartroom chef Roberta Hall McCarronuses sole, and north London “sandwich genius” (I quote About Time magazine)Max Halleythrows the door wide open, writing inMax’s Sandwich Bookthat “cod is back in vogue, but who knows? Haddock? Whiting and sole would be delicious”.View image in fullscreenHelen Graves salts her fish before making the fish fingers, which she then coats in panko breadcrumbs for extra crunch.As so often with fish, the best option is generally the one that looks freshest on the day, and is most sustainable. My preference, however, if it’s available, is for anything that comes in thick fillets, because I find the sole and the end of one of the haddock fillets too thin: it throws off the ratio of fish to crumb. Go for whatever fits the bill, though – I suspect hake would be an excellent choice.Graves salts the fish for half an hour before cooking, “to firm up the texture, so what you get is really satisfying flakes of well-seasoned fish, not mushiness”. Though they’re rinsed afterwards, I like the way this seasons the dish from the inside out, but I actually prefer the softer texture of fish salted just before cooking – it shouldn’t be mushy. If you have similar textural objections, however, this is a step you may like to consider.The coatingI’m relieved to find that no one batters their fish fingers; this is not a fish supper in portable form, but flour, egg and breadcrumb territory. Graves, Hall McCarron and Halley all plump for panko, the large flaked, white, ultra-crisp Japanese variety that’s taken the western crumbing world by storm in recent years; onlyKirsty Scobie and Fenella Renwick, proprietors of Ullapool’s Seafood Shack and authors of an award-winning book of the same name,recommendthe fluffier kind made from fresh bread.For me, all breadcrumbed fish is delicious, but for this purpose I slightly prefer the crunchier texture of fried panko – if I were baking the fish, I suspect I might go for fresh crumbs instead, because dry breadcrumbs will inevitably become even dryer in the heat of the oven. (Home-dried breadcrumbs would, of course, be a perfectly acceptable substitute.)Flavour-wise, you could just stick to salt and pepper, as Halley does, or you could capitalise on the freedom of making your own to spice things up a bit. The Seafood Shack chefs suggest chopped fresh herbs such as parsley and dill, while Graves describes her mix of panko and cayenne pepper as “super-crisp with just a tiny bit of warmth”, before going on to explain: “We also added a titchy pinch of MSG because we like to live on the edge in this house. That’s totally optional, just as long as you know that being scared of MSG is pointless.” Hall McCarron, meanwhile, mixes her panko with blitzed oats and pumpkin seeds, then flavours them with garlic and onion powder and nutritional yeast, on the basis that, as she points out in her bookThe Changing Tides: “You can’t go wrong with a fish finger sandwich. And you certainly can’t go wrong when the fish is coated in breadcrumbs and yeast flakes.”View image in fullscreenSaucy! Max Halley’s salad cream and tomato ketchup-embellished fish finger sandwichAll of these are very valid options – my testers and I particularly like the savoury notes that the yeast and MSG bring with them. And, though I haven’t included them in my recipe, I’d also urge you to give the pumpkin seeds in particular a go; they give the crumb an interestingly nubbly texture.The saucesPersonally, like Scobie and Renwick, I’m a tartare girl; the combination of rich mayonnaise cut with acidic pickles, savoury alliums (they use shallots, I like chives) and salty capers is perfect with fried fish. It seems, however, that this is not the will of the people – Graves describes tartare as “the fancypants choice” (guilty as charged, Helen), explaining that the key to a perfect fish finger sandwich “is to use a mayonnaise-based sauceandketchup. I know. You are reeling,” she continues kindly. “The reason it works is because the ketchup offers something I was always missing in the fish finger sandwich: sweetness. People tend to go OTT on the acidity, I find, adding lemon juice, capers, vinegar et al, but let me tell you once more – double-sauce is where it’s at.”Halley agrees, but he uses salad cream (a mayonnaise-adjacent sauce, I suppose?), describing the mix of that and ketchup as “SO good”. Mind you, he goes on to boast about blending a whole pork pie in the stuff to make a dip, so he’s definitely a salad cream superfan, whereas it reminds me of early 1990s school lunches, and not in a good way, I’m afraid.Halley boasts about blending a whole pork pie in the stuff to make a dip, so he’s definitely a salad cream superfanConfession time: I find ketchup too sweet and vinegary in most contexts – like chocolate, it’s a flavour bully, dominating everything it touches – but I’m well aware this is a minority opinion. My own second choice is Johansen’s punchy green Nordic dill salsa, which also contains parsley, anchovies, gherkins, capers, horseradish, lemon juice and olive oil. “Admittedly,” she writes, “a good old fish finger sarnie tastes incredible with just a good squirt of ketchup, but once in a while I like a fresh green sauce to grace those crispy little fish sticks. This dill salsa is a great way of using up any odds and ends you have in the fridge – such as sad, forgotten herbs, condiments and pickles. Treat the recipe as a guide and please do play around with the flavours to make it your own.”Lest you be in any doubt that ketchup is not the only choice available, Hall McCarron gilds her fish finger sandwich with a two-ingredient roasted garlic mayonnaise, bringing back happy holiday memories of mountains of fried seafood dunked inaïoli. No doubt most of you will probably shake your head at such notions, but don’t knock them until you’ve tried them.The extrasGraves favours the cool crunch of iceberg lettuce, while Halley prefers the oily one of crumbledScampi Fries(a particularly noxious, yet undeniably moreish brand of pub snack, for readers outside the UK). Hall McCarron makes a celeriac and butternut squash slaw flavoured with crushed wakame, which delivers crunch and a more subtle touch of the sweetness that Graves feels is missing without ketchup (it is also much less work than it sounds (grate both vegetables, add salt and seaweed powder).View image in fullscreenThe addition of minty peas make Fenella Renwick and Kirsty Scobie’s fish finger sandwich the catch of the day.My favourite extra, however, is theSeafoodShack’s minty peas: frozen petits pois, blitzed with mint and lemon juice, which brings sweetness, freshness, and comforting echoes of my childhood (not that we pureed them). As this is not your childhood, you should feel free to replace it, or indeed eschew any sort of garnish as an unnecessary complication of what should be a simple pleasure.The cookingIf you’re using bought fish fingers, baking is the way to go; it’s classic and low-faff. If you’re making your own fish fingers, however, I regretfully share the ill tidings that the baked versions are a poor second to the fried variety, and drier inside and out. You don’t need to deep-fry them, though; a few centimetres of oil in a frying pan will do the job, and if you’re going to the trouble of making your own fish fingers, you may as well cook them right, too.The sandwich breadView image in fullscreenBaptastic: Roberta Hall McCarron’s fish finger sandwich.When I see that more than half the recipes call for toasted bread, I begin to question everything I thought I knew about fish finger sarnies – surely most of the pleasure comes from the contrast in textures between bread and filling? For this reason, I will only countenance soft, fluffy white bread (a white tin loaf from my local bakery for me, though you may well be in the Halley Mother’s Pride camp). Or, Hall McCarron’s white roll would work (she mentions brioche, but I think a bap would be nicer). You can fight me on this in the comments; I won’t change my mind – though I will make an allowance for Johansen’s happy suggestion that: “If you’ve had a really rotten day, or spent it doing seriously strenuous exercise, fry the bread in butter”. That I might come round to.Perfect fish finger sandwichesPrep25 minCook8 minServes4For the tartare sauce (or use ketchup and/or mayonnaise)200g mayonnaise, bought or homemade1 tsp dijon mustard1 heaped tbsp chopped capers1 heaped tbsp chopped cornichons, or other vinegary gherkins1 heaped tbsp chopped parsley, or dill½ tbsp chopped chivesFor the fish fingers (or use eight ready made)2 skinless fillets thick white fish(about 400g) – eg, cod, hake, haddockSalt and pepper50g plain flour2 eggs125g panko breadcrumbs, or other dried breadcrumbs20g nutritional yeast flakes, or ½ tsp MSG powder (optional)Neutral oil, for frying8 slices good soft white bread, or 4 soft white rollsButter, at room temperatureFor the minty pea puree200g frozen peas1 small bunch fresh mint, leaves picked½ tbsp lemon juice1 tsp horseradish sauce(optional)View image in fullscreenStir all the ingredients for the tartare sauce in a bowl, then adjust and season to taste.

A few months ago, however, Suffolk’s food capital welcomed a soupçon of fancy-pants Spain in the form ofBellotaon Churchgate Street, not far from the abbey. Bellota bills itself as offering an “elevated tasting menu” (seven courses, and eight at weekends) and boasts only a maximum of 20 seats, all of them lined up around a counter overlooking married chefs Ruben Aquilar Bel and Gabriella Fogarasi at work.On its website, Bellota promises to be “relaxed and welcoming”, which before going I severely doubted, because tasting menus rarely are: “I found the chef’s 657-word soliloquy on artichoåkes very relaxing,” said no one ever. However, on entering the restaurant on a recent Saturday and finding a room hewn in a rhapsody of calm browns and golds, and Fogarasi herself greeting us at the door, well, Bellota actually felt rather zen. There is a cosiness here that doesn’t at all feel like your average flash-harry fine-dining metropolitan joint. On a sold-out night of two sittings, there were a mere four staff working all evening. There were no hostesses leading us 40 steps to our seats, no pushy sommeliers, no kitchens stuffed with staff ostentatiously shouting, “Oui, chef!”View image in fullscreen‘Not remotely amateur-hour’: Bellota’s hake with squid ink, salsa verde and padrón pepper.Bellota is homespun, sure, but it’s not remotely amateur-hour, and the meal service is gloriously well honed. Within mere moments of us taking our seats, warm loaves of Fogarasi’s sourdough bread appeared in cute hessian bags and with a glut of salted butter; we were offered more bread throughout the meal, just in case the tasting-menu portion sizes weren’t already sating enough. As Aquilar Bel talked earnestly about the txakoli he’d paired with his hake in salsa verde and escalivada vegetable raviolo, a satisfied hum of Suffolk folk eating good bread and butter enveloped the room.Bellota’s genesis has been financed byLinda Keenan, who has connections to London’s well-lovedNoble Rotandthe Clove Club, and, although dissecting something as grubby as money is unappetising, her golden touch matters. Bellota may well be the brainwave of two relatively unknown chefs and tucked away in a quaint West Suffolk market town, but there’s something hugely beguiling going on here, and even verging on swaggering.View image in fullscreen‘Yes, you heard that right’: Bellota’s Thai green curry ice-cream with confit apricots and pistachio cake.From the first snacks of hot, crisp, truffled croquetas – better than many I’ve tasted even in Spain – moving on to that masterful al dente raviolo stuffed with roast sweet red pepper and aubergine with just a touch of sherry vinegar, all dressed in a heavenly manchego sauce, it’s clear that this is a restaurant without so much as a hint of naivety.A hunk of south-west coast hake is crisscrossed with sombre-looking squid ink and served with a fiery green pepper sauce, a piece of grilled langoustine, a padrón pepper and a few palourde clams. Next, rare slices of Creedy Carver duck on a silky puree of heritage carrots with a slick of rich duck jus. Each dish, as we finish it with a sigh, is swept away and replaced like clockwork with something else sticky, rich or magnificent. The chefs move purposefully and in relative silence, with no flapping, no fussing, no shouting and no underlings locked in the walk-in freezer for “banter”. Just fabulous food. How very modern indeed.Bellota opened three months ago, and without much fanfare. Curious locals turned up, word of mouth spread, then people began travelling from around Suffolk, followed by the down-from-London brigade, me included. Twelve or so short weeks later, Bury St Edmunds’ residents – or the ones I met in the local shops, anyway – are now lamenting that they hadn’t booked sooner, and in the forlorn tones that are usually reserved for the likes ofNoma’s summer season tables. After eating at Bellota, I now feel bad for them, too, because this small, almost perfect joint will most likely win a Michelin star very soon, and then it’ll be bonne chance for anyone wanting to try Gabi’s Thai green curry ice-cream with warm pistachio cake and confit apricots. Yes, you read that right: I did say Thai green curry ice-cream. And, yes, it works. Don’t try this at home, people.View image in fullscreenBellota’s ‘tantalising’ pre-dessert of goat’s cheese, walnuts and membrillo sorbet.In fact, all the sweet things here are done wonderfully, including the tantalising pre-dessert of monte enebro goat’s cheese with candied walnuts and glossy membrillo sorbet; rumour tells me there’s sometimes sourdough ice-cream, too. There are also some very good petits four, including immaculate black olive bonbons with a sweet tapenade filling. Yes to all of this, and to one of my top five openings of 2025.​Bellota, 43-45A Churchgate Street, Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, 01702 844890.

Or a clothes retailer says that it is with sadness he has decided to shut up shop and needs to get rid of his remaining stock.But the “sadness” of a business closing also brings an opportunity to bag a bargain – perhaps a cut-price leather jacket, or 50% off the last merino wool sweaters in the warehouse.Such ads are commonplace on social media, but, in some cases, they are simple scams where you hand over money only to receive nothing.Or perhaps you will end up with a jacket or sweater that barely resembles what was advertised, or is of a much lower quality than expected.View image in fullscreenAds published by two separate accounts on Facebook, Instagram and other social media. The text is almost identical, even though the companies are said to be different.Photograph: FacebookMarta Mallavibarrena, a cybersecurity researcher based in Madrid, was browsing Instagramwhen she saw four different shops all using the same language (“Sadly, we are closing …”) about a sale. Some were offering men’s jackets, while others were selling animal print clothing.When she searched the ad library of Meta (owner of Facebook and Instagram), she found 50,000 ads had used the same phrase, and 1,600 were still active at the time. Most of the accounts which published the ads had been around for a short time, and those that were older had typically changed their profile names in recent weeks.Using similar marketing tactics is not a crime, says Mallavibarrena. But often real images from reputable shops were being taken and used across the “closing down” ads.The sites are industrialised social engineering – leveraging cheap ads, fake urgency and rapid rebranding to take money from thousands of consumers before disappearingSerpil Hall, consultant on fraudIn cases where buyers actually get something delivered, the products will often come from large, cheap online retailers or so-called “drop shipping” sites: third party companies which ship products directly to consumers.“While you might get something delivered, it’s not going to be reflective of what’s there on the ad,” says Mallavibarrena. “It’s going to be something like a polyester T-shirt with the knitting pattern printed on it, instead of an actual knitted sweater.”Serpil Hall, a consultant on fraud and economic crime, says hundreds of such accounts can be set up at once using emotive language with a sense of urgency to draw people in.“In many cases no goods are ever shipped – the site disappears after collecting payments. In some other cases, counterfeit, or poor-quality goods arrive (sweatshirts, watches, trainers), often traced to very low-cost bulk suppliers,” she says. The accounts will often be abandoned, or renamed, once negative reviews start to build up on them.What the scam looks likeThe post will say that a company is closing down and has a limited amount of stock available. This tactic uses the scarcity principle, which says that people place a higher value on things which are limited in availability.Sometimes there will be bigger discounts if you buy more than one item – for example, 20% off one and 40% off for two.Often the accounts that post the ads will look slick and – when glanced at very quickly – genuine. They may give an address, and sometimes have the city they claim to be based in as part of the name – such as London or St Louis. In reality, these formats can be endlessly repeated with false information and have no grounding in reality. Often the pictures that appear on them – of the founders, say – can be AI-generated.In one case highlighted by consumer group Which?,a boutique called Thompson Oxford said it had a “heavy heart and tears in my eyes” and could not compete with larger stores, so it had to close down and sell on its stock.Hall says that often the sites are not sophisticated. “They’re industrialised social engineering – leveraging cheap ads, fake urgency and rapid rebranding to take money from thousands of consumers before disappearing.”What to doThe age-old adage says that “if it is too good to be true, then it probably is”. And this is the case here. The fraudsters rely on people reacting quickly when faced with the offer of a bargain.So take a step back and immediately question whether the ad you are looking at could be a scam.Start with the comments on the profile page of the account which will give you an indication of whether people got the goods they ordered, and what the quality was like.You can checkMeta’s ad libraryto see whether the text from the ad is replicated elsewhere. Doing a reverse image search, on Google Images for example, will allow you to see where else the pictures may be appearing.You cancomplain to Metaabout misleading contents, or a possible scam on its platforms. Its rules say that ads “must not promote products, services, schemes or offers using identified deceptive or misleading practices, including those meant to scam people out of money or personal information”.Explore more on these topicsScamsScam watchConsumer affairsConsumer rightsRetail industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

        "Content": "Cameron Mofid at Windansea Beach, La Jolla, California. Photograph: Ariana Drehsler/The GuardianCameron Mofid was 20 when his mental health worsened during Covid. In need of a distraction, he began scrolling travel sites, and realised there was an extraordinary record he could potentially break. His journey would change everythingByAmmar KaliaSun 24 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTShareIn May 2020, a month into the first Covid lockdown in Miami, Florida, 20-year-old student Cameron Mofid found his obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) beginning to spiral out of control. “I was first diagnosed with the condition when I was 12. It produces obsessive thoughts that drive compulsions like washing hands, tapping or endlessly replaying conversations. When I was alone in the apartment with nowhere to go during Covid, those intrusive thoughts got much worse,” he says. “It can become paralysing being stuck in a mental loop. It was worrying and I felt like I really needed to get out of my head and that space.”With nothing else to do, Mofid began searching through travel destinations on his laptop, hoping for a near future where borders would reopen and he could leave. As he scrolled, he came across a fact that would change his life. “I saw that more people had been to space than had visited all 195 countries in the world,” he says. “I was shocked that so few people – about 300 – had seen the world, and I also learned that, according to thetravel platform and community, Nomad Mania, the age of the youngest person to visit every country at that time was 27. I wanted to do something impossible: I decided to beat that record.”The age of the holder of the Guinness World Record for the feat, at the time,was 21, butMofid noticed that the Guinness World Records rules had allowed the use of airport transits to gain new border stamps, in lieu of actually spending time in each country. Mofid wanted to break the record according to the rules of Nomad Mania, which meant setting himself the extra challenge of not only leaving the airport in each country but also spending at least a few days there.View image in fullscreenMofid in North Korea, having completed his 195-country odyssey.Photograph: Courtesy of Cameron MofidFive years later, on 6 April 2025, only a few weeks after his 25th birthday, Mofid crossed the finish line and claimed the record in Pyongyang, North Korea. He wasone of the first foreignersto enter the country in six years, forming part of a delegation allowed into the city to run a marathon. “I couldn’t believe it was real,” he says. “There were 50,000 people in the stadium cheering us on and my adrenaline was so high that at one point I thought I might even win the race!”Speaking from his parents’ home in San Diego, California, where he has been living for the past four months since his return, Mofid sports a close-cropped beard and is full of energy and enthusiasm, despite describing how, during his five years spent travelling, he experienced everything from severe illness in Algeria to imprisonment in Djibouti, detainment in Afghanistan, and witnessed horrifying poverty in Nigeria. “It’s no exaggeration to say it’s been life-changing,” he says. “My OCD has been much better for it and I’ve witnessed the kindness in humanity, as well as the luck that sees some of us born into privilege and others into awful poverty. I now want to do something with the rest of my life that has purpose.”View image in fullscreen‘It’s no exaggeration to say it’s been life-changing’ … Mofid in Afghanistan.Photograph: Courtesy of Cameron MofidGrowing up in the coastal neighbourhood of La Jolla, San Diego, Mofid was raised by Egyptian and Persian American parents who encouraged him to take an interest in the wider world. “I would play a game where my grandmother called out the names of countries and I had to find them on a world map we had in the garage,” he says. “I was fascinated by the world and became really interested in visiting places like Lesotho and Somalia – not the usual places a kid might end up on holiday.”While his parents would take him every year to Egypt, where his grandmother eventually relocated, it was actually through his love of tennis that Mofid started travelling more widely. Training as a promising junior player, he achieved an international ranking and at 17 moved to Naples, Florida to join a tennis academy. It was there that he broke his elbow and, after two surgeries, was forced to retire from the game at 18.Faced without a future in the sport, Mofid decided to spend a gap year writing about tournaments for Florida Tennis magazine. “I spent that year covering professional tournaments in cities like Hong Kong, Marrakech, Milan, London and Singapore, and it was the first time I felt something shift in me,” he says. “Travel gave me a kind of escape from my OCD. I was breaking away from stressful situations in my mind and exploring new environments that my OCD hadn’t seeped into. I didn’t feel trapped in the same way.”When I entered Afghanistan, a member of the Taliban holding an enormous machine gun offered me teaOnce he returned and enrolled at the University of Miami in 2019, Mofid continued to travel, as an escape from his OCD symptoms and the confines of his dorm room. He began working nights as a club promoter in Miami, selling entry tickets and packages to partygoers, to fund weekend trips to Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador and Nicaragua. By the time the world ground to a halt during Covid, he estimates he had already been to 50 countries.Still, if he was to beat the record for visiting every nation in the world, there was planning to be done and money to be made – in order to reach the other 145 locations. He took extra credits at college so he could graduate earlier, while he expanded his freelance club-promoting into a nightlife business, holding events around the city. “I was at college in the day and then working nights, often until 4am, scanning tickets and dealing with drunk 21-year-olds,” he says. “In March, during spring break, we had 30 events in a row. I was exhausted but it was worth it to fund my trip.”View image in fullscreenMofid in Sudan in his graduation gown, with local villagers.Photograph: Courtesy of Cameron MofidBy December 2022, Mofid had completed his studies – including an MBA whittled down from two years to seven months – and had constructed a master spreadsheet of countries to visit, planned routes and airline costs. “My parents were worried about me going to places like Afghanistan and Iraq, but I took my last exam, packed my duffel bag and the next morning I flew out to Sudan,” he says with a smile. “I went to the ancient Nubian pyramids six hours from Khartoum, put on my graduation gown and got villagers to take pictures with me. I’d missed graduation back home but this was already so much more memorable.”Planning trips by region, Mofid spent the next two years veering between running his nightlife business in Miami and heading off for a month or two to tick off as many countries as possible on his list. “I would visit anything from seven to 20 countries at once, planning everything meticulously to keep to a really tight budget. Usually, as soon as I got home from one trip, I was so excited I’d plan the next one the next morning,” he says. “The longest stint I went on was three months, which was my second to last trip. I started in Oman and then went to Iran, Dubai, Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Russia, and then bussed and walked to Estonia.”View image in fullscreenAt the barber’s in Pakistan.Photograph: Courtesy of Cameron MofidWhen Mofid found out that air travel was suspended to Afghanistan while already en route through the United Arab Emirates, he had to enter via the notoriously dangerous Torkham border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. A local fixer encouraged him to dress in Afghan robes and to grow a beard in order to blend in, but he was immediately detained by Pakistani police on arrival, who were confused as to why an American citizen was disguising himself. “I was interrogated about my travels and tried to explain that I was just a tourist, not a spy, while in front of me another man was being whipped. It was terrifying,” he says. “Thankfully, I was released – and as soon as I crossed into Afghanistan, a member of the Taliban holding an enormous machine gun offered me tea.”In Djibouti, meanwhile, a market seller called the police after spotting him taking photos of the psychoactive substance khat. “Everyone surrounded me and I tried to talk my way out of it but I was taken straight to the local jail,” he says. “It was 43C (110F), they took my phone and I had a flight to catch that night. After half a day of waiting, the head of the national police arrived to interrogate me. Once they saw selfies of me at various locations they realised I was just a tourist and released me, but they told me to not come back.”View image in fullscreenAt a waterfall in Laos.Photograph: Courtesy of Cameron MofidWhile some might see these experiences as naive, Mofid is keen to emphasise the importance of what he has learned on his travels. “Travelling has made me so much more attuned to people’s stories and the complexities of what’s happening in the world,” he says. “Nothing is black and white, and we need to start treating migrants with humanity. People, at their core, are inherently good. In country after country, I was met with kindness. In Suriname, a man gave me shelter and a meal in his shack during a storm, and in Baghdad, everywhere I went, people offered me tea and hospitality, regardless of the fact that I am American. People who had almost nothing were willing to offer me everything; I realised that the more you travel, the more you realise how little you actually know.”In Nigeria, the 115th country he visited, Mofid spent time inthe Makoko slumon the outskirts of Lagos, which is partly built on stilts over water. “It was the worst poverty I’ve ever seen, with more than 100,000 people living over sewage water,” he says. “Only 15% of kids in that section of Makoko go to school and they are totally cut off from the rest of the city. The one school we did visit, the teachers hadn’t been paid in months and most of the students lacked supplies. I decided I had to do something to help so I set up a GoFundMe.”Raising a few thousand dollars from fellow college students, Mofid was about to end the campaign in January 2023 when a donation for $45,000 came through from NBA player Kyrie Irving. “With that amount of money, I felt I had a responsibility to be a custodian,” he says. “I had been coming home between my trips and watching people drop $50,000 on a night out in Miami; that’s enough to fund an entire school in Makoko. It isn’t how the world should work. I left the business and the following month I foundedthe charity Humanity Effectas a way to support that community.”View image in fullscreenMofid with pupils at the school rebuilt by his charity, Humanity Effect, in Makoko, Nigeria.Photograph: Cameron MofidTwo and a half years on, Mofid has completed the construction of a second school, built an orphanage for 40 students and led a medical mission to Makoko. The charity is now his main focus. “Ninety per cent of our current circumstance in life is based on our birth, it’s the greatest luck we have,” he says. “These kids had bad luck and helping them is the thing in my life I’m most proud of.”Mofid also describes his OCD as “the best it’s ever been” since he began using his travels as exposure therapy to triggers such as dirt or unfamiliar social situations. “Through staying in places that were filled with worms or spiders or had no running water, I found the tools to manage it and reassure myself that I was OK,” he says. “Travelling can be very isolating and it taught me to be happy in my own company. Now, I can see OCD as my superpower, since it gives me a relentless curiosity – something that powered this mission to visit every country. I’m learning to accept it and live with it.”Mofid achieved his record, but it may already have been toppled. According to Nomad Mania, a 23-year-old recently completed the round-the-world challenge. But Mofid believes the experience itself was worth the effort. “Travel teaches you the value of curiosity and empathy, and there are plenty of places I’d like to go back to and explore more thoughtfully,” he says. “Top of the list is Japan and then probably Iraq. First, though, I’ve never been to New York, so there is still plenty to see at home, and lots of time now to get there.”Explore more on these topicsObsessive-compulsive disorderMental healthinterviewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.There are four major hubs for sleeper services across western and central Europe: Amsterdam, Berlin, Vienna and Zurich. Then there are secondary nodes at Budapest, Brussels, Milan, Munich, Paris and Prague. Most of the region’s night trains start or end in one of these 10 cities. Whatever your departure point, savour the moment by going for an aperitif and a relaxed dinner before boarding. And upon arrival, don’t just dash on – linger over a coffee and let the morning, and the city, develop around you.Amsterdam CentraalForÖBB NightjetstoBasel, Innsbruck, Munich, Vienna and Zurich; andEuropean SleepertoBerlin, Dresden and PragueDon’t miss the excellentGrand Café Restaurant 1e Klasin the former first-class waiting room (entrance via platform 2B). It opens at 9.30am, so the perfect spot for breakfast after decanting from a Nightjet (or an early-morning Eurostar from London), and stays open till late evening, so also ideal for pre-departure supper. It serves fairly priced Dutch staples in a space that oozes retro flair.

It gets another black mark for the lack of showers for passengers arriving on overnight trains, but a big plus for being at the very heart of the city it serves – its enchanted canal network is right outside the station.Just head south from the station to hit the main sights. If, like me, you prefer to cut away from the crowds, then leave the station on the north side and hop on the F4 ferry for a free 15-minute ride to theNSDM Wharf, an old shipyard that is now a creative and cultural hub with many alt-vibe cafes.Berlin HauptbahnhofView image in fullscreenA stroll by the Spree River is an ideal prelude for a long distance train journey from Berlin.Photograph: John Kellerman/AlamyFor ÖBB Nightjets toBasel, Graz, Paris, Vienna and Zurich;SJ/RDCorSnälltågettoStockholm;MÁV EuronighttoBratislava, Prague and Budapest;European Sleeper toAmsterdam and Brussels; and, from later this year,PKPICnight sleepers toChelmandPrzemyślin eastern PolandA multi-level essay in glass with a striking vaulted roof, the station is on five levels, with level 0 in the middle and trains departing/arriving on levels -2 and +2 – all utterly confusing for a first-timer.

Later photograph: Pål Hansen/The Guardian. Styling: Andie Redman. Grooming: Alice Theobald at Arlington Artists using Rhug Wild Beauty and Charlotte Tilbury. Archive photograph: courtesy of Sam RyderBorn in Essex in 1989, musician Sam Ryder found fame covering hits on TikTok during the 2020 lockdown. In 2022, he represented the UK at theEurovisionsong contest, finishing second to Ukraine with his hit Space Man. The following year, he was nominated for best new artist at the Brit awards. Ryder headlines the Ovo Arena, Wembley, on 6 November, and his new single, OH OK, is out now. He lives in Essex with his partner, Lois Gaskin-Barber.This was taken atThe Underworld in Camden, north-west London, when I was in a band called the Morning After with my friends from school. The gig was probably awful – but what we lacked in tightness, we definitely made up for in enthusiasm.When I look at this photo, I see the arrogance of youth. I’d have probably got wasted after the gig and stayed up all night. The foot on the amp – it’s like I’m playing the part of a rock star. I was convinced we were going to make it, and I had no insecurities whatsoever, which is a total superpower at 19. As you get older, that kind of mindset can cause problems – arrogance and a detachment from reality. But when you’re young, it fuels your dreams. If I wasn’t deluded, what else would I have had? I came from a working-class family, I had no foot in the door. All I had was my ambition and the stories I could tell.The Morning After’s music was an amalgamation of Iron Maiden, Sum 41 and Megadeth, but I couldn’t write anything nearly as good as those bands. That didn’t stop us from touring in mainland Europe, mostly playing to no one. The alternative was working full-time in an industry I wasn’t passionate about. Instead, we borrowed my bandmate’s van from his tiling job, and played wherever anyone would let us.Tim Minchin looks back: ‘Entertainers say we want to change the world, but really we just enjoy being clapped’Read moreMy dad was a carpenter, my mum worked in Bootsand then as a dental assistant. They grafted every hour they could. My parents didn’t have connections in the music world, but they did everything they could to help me get there, like driving me to gigs. For a while, I had a job in McDonald’s, but I got into a fight with some people who came into the drive-thru one night. I’ve always had long hair, apart from one unfortunate haircut I had as a kid where I looked like Mr Spock. Maldon in Essex could be a hostile environment for anyone who looked “alternative”. My dad didn’t want me doing shifts there any more, so I ended up working part-time with him in carpentry and labouring on building sites.After the metal band broke up, I joined a punk band called Close Your Eyes. It was a proper rock’n’roll lifestyle – drinking, smoking, being a nuisance and barely being able to sing the next day. But after a few years of touring, my bandmates met their girlfriends and started to put their instruments down for something more settled. Lois, who I’ve been with for 13 years, is my first real girlfriend. Before I met her, all I wanted was a life on the road. Not that I actively avoided female attention – I was awkward, with braces and a mullet. Nobody was coming forward! But it did mean I had a lot of spare time to obsess over Megadeth songs in my bedroom instead.In my mid-20s, the delusion was finally overand I made a promise to myself that I’d stop joining new bands that were on the brink of breaking up. I was like a flea on the back of a series of dead dogs, and it was all about ego. I just wanted people to see I was touring the world, so they’d think, “Wow, he has been a successful artist since leaving school!” The reality was, I had no kind of foundation or constant in my life. I also had no money. I remember, after one tour, being in line at Nando’s and trying to pay for my order, but my card getting declined. I went to the ATM and realised I was over my overdraft. At that moment, I thought, “I’m fed up with this. Something has to change.” I was constantly seeing friends on Facebook moving into new houses or celebrating work promotions. Meanwhile, I couldn’t afford a chicken wrap in a business park in Leicester.If I don’t have balance in my life, I lose my spark – it’s why I live in the countryside and keep my circle smallAfter that, I decided to focus on my own music and started recording in my parents’ shed. It was then that Mum suggested I start a wedding band. For eight years, me and my friends made a business out of it. I learned about taking care of my voice and what it means to really be a musician, rather than just pretending to be a rock star. There was no ego, because nobody cared about what I was doing musically. Things would always go wrong. Once, a couple had told us a different first dance from the one they actually wanted and we needed to figure out the new one on the spot, and there were times where big family fights erupted and we had to keep on playing. But, mostly, we just made a lot of people happy.It took until I was in my 30s for my solo careerto take off. It was in lockdown, and I was posting TikTok videos from my parents’ shed. The stars aligned, my profile got a lot of traction and I was blown away by the response. It was incredible, but also a strange sensation, as I was starting to make peace with just playing weddings. Instead, my life changed overnight.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It’s a poisoned chalice. You’re going to ruin your career.” In the end, I trusted my heart. On the night of the results, I had the Ukrainian flag with me in my pocket. The scores were coming in and it was close. But I knew that I couldn’t go up and accept the award. Eurovision has always been about putting a spotlight on something that needs it, and I was adamant, however high we scored, Ukraine were the real winners.At the start of my career, I inadvertently built a brand around myself. This sort of sunny, optimistic person. It wasn’t strictly who I was, because no human on Earth is like that all the time. We all have seasons. It wasn’t fake, either – I was just stoked to have this opportunity. I thought that bringing negativity into a conversation was bad manners and that I should put a smile on my face, no matter how I felt. Now, I’m trying to have more authentic connections with people, and I don’t feel the pressure to be an endlessly positive caricature.Thereare still dayswhen I feel an immense lackof self-confidence and lose my spark, but now I know how to get balance back in my life. It’s why I like to live out in the countryside, why I don’t subscribe to famous friends and keep my circle small, because all the people that were there at the beginning are still here now.I may not have fronted the biggest band in the world, as I thought I was about to when that photo was taken, but without that failure I’d have also never tasted defeat. It tastes horrible, but it’s the best suit of armour you will ever get.Explore more on these topicsFamilyFlashbackSam RyderPop and rockPhotographyEurovisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now I want to know whyYou’re courageous to be facing up to this trauma. It’s time to empower yourself and explore your life storyAnnalisa BarbieriSun 24 Aug 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 24 Aug 2025 08.47 EDTShareI am 83, and my life seemstohave beenmostly happy.But after a year at art college, I sort of disintegratedand was sent to a mental hospitalafter Ihadtried to kill myself several times.My best explanationis thatlife was too difficult and painful. But why?In the hospital I had 15 electric shock treatments. After the first oneIdidn’t recognise my mum.I had a blinding headache, and the fear of never waking up was strong.I was givenantipsychoticdrugsandsedatives.I caused a lot of worry to my parents, but I couldn’t“pull myself together”.Looking back, I see myself as a caring person who helped the confused and unhappy ladies who were locked away in that massive old mental hospital, where, in a way, I felt at home.Afterwards, I decided to go to Italy, where I recovered gradually and stopped the medication.I started teaching English andenjoyed it.Since then, I have lived a full and in many ways successful life.But thequestion is, what happened to me?People make seemingly random decisions all the time, but when we look back they had more purpose than they seemed to and were often informed by our environment. You were courageous, and still are for writing to me and thinking about this difficult time in your life, which must have been traumatic. And like all trauma, it’s stuck in your memory as snapshots, which you are now trying to make sense of.Trauma memories aren’t laid down like regular memories in the brain. You can learn more about this by listening to thepodcastI did on this subject with Dr Joanne Stubley, a consultant medical psychotherapist who leads the trauma service for adults at the Tavistock and Portman NHS trust in England. I showed her your letter and we were both curious about what led up to your breakdown. Mental health issues were not always dealt with well in the early 1960s, and the landscape back then was, as Stubley describes it: “power-based and misogynistic”. Things aren’t perfect now, but there’s certainly more understanding.We also wondered what was happening around that time for you? What led to life being so difficult? Young people don’t have breakdowns and attempt suicide in a vacuum.Even in the psychiatric hospital you were looking after others. No wonder you’re now thinking, ‘What about me?’“You showed great resilience moving to Italy,” said Stubley. “You had the capacity to get yourself up and away [from a place where difficult things happened] to live a life where you were giving to others, teaching English.”Even in the psychiatric hospital, you said you were looking after others. No wonder you’re thinking, “What about me? Who was thinking of me?” It’s not unusual to have these questions as we age and realise we have more years behind us than ahead. “You seem to have great courage and capacity to ask yourself these questions,” said Stubley. “That sense you have of, ‘What happened to me? What really went on here?’ is impressive.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

A way to process it is to understand what happened. I wondered if you might try to find out if any of yourmedical notesfrom this time still exist.Stubley also suggested “starting to have conversations. It doesn’t have to be formal therapy. It could be with a good friend, a counsellor, anyone who would be able to offer you the space to explore and tell your life story so you may get more of an understanding of it. Are there any relatives alive from that time who you could talk to?”I thought it was interesting you made a geographical move, and to a place where English isn’t routinely spoken. You really left your old self behind, but now it’s time to integrate the two.

We’re particularly interested in talking to throuples living together under one roof, as well as throuples who are raising children as a unit of three parents. Is it easier to manage childcare duties when there are more adults in the room? Or more difficult?It is important that all parties agree to being featured. This means we need you to ask the other people involved whether they’re also willing to take part.We are hoping to feature existing throuples who are happily cohabiting, and also throuples who have broken up, and are willing to be candid about why they didn’t make it.

The plant was closed in May as the government shifts to renewables and liquefied natural gas.Trump says Xi told him China will not invade Taiwan while he is in officeRead moreThe small Taiwan People’s party proposed the referendum earlier this year, and with the backing of the much larger Kuomintang (KMT) passed the legislation for the vote, saying Taiwan needs reliable power supplies and not to be so reliant on imports.About 4.3 million people voted in favour of the plant’s reopening in the referendum, a clear majority over the 1.5 million who voted against, figures from the Central Election Commission showed.But the motion needed the backing of one quarter of all registered electors – about 5 million people – to get through under electoral law, meaning the plant on Taiwan’s southern tip will not reopen.View image in fullscreenPeople walk with the Maanshan nuclear power plant in the background in Pingtung.Photograph: Ann Wang/ReutersTaiwan’s government says there are major safety concerns around generating nuclear power in earthquake-prone Taiwan and handling nuclear waste.President Lai Ching-te told reporters on Saturday evening that while the referendum had failed, he understood “society’s expectations for diverse energy options”.“If, in the future, the technology becomes safer, nuclear waste is reduced and societal acceptance increases, we will not rule out advanced nuclear energy,” he said.In a separate vote on Saturday, electors rejected the recall of seven KMT legislators.A larger recall vote, to try to oust 24 legislators from the same party, alsofailed last month.Civic groups who hadrun the recall campaigns, with the backing of Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive party, accused the lawmakers of being too close to China and intentionally trying to snarl government spending and legislation, charges the legislators strongly denied.Explore more on these topicsTaiwanNuclear powerEnergyChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

In 2022, Giuffre and the prince reached an out-of-court settlement after she sued him for sexual assault.Knopf’s statement includes an email Giuffre wrote to Wallace 25 days before her death, stating that it was her “heartfelt wish” the memoir be released “regardless” of her circumstances.“The content of this book is crucial, as it aims to shed light on the systemic failures that allow the trafficking of vulnerable individuals across borders,” the email reads. “It is imperative that the truth is understood and that the issues surrounding this topic are addressed, both for the sake of justice and awareness.”Giuffre had been hospitalised after a serious accident on 24 March, Knopf said, and sent the email on 1 April. She died on 25 April at her farm in Western Australia, where she had lived for several years.“In the event of my passing, I would like to ensure that Nobody’s Girl is still released. I believe it has the potential to impact many lives and foster necessary discussions about these grave injustices,” she wrote to Wallace.Knopf’s statement says the book contains “intimate, disturbing, and heartbreaking new details about her time with Epstein, Maxwell and their many well-known friends, including Prince Andrew, about whom she speaks publicly for the first time since their out-of-court settlement in 2022.”Knopf editor-in-chief, Jordan Pavlin, said Nobody’s Girl was a “raw and shocking” journey and “the story of a fierce spirit struggling to break free”.In 2023, the New York Post reported that Giuffre had reached a deal “believed to be worth millions” with an undisclosed publisher.Knopf spokesperson Todd Doughty told AP that she initially agreed to a seven-figure contract with Penguin Press, but moved with acquiring editor Emily Cunningham after she was hired by Knopf as executive editor last year.Doughty declined to provide further details about the Epstein associates featured in Nobody’s Girl, but confirmed that Giuffre made “no allegations of abuse against [Donald] Trump”, who continues to face questions about the disgraced financier and his former friend.Nobody’s Girl is distinct from Giuffre’s unpublished memoir The Billionaire’s Playboy Club, referenced in previous court filings and unsealed in 2019. Through Doughty, Wallace says she began working with Giuffre on a new memoir in spring 2021.“Nobody’s Girl was both vigorously fact-checked and legally vetted,” a Knopf statement reads.Giuffre’s co-author on her memoir, Wallace, is an award-winning magazine and newspaper reporter whose work has appeared in the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times, among other publications.A representative for Andrew did not immediately return the AP’s request for comment. Buckingham Palace was asked for comment.Additional reporting by the Associated PressIn the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Here’s why they are wrong | Clear AirRead moreThe tussles are expected to play out in public on Monday, with Joyce’s bill to ditch the 2050 net zero target up for debate in the lower house.On Sunday, the shadow treasurer, Ted O’Brien, would not reveal whether he backed his state division’s motion but said he wasn’t surprised by the outcome, noting it passed “very strongly”.The Nationals leader,David Littleproud, remained defiant in taking the Coalition’s nuclear energy proposal to the next federal election.Sign up: AU Breaking News email“I think what we can do is obviously learn from the last election and not necessarily go down and model where the Australian taxpayer owns the nuclear power plants, but in fact just open up the market by lifting the moratorium and having them where existing coal-fired power stations are,” Littleproud told Weekend Today on Sunday.“I think that’s a sensible solution to say, let’s put everything on the table.”At the centre of the opposition’s climate and energy policy review is the future of its commitment to net zero targets.While the former Morrison governmentbrokered a deal with its junior Coalition party, then led by Joyce, in 2021 to support net zero by 2050, a growing number of Coalition members have been agitating for it to be dumped.The shadow home affairs minister, Andrew Hastie, described the net zero economy as a “moral hypocrisy” and a “scam” in a newsletter titled “Net zero is not the answer” to his supporters on Friday evening.“Australia has gone from an energy abundance to an energy famine in two decades,” he said.“Why? Because we are chasing fantasy climate targets, and lining the pockets of an aggressive green energy lobby with our hard-earned money.”Earlier this month,Guardian Australia reportedLiberal MPs had been sent a barrage of emails demanding they drop net zero targets or “risk losing our support” by a political campaigning group connected to conservative right-wing lobby group Advance.Liberal senator for South Australia Andrew McLachlan, a vocal supporter of net zero and climate action, said it was “not a ‘weakness’ to support targets to reduce pollution” at the time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He toldGuardian Australia in Augustany long-term emissions reduction from renewables would not make a meaningful difference to the climate and would cost households too much.Under the Albanese government, Australia has legislated a 2030 target to reduce emissions by 43% compared with 2005 levels. A 2035 target is expected to be announced in September before the UN climate change conference, or Cop30, in November.David Littleproud vows to take nuclear energy to next election and claims ‘no malice’ behind brief Coalition splitRead moreOn Monday, the independent MP, Zali Steggall, will also introduce a private member’s bill to legislate independent national climate change risk assessments every five years and a fully funded adaptation plan to risks that arise from it.Anational climate risk assessment– which includes modelling of future climate damage, estimates of the number of people who could be killed by worsening heatwaves and a mapping tool that forecasts flooding risk in suburbs across Australia – has been handed to the governmentbut remains unreleased.“Australia’s approach to climate risks is piecemeal and left to the whims of whichever party is in power,” Steggall said.“While we wait for the government to release its ‘one-off’ National Climate Risk Assessment, this bill ensures future climate risks assessments are independent of government and released in a timely and transparent manner.”Explore more on these topicsCoalitionEnergy (Australia news)Climate crisisEnergy (Environment)National partyAustralian politicsGreenhouse gas emissionsnewsShareReuse this content"

Kushner would be summoned to the foreign ministry on Monday, it added.Kushner’s letter follows another sent to Macron by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this week in which Netanyahu accused Macron of contributing to antisemitism by calling for international recognition of a Palestinian state, according to the Jerusalem Post.Macron has emerged as one of the more forceful critics of Netanyahu’s prosecution of the war in Gaza, particularly with regard to Palestinian civilian casualties, while Trump has steadfastly supported the Israeli leader.“Public statements haranguing Israel and gestures toward recognition of a Palestinian state embolden extremists, fuel violence, and endanger Jewish life in France. In today’s world, anti-Zionism is antisemitism – plain and simple,” Kushner wrote.Kushner’s son Jared Kushner is married to Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump, who converted to Judaism before their wedding in 2009. They have three children who are being raised Jewish.Macron has publicly criticized antisemitism as antithetical to French values and increased security to protect synagogues and other Jewish centres in response to antisemitic incidents linked to the Gaza conflict.France is home to western Europe’s largest Jewish population at around half a million people, as well as a significant Muslim community sensitive to the plight of the Palestinian people in Gaza.Both communities have reported a spike in hate crimes since Israel’s retaliatory offensive against the Palestinian militant group Hamas in the besieged coastal strip.Macron’s announcement that France would formally recognise a Palestinian state during a UN meeting in September drew a swift rebuke from Israel at the time.With the move, France is set to join a list of nations that has grown since the start of the Gaza war nearly two years ago.France is among at least 147 of the 193 UN members that now recognise or plan to recognise a Palestinian state, according to a recentNew York Times report.AFP contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsFranceUS foreign policyTrump administrationAntisemitismEuropeUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

He wants, President Trump wants, peace in Ukraine. The reaction to [the] Anchorage meeting, the gathering in Washington of these European representatives and what they were doing after Washington, indicates that they don’t want peace,” Lavrov said.The Alaska talks produced neither a ceasefire nor an agreement for Zelenskyy and Putin to meet, and was widely considered to be apublic relations triumphfor the Russian leader.Lavrov brushed aside Trump’s apparent frustration at the outcome and the US warning of “massive sanctions or massive tariffs or both” against Moscow. He said “yes” when asked if Putin wanted peace and said Putin and Trump respected each other, while assailingthe allianceof leaders such as France’s Emmanuel Macron, Germany’s Friedrich Merz, Britain’s Keir Starmer and European Union president Ursula von der Leyen who came to the White House last weekto bolsterZelenskyy’s visit.European leaders in recent days have pledged to support security guarantees as part of a peace agreement, although Russia hasflatly rejectedthe prospect of troops from countries in Europe being positioned in Ukraine.Trump hasruled out sending the US military, and on Friday it was reported that his administration hadblocked Ukraine’s useof US-supplied long-range missiles to attack Russia.Meanwhile, Canadian prime minister Mark Carney told Zelenskyy on Sunday that he backed Ukraine’s calls for robust security guarantees and that Canada would not rule out sending troops.Earlier, Lavrov became defensive when NBC asked him if Putin was “stringing along” Trump by appearing conciliatory to his peace overtures but continuing to bomb Ukraine, attacks which last week included anairstrike on an American electronics manufacturing companyin the west of the country.“It is not for the lawmakers or for any media outlet to decide what President Trump is motivated by. We respect President Trump because President Trump defends American national interests. And I have reason to believe that President Trump respects President Putin because he defends Russian national interests,” he said.Critics, including some conservative voices,are alarmedby what they see as Putin manipulating Trump over Ukraine and US elections.At home and abroad US policy chaos has one constant: Trump’s self-interestRead moreLavrov meanwhile denied that Russia attacks civilian targets including schools, hospitals and churches, hinting at Russia’s extraordinary claims throughout the war that Ukraine is attacking its own people.“Our intelligence has very good information, and we target only military enterprises, military sites or industrial enterprises directly involved in producing military equipment for [the] Ukrainian army,” he said.Vance appeared separately in the same Sunday morning program and insisted Russia deserved credit for indicating it was ready to end a conflict that Trump hassaid more than 50 timeshe would solve “in one day”, while in contrast the vice-president warned of a longer process.“I think the Russians have made significant concessions to President Trump for the first time in three and a half years of this conflict,” Vance said.“They’ve recognized that they’re not going to be able to install a puppet regime in Kyiv. That was, of course, a major demand at the beginning. And importantly, they’ve acknowledged that there is going to be some security guarantee to the territorial integrity of Ukraine.”Vance said historically that peace negotiations go “in fits and starts” and warned that he did not think ending the war was “going to happen overnight”.Vance said of Russia, in a comment that was not further clarified: “Should they have started the war? Of course, they haven’t. But we’re making progress”. Trump in Februaryblamed Ukraine, saying, “you never should have started it.”Any sanctions against Russia, Vance said, would be on a “case by case basis”, but he remained hopeful that US efforts could bring Zelenskyy and Putin together.“It’s complicated, but we’re going to keep on trying to convince these parties to talk to each other and continue to play the game of diplomacy, because that’s the only way to get this thing wrapped up.”Lavrov remained adamant that Russia also wanted peace, and acknowledged “Ukraine has the right to exist”. But he said it “must let people go”, referring to Putin’s demand that it give up Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula seized by Russia in 2014, as well as southern and eastern parts, such as the Donbas, captured since 2022, as part of a peace agreement.“In Crimea [they] decided that they belong to the Russian culture,” he said, citing adisputed 2014 referendumcondemned by most of the world as illegal.On Friday, Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat of Connecticut, said on CNN that stronger US action was needed because “Putin is not going to stop until we stop him.”Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS foreign policyTrump administrationDonald TrumpJD VanceVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinRussianewsShareReuse this content"

The IAEA has repeatedly warned of the risks of fighting near nuclear plants afterRussialaunched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.Russia’s defence ministry said at least 95 Ukrainian drones had been intercepted across more than a dozen Russian regions on Sunday, whenUkrainecelebrated its 1991 declaration of independence.Map showing location of drone strikes across RussiaUkrainian drones were also shot down over areas far from the frontline, including St Petersburg in the north-west. Firefighters responded to a blaze at the port of Ust-Luga in Russia’s Leningrad region, home to a large fuel export terminal. The regional governor said approximately 10 Ukrainian drones were shot down, and debris had ignited the fire.Ukraine’s outgunned army has relied heavily on drones to respond to Russia’s invasion, notably targeting oil infrastructure to hit one of the main sources of Moscow’s revenues for funding the war.Ukraine, meanwhile, said Russia had attacked with a ballistic missile and 72 Iranian-made Shahed attack drones, 48 of which the air force said had been shot down.A Russian drone strike killed a 47-year-old woman in Dnipropetrovsk, the eastern region’s governor said.Russia has recently claimed new advances in the war, including taking two villages in the eastern Donetsk region on Saturday.The Ukrainian commander-in-chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said on Sunday that Kyiv’s forces had reclaimed three other villages in Donetsk, which has emerged as the focal point for peace talks.The Ukrainian president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said at a ceremony to mark the anniversary of the country’s independence: “This is how Ukraine strikes when its calls for peace are ignored.”He added: “Today, both the US andEuropeagree: Ukraine has not yet fully won, but it will certainly not lose.

Meanwhile, tanks shelled houses and roads in the nearby Sabra neighbourhood and several buildings were blown up in the northern area of Jabaliya.Fire lit the skies from the direction of the explosions, causing panic and prompting some families to stream out of the city. Other residents said they would prefer to die and not leave.About half of Gaza’s roughly 2 million people currently live inGazaCity. A few thousand have already left, carrying their belongings on vehicles and rickshaws.Israel expands Gaza City offensive as UK decries West Bank settlement approvalRead more“I stopped counting the times I had to take my wife and three daughters and leave my home in Gaza City,” Mohammad, 40, told Reuters. “No place is safe, but I can’t take the risk. If they suddenly begin the invasion, they will use heavy fire.”Others said they would not leave, despite the explosions. “We are not leaving, let them bomb us at home,” said Aya, 31, who had a family of eight, adding that they could not afford to buy a tent or pay for the transportation, even if they did try to leave. “We are hungry, afraid and don’t have money.”Israel approved a plan earlier this month foran expanded military offensiveto seize control of Gaza City. It is not expected to move forces into the largely destroyed city centre for a few weeks, leaving room for mediators Egypt and Qatar to try to resume ceasefire talks.Still, Israeli forces have bombed the city and surrounding areas, and said on Sunday that forces had returned to combat in the Jabaliya area in recent days.Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, on Sunday vowed to press on with the offensive, which has raised alarm abroad and objections at home. On Friday, Katz said that Gaza City would be razed unless Hamas militants agreed to end the war on Israel’s terms and release all the hostages it still holds.Hamas said in a statement on Sunday that Israel’s plan to take over Gaza City showed it was not serious about a ceasefire. It said a ceasefire agreement was “the only way to return the hostages”, holding the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, responsible for their lives.UN-backed expertsdeclared on Fridaythat an “entirely man-made” famine is taking place in Gaza’s largest city and its surrounding area amid deteriorating conditions that threaten increasing deaths across the devastated territory.“This famineis entirely man-made, it can be halted and reversed,” the report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) said. “The time for debate and hesitation has passed, starvation is present and is rapidly spreading … If a ceasefire is not implemented to allow humanitarian aid to reach everyone in the Gaza Strip, and if essential food supplies and basic health, nutrition and [sanitation and water] services are not restored immediately, avoidable deaths will increase exponentially.”1:03UN agency says Gaza famine is direct result of Israel’s actions – videoOn Sunday, the Gaza health ministry said eight more people had died of malnutrition and starvation, raising deaths from such causes to 289 people, including 115 children, since the war started.Gaza’s civil defence agency reported at least 42 people had been killed in Israeli attacks on Sunday​.​Spokes​p​erson Mahmud Bassal said there had been several airstrikes around Gaza City​, including one in Sabra that killed eight people.​Attacks were also reported elsewhere across the territory, he said, with the “total tally currently rising to 42 dead”.Israel is fighting allegations at the world’s top court of committinggenocide in Gaza, where it has killed more than 60,000 people. Separately, the international criminal court (ICC) hasissued arrest warrantsfor Netanyahu and his former defence minister Yoav Gallant. It also issued an arrest warrant for the Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif, but later withdrew it after he was killed.‘Very sick and very tired’: the reality of famine for Gaza’s most vulnerableRead moreThe Associated Press reported that Israeli forces had killed four people seeking food aid on Sunday as they travelled through a military zone south of Gaza City – an area regularly used by Palestinians trying to reach a food distribution point.Al-Awda hospital and two witnesses told the Associated Press that the four Palestinians were killed when troops opened fire on a crowd heading to a site run by the Israeli-backed US contractor Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) in the Netzarim corridor area. It occurred hundreds of metres away from the site, the witnesses said.“The gunfire was indiscriminate,” Mohamed Abed, a father of two from the Bureij refugee camp, told Associated Press, adding that while many had fled, some people fell to the ground after being shot.Abed and Aymed Sayyad, another Palestinian seeking food among the crowd, said troops opened fire when a group near the front of the crowd pushed forward toward a distribution site before its scheduled opening.The Israeli military and GHF did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Reuters andthe Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

An Israeli air force official said on Sunday the missile most likely carried several submunitions “intended to be detonated upon impact”.“This is the first time that this kind of missile has been launched from Yemen,” the official said.Since Israel’s war in Gaza against the Palestinian militant group Hamas began in October 2023, the Iran-aligned Houthis have attacked vessels in the Red Sea in what they describe as acts of solidarity with the Palestinians.They have also frequently fired missiles towards Israel, most of which have been intercepted. Israel has responded with strikes on Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, including the vital Hodeidah port.Abdul Qader al-Murtada, a senior Houthi official, said on Sunday the Houthis, who control much of Yemen’s population, would continue to act in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.“(Israel) must know that we will not abandon our brothers in Gaza, whatever the sacrifices,” he said on X.Explore more on these topicsYemenIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The IPC, which represents a fastidious survey of available data, is regarded as the international gold standard in nutritional crises.Long-criticised by humanitarians in other emergencies for its overabundance of caution, the IPC’s declaration of Level 5 – “catastrophic” hunger – in Gaza is a significant moment.Famine, under the IPC’s exacting criteria, requires three critical thresholds to be passed: extreme food deprivation, acute malnutrition and starvation-related deaths, all of which are now visible in Gaza.A quarter of all Palestinians in Gaza are starving – more than 500,000 people – with that number expected to rise to more than 640,000 within six weeks.A mark of the IPC’s thoroughness is that despite the very strong suspicion that famine conditions exist in the far north of Gaza, it has not declared famine there because of a shortage of available reliable data.Inevitably,Israelhas called foul, accusing the IPC of being manipulated by Hamas and claiming that it is providing sufficient food to Gaza.That lie, however, is challenged not just by the IPC’s ruling but by the accumulation of all available evidence coming out of Gaza. Aid agencies large and small – including Médecins Sans Frontières’ clinics – have been collecting their own data of growing levels of acute malnutrition. Palestinian doctors, journalists and ordinary individuals have told their own stories of going without food for days, of dramatic weight loss and exhaustion.Those most vulnerable – the very young and very old, and those with pre-existing medical conditions – have begun dying as one would expect to see in an unfolding famine.Israel’s response has not been humanitarian. Its spokespeople and proxies have laboured to minimise the deaths, claiming those dying were dying anyway of other causes.Blocking foreign media from accessing Gaza to report independently, Israel has instead ferried in sympathetic social media “influencers” to Gaza to amplify its denials: that it is Hamas’s fault or the fault of the UN, whose main aid agency for Palestinians, Unrwa, Israel has banned from operating in Israel.As aid agencies complained in a joint letter earlier this month –accusing Israel of “weaponising” aid– new Israeli registration rules have hampered their ability to operate.Permissions for convoys either do not come, or are erratic or insufficient. Instead, Israel has pointed to its reliance on the private Gaza Humanitarian Foundation at whose sites hundreds ofaid seekers have been massacredby Israeli gunfire.What is most damning, however, is that the outbreak of full famine as described by the IPC and UN agencies has been fully avoidable.Amid growing warnings over recent weeks and months of the precariousness of nutrition in Gaza, Israel could have reversed course at any point to admit sufficient aid and create a credible mechanism for its safe and timely distribution. As the military occupying force in 75% of the Gaza Strip it has been under a legal obligation under international law throughout this period to ensure this distribution.As the Food and Agriculture Organization, Unicef, the World Food Programme and the World Health Organization said in a joint statement on Friday, they have “collectively and consistently highlighted the extreme urgency for an immediate and full-scale humanitarian response, given the escalating hunger-related deaths, rapidly worsening levels of acute malnutrition and plummeting levels of food consumption”.The UN secretary general,António Guterres, also has been clear. The Gaza famine is a “man-made disaster, a moral indictment and a failure of humanity itself” he said, calling for an immediate ceasefire, the release of all hostages still held by Hamas and unfettered humanitarian access.“People are starving. Children are dying. And those with the duty to act are failing. We cannot allow this situation to continue with impunity.”Instead of agreeing to a ceasefire and allowing an appropriate emergency response, Israel isthreatening a large-scale new offensiveprecisely where the famine is centred in Gaza City, which would forcibly displace once again up to 1 million already desperate, hungry and exhausted Palestinians with no evidence that Israel has made meaningful preparations to sustain such a huge movement of people.As David Miliband, the president and chief executive of the International Rescue Committee, said:“The IPC’s confirmation that all famine thresholds have been surpassed in Gaza City is a damning indictment of the failure to protect civilians and uphold humanitarian law. The warning signs have been flashing red for months. The IRC and others have called repeatedly for urgent action.“The IPC’s findings must be a wake-up call for the international community. Without immediate, unhindered humanitarian access and a ceasefire, more lives will be lost to starvation and disease. This is not a natural disaster, it is a man-made catastrophe, unfolding in full view of the world and entirely preventable.”The implication was made clear by the UN’s human rights agency: that the famine was a direct result of Israel’s actions. And because of that may amount to a war crime.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warFaminePalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelUnited NationsAntónio GuterresanalysisShareReuse this content"

None of us were prepared for this, and the pain of losing him so suddenly is impossible to put into words.“Our lives will never be the same without him, but his memory will live on in our hearts for ever.“We love you endlessly, Corrie, and we miss you more than words can ever say.

It’s worse than Brexit. In fact I could cope with that better.”Another veteran Labour MP backed up her comments saying that, in their experience, hostility towards politicians was worse now than it had ever been.Another MP said: “I’ve had some pretty unpleasant abuse. One [person] asked recently why I was hosting and supporting child rapists.” They added that the police had assured them those carrying out the abuse were “only a small online community”.Newer MPs also reported feeling the impact of a recent rise in tensions over issues including grooming gangs, small boats and asylum seeker hotels.The Green party co-leader and MP for Bristol Central, Carla Denyer, said the abuse she is sent had become “noticeably worse” in the last few months, “escalating in some cases to violent threats”, which she had reported to the police.“As a leftwing and queer woman MP who speaks up frequently in support of refugees and LGBTIQA+ issues, I attract a lot of misogynist and homophobic abuse,” she said. “I wish I was surprised, but sadly it feels inevitable in the current political environment as the far right in the UK and across the world feels more and more emboldened and validated by other political parties dancing to their tune.”She added: “It doesn’t matter how much you disagree with someone, threats of violence are never, ever appropriate. And they won’t silence me.”“It’s horrendous,” said another MP who was elected last year. “I’m having to deal with daily lies about asylum seeker hotels and HMOs, which are entirely fabricated and are leading to huge anger and fear.”Another female MP said: “I have received death threats in the last six months. The misogyny and the hate hasn’t really stopped since I was elected [last year], so it always feels like it has been pretty intense and is constant.”Many of the MPs who voiced concerns asked to remain anonymous, fearing they would attract further abuse if they spoke publicly about the issue.A speaker’s conference on the security of MPs found only just over half (52%) of those who responded to a survey felt safe in their role. The biggest concern reported by MPs was online abuse, followed by being recognised and abused in public.“I’ve fought four general elections and feel things sank to all time low – so far – in this last 2024 one,” another Labour MP, Rupa Huq, said.“The speaker’s conference, which I serve on, is investigating these issues and our witnesses have included Meta and X to the Electoral Commission, but their focus is during electoral campaigning or contests when, sadly, these issues rear their heads in between elections.”On Saturday, the MP Anna Dixon saidpolice were investigating death threatsover her position on a national inquiry into grooming gangs after Moore claimed she had been “dismissing calls for an inquiry since day one”.Dixon said she only voted against a Tory proposal for a national inquiry into grooming gangs because it included an amendment to the children’s wellbeing and schools bill. Moore said he condemned any threats of violence, but insisted he had raised “legitimate concerns”.Brendan Cox, the co-founder of the Together Coalition and the husband of the MP Jo Cox, who was murdered by a far-right terrorist in 2016, said mainstream politicians were fanning the flames of division. He said “difficult policy positions” needed to be debated more civilly.“Threats to MPs don’t come from nowhere,” he said. “When mainstream politicians use violent or extreme rhetoric, dehumanisation of opponents increases and violence becomes more likely.”On Sunday, protests continued against the use of hotels to house asylum seekers, with demonstrators decked in flags gathered outside the Castle Bromwich Holiday Inn in Birmingham and police in London standing guard outside the Britannia hotel in Canary Wharf.This weekend there was also acampaign to put up union jack and Saint George’s cross flagsacross the country gather pace. According to the anti-extremist groupsHope Not Hateand Stand Up to Racism, the campaign called “operation raise the colours” has been partly organised by well-known far-right figures.On Saturday, police in Basildon in Essex arrested a 33-year-old man on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offence and conspiracy to commit criminal damage, after a video appeared to show racist abuse being shouted as red crosses were painted on the walls of a row of white buildings in the town.In Stevenage, a man claimed he was attacked with a petrol bomb in the early hours of Saturday morning while hanging flags from lamp-posts. “It appears that the victim was struck by a glass bottle containing a lit rag and sustained a cut to his head,” Chf Insp Sarah Gilbertson of Hertfordshire police said, appealing for anyone with information to come forward.Amid the febrile atmosphere, the government has set out plans to introduce a fast-track asylum appeals process, which will speed up the removal of people with no right to be in the UK. Labour has also pledged to end the use of asylum hotels by 2029.“We cannot carry on with these completely unacceptable delays in appeals as a result of the system we have inherited, which mean that failed asylum seekers stay in the system for years on end at huge cost to the taxpayer,” said the home secretary, Yvette Cooper.Dan Jarvis, the security minister and chair of the defending democracy taskforce, said: “Vile threats and the intimidation of those who serve in public life is utterly unacceptable.“We are absolutely determined to ensure all elected representatives can carry out their democratic duties without suffering harassment and the defending democracy taskforce works to ensure a whole-of-government response to the threats to our democracy.“While there will always be a place for robust debate, there will never be a place for fear in our democracy.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumThe far rightOnline abuseLabourConservativesnewsShareReuse this content"

Because, even before I’ve gone to Notting Hill carnival, I’ve heard about it so many times. It’s something you see on TV, your friends tell you about it, and say: ‘You should come.

It wouldn’t be the same, for sure.“Knowing what carnival is – it’s about marching and the vibes and the energy – to put it in one space where people can’t move, it’s not going to be the same … I think it would definitely kill. A lot of people probably wouldn’t go that much.”Speaking in his Mayfair hotel room after his appearance at carnival, as part of a sponsorship deal with the clothing brand Puma, he said: “It was something I’ve never really experienced – a vibe where we come together and build something different.”View image in fullscreenRevellers at Notting Hill carnival on Sunday.Photograph: Toby Melville/ReutersSunday is traditionally family day at carnival. This year, it began with the J’ouvert celebration, with people covering each other in paint, coloured powder and chocolate.The festivities started in the morning on Great Western Road, where judges stood in a stall to watch the colourful float procession. A woman on glittering golden stilts walked past as an enthusiastic soca MC had the crowd jumping with their hands in the air.Fast-paced drumming could be heard and felt before the first parade arrived. The street was decorated with flutes, brass instruments, steel drums and costumes including giant colourful wings.View image in fullscreenCarnival attenders with orange paint and smoke grenades on Sunday.Photograph: Sopa Images/LightRocket/Getty ImagesFlags representing countries from Venezuela to Trinidad and Tobago were draped across the shoulders of people who danced and cheered down the road. A mixture of adults and children dressed in jewels, glittery wings, belts and headdresses leapt down the street followed by floats pumping out bass and music.As the Paddington Arts float drove past, the side of the lorry reading Let’s Dance Not Fight, the MC spoke of connection to the crowd and the dancers dressed in iridescent purples and blues for its Under the Sea theme.Along the side streets were rows of food and drink stalls serving jerk chicken, curry goat, Red Stripe and rum punch cocktails. On other streets, towering sound systems and stages had been set up playing reggae, dub and drum’n’bass. Locals leaned out of their balconies and windows and watched the celebrations below.This was Claudette Sparen’s eighth visit to carnival. Originally from Curaçao but living in the Netherlands, the medical worker said she loved everything about it. “The people are so nice, so polite, so happy – they are the best people I have ever met,” she said. “We love to be here. It’s bigger [than before] and there are a lot of young people. Everybody is having fun and you see different culture together. I love that.”View image in fullscreenThe children’s parade at Notting Hill carnival on Sunday.Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/Future Publishing/Getty ImagesSabina Challenger, from Hackney in east London, took part in the Perpetual Beauty float with her child. “Carnival is about unity and about bringing people together, about reminding the community what the West Indian community has brought to the UK,” she said.“It also helps us to remind us of where we came from. It stems from slavery and oppression but it’s a celebration in terms of how far we have come in not just the UK but the world.”All major music and sound systems were switched off at 3pm for three minutes to honour those who were killed in the 2017 fire in Grenfell Tower, which is still clad in scaffolding and wrapping, and looms over the carnival route. People also honoured Kelso Cochrane, who was murdered in a racially motivated attack in Notting Hill in 1959.Explore more on these topicsNotting Hill carnivalUsain BoltFestivalsLondonCaribbean food and drinkRacenewsShareReuse this content"

They grab on to the guide rope to help lower the balloon to a safe spot, helping it to avoid crashing into houses or parked cars.Georgia Balać, whose partner assisted with the landing using an emergency line thrown down by the pilot, told the Bedford Independent: “It was extraordinary. It came down quickly and uncontrollably, very nearly missing the terraced houses and pylons.“It made a near-perfect landing between parked cars on either side.”The British Balloon and Airship Club confirmed to the BBC it “landed without incident” and everyone was OK.Only 98 incidents involving hot air balloons occurred in the UK between 1976 and 2004, according to a report by ScienceDirect.The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is the independent aviation regulator in the UK. All ballooning operations must comply with strict CAA regulations to ensure optimal safety for passengers and crew members.One of the main requirements for commercial balloonists is a commercial balloon pilot licence.In April, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said it wasinvestigatingafter receiving a report about a collision in Essex caused by a malfunction with a hot air balloon’s aircraft’s envelope – the large, airtight, balloon-shaped bag where the hot air goes.Explore more on these topicsBedfordshireEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

There will be increasing amounts of sunshine and temperatures continuing to climb.“On Monday it will be a very warm and sunny picture for most. It will start to go downhill and rain will start to move in for Northern Ireland into the afternoon.”People planning to head to beaches on Monday or Tuesday are being advised to go to those with lifeguards as big waves are expected.From Tuesday onwards, spells of rain will be moving across all parts of the country, and it will be wettest in the west, Snell said.He downplayed the potential impact of Hurricane Erin on UK shores, which is now a category 2 storm moving eastwards across the North Atlantic.“It will be heavy at times in the west, but at the moment we’re not expecting too many impacts, and it may for farmers or anyone who needs the rain be welcome,” he added.On Wednesday, a band of rain will move across the whole country, and low pressure will remain until the weekend with further spells of rain.Hurrican Erin has lost some strength in the past week as it moved along the east coast of North America, having been classified previously as a category 5 storm, but has still caused more than2,000 people to be evacuated in North Carolinaand at least 60 swimmers to be rescued from rip currents at Wrightsville Beach on the state’s southern coast on Monday.Explore more on these topicsUK weatherNotting Hill carnivalnewsShareReuse this content"

The government is seeking to prove the funds were part of a long pattern of bribing election officials by Smartmatic, the voting machine company, which suedFox Newsfor defamation after the 2020 election.A separate court filing in a lawsuit brought by Fox News against LA county to obtain records about Smartmatic’s relationship with Dean Logan, LA county’s registrar-recorder and county clerk who oversees elections and the Smartmatic contract, Fox News asserts that Logan may have received inappropriate gifts from the company in the form of business-class travel and upscale restaurant meals. Logan is supposed to report vendor gifts above $50 on annual disclosure forms, but records obtained by Fox News and included in the court filing show he did not report some gifts from Smartmatic. Logan maintains he was not required to report the travel or a meal that Fox highlights in its filing. Fox News is seeking the records from LA county to support its defense against a defamation suit filed against it by Smartmatic in 2021.Last year, prosecutors in Florida filed corruption charges against the president of UK-based Smartmatic, along with two other current and former executives, for allegedly operating a years-long bribery and money-laundering scheme that paid bribes to an election official in the Philippines. The justice department has since said that the scheme involved payments to officials inVenezuelaas well, where the company obtained its first elections contract in 2004.US election integrity activists have long been concerned about Smartmatic’s contract with LA county, due to the company’s controversial history, the founders’ ties to Venezuela and a lack of transparency over company ownership. The company first tried to get into the US elections market in 2006, but a federal investigation into its ownership and potential ties to the Venezuelan government at the time put a halt to its US ambitions until it obtained the contract with LA county in 2018. Concerns about the company and its role in US elections increased last year when the justice department indicted its executives.The new revelations about the LA county money raise even more questions about the county’s contract. Prosecutors allege that the Smartmatic executives conspired for years with the owner ofJarltech International, a hardware maker in Taiwan that manufactured voting machines for Smartmatic, to overcharge customers for the systems it built then used the excess money to pay bribes to election officials in the Philippines and Venezuela. Prosecutors do not say if they overcharged LA county as well or if any LA county money actually got paid out in bribes to anyone – only that some of that money made it into slush funds that had been used in the past to pay bribes. The justice department declined to answer questions about the case but said in a court filing that it has documents and witness testimony to support its claims about LA county’s money.Smartmatic itself has not been accused of wrongdoing, only the three executives. But a Smartmatic spokesperson says the justice department allegations are “filled with misrepresentations” and also says the company operates “ethically” and abides “by all laws always, both inLos Angelescounty and every jurisdiction where we operate”.The new allegations are not part of charges the justice department brought against the Smartmatic executives. Prosecutors are only asking a Florida court to allow evidence about the LA county money to show a pattern in how the executives managed their alleged bribery and money-laundering scheme.After news of the indictments broke last year, the county barred the three executives from any further association with its Smartmatic contract but did not “debar” the company itself, something it can do if a contractor shows a lack of “business integrity or business honesty”. The county can also terminate a contract if a vendor gives any county officer or employee “improper consideration” in the form of travel, entertainment or tangible gifts to secure favor. But Logan’s office says it stands by its work with the company. With regard to the implication that LA county money that got into the slush funds might have come from overcharging the county, Logan says the county’s contract with Smartmatic uses fixed pricing.“The alleged actions in the federal matter are unrelated to the work performed under contract by Smartmatic for Los Angeles County,” according to a statement sent by Logan in an email. “The County has no knowledge or visibility into how Smartmatic USA used proceeds from that contract; however, the County does validate work performed and deliverable requirements aligned to the fixed price structure of the contract prior to making any payments.”The contract runs through March 2027, but has three, two-year extension options that, if exercised, would stretch the agreement to 2033. It also does allow for changes in pricing up to 10% of the contracted amounts.The three indicted executives include company president and co-founder, Roger Alejandro Piñate Martinez Jr; Jorge Vasquez, former vice-president of hardware development for Smartmatic’s US division; and Elie Moreno, who oversaw the company’s contracts. According to a company bio, Piñate, who goes by Roger Piñate, played a “critical” role in winning the LA county contract and was chief operating officer until becoming president in 2018, the year Smartmatic won the Los Angeles contract.Piñate is a Venezuelan citizen and permanent US resident, and Elie Moreno is a Venezuelan-Israeli. The company put Piñate and Moreno on administrative leave after the announcement of their indictments last year, and currently Ruliena Piñate, Roger’s cousin, oversees Smartmatic’s LA contract with another employee. She was co-president with her cousin before his indictment. Vasquez, a US citizen, left Smartmatic in 2021 in the midst of the justice department investigation. The justice department accuses him of receiving direct kickbacks for his role in the alleged scheme.ControversialbeginningsSmartmatic has been dogged by controversy almost since its founding in Florida in 1999 by Piñate and two fellow Venezuelan engineers – Antonio Mugica and Alfredo José Anzola – as a network applications developer.The company shifted to voting machines in 2004 when then-Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez was threatened with a recall referendum. Months before the recall election, Venezuela’s National Electoral Council announced it would replace the country’s six-year-old voting machines with new ones under a $91m contract awarded to Smartmatic, Bizta – a small software firm owned by Mugica and his father – and the state-run telecom CANTV. Smartmatic and Bizta got the contract despite having no experience in voting machines or elections. There were other concerns about the deal as well: the Venezuelan government owned 28% of Bizta through a $200,000 investment in the firm, a close associate of Chávez was on Bizta’s board, and two of the five members of the electoral council denounced the contract, citing irregularity with the bidding process.Chávez survived his recall battle, though not without additional controversy: he and his supporters were accused of rigging the election based on an outcome that differed from an exit poll. However, after an audit of the results, the US-based Carter Center, which monitors overseas elections, supported the outcome, as did the US state department.Riding its success in Venezuela, Smartmatic tried to enter the US elections market in 2006 by using money from the Venezuela contract to buy the California-based Sequoia Voting Systems, whose voting systems were used across the US. The purchase caught the attention of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, whichlaunched an investigationinto Smartmatic’s ownership andpossible ties to the Venezuelan government. But rather than cooperate with the federal inquiry, Smartmatic quickly sold off Sequoia.The company then turned to Europe and other election markets, moving its headquarters to the UK in 2012. It won a contract worth more than $180m to supply the Philippines with more than 90,000 voting machines for its 2016 elections, with Jarltech International on board to manufacture the machines. But the company became embroiled in more controversy almost immediately after the election when Philippine authoritiescharged the head of Smartmatic’s technical support teamand two subordinates with accessing a system on election night used to transmit unofficial results and making an unauthorized change to code. The case was later dismissed.Two years after the Philippines election, Smartmatic won the Los Angeles contract. Smartmatic hoped to parlay this win to expand across the US. But after its machines were used for the first time in the 2020 presidential primary and general election, Donald Trump, who lost the election, falsely accused Smartmatic and Dominion Voting Systems of manipulating the results to give the election to Joe Biden.These claims were amplified by Fox News and other media outlets sympathetic to Trump, and in 2021, Smartmatic filed a series of defamation lawsuits against media outlets and Trump supporters who they say encouraged and amplified the vote-rigging assertions, including a $2.7bn defamation suit against Fox News. Smartmatic claims Fox News reporting decimated its US business prospects, causing other election jurisdictions to shun it. But Fox News says it simply covered newsworthy claims made by Trump and others.Last year Smartmaticsettled a similar suitagainst Newsmax for $40m and against One America News for anundisclosed sumand seemed to be on path to win or settle the Fox News suit as well until the indictment of its executives. Fox News has used the indictments and alleged bribery scheme to support its defense in the defamation suit, saying in court documents that if the company has had trouble expanding its business in the US, it’s due to these allegations and the company’s troubled history, not Fox News reporting.ThechargesProsecutors from the southern district of Florida allege that the three Smartmatic executives and Jarltech owner Andy Wang engaged in a years-long conspiracy to overcharge the Philippines government for voting machines, then used the fraudulently obtained funds to pay more than $1m in kickbacks to Juan Andres Bautista – chair of the Philippine elections commission at the time – towin and retain a contractto supply systems for the 2016 elections there.Jarltech allegedly overcharged the Philippines government $10-$50 per voting machine in “extra” or “rush” fees, amassing about $6m in a slush fund to pay the bribes. Wang allegedly managed the funds in Hong Kong bank accounts, and Smartmatic executives directed the payments, using bogus purchasing agreements, shell companies and banks in Europe, Asia and the US. Bautista passed the money to a family member who then bought a condo in San Francisco, prosecutors say.Wang did not respond to questions from the Guardian.The justice department investigation began after Bautista’s estranged wife told Philippine authorities in 2017 that her husband had $20m in “unexplained wealth” and provided them with 35 passbooks for offshore bank accounts in Bautista’s name. Bautista resigned as chair of the election commission two months later, and in 2023, news broke that the justice departmenthad filed charges against himand was investigating unnamed Smartmatic executives as well.But the scheme didn’t start with the Philippines. Prosecutors say the conspirators had also inflated the cost of voting machines sold to Venezuela to amass $4m for bribes paid to unnamed Venezuelan officials between 2012 and 2014 , showing a pattern of illegal activity. In 2019, prosecutors say Piñate also transferred ownership of an upscale home in Caracas to Tibisay Lucena Ramírez, then president of the Venezuelan National Electoral Council, to secure her assistance with its business interests in that country.A Smartmatic spokesperson calls the house claim “untethered from reality”. She says Smartmatic “ceased all operations in Venezuela in August 2017 after blowing the whistle on the government and has never sought to secure business there again”.In 2017, Smartmatic accused the Venezuelan electoral council and the Nicolás Maduro regime of manipulating voter turnout numbers and election results and ceased business in the country. But prosecutors say Piñate hoped to repair the relationship with Venezuela with Ramírez’s help and gave her the Caracas home as a bribe. Ramírez died in 2023.Los AngelescountyThe federal case against Smartmatic executives and the company’s lawsuit against Fox News have now become intertwined due to the new allegations about the LA county money and questions about whether the executives used bribes to win favor around the county contract. Fox News says in its recent filing against LA county that it “does not yet have evidence that slush fund payments or real estate title transfers were made to any L.A. County official”, but it says that gifts Logan received from the company follow “patterns of misconduct” that prosecutors have alleged occurred in other countries, and that Logan cultivated an unusually close relationship with Smartmatic executives that went “well beyond typical business relationships.”Logan took a nine-day trip to the Maldives and Taiwan in July 2019 that was partially funded by Smartmatic, including business-class air fare, accommodations and meals, according to text messages obtained by Fox News and included in its court filing. The Maldives portion was covered by an organization that invited Logan to speak there, but Smartmatic paid for Logan’s travel to Taiwan. Based on another text message not included in the court filing but seen by the Guardian, Smartmatic played a role in coordinating the conference invitation to Logan as well.Logan’s wife accompanied him on the trip, but the text messages indicate he gave his credit card number to Smartmatic to cover her $5,000 air fare. Logan and his wife tacked on tourist activity to the Taiwan portion of their trip, and it’s not clear how much Smartmatic paid for the entire excursion. Under California Fair Political Practices Commission regulations, gifts to state and local officials from a single source werelimited to $500a year when Logan took the trip. Smartmatic would not say how much it paid for the Taiwan trip, citing ongoing litigation.An LA county spokesperson said in an email that the Taiwan trip was not a gift but a work trip to conduct oversight of the manufacturing process – the trip included a visit to Jarltech, the subcontractor that was making the hardware for LA county’s machines. The spokesperson wrote: “the lead from the County’s VSAP design contractor was also part of the trip, which included detailed reviews and presentations of products that required approval prior to manufacturing, and onsite visits to multiple product and manufacturing assembly plants/operations.”Approval of the manufacturing process was required as part of the contract, he says, and “protocols for notification and approval of the travel were followed and are documented in the responsive records provided [to Fox News]”.Asked why the project manager for the contract, whose job is “inspecting any and all tasks, deliverables, goods, services, or other work provided by or on behalf of the Contractor” didn’t visit the Jarltech facilities instead of Logan, spokesperson Michael Sanchez said that as chief elections official “Logan had and continues to have clear responsibility for ensuring contract compliance.”Fox News disputes that the travel was covered under the contract, noting that the contract only mentions paying travel expenses if county officials are auditing financial records related to Smartmatic’s contract with the county and have to travel outside the county to view the company’s financial records. Sanchez says the paragraph addressing travel expenses “is not limited to the inspection of financial records for a financial audit” but includes travel to “examine … any pertinent transaction, activity, or record” relating to the contract.In addition to the Taiwan travel, Fox News says Smartmatic paid for an unknown number of meals in upscale restaurants for Logan, at least one of which Logan did not report on annual disclosure form in 2022. In a deposition in the lawsuit Fox has filed against LA county to obtain Logan’s records, Logan disputes that he was required to report the meal because he says it was a personal meal with a Smartmatic employee.He also rejects the suggestion that Smartmatic won its contract out of favoritism.“The contract between Los Angeles County and Smartmatic USA was competitively bid, evaluated, and awarded in compliance with the County’s open competitive public procurement processes,” Logan wrote in an email.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationFox NewsUS politicsLos AngelesWest CoastVenezuelanewsShareReuse this content"

The Department is a planning organization and is continuously working with other agency partners on plans to protect federal assets and personnel,” a Department of Defense official said, according to ABC.Earlier on Sunday, Hakeem Jeffries, House minority leader and New York Democratic congressman, saidDonald Trumphas “manufactured a crisis” to justify sending federalized national guard troopsinto Chicagonext, over the heads of local leaders.Jeffries, appearing on CNN’s State of the Union, accused the US president of “playing games with the lives of Americans” with his unprecedented domestic deployment of the military, which has escalated to include thearming of troopscurrently patrolling Washington, DC – aftersendingtroops into Los Angeles in June.The mayor of Chicago, Brandon Johnson, said any such plan from Trump was perpetrating “the most flagrant violation of our constitution in the 21st century”.Late on Friday, Pentagon officials confirmed to Fox News that up to 1,700 men and women of the national guardwere poisedto mobilize in 19 mostly Republican states to support Trump’santi-immigration crackdownby assisting the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (Ice) with “logistical support and clerical functions”.Trump targets Chicago and New York as Hegseth orders weapons for DC troopsRead moreJeffries said he supported astatementissued by the Democratic governor of Illinois, JB Pritzker, that Trump was “abusing his power” in talking about sending the national guard to Chicago, and distracting from the pain he said the president was causing American families.The national guard isnormally underthe authority of the individual states, deployed at the request of the state governor and only federalized – or deployed by the federal government – in a national emergency and at the request of a governor.Jeffries said in an interview with CNN on Sunday morning: “We should continue to support local law enforcement and not simply allowDonald Trumpto play games with the lives of the American people as part of his effort to manufacture a crisis and create a distraction because he’s deeply unpopular.”He continued: “I strongly support the statement that was issued by Governor Pritzker making clear that there’s no basis, no authority for Donald Trump to potentially try to drop federal troops into the city of Chicago.”The White House has been working on plans to send national guard to Chicago, the third largest US city, dominated by Democratic voters in a Democratic state, to take a hard line on crime, homelessness and immigrants, theWashington Post reported.View image in fullscreenHakeem Jeffries speaks during a news conference in Washington DC on 1 July.Photograph: Mariam Zuhaib/APPritzker issued astatementon Saturday night that began: “The State of Illinois at this time has received no requests or outreach from the federal government asking if we need assistance, and we have made no requests for federal intervention.”Trump has argued that a military crackdown was necessary in the nation’s capital, and elsewhere, to quell what he said were out of control levels of crime, even though statistics show that serious and violent crime in Washington, and many other American cities,has actually plummeted.Talking to reporters in the Oval Office on Friday the president insisted that “the people in Chicago are screaming for us to come” as he laid out his plan to send troops there, and that they would later “help with New York”.“When ready, we will start in Chicago … Chicago is a mess,” Trump said.Johnson, in an appearance on Sunday on MSNBC, said shootings had dropped by almost 40% in his city in the last year alone, and he and Pritzker said any plan by the White House to override local authority and deploy troopswould be illegal.“The president has repeated this petulant presentation since he assumed office. What he is proposing at this point would be the most flagrant violation of our constitution in the 21st century,” Johnson said.Californiasued the federalgovernment when it deployed national guard and US marines to parts of Los Angeles in June overprotestsagainstIce raids, but a court refused to block the troops.Main target cities mentioned by Trump are not only majority Democratic in their voting but also run by Black mayors, includingWashington, DC, Chicago, New York,Baltimore, Los Angeles and Oakland.Trump visits DC police station and boasts of success of crime crackdownRead moreRahm Emanuel, a Democratic former Illinois congressman, chief of staff to former president Barack Obama, and a former mayor of Chicago, also appeared on CNN on Sunday urging people to reflect that Trump, in two terms of office, had only ever deployed US troops in American cities, never overseas.Emanuel said if he was still mayor he would call on the president to act like a partner and, although crime was coming down, to “work with us on public safety” to combat carjackings, gun crime and gangs and not “come in and act like we can be an occupied city”.He added about Trump’s agenda: “He gave his speech in Iowa, he said ‘I hate’ Democrats, and this may be a reflection of that.” Thespeech was in July, when Trump excoriated Democrats in Congress who refused to vote for his One Big Beautiful Bill, the flagshiplegislationof the second Trump administration so farthat focuses ontax cuts for the wealthy, massive boosts for the anti-immigrationagendaand benefits cuts to programs such as Medicaid, which provides health insurance for poor Americans.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationHakeem JeffriesUS politicsUS militaryChicagoDonald TrumpDemocratsnewsShareReuse this content"

Air assets have also been deployed, including multiple helicopters for targeted water drops and air tankers for fire retardant.The cause of the fire was still under investigation.According toCal Fire, there has been no confirmation of structures damages and or destroyed, although damage assessment remains ongoing. Because the fire is burning in rugged terrain, plus a weather forecast over next few days with hot and dry conditions, it will make sustained efforts “crucial for containment”.An air quality alert has been put in place through multiple counties including Napa, Sonoma and Solano until Monday.“If possible, and temperatures allow, stay inside with windows and doors closed until smoke levels subside. Residents can also reduce their exposure to smoke by setting their car vent systems to re-circulate to prevent outside air from moving inside. The use of indoor air filtration or going to a Clean Air Center or other location with filtered air, such as a library or mall, can also help reduce smoke exposure,” the Bay Area Air Districtsaidon Saturday.Residents of the western United States have been sweltering in a heat wave that hospitalized some people, with temperatures forecast to hit dangerous levels throughout the weekend in Washington, Oregon, southern California, Nevada and Arizona.Clay said the weather has moderated since the fire broke out, with Sunday’s high expected to be 94F (34C). But as the day goes on, humidity levels were expected to drop and the winds to pick up in the afternoon.“That’s been a driving factor in the afternoons since we’ve seen the fire activity pick up for the last three days,” Clay said, adding that “support from all up and down California has been critical to our efforts”.The fire began in the same area as the much larger Glass Fire in 2020, which crossed into Sonoma county and eventually burned about 105 sq miles (272 sq km) and more than 1,500 structures.That fire was driven by wind, while the current fire is fueled by dry vegetation on steep slopes – some of it dead and downed trees left over from the Glass Fire and some of it grass and brush that grew back and then dried out again, said Clay.In Oregon, the Flat Fire in Deschutes and Jefferson counties had grown to almost 34 sq miles (88 sq km), with no containment, and threatened nearly 4,000 homes, according to the state Fire Marshal’s Office. About 10,000 people were under some sort of evacuation notice.The fire began Thursday night and grew quickly amid hot, gusty conditions. Fire officials were keeping an eye on isolated thunderstorms in Southern Oregon that could drift north on Sunday, spokesman Chris Schimmer said in a video posted to Facebook.In a Sunday update, Central Oregon Fire Info (Cofi) said that night shift crew were able to establish initial lines along the southern head of the fire and made additional progress along portions of the north and wester perimeter of the fire.Cofi added that crew were also able to burnout unburnt vegetation in the Carcass Creek area to slow the fire’s spread.We were able to cut in some rough breaks around the fire to stop the spread around key areas and homes,”saidEric Perkins, Oregon’s Department of Forestry Complex Incident Management Team 3 operations section chief.“We still have a lot of work ahead of us to improve lines and tie them together,” he added.Sunday’s conditions of fighting fires in Oregon include an extreme heat warning, as well as low relative humidities, an unstable air mass as well as temperatures expected to reach triple digits.“Today we’re looking much better, we have high hopes that we can stop the forward progression of this fire,” Perkinssaidin a Facebook video, adding: “Having said that, we are in a fire fight and the weather’s not that favorable … It’s more favorable for the fire than the firefighters today.”Temporary flight restrictions from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have been put in place across the fire area, with authorities warning that all illegal drone use will be reported to law enforcement.Meanwhile, air quality alerts have beenissuedacross multiple communities in central Oregon, including Beaver Marsh, Bend, Crescent, Deschutes River Woods, La Pine, Madras, Prineville, Redville, Silver Lake, Sunrise and Three River.According to IQAir, current air quality levels ranged between 150 and 200, which fall into the categories of unhealthy to very unhealthy conditions for residents.Although it’s difficult to directly tie a single fire or weather event directly to climate change, scientists say human-caused warming from burning fossil fuels like coal and gas is causing more intense heatwaves and droughts, which in turn set the stage for more destructive wildfires.Explore more on these topicsUS newsWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

Adler “passed peacefully in his sleep”, Paradigm Talent Agency’s Sarah Shulman said on behalf of his family. No immediate cause was given.Among Adler’s acting credits areThe Sopranos, on which he played Tony Soprano adviser Hesh Rabkin across all six seasons, andThe Good Wife, where he played law partner Howard Lyman. But before Adler had ever stepped in front of a film or television camera, he had 53 Broadway productions to his name – all behind the scenes, serving as a stage manager, producer or director.He hailed from an entertainment family with deep roots in Jewish and Yiddish theater, as he told the Jewish Ledger in 2014. His father, Philip Adler, was a general manager for the famed Group Theatre andBroadwayproductions, and his cousin Stella Adler was a legendary acting teacher.“I’m a creature of nepotism,” Adler told TheaterMania in 2015. “I got my first job when I was at Syracuse University and my father, the general manager of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, called me [because] there was an opening for an assistant stage manager. I skipped school.”After a long theater career, which included the original production of My Fair Lady and working with the likes of Marlene Dietrich, Julie Andrews and Richard Burton, among many others, Adler left Broadway during its 1980s slump. He moved to California, where he worked on television productions such as the soap opera Santa Barbara.“I was really getting into the twilight of a mediocre career,” he told theNew YorkTimes in 1992.But the retirement he was contemplating was staved off when Donna Isaacson, the casting director for The Public Eye and a longtime friend of one of Adler’s daughters, had a hunch about how to cast a hard-to-fill role, as the New York Times reported then. Adler had been on the other side of auditions, and, curious to experience how actors felt, agreed to try out. Director Howard Franklin, who auditioned dozens of actors for the role of a newspaper columnist in the Joe Pesci-starring film, had “chills” when Adler read for the part, the newspaper reported.So began an acting career that had him working consistently in front of the camera for more than 30 years. An early role on the David Chase-written Northern Exposure paved the way for his time on a future Chase project,The Sopranos.“When David was going to do the pilot for The Sopranos he called and asked me if I would do a cameo of Hesh. It was just supposed to be a one-shot,” he told Forward in 2015. “But when they picked up the show they liked the character, and I would come on every fourth week.”Films included Woody Allen’sManhattan Murder Mystery, but Adler was perhaps best known for his television work. Those credits included stints on Rescue Me, Mad About You, Transparent and guest spots on shows ranging from The West Wing to Broad City.He even returned to Broadway, this time onstage, in Elaine May’s Taller Than a Dwarf in 2000. In 2015, he appeared in Larry David’s writing and acting stage debut,Fish in the Dark.“I do it because I really enjoy it. I think retirement is a road to nowhere,” Adler told Forward, on the subject of the play. “I wouldn’t know what to do if I were retired. I guess if nobody calls anymore, that’s when I’ll be retired. Meanwhile this is great.”Adler published a memoir, Too Funny for Words: Backstage Tales from Broadway,Television, and the Movies, last year. “I’m ready to go at a moment’s notice,” he told CT Insider then, when asked if he’d take more acting roles. In recent years, he and his wife, Joan Laxman, relocated from Connecticut back to his hometown of New York. Survivors include his four daughters, Shulman said.For Adler, who once thought he was “too goofy-looking” to act, seeing himself on screen was odd, at least initially. And in multiple interviews with various outlets, he expressed how strange it was to be recognized by the public after spending so many years working behind the scenes. There was at least one advantage to being preserved on film, though, as he told the New York Times back in 1992.“I’m immortal,” he said.Explore more on these topicsUS newsTelevisionBroadwayThe SopranosThe Good WifeTheatreUS televisionnewsShareReuse this content"

The church may canonize oneThe prominent religious order postponed the ordination of Donald B Dickerson, but ultimately allowed his promotionA version of this story was first reported and published byNational Catholic ReporterRyan Di Corpo of National Catholic ReporterSun 24 Aug 2025 12.35 EDTFirst published on Sun 24 Aug 2025 08.00 EDTShareNumerous officials within theRoman Catholicreligious order known as the Jesuits struggled in the 1970s and 1980s over how to deal with a man whom they knew molested children – but nonetheless was ordained a priest, according to a review of internal correspondence concerning his career.The correspondence about the late Donald B Dickerson stems from a pending Louisiana state court lawsuit filed in June 2024 that alleges he raped a 17-year-old student at the order-run Loyola UniversityNew Orleansin 1984. It provides a rare, complex, behind-the-scenes look at how local leaders during a much earlier phase of the worldwide Catholic church’s ongoing clergy molestation scandal struggled to contain a predator priest’s repeated abuse of children while encouraging him to seek psychological help.Born in 1936 in Jerseyville, Illinois, Dickerson entered the Society of Jesus inLouisianain August 1971 and professed his first vows two years later, a day before he turned 37, court documents show.Jesuits undergo a years-long formation period that begins with a two-year novitiate and concludes after ordination with the final vows, a process that can take 15 to 20 years. While Jesuits are not priests until ordination, they begin using the initials “SJ”, for the Society of Jesus, upon entering the order.Early in his formation, Dickerson was assigned to the Jesuit high school inNew Orleans, where letters say he abused two boys. In early December 1974, he molested a minor in a car en route to a high school awards ceremony, according to court documents.In 1974,Jesuit priest Anthony McGinn– who would later serve as the New Orleans high school’s president – described Dickerson as lazy and manipulative.“He does whatever he pleases,” McGinn wrote in a character appraisal that is now an exhibit in the court case, which seeks damages from Loyola and the Jesuit order. “This is a dangerous sign that the Society will have difficulties with him in future years.”Dickerson should not be advanced to theology, the next level in formation, concluded McGinn, who did not respond to a request for comment.Despite the negative appraisal, Dickerson went to theology instruction in Chicago.In March 1975, during a six-hour meeting attended by multiple priests and a brother at the Jesuit provincials’ office to discuss several clergy,Jesuit priest Louis Lambert, the vice-provincial for formation and a top Jesuit in the region, held that Dickerson “was making great progress in working through his problems” – and that a recent psychological report on him was “positive”. At that meeting, four priests voted to send Dickerson to theology despite McGinn’s warnings.By 1977, concerns from high-ranking Jesuit priest Thomas Stahel had reached a crisis point. The provincial of the Jesuits’ former New Orleans province, Stahel had learned of yet another accusation that Dickerson had harassed a minor. Five days before Christmas that year, the provincial, who would laterserve as executive editorat America magazine, detailed specific misgivings about Dickerson in a lengthy letter to the Jesuits’ worldwide leader at the time, superior generalPedro Arrupe.“I do not think we can in conscience present Dickerson to bishop as ready for ordination,” Stahel wrote to Arrupe, one week before Dickerson was to be made a priest. “I recommend that Dickerson’s ordination be postponed, at the very least, and that we raise with him a question about his staying in the Society.”‘Under sufficient control’According to the letter, Arrupe had already agreed that Dickerson’s ordination should be postponed.It is unclear whether Arrupe responded to this letter. National Catholic Reporter has not obtained other documents detailing a back-and-forth conversation between the superior general and the New Orleans provincial.Stahel wrote that he first contacted Arrupe to help resolve a debate with Lambert regarding how to handle Dickerson.Αccording to a 1977 letter, Dickerson’s Jesuit superiors believed that his “psychosexual problem was under sufficient control”.Yet Stahel, who details serious concerns regarding Dickerson’s “suitability” for the priesthood, found himself at an impasse with Lambert. “He thinks Dickerson is no more a risk than others who have been ordained, and he characterizes the recent incident as a regrettable slip. I am unpersuaded by his reasons,” Stahel wrote to the superior general.“I have the distinct impression that Fr [Father] Lambert’s resistance in this matter had to do, not with the merits of his case, but with the jealous guard he maintains over his Vice-Provincial’s prerogatives,” Stahel wrote. “He was determined that I should have nothing to say about Dickerson’s ordination, and it was impossible to come to a meeting of the minds concerning evidence that seemed overwhelming to everyone but him.”Describing the disagreement, Stahel alleged that Lambert considered Dickerson’s improper behavior to be the result of nerves – and rejected Arrupe’s move to postpone ordination as unjust “strong-arm tactics”.Lambert, Stahel said, “argued that, once a man is approved for ordination by the Society (as Dickerson had been), the Society is committed to him. By this kind of reasoning, nothing a person could do between approval and ordination could disqualify him.”In September 1978, Arrupe said in a letter to Lambert that he had received a psychological report on Dickerson, but the details of that report were not readily available. “I will await further information on the case from Father Stahel,” wrote the superior general.Dickerson had received psychological treatment at least twice by then – in 1975 and 1978. He later noted that he had submitted to “extensive psychological therapy” at Foundation House, a former treatment facility for troubled priests run by theServants of the Paracletein Jemez Springs, New Mexico.Dickerson had still not been ordained by the summer of 1979, when Stahel said Dickerson had told him that sexually harassing an underage boy was “a relatively insignificant incident”.The provincial disagreed.“I did not feel that I could ordain him until we had removed as much as possible any worries that such incidents would happen again,” Stahel wrote.‘I thought he should be ordained’But Stahel’s worries about Dickerson had apparently subsided by the end of that year, after Dickerson understood the “scandal” molesting children could cause. “I said that I thought he should be ordained,” Stahel wrote in a memorandum dated 30 December 1979. Six months later, on 7 June 1980, Dickerson was ordained by Birmingham, Alabama, bishop Joseph Vath.Dickerson began teaching at the boys Jesuit preparatory school in Dallasthat same year. But in 1981, he was removed from Jesuit Dallas following an allegation from a child’s parents. He was sent in September 1981 to St John Berchmans, then a co-cathedral in Shreveport, Louisiana.A $12m lawsuitwould later accuse Dickerson of raping a boy there in 1982.That year, Stahel had written to Dickerson with the hope “nothing would happen in Shreveport”. The case was settled for an undisclosed sum.Two years later, in an August 1984 letter to Dickerson,Jesuit priest Edmundo Rodriguez, the new provincial in New Orleans, noted that he had “a duty to protect the Society and the Church from unacceptable behavior of its members”.A 1984 psychological profile of Dickerson written by the Servants of the Paraclete, the men’s order that treated troubled priests, described him as “very sick” and in need of intensive, long-term treatment. During Dickerson’s evaluation, he said that he had been molested by a man at age six, according to clinical notes included in the most recent New Orleans lawsuit.In September 1984, a mother wrote a letter to the bishop of Alexandria-Shreveport that alleged that Dickerson had molested her son.“Recently he was rejected by his natural father,” the woman said of her son. “Instead of help from Fr Dickerson, he has been mentally damaged even further.” She added that Dickerson should never work near children again.Court documents show thatJesuit priest Thomas Barberitohad spoken in August 1984 with the bishop about “the situation with Fr Dickerson”. According to Barberito, the bishop said he would refer concerns to the provincial if one of the parties involved contacted his office.Dickerson’s Jesuit superiors assigned him to Loyola University New Orleans in 1985. There, the New Orleans lawsuit alleges, he abused another minor. Yet Dickerson maintained the support of his direct superior even while facing an investigation.“Don has to be given the benefit of the doubt,” Rodriguez wrote in a communication dated 28 February 1986. “We owe Don the same careful due process which we would want to provide for anyone else.”But in early March 1986, after Rodriguez received three separate allegations against Dickerson in one week, the provincial encouraged him to leave the priesthood “to save everyone from a very painful process”.Dickerson complied, thanking the provincial for his “willingness to suspend judgment on the question of moral culpability and to acknowledge my genuine efforts to overcome my tendencies”. On 12 March 1986, Rodriguez wrote that he had contactedJesuit priest Peter-Hans Kolvenbach, then the order’s superior general, requesting that Dickerson be dismissed from the society and priestly life.Since his laicization, Dickerson has been at the center of multiple lawsuits beyond the recent New Orleans case. It is unclear whether he ever faced criminal charges for accusations of sexual abuse of minors.New Orleans clergy abuse survivors begin voting on church bankruptcy dealRead moreIn 2009, a casewas settledafter he was accused of molesting an eighth grade boy. Dickerson was accused in 2010, in the aforementioned $12m lawsuit, of raping an 11-year-old boy at St John Berchmans in 1982. And a former Jesuit Dallas studentsued the schoolin 2019, alleging Dickerson gave him alcohol and raped him during a trip to Alabama decades prior.During his 18 years as Jesuit superior general, Arrupe emerged as a widely respected leader, beloved by the men’s religious community at the time of his resignation in 1983, two years after a disabling stroke. He was known for having ministered to survivors of the US’s atomic bombing of Hiroshima at the end of the second world war.Arrupe’s cause for canonization, which opened in Rome in 2019, remains active. Attorneys Richard Trahant, John Denenea and Soren Giselson, who represent the plaintiff in the New Orleans lawsuit centering on Dickerson, argue Arrupe should not be considered for sainthood.While Arrupe, as superior general, could have stopped Dickerson’s ordination, biographies and statements from Arrupe show that he opposed an authoritarian style of leadership of the Jesuit order. If local Jesuit officials decided to ordain Dickerson, it is unclear whether Arrupe would have stepped in to stop it – or if he had all the facts supporting such a decision.Dawn Eden Goldstein, an author and canon lawyer, said it is unclear whether there is sufficient evidence to say the way the Jesuits handled the Dickerson case was a coverup or willful negligence. “At this point, we don’t know whether this might rather be a case of superiors following the accepted procedures of that time,” she said. But, she added, that explanation does not justify their actions.The Jesuit Conference of Canada and the United States did not respond to multiple requests for comment, and it’s unclear whether other records about Dickerson are in the Jesuits’ files in Rome. McGinn is the only Jesuit official in this story who is still alive.The lawsuit was ongoing as of the weekend of 22 August.National Catholic Reporter is a national US news outlet that has been reporting on issues within the Catholic church since 1964Explore more on these topicsNew Orleans clergy abuseRape and sexual assaultCatholicismChildrenReligionNew OrleansLouisiananewsShareReuse this content"

Now, the president is targeting Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook,demandingshe resign and threatening to fire her.Cook, the first Black woman to be appointed a Fed governor, was appointed in 2022 by Joe Biden. Her 14-year term is not due to expire until 2038.Leading this new strategy is Bill Pulte, heir to a home construction company fortune, appointed by Trump to lead the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees regulations of federal housing lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.Fed governor urged by Trump to resign will not be ‘bullied’ into stepping downRead morePulte has used his role to publicly accuse Trump’s opponents, publishing extraordinary allegations on social media and referring them for investigation.He alleges that James, Schiff and Cook committed what is known as owner-occupancy fraud, when a person claims a second home or investment property is actually a primary residence to get better mortgages. Lenders are more inclined to give borrowers a lower mortgage on a primary residence, compared with a second home or investment property.In aletterto the Department of Justice, Pulte claimed that Cook “falsified bank documents and property records to acquire more favorable loan terms”. In other online posts and on TV news appearances, Pulte said that Cook should resign or be fired over the allegations, which have not been verified.James and Schiff have denied the allegations. Cook has pledged to “provide the facts” after gathering the relevant information.Trump allies have celebrated the accusations, citing it as evidence of corruption within the Democratic party. “This is not just hypocrisy, this is poetic justice,” said Fox conservative commentator Laura Ingraham, of Schiff’s fraud accusations, in aclipTrump reposted to social media.While Pulte has targeted two prominent Democrats and a Democratic appointee, accusations of such fraud are not exclusive to the party: aninvestigationby the Associated Press found Texas attorney general Ken Paxton, a Republican and staunch Trump ally, and his then wife claimed that three homes were their primary residences.View image in fullscreenKen Paxton speaks during a news conference in Washington DC on 26 April 2022.Photograph: Elizabeth Frantz/ReutersThough Paxton has not commented on his own mortgage fraud accusations, he had said of the accusations against attorney general James: “I hope that if she’s done something wrong, I hope that she’s held accountable.”Owner-occupancy fraud is not uncommon. Philadelphia Fed researchers in 2023estimatedthat over 20,000 loans were given to “fraudulent investors”, or people who purchased more than one home they listed as a primary residence within a year.Some political experts have raised concerns that the president and his allies are blatantly using the legal system to intimidate political opponents. “The fact that the law is being selectively applied underlines that this is part of a pattern of lawfare,” Don Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan, told the Guardian via email.“What we are seeing is the type of weaponization we associate with authoritarian regimes, like Hungary, Turkey or Russia,” Moynihan added. “I would say that this is a massive warning sign, but the reality is that we have seen so many of these signs at this point.”Contacted for comment, a US federal housing spokesperson said: “We refer people of all political parties for mortgage fraud, and we will continue to do so.”A White House official said: “Anyone who engages in criminal activity should be held accountable. No one is above the law.”‘No intention of being bullied’That Trump is targeting a Fed governor speaks to the president’s continued antagonism against the Federal Reserve. Compared with James or Schiff, both of whom have headedinvestigationsagainst Trump, Cook has not singled herself out as an enemy to the president.But her role on the 12-person Fed governing board that sets interest rates has probably made her a target. Since taking office in January, Trump has demanded the central bank cut rates, disregarding the precedent set by his predecessors; the Fed has historically been treated as an independent institution, free from political influence, by past presidents.The Fed board hasn’t yet lowered rates during any of the five meetings it had this year, which has infuriated Trump. Policymakers, including the central bank’s chair,Jerome Powell, say the administration’s tariffs have clouded the economic outlook and raises the risk of higher inflation.Pulte has pushed himself into the heart of the action, criticizing the Fed on social media and reportedly evendraftinga letter for Trump – which remains unsent – to fire Powell. “Jerome Powell’s career is done,” Pulte wrote in July.View image in fullscreenAdam Schiff and Letitia James.Photograph: Getty Images and  Julius Constantine Motal“Could somebody please inform Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell that he is hurting the housing industry very badly? People can’t get a mortgage because of him,” Trumpwroteon social media earlier this week.Trump’s gut-reaction to seize control of the Fed is to fire Powell, but neither the stock market nor the US supreme court haveresponded kindlyto such threats. So, Trump, with Pulte’s help, has spent the summer following other tactics.In July, Trump zeroed in on renovations that were taking place at the Fed’s headquarters in Washington DC, claiming that the renovations were fraudulent because they were more expensive than what was originally budgeted, costing $2.5bn instead of $1.9bn. The Fed put this down tocomplicationsthat came up during renovations.But as criticisms of the renovations died down, Trump started zeroing in on Cook. Her exit would allow Trump to appoint a replacement who may be more sympathetic to his desire for lower rates.In astatement, Cook said that she has “no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet”, adding: “I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.”On Friday, Trump threatened to fire her if she did not resign.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpFederal ReserveTrump administrationLetitia JamesUS politicsJerome PowellfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We are still waiting on adeal with China.But with school supplies so dependent on imports, consumers have been anxiously waiting to see how tariffs will affect the prices they see in stores.Asurveyfrom the National Retail Federation (NRF) found that 12% more parents started back-to-school shopping earlier this year compared with last year, largely because of concerns over tariffs, and 72% of parents expect higher prices this year.A graphic showing the tariffs levied by Trump on different countries, reimagined as a school shelving system with empty trays and some slots filled with school supplies.The NRF estimated the total expected spending for back-to-school shopping, from new clothes and electronics to pencils and paper, will total $39.4bn – the second highest on record, after 2023. Families with kids in kindergarten through 12th grade are budgeting, on average, $874.68 for everything they need for the year.It’s still unclear exactly how much Trump’s new tariffs will affect prices. Companies have the power to increase prices as much as they want, but at the risk of losing customers to competitors.“There’s a lot happening behind the scenes, like importers trying to renegotiate with their foreign suppliers, they’re trying to get their foreign suppliers to absorb some of the costs, they’re trying to absorb costs themselves,” said Sarah Dickerson, a research economist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.‘Everyone is coming into fire’: students return to US campuses bruised and changed by Trump’s assaultRead moreAt the beginning of the summer, Targetannouncedit would maintain its 2024 prices for 20 “must-have supplies”, a move the company hopes will keep customers loyal during the back-to-school shopping season.However, economists argue that retailers will eventually have to pass on the costs. A recentanalysisfrom Goldman Sachs estimated that consumers paid 36% of tariff costs three months and 67% of costs four months after a levy was set.These increases are only just starting to show up in inflation data. After dipping down in the spring, inflation has been rising since April, something that’s caught the attention of officials at the US Federal Reserve.A graph showing inflation trends for US consumers.Tariffs “are starting to show up in consumer prices … [and] we expect to see more of that”, Fed chair Jerome Powell said in July. “We know from surveys that companies feel they have every intention of putting this through to the consumer.”This of course is contrary to how the White House thinks. Trump has said that tariffs will either bring manufacturing back to America or help the country negotiate better trade deals. Trump has largely brushed aside the potential price increases and while conceded that the tariffs “won’t be easy, the end result will be historic”.For parents starting their back-to-school shopping, Dickerson recommends taking the time to compare prices between stores since they may vary between retailers.“Those individual prices are going to vary, which is why it makes sense, if you’re a parent, to shop around a bit and see what the different prices are out there,” she said.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsUS educationUS economyEconomicsTariffsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A moment that said plenty about Trump’s ego, sure. But ultimately, only a moment.Nope. It’s reality. Inescapable. Donald Trump will be everywhere Fifa is in the US, including at the 2026World Cup– due to start in about 10 months, when Canada and Mexico will co-host.If this much wasn’t clear already after that moment at MetLife Stadium andalltheothertimesTrump or his agenda haveaffectedWorld Cup affairs, it may have become so after Friday’s Oval Office appearance with Fifa president Gianni Infantino – the eighth reported meeting between the pair since January, and the fifth to take place in public at the White House.Trump says 2026 World Cup draw will be staged at Washington’s Kennedy CenterRead moreTrump wore a signature hat reading “TRUMP WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING” – one of his collection that was deemed noteworthy enough todisplay to world leadersin the middle ofhigh-stakes talkswith lives hanging in the balance. He then announced that the attention of the soccer world will once again be on him in December. On the fifth of that month, the World Cup draw will take place not at the Las Vegas Sphere as had been widely expected, but at Washington DC’s Kennedy Center – a historic venue and a worthy place to sort through some ping-pong balls, but also one that is now controlled by Trump, who has installed himself as chair, named himself as host of the institution’s annual honors, overseen upcoming renovations (“there’s nothing like gold,” he said on Friday in reference to his Oval Office redesign), and may soonlend his wife’s nameto the opera house.“Some people refer to it as the ‘Trump Kennedy Center,’ but we’re not prepared to do that quite yet,” Trump said on Friday. “Maybe in a week or so.”The World Cup is not federally controlled like the Kennedy Center, but it will now be subject to a similar dynamic. The tournament Trumphas taken credit for bringing to the USwill take place under his presidency, with the draw and “big press conferences” happening in a venue he controls, put on by an organization run by someone looking to befriend Trump at every turn – including bybecoming the Trump Organization’s tenant. There is almost no choice other than to accept that Trump will make sure he is front and center at this tournament – even in spots where he has no business, or where his involvement may be seen as uncouth or inappropriate. It’s a dynamic Americans know well now, more than a decade into Trump’s rise.After Trump’s announcement, Infantino allowed him to hold the single most valuable hardware in men’s soccer, the World Cup trophy –not unheard of for heads of state, but more uncommon when accompanied with Infantino’s comment: “Since you are a winner, of course, you can as well touch it.”Trump asked if he could keep the trophy afterward, and it was not immediately clear that he was joking, given that Infantino let him keep the Club World Cup trophy, where it has been on display in the Oval Office ever since.Trump made this latest World Cup announcement in practically the same breath as he expounded on his latest imposition on the American people –a strong-arm takeover of Washington DC, which he called a “crime-infested rat hole” despite the fact that the Justice Department had previously reported a 30-year low in violent crime in the capital. Trump continued to promote his crackdown later on, with the trophy directly in front of him on the Resolute Desk, as if it was a microphone meant to amplify his message. When Trump got to talking about immigration, Infantino moved the trophy out of the way.When prompted by Trump on Friday, Infantino – rather than demurring to comment on the domestic affairs of a foreign country – gave a solemn “oh yes” to express approval of the president’s plan for DC. It’s a plan Trump said he intends to spread to other American cities,mentioning Chicago specifically, but one can easily imagine that any city that voted against him – like 10 of the 11 US host cities for the upcoming World Cup – would be on the list.“Johnny”, as Trump calls Infantino, then gifted him a ceremonial ticket to the World Cup final – row 1, seat 1.Given all of this, expect the World Cup final camera to linger on Trump’s face longer than many of the players, coaches, and team staff who will have worked all their professional lives to get to that point.You’ll see him at the World Cup before then, too. He’ll boast endlessly about how well the tournament is going, only changing tack if things get so bad it’s obvious to everyone, in which case he’ll blame someone else (watch your back, “Johnny”). He’ll do at least one half-time interview on Fox, which is broadcasting the tournament in the US. Alexi Lalas,a big fan of Trump’s Maga movement, will shake his hand. Don’t rule out a gold-encrusted seat waiting for Trump at the final and any other games he chooses to attend.There can be no doubt now – the World Cup is not a guest in the house Trump runs. It is his plaything. AndFifaappears happy to do anything it takes for things to remain that way lest world football’s governing body be discarded or, worse, made a target.The World Cup, beneath all of the commercialism, is almost comically pure-hearted. It’s a celebration of the most popular sport in the world. It gives people across the world something in common to talk about, to bond over, to yell at. That feeling goes double for the host nations, and it’s a large part of the tournament’s singular power. It’s why it’s so coveted by countries that rule through authoritarian means – and that now arguably includes the US under TrumpIndelible, sublime moments will still happen at the 2026 tournament. People will still take joy, hurt, anger, and feelings from them. But those moments will be punctuated by Trump – eternally encroaching on even the most elevated of emotional experiences.If this news drives you to boo, ready your vocal cords. If it drives you to act, start thinking about what you want that to look like. If it thrills you, pace yourself. Whichever way, it’s time to get used to it.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026FifaFootball politicsWorld CupDonald TrumpTrump administrationGianni InfantinocommentShareReuse this content"

The overall record is 11 multi-home run games in a season.The myth of the Big Dumper: how Cal Raleigh became a Seattle folk heroRead moreThe switch-hitting Raleigh, batting from the right side, homered off Athletics left-handed starter Jacob Lopez in the first inning to make it 2-0 and tie Perez. Raleigh got a fastball down the middle from Lopez and sent it an estimated 448ft, according to Statcast. It was measured as the longest home run of Raleigh’s career as a right-handed hitter.In the second inning, Raleigh drilled a changeup from Lopez 412ft. The longballs were Nos 39 and 40 on the season for Raleigh while catching this year. He has nine while serving as a designated hitter. Perez hit 15 home runs as a DH in 2021, and 33 at catcher.Only four other players in big league history have hit at least 40 homers in a season while primarily playing catcher: Johnny Bench (twice), Roy Campanella, Todd Hundley and Mike Piazza (twice). Bench, Campanella and Piazza are Hall of Famers.Raleigh launched 27 homers in 2022, then 30 in 2023 and 34 last season. Should he continue at his current pace, Raleigh could become the first American League catcher to lead the major leagues outright in home runs.A first-time All-Star at age 28, Raleigh burst on to the national scenewhen he won the All-Star Home Run Derbyin July, just four months removed from signing a six-year, $105m contract extension. He became the first switch-hitter and first catcher to win the title. He’s the second Mariners player to take the crown, after three-time winner Ken Griffey Jr.With 31 games to go in the regular season, Raleigh also has an excellent chance of passing Griffey’s franchise record of 56 home runs in a season.Raleigh’s homer gave him 104 RBIs on the season. He’s the first catcher with consecutive 100-RBI seasons since Piazza (1996-2000), and the first American League backstop to accomplish the feat since Thurman Munson (1975-77).Explore more on these topicsSeattle MarinersMLBBaseballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

I did feel different coming into it this year. I felt like I was doing the right things day to day, but still, it’s in the back of your head. So I’m just very pleased to have overcome that.”With the victory, the British No 1 is now 20-4 against lower-ranked players over the past year and her ability to consistently win favourable match-ups has been a key part of her steady rise up the rankings. She will next face the qualifier Janice Tjen, who toppled the 24th seed Veronika Kudermetova 6-4, 4-6, 6-4.It also signified a confidence-building first grand slam victory alongside her new Spanish coach, Francisco Roig, who again offered his charge a constant stream of positive reinforcement from a corner of Louis Armstrong Stadium. Roig was joined in Raducanu’s player box by Jerome Poupel, a chiropractor who has been helping Raducanu with her continued back injury.“He’s been helping me for the last year, I would say. I’ve had back problems for the last year, so he’s just really helped with that,” Raducanu said.“As I’ve been playing more tennis and training more, it’s just important for me to stay on top of that. It’s cool, you know, he’s worked in F1, he’s worked with horses, so it’s very different. But I’m just enjoying having him around. He’s a great, calm but eccentric kind of character.”During their time working together, Poupel has offered Raducanu unique insights on her character. “He said that my character is similar to a horse,” she said. “Can be quite stubborn, dig their heels in. He’s got experience. Hopefully he can read me. And also they kind of wear their emotion on their sleeve.View image in fullscreenEmma Raducanu stretches to return a shot during her first-round match.Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty Images“If they’re not feeling like they want to do something they probably won’t do it. I’m just happy to have him around. He’s got so much different, diverse experience that it’s great to have that insight.”This was a good first-round draw for Raducanu, but Shibahara is an interesting figure in her own right. An American-born Japanese player, the 27-year-old is a former top four doubles player and the 2022 French Open mixed doubles champion. Shibahara only opted to prioritise singles last year and she has performed admirably, rising from outside the top 500 to her current ranking of No 128. However, she has never defeated a top-50 opponent and this contest marked just the second grand slam main draw appearance of her career.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As she rolled through the match, she found a nice balance between imposing herself with her early ball striking and remaining solid against an erratic opponent who finished the match with 36 unforced errors. While Raducanu once spent a significant amount of time scouting opponents, she puts part of her success down to finding solutions within herself.“I like watching the opponents,” Raducanu said. “I think I’m probably watching less now. I just have a good awareness of the opponent, what they like to do, and a lot more centred around me. I think I’m trusting myself, trusting my own abilities a lot more and I know what I need to do on the court as well, not necessarily searching so much to the box, asking for what to do, only if I feel like I really need it. I think that’s helped me keep my head in the match, rather than looking up, getting distracted, and kind of searching for something.”Before the tournament, Raducanuspoke in depthabout how the US Open has generated conflicting emotions for her over the years. Her first‑round defeat against Kenin last year was a particularly low point, and Raducanu broke down in tears during her post-match press conference.Things are clearly different now. This summer Raducanu has become a more match tough and confident player than at any point in the past four years. Now she will try to turn that conviction and contentment into another positive run in New York.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025Emma RaducanuUS Open tennisTennisUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Instead, the Englishman had to see off the burden of recent history. Fleetwood prevailed, taking his maidenPGA Tourtitle on his 164th start. Sometimes the good guys win. East Lake delivered one of the most heartwarming tales of the sporting year, a victory for persistence and proof that a relatable golfer can be a triumphant one.Fleetwood displayed magnificent mental strength to brush aside scar tissue caused by falling short, agonisingly so, twice since late June. The most remarkable thing about this success was how unremarkable it all looked. Fleetwood’s closing 68 was so blissfully simple.Keegan Bradley agonising over whether to be a playing Ryder Cup captain for USRead moreAmusingly, for a golfer who had endured so many near misses in the United States, Fleetwood actually lifted two trophies at East Lake. He is the latest winner of the FedEx Cup. The acclaim that met Fleetwood, in a land so far from home and in direct competition with Americans, served to demonstrate his huge popularity. “Tommy, Tommy,” chanted the adoring crowd as he approached the final green. Even those nudged into lesser leaderboard positions could not reasonably deny Fleetwood his moment. He is a nearly man no more.LeBron James postedwords of celebration towards the Southport man. LeBron James!“There was Travelers, there was Memphis, obviously plenty before,” Fleetwood said of ones that got away. “This probably wasn’t the most comfortable I’ve been because, as they rack up, you obviously start to think of [negative] things.“I’m proud of what I’ve done before. Whether I’ve won or not, I’ve still been proud of my career so far, knowing that I still have a long way to go and lots of learning. This doesn’t change that really. This is hopefully just one win, the first of many to come. You cannot win plenty if you don’t win the first one. I’ll continue to try to get better and be the best I can be.” Indeed, with an orangutan removed from his back, Fleetwood is seriously dangerous.A further endearing element is added by the fact Fleetwood still had his life long friend Ian Finnis on the bag for the biggest victory of his career. Golfers of less substance would have blamed and sacked caddies as the wait went on. Finnis has sampled the pain and now the glory.By the time Fleetwood took to the 71st tee, he held a three shot lead. Cantlay had erred at the 16th just when Fleetwood had blinked with a bogey at the hole before. Fleetwood split the fairway with a superb drive at the 17th. Cantlay refused to wilt, hitting his approach shot to 8ft. When Cantlay’s birdie try, a tame effort, fell short Fleetwood had one hand and four fingers upon the tournament. “When you have had a few close calls and let a few trophies slip, a three shot lead doesn’t feel like much,” said Fleetwood with a smile later. A straightforward par at the last meant he won by that margin, at 18 under par, Cantlay sharing second with Henley. Cantlay’s wait for a ninth PGA Tour victory stretches back to 2022.Scheffler’s stunning PGA Tour season closed with a 68 for 14 under in total. The world No 1 tied Corey Conners, who shot a 62, and Cameron Young. For Young, a Ryder Cup wildcard pick seems inevitable. Keegan Bradley, who will captain the US at Bethpage next month, closed on 13 under alongside Sam Burns and Justin Thomas. The latter duo are also likely to feature at Bethpage, with the lingering question for the coming days involving whether Bradley will pick himself. To his credit, Bradley hung around here to congratulate Fleetwood as he headed for scoring duties. Shane Lowry, Harry Hall and Justin Rose provided European flavour by doing likewise.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was the only Cowboys player not wearing a jersey while on the sidelines in Friday’s game with Falcons. At one point in the third quarter, he laid on a training table behind the team bench while the Cowboys were on offense.Schottenheimer said on Saturday that he wants to talk with Parsons about the incident, which went viral on social media.Efton Chism III to trouble for Russell Wilson: NFL preseason storylines that actually matterRead more“Without talking to Micah, I need to figure out what he was doing and why he was doing it,” Schottenheimer said during the conference call. “So until I talk to him, I’m obviously not going to talk about it.”Parsons posted on social media after the game a quote-tweet of WFAA’s Mike Leslie’s post that said the player was on the training table for “a relatively short portion of the evening.”“I’d never disrespect the guys out there fighting for their lives,” said Parsons, a four-time Pro Bowler and two-time first-team All-Pro.Schottenheimer said an MRI on Parsons’ back on Friday was “pretty clean” after Parsons had mentioned back tightness at minicamp in June. The coach expects Parsons to be ready to play for the season opener on 4 September against the Philadelphia Eagles.“I think [defensive end] is an area that we’re pretty deep,” Schottenheimer said.It’s the latest episode in an almost daily soap opera between Parsons, who has asked to be traded, and the Cowboys and longtime owner Jerry Jones. Late Thursday night, Parsons scrubbed the Cowboys from his social media bios and posted what could be considered a farewell video to the organization.The 26-year-old is in the final year of his contract, but the Cowboys could use the franchise tag to retain him in 2026 and 2027. From Jones’ perspective, he considers Parsons essentially under contract for not only 2025, but the next three seasons.“I can’t imagine anybody sitting out for three years, at all,” Jones said in the interview Friday.Parsons’ profiles on his Twitter and Instagram pages both list “TBD” in place of the Cowboys as his employer. And on TikTok, he posted a video that appeared to show him bidding farewell to the Cowboys.In an appearanceon Michael Irvin’s YouTube show, Jones detailed what he said was a contract offer to Parsons, which would have made him the highest-paid non-quarterback in the NFL.“Nobody appreciates Micah Parsons more than the Cowboys or me,” Jones said. “Nobody has ever offered him more money than I have to play football. Period.”Parsons and Jones met earlier this year to discuss contract parameters, among other things. Jones has said the two had a deal in place. Parsons has said it was the framework for discussions between Jones and Parsons’ agent, David Mulugheta.“When we wanted to send the details to the agent, the agent told us to stick it up our ass,” Jones said. “Just so you’re clear.”It was not clear when the Cowboys contacted Mulugheta, whether it was soon after the meeting or since Parsons publicly requested a trade on 1 August as his relationship with the front office continued to diminish.Parsons attended training camp but did not participate, and the video has only stirred speculation that he will sit out the season and sacrifice his huge pay raise for 2025.The Cowboys selected Parsons with the No 12 overall pick of the 2021 draft, and he signed a four-year, $17.1m contract. The Cowboys picked up his fifth-year, $24m option for this season.Explore more on these topicsDallas CowboysNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

How strange to be Sesko right now, aged 22 and a few months, a £73m footballer, thrown into the meat grinder and asked not just to play and score goals for Manchester United, but to fix them too, to work out exactly how this £1bn cut‑and‑shut job of a team, hurled into a non‑negotiable shape by a supremely confident man in white trainers, are actually going to do this.Emile Smith Rowe’s instant impact for Fulham denies Manchester UnitedRead moreScore goals. But also invent an attacking rhythm, link the parts, discover how we’re meant to play. Because, frankly, no one else around here seems to have much of a clue.Craven Cottage had been clammy with late summer heat before kick-off, looking as ever like the kind of place American movies imagine all English football is played, quaint west London terrace houses, chintzy wooden seats, Hugh Grant in a pink shirt. Not to mention a mind-numbingly high‑pitched pre-match public address system, the kind of thing the CIA might have used to smoke out a 1980s Central American dictator from his mansion.If the football was stodgy at first, there was at least a sense of something new here as half‑time approached with the game still scoreless. For years the talk has been about culture shift around Manchester United. And there was a new dynamic here, the question no longer whether Manchester United will win the Premier League again, but whether Manchester United will ever actually score a goal.Have they ever scored one? There is a folk memory of United scoring goals. We have photos, grainy films. But is there any hard, unfakeable evidence of this actually happening? Do we need to harass Buzz Aldrin again?United did score one here, a deflected own goal in the 58th minute, shortly after Sesko had come on. But it wasn’t enough to break a sequence that now states no United player has scored against a team that hasn’t had its goalkeeper sent off since Bilbao in May. That run reads two goals in six games, with four blanks.View image in fullscreen‘A supremely confident man in white trainers’, Ruben Amorim is too rigid in his strategy for a team who are still struggling.Photograph: Vince Mignott/MB Media/Getty ImagesThis can happen. The real issue here is that United are overseen by a laughably rigid systems manager, who appears to have no actual system for how to attack. What are the patterns, the combinations? Manchester United have spent £200m on an entirely new attacking tripod. Does anyone really know, on the evidence so far, how it is supposed to work? There are options. Overloads, crosses, runs between the lines. Why does this look instead like a football version of some extreme cookery TV programme where you just throw a handful of rice and some walnuts at a baffled looking young man and say: Your mission, Patrick, is to prepare a four-course banquet for 5,000 very unhappy people.”Amorim tells Manchester United to ‘grow up’ while Fernandes says referee triggered penalty missRead moreAmorim talked afterwards about United “creating so many chances” and the absolute certainty they would soon begin to score, and you wondered if perhaps he has already spent too much time crouched staring with a furious focus into the turf at his feet, like the world’s most constipated man poring over the final clue in his cryptic mega-crossword.On the other hand, the thing about dogma and systems is they can also be decoded. There will be something extra galling for United fans in Marco Silva talking after the game about how his players knew the way to get behind United’s wingbacks because they basically always do the same thing.The second point is that Sesko is just another one in a long line of very young, very talented footballers thrown into the fray with no clear blueprint, no sense of momentum, nothing but that familiar old sense of dead energy and institutional drag.Sesko did his best here. He touched the ball 16 times. He didn’t have any shots or dribbles or crosses. There was one lovely little switch of feet. Otherwise he was a ghost at the edge of things, tall, rangy, agile, impressively tattooed, like an AI depiction of Elite Young Euro Footballer 2025.View image in fullscreenA dejected Bruno Fernandes, who missed a penalty, trudges off with his teammates.Photograph: Shaun Brooks/CameraSport/Getty ImagesElsewhere, Matheus Cunha had his moments. Bruno Fernandes missed a penalty in ludicrous fashion. Fatally distracted by the existence of referee Chris Kavanagh, Fernandes didn’t shank or scuff or balloon his kick into the stands, he belted it gloriously, a perfect connection.And by the end there was a sense at least of some kind of continuity. Manchester United have spent a decade as a living breathing confirmation that life is what happens while you’re busy making other plans.This remains an endless cycle of what if, of hope and regret. United were given a pat on the head by many observers for losing 1-0 at home last week. There was talk of “good signs” in the defeat by Arsenal, those good signs the fact most of the United team actually looked like they wanted to play football. Nobody sat down or gave up. This is the starting point now for a rebuild, existentialist ground zero. Is this spectacle better then death? If yes, proceed cautiously to the level of doomed hope.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedRuben AmorimFulhamanalysisShareReuse this content"

Why lend it to Ozempic culture? | Bryan Armen GrahamRead more“There are only a few players in my career who challenged me to be the very best, every single time we stepped out on the court,” Williams said. “Maria Sharapova was one of them. Whenever I saw her name next to mine in the draw, I made sure I practiced harder.”And the feeling was mutual.“It’s a gift to have someone who motivates you to reach those heights. And I’ll forever be grateful for bringing out the best in me,” Sharapova said in her acceptance speech. “We both knew no other way than to fight our hearts out. ... We both hated to lose more than anything on this earth, and we both knew that the other was the biggest obstacle between ourselves and the trophy.”The first Russian woman ever to reach No 1 in the rankings and one of 10 women to complete the career grand slam, Sharapova was joined in the Class of 2025 by dominating doubles team Mike and Bob Bryan. The twin brothers finished their speech with one of their trademark chest bumps.Hall of Famers Martina Navratilova, Jim Courier, Stan Smith and Andy Roddick were among those in the crowd, wearing their blue Hall of Fame blazers. Sharapova and the Bryan brothers also received a cast tennis racket that is the hall’s newest offering to inductees.Sharapova was described in her introductory video as someone who “combined grit with glamour,” and some of the stylish outfits she competed in are already displayed in the hall – including a tuxedo-inspired dress she wore when she won Wimbledon in 2008.Williams noted that her rival was the highest-paid female athlete in the world for 11 straight years – bolstered by endorsement income that surpassed her on-court winnings.“She showed us all how to take excellence on the court and turn it into excellence in business, and fashion, branding and everything that she touched,” Williams said. “She changed how women not only approached tennis, but sports and opportunity. She showed us that you can be fierce on the court and strategic off the court, and unapologetically herself the entire time.”Sharapova said her induction gave her a chance to look back – something she tried not to do when she was playing. And she credited her success to “embracing the struggles and leaning into the hard stuff”.“When voices inevitably tell you to ease up, to round your edges, dull your ambition, I hope you can find a way to ignore them,” she said. “Compete fiercely. Raise your standard. Set goals that intimidate you. And don’t forget to celebrate your victories, no matter how small.“In giving my life to tennis, tennis gave me a life,” she said. “And what a remarkable, remarkable life. And I’m so deeply grateful for it.”View image in fullscreenBob and Mike Bryan speak during their induction into the International Tennis Hall of Fame on Saturday.Photograph: Joe Buglewicz/Getty Images for International Tennis Hall of  FameThe Bryans shared a speech as if they were taking turns hitting on a court, alternating at the microphone as they thanked coaches, friends and Davis Cup teammates from a career in which they won 119 ATP titles, including 16 grand slams, and an Olympic gold medal. They spent a record 438 weeks atop the world rankings.Navratilova, who won the 2006 US Open mixed doubles title with Bob Bryan, credited the brothers for keeping the doubles disciplines from being forgotten.“Not too many athletes transcend their sport,” she said. “For twins to do it is amazing.”Bob Bryan said he was fortunate because “for most of my career, I had the No 1 player in the world across the hall.”“Doubles was our love from day one,” Mike Bryan said. “We loved everything about doubles. We loved the strategy, the teamwork, sharing, and the highs and lows. Like our personalities, our games complemented each other perfectly.”Explore more on these topicsTennisMaria SharapovaSerena WilliamsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

While it remains unclear when Saka will return to the fold, the early indications are thought to be positive for the 23-year-old – and it is understood that it is not anticipated he will be sidelined for a similar timeframe as last season.Arteta reveals Eze call, frets over ‘significant’ Saka injury and Ødegaard blowRead moreArsenal, who have won both of their matches so far, head to Anfield next Sunday to face the Premier League champions Liverpool.Martin Ødegaard, the Arsenal captain, was also substituted in the win against Leeds after he fell awkwardly on his right shoulder. He was withdrawn from a fan signing event at the Emirates Stadium on Monday as he focuses on his recovery. But, like Saka, it is not expected that the Norway international will face a sustained period away from action.Meanwhile, the new Arsenal signing Eberechi Eze will create “magic moments” and take the club to a different level, the manager,Mikel Arteta, has claimed. Eze was presented to the Emirates Stadium crowd in the minutes before Arsenal’s demolition job of Leeds which fired the Gunners to an early sight of the Premier League summit.Arteta said of his latest recruit: “He [Eze] has the capacity to create these magic moments. He can do it from different positions, different situations. He’s got that flair and he’s got that charisma about him that is very contagious.“It shows how much we want to take this club to a different level. His talent is unquestionable. He’s experienced in this league. The personality is unbelievable. He can play different positions. We know he can play as an attacking midfielder, right or left. He doesn’t care. And you can tell that what happened on that pitch [before the game] meant the world to him so I am delighted to have him.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Danish rider went on to triumph in a mass sprint featuring a number of GC rivals on the climb to the town near the Italian border with France.“It’s been a while since my last victory, I’m super happy with how I felt and how the team did today. Also super happy to have the red jersey,” Vingegaard said.Vuelta a España: Jasper Philipsen bounces back from Tour pain to win opening stageRead moreDavid Gaudu (Groupama-FDJ) finished third but his teammate Guillaume Martin-Guyonnet, who won the Vuelta’s mountains classification in 2020, was forced to withdraw from the race following a crash.In the early running, Vingegaard was happy to remain in the peloton as Gal Glivar, Jakub Otruba, Liam Slock and Sinuhe Fernandez formed a breakaway pack, taking a two-minute lead from the bunch on mostly flat terrain.The incident that saw Martin-Guyonnet became the first rider to quit the race came as rainfall made the roads treacherous on the 159.6-kilometer (100-mile) route from Alba. The Frenchman’s crash on a descent came just before Vingegaard was one of a number to fall in a separate incident at a roundabout.“I went down pretty hard, but it seems like I didn’t hurt myself too bad. I have a bit of bruises, but I think because it was so slippery, I was sliding more so I didn’t really get any bad road rash or anything,” Vingegaard said.Once the road turned dry going into the final 10km ascent, the peloton began to reduce the gap to the leading group and caught them halfway up the climb.The early leaders were swallowed up by the peloton in the final kilometres, with Visma’s Wilco Kelderman driving the bunch as Vingegaard sat just behind. Julien Bernard took over for Lidl-Trek teammates Ciccone and Andrea Bagioli, before Spanish rider Marc Soler made a break 600 meters out. Yet, it was Vingegaard who pipped Ciccone to the line, followed by David Gaudu and Egan Bernal of Ineos Grenadiers.Belgium’s Jasper Philipsen (Alpecin-Deceuninck), who finished 155th on the stage, retained the green jersey for the points classification.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The problem, according to United’s manager, was his team trying to shut up shop after scoring their second‑half opener via a Rodrigo Muniz own goal.“I think we scored the goal and then we forgot about how we play,” Amorim said of his United side, who remain winless from their opening two games. They were well matched by an impressiveFulham. “We want to win so badly, and that is a good feeling. We scored a goal and everyone on the pitch was thinking: ‘Let’s hold on to the advantage and try to win the game.’Emile Smith Rowe’s instant impact for Fulham denies Manchester UnitedRead more“We have to grow up a lot as a team. For me the most important thing is that during the week they were working really hard, today we worked really hard, and we are going to improve.”Bruno Fernandes missed a first‑half penalty, ballooning the ball over Bernd Leno’s goal, going against his usual more measured technique. Amorim put the miss down to nerves: “Fernandes has so much responsibility with him that … he was thinking in the past.”Fernandes himself put his uncharacteristic miss down to Chris Kavanagh, the referee, bumping into him before he took his kick. “I was upset,” he said. “As a penalty taker, you have your own routines, your own things that you do. It upset me because the referee didn’t apologise. That is what triggered me in that moment, but that’s not the excuse for missing the penalty.

He is due to meet both in the coming days, although the Forest manager insisted that he has no intention of walking out.Crystal Palace 1-1 Nottingham Forest: Premier League – as it happenedRead more“This narrative is absurd,” Nuno said after Callum Hudson-Odoi’s equaliser ensured Forest made it 10 league games without defeat againstCrystal Palaceas they survived a cauldron of noise created by the home supporters still seething at their demotion from the Europa League.However, asked whether he is confident of still being Forest manager after this month, he said: “I cannot answer that question, but what I know is that I’m working and trying to do my job the best that I can. Of course the situation has to be solved and we are responsible players and we’re going to have a good conversation to try to create more than anything a good platform for what is more important, the team.”Marinakis, who has been blamed by Palace for his role in the decision after Forest wrote to Uefa urging them to investigate whether their Premier League rivals had breached multi-club ownership regulations, did not attendthe 1-1 drawwhere a banner was unveiled midway through the first half which took aim at the Greek billionaire. Edu was at ­Selhurst Park as Nuno brought four new signings off the bench in the second half but admitted he would like to bring in more players before the window closes.“I believe so,” he responded when asked if he can repair his relationship with Marinakis. “Everybody wants the best for Forest. Me first, the president first and all the club wants the best for Forest. And I always, during my career, I think it’s the first time that I’m facing a situation and being asked these things. It’s not helpful, but I believe work with conflict doesn’t work out. What we did last season together will stick forever in our memories. This is the responsibility that we have to our club. Ignore the noise and work hard.”Oliver Glasner is also desperate for investment in Palace’s squad after Eberechi Eze’s club record sale to Arsenal and he seemed hopeful that they will get their business ­completed in time after new American billionaire co-owner Woody Johnson was spotted mingling with fans before the game.“I don’t talk about the players we are looking for because it just makes it more expensive. It’s pretty clear what we need,” he said. “We are competing in four competitions this season and if you lose one of your top stars who had 14 goals and 12 assists [last season] then it’s pretty clear we need to replace him with a starter. This is what we are looking for and I’m pretty sure we will get it done.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The club are also in the market for two new full-backs,with Matty Cash a key target, before the window closes on 1 September.Livaković is an experienced goalkeeper who has 66 caps for Croatian and has spent the past two seasons in the Turkish Super Lig withFenerbahcewhere he was their No 1 until the start of the campaign and will be allowed to leave Istanbul for the right amount. The 30-year-old is yet to start a game this season as José Mourinho has preferred İrfan Can Eğribayat in Champions League qualifiers and domestic matches.Previous Premier League interest in Livakovic has come from Tottenham and Manchester United and the Croatian is eager to test himself in England. He was carefully monitored during the 2022 World Cup when he helped Croatia finish third in the tournament, including a match-winning performance in the quarter-final shootout victory over Brazil.If Forest were able to complete a deal for Livakovic, it would become the club’s ninth signing of the summer. Forest have already spent £140m to aquire Igor Jesus, Dan Ndoye, Omari Hutchinson, James McAtee, Jair Cunha and Arnaud Kalimuendo, while Gunn joined for nothing and Douglas Luiz is on loan from Juventus.Explore more on these topicsNottingham ForestTransfer windowFenerbahcenewsShareReuse this content"

Slot revealed Howe is the one Premier League manager he has texted during his Liverpool reign and believes the 47-year-old will eventually coach England. Friendly overtures, however, may not be reciprocated when Liverpool visit St James’ Park on Monday evening.Isak will be conspicuous by his absence from Newcastle’s first home game of the season, having in effect downed tools in an attempt to force aBritish record transfer to Liverpool. The Premier League champions have contributed to a trying summer for Newcastle, turning Isak’s head while also signing his potential replacement, Hugo Ekitiké. Their £110m offer for the Sweden international remains on Newcastle’s table.The undeniably massive Alexander Isak affair has created its own sub-reality | Barney RonayRead moreSlot expects an “intense” night at St James’ and, although Liverpool’s pursuit of Isak is strictly business, he recognises the effect a player going on strike will have had on his opposite number. “In general I have sympathy forEddie Howebecause he is a great human being,” said the Dutchman. “It’s maybe not a coincidence that I’ve texted with him because I think he’s a very nice, honest and polite colleague.“For the rest, I don’t need to have sympathy for a manager that can still have the availability of Gordon, Murphy, Elanga, Barnes … You don’t need to have sympathy for a manager who has so many good players in his squad. But, in general, I like him and I don’t think it will be a surprise to anyone if eventually he is going to lead the national team of England.”Slot and Howe exchanged messages afterthe Carabao Cup finalin March, when Isak scored the decisive second goal to secure Newcastle’s first domestic trophy for 70 years at Liverpool’s expense. “The only [Premier League] manager I’ve ever texted with was Eddie Howe,” said Slot. “In Holland I texted with a few more. I don’t think it is good for me to say what he texted me or what I texted him.“They fully deserved to win the League Cup final. I didn’t text him something different. If I see him [on Monday] I will be the same as I was last season and I expect nothing different from him as well.”Relations may have been strained between Howe and key figures at Anfield by the transfer saga. Richard Hughes, theLiverpoolsporting director who submitted the bid for Isak, has been close friends with Howe since they shared a flat during their playing days at Bournemouth. Howe has been friends with Michael Edwards, chief executive of football at Fenway Sports Group, Liverpool’s owner, since they played for Portsmouth in the early 2000s. Edwards worked for Portsmouth at the time as a Prozone analyst.Slot, returning to the theme of Howe’s predicament, said: “Do you feel sympathy? To a certain extent because I like him as a manager and as a person. It’s not like we are friends and we are going to go on holiday together. You are asking me these questions because of Isak, of course. I added to that by saying we exchanged messages, the only manager I’ve exchanged messages with in the Premier League until now. I do speak to other managers after games. Maybe there’s a reason for that because my sports director has his number. Maybe he doesn’t have all the numbers of all the other managers.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Chiesa delivered in the opening Premier League fixture with an 88th-minute winner, but purely in terms of numbers compared with last season Liverpool’s need for another forward option is clear after the sales of Luis Díaz and Darwin Núñez, and the death of Diogo Jota.“It depends how you want to look at it,” said Slot. “If you see Florian Wirtz as an attacking option as well, you can make it five [forwards available]. Yes we’ve sold Darwin, we’ve brought in Hugo, Luis is gone, but maybe you can see Florian as his replacement. Then you have Jeremie Frimpong who, when he is fit, is definitely an option to play as a winger as well. So then we end up at six. We have six players who can play in three positions.“I would consider Florian in more games for that position. There were games last season – [Manchester] City away and Villa away – where we did play with an extra midfielder, I think Curtis Jones. It depends not only on being an extra midfielder, but also the tactics and how the opposition line up.” And how the transfer saga of the summer pans out over the next few days.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolNewcastle UnitedArne SlotEddie HowefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But now, finally, the future is here. If Goodison Park was a temple to Everton’s rich and storied past,Hill Dickinson Stadiumrepresents something long desired for the future, a great leap forward in their ambition to host a world-class football team. In truth, it is much needed.Proud though Evertonians are of their club’s sleeping giant status, the club have too long traded on the former glories chronicled in songs of the Glwadys Street end.Everton send Brighton packing as Jack Grealish ignites win in club’s new homeRead moreHere, on asun-drenched afternoon on the banks of the River Mersey, change and optimism was the tune of the day – and the architect Dan Meis’s 52,000-seat stadium, a sleek, stylish construction of glass and steel feels like the right place to harness that spirit.It is a long time to spend in one place, 133 years. Perhaps it was the sheer newness of it all that had fans ambling at half speed, seemingly awestruck up Regent Road, the site of their new ground, stopping for family selfies and to take videos for social media.More likely it was the stadium itself, which seems to rise out of the river when approached from the nearby Eldonian Village estate, that gave early arrivals their moment for pause.Its roof, a flowing arch of polished steel, glints like a swallow’s wing in the early afternoon sunlight. A successful season cannot be guaranteed by the move into their new home – as Everton’s opening defeat at Leeds showed – but there is undoubtedly a feeling of joy around this place.Inside, families swept around the spacious concourse which flows around the stadium almost in homage to the rolling river behind. It is a marked departure from the visceral experience of navigating entry to Goodison – a weekly ritual of charting a course through a crush of people meandering out of narrow streets, dodging chip wrappers, parked cars and plastic pint glasses along the way. Although the experience on Sunday wasn’t faultless, with some fans complaining of long queues for the bar and bottlenecks in busy areas.View image in fullscreenFans walked slowly up to their new stadium, ‘seemingly awestruck’ and stopping for selfies.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianBut of course the true test of Hill Dickinson Stadium’s suitability would be what happened inside. With 10 minutes to kick-off came evidence of one thing the designers had thought about very carefully. As a booming sound system dialled up, nervous energy in the stands soon became a simmering anticipation. Acoustics is not a word which often comes up in conversations among football fans – Evertonians may rightly be more concerned with their lack of full-backs than a world-class PA system – but the way Hill Dickinson Stadium retains the thrum of fan excitement invoked a physical response here.There She Goes, the 90s indie song by the scouser band the La’s, is now a fan anthem after it became part of Goodison Park’s swan song. Here it was the first song roared in unison by the packed stadium in full voice. It is magnificent – a bittersweet goodbye turned soundtrack for the future, exactly what the occasion called for.And then, as kick-off approached, this roomy, comfortable feat of 21st-century design felt all of a sudden very familiar – old school, even. The Evertonians went through the usual pre-match routine of songs, before the old battle cry went up. A roar for Z-Cars bolstered by the 10,000 or so extra voices all this modernity can accommodate.Those who knew Goodison will know that its silences could be as deafening as its crescendos – the clattering of wooden seats announcing an early half-time pint after a disappointing start. How those moments of disillusion play out in this new, more sanitary environment, we will have to wait to find out.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their game effort was rewarded when Jack Grealish,surely a cult-hero in the making, set up the first goal of this new era – finding Iliman Ndiaye, whose finish induced the kind roar which would test the mettle of any roof.That outpouring of elation and relief, which are often the same thing where Everton are concerned, were only matched when Jordan Pickford – a cult hero firmly established – saved a penalty which all but guaranteed a victorious start to life by the river.Here was a thoroughly Everton afternoon. Not perfect, by any means. But a step forward, willed into being by the support of a faithful blue army of fans who finally got their moment in the sun.They may no longer reside among the terrace houses of L4 but they are, as another of those old songs says, the Goodison gang.

We are about to find out. Arsenal’s battling run to Lisbon and subsequentvictory over Barcelonaended a north London trophy drought, yet it has still been six years since the most decorated women’s team in England won a Women’s Super League title. Back-to-back League Cup wins in 2023 and 2024 ensured the cupboard was filled somewhat during that time, but those were widely viewed as not enough for a club with such an illustrious history, and certainly did not match up with the level of investment being pumped into the team.Arsenal launch meet-and-greet prize draw for fans after WSL matchesRead moreEnding Chelsea’s dominance of the WSL is the focus of every team looking to challenge at the top and Arsenal are no different. For the latest challenge they boast players riding high on the crest of a trophy-laden wave, with five European champions for club and country in their squad followingEngland’s triumph in Switzerland. The key is finding consistency across the four competitions that have eluded them in recent years. Renée Slegers’ squad has been strengthened, with the world-record fee paid for Olivia Smith a real statement of intent. It has, however, also suffered the blow ofLeah Williamson being ruled outfor the start of the campaign following a knee procedure.Arsenal have for some time weathered accusations that they can sell out crowds but can’t win trophies. May’s glory in Lisbon has quashed that narrative, but the onus is on them now to deliver domestic success. All the ingredients for success are there and, in Slegers, they have a manager clearly capable of bringing them together and cooking up a treat.Arsenal’s league placing since 2021.Arsenal’s league placing since 2021The managerSlegers’ time at the helm following the departure of Jonas Eidevall in October has rightly led to a place on the shortlist for the Ballon d’Or women’s coach of the year award for the 36-year-old. At the start of last season, Slegers was a relative unknown; an assistant coach at Arsenal who stepped into the breach following a poor start to the season that led to Eidevall’s resignation. An unbeaten run up to the winter break and qualification for the Champions League knockout stage prompted a permanent contract and Arsenal flourished, her inclusive approach and the culture she has encouraged yielding remarkable results. Now Slegers has had the chance to further shape the team the way she wants it.Off-field pictureThe decision to host all WSL games at the Emirates Stadium this season will further elevate Arsenal’s financial position. The club have sold 15,000 season tickets for the main stadium, having increased the number of fixtures they’ve played at the ground year on year. From the 2023 financial year to 2024, Arsenal’s matchday turnover rose from £2.7m to £4.4m; the impact of last season’s games at the Emirates on the club’s finances will be evident next year and the full effects of a permanent WSL-related move to the ground will be seen in the 2027 filings. The scale of the crowds at the Emirates is of benefit to other WSL clubs too, with players from across the world wanting to play there.Star signingView image in fullscreenOlivia Smith became the most expensive player in the world with her move from Liverpool.Photograph: David Price/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesThe recruitment of Chloe Kelly on a permanent deal following the conclusion of her successful loan spell from Manchester City is significant, but the signing of Smith is a huge statement of intent. After missing out on Naomi Girma and Keira Walsh, who joined Chelsea, and having reportedly failed with record bids for Mary Earps and Alessia Russo (before the latter was signed on a free), Arsenal needed a big transfer. Smith shone at Liverpool and was named the Professional Footballers’ Association young player of the year earlier this month. She is a star.Stepping upKyra Cooney-Cross made 19 WSL appearances for Arsenal last season, starting 10 times, and displayed maturity and confidence on the ball. The 23-year-old has spent time during the summer training with Myles Lewis-Skelly as she looks to ramp up her influence on the side. Supplanting the mercurial Kim Little and the defensive-midfield maestro Lia Wälti is no mean feat but Cooney-Cross is undoubtedly snapping at their heels. This season could well be the year where the Australian shakes off the prospect label and becomes a mainstay.It was a good summer for …It would be neglectful to pick out one of Arsenal’s victorious Lionesses given all of them were influential in a bruising and thrilling Euros campaign. Kelly was the gamechanger, Russo led the line, Beth Mead was hugely impactful and, despite not playing a minute of football, Lotte Wubben-Moy’s influence on the side is held in high regard. Then there was Williamson, the captain, and Michelle Agyemang, who was the tournament’s breakout star and has departed for another loan spell at Brighton as part of the 19-year-old’s ongoing development. Agyemang will no doubt return to Arsenal given how highly rated she is in north London.Arsenal’s results from the 2024-25 season.Arsenal’s results from the 2024-25 seasonMain initiative to attract more fansView image in fullscreenArsenal are breaking attendance record after attendance record.Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty ImagesThe decision to host all WSL games at the Emirates has been in the works for some time, part of a long-term strategy that has led to large crowds for the women’s games in N5, and it is no accident Arsenal have broken attendance record after attendance record. The decision to play Champions League group-stage games at Borehamwood may feel like a step back, but with Arsenal struggling to maintain their high attendances on weekday evenings, there is logic to the decision.The next phase is managing player access with so many more fans in attendance, and the club will draw from a ballot of season-ticket holders and six-game bundle buyers before each game fora meet-and-greetto curb the growing pressure on players to spend up to an hour or more signing autographs and taking photos after games.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueArsenal WomenWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Substitute Vinícius slipped the ball through to Mbappé, who finished coolly to double the lead.Deep into stoppage time, Vinícius found himself unmarked in the box and calmly picked out the far corner to add Real’s third and final goal.Juventusopened their Serie A campaign with a 2-0 home win overParmaon Sunday, sealed by debutant Jonathan David’s opener and a late tap-in from Dusan Vlahovic.There were few chances for either side in the first half and Juve’s Francisco Conceição went closest early on with a diving header that forcedParmagoalkeeper Zion Suzuki into a full-stretch save to keep it out.Parma came out sharper after the break and nearly struck within minutes. Mateo Pellegrino broke through only to be denied by a superb last-ditch block from Gleison Bremer that kept Juve level. The scare seemed to jolt the hosts into life and they soon piled on the pressure.Kenan Yildiz and Conceição repeatedly found space on the wings, creating several chances for Juve early in the second half, with Conceicao rattling the bar with a deflected strike. In the 59th minute, Yildiz burst free down the flank and whipped in a pinpoint pass to David, who stole a step on his marker and coolly finished with the outside of his boot to put Juve ahead. Yildiz could have doubled Juve’s lead minutes before the end, but his half-volley was kept out by Suzuki, who reacted sharply to palm it away from the bottom corner.Andrea Cambiaso was sent off following a tussle with Mathias Fjortoft Lovik in the 83rd minute that ended with the Italian seemingly striking Parma’s Norwegian defender. A minute later, Juve capitalised with a swift counter as Yildiz drove into the box and squared for substitute Vlahovic, who tapped in to seal the match.View image in fullscreenJonathan David put Juventus into the lead.Photograph: Alberto Lingria/ReutersAtalanta, under new coach Ivan Juric, opened with a 1-1 home draw against promotedPisa, as Isak Hien’s first-half own goal put the visitors ahead but the lead was cancelled out by Gianluca Scamacca five minutes after the restart.Hamburgreturned from a seven-year absence and emerged from its first game back in the Bundesliga with a 0-0 draw atBorussia Mönchengladbach.The promoted side spent much of Sunday’s game defending, with goalkeeper Daniel Heuer Fernandes diving well to deny Gladbach captain Rocco Reitz among other saves.“We knew we were coming up against a strong team that would have many people in midfield, so we kept it tight in the centre and tried to hit on counterattacks,” Heuer Fernandes said. “Of course you never know where you stand after such a [difficult] pre-season, but I think everyone saw today how we can take on the league and that’s exactly how it should go.”Hamburg were the last surviving member of the Bundesliga to have played every season since its formation in 1963, earning the nickname “der Dino,” until it was finally relegated in 2018 after several close shaves.Colognemarked their return as second-division champion with a 1-0 win atMainz, who had Paul Nebel sent off on the hour for a tactical foul to stop Jakub Kaminski going through on goal. The sending off provided encouragement forCologne, who had been primarily defending up to then, and Kaminski’s strike partner Marius Bülter headed the winner in the final minute.Explore more on these topicsEuropean club footballLa LigaReal OviedoReal MadridSerie AJuventusParmanewsShareReuse this content"

The under-fire manager also revealed after the game that he wanted to bring Hamza Igamane on in the second half, but the forward claimed he was injured.The visitors started without a recognised centre-forward, with midfielder Thelo Aasgaard leading the line as Danilo and Igamane started on the bench with Cyriel Dessers injured. The visitors found themselves behind in the 33rd minute when Saints striker Jonah Ayunga raced through to beat goalkeeper Jack Butland.Celtic brush Livingston and protests aside as Rodgers focuses on Champions LeagueRead moreMartin changed tactics and personnel in the second half and in the 78th minute, 18-year-old substitute Curtis drilled in the equaliser with his third goal of the season but the visitors could not find a winner, leaving Martin with three wins in nine games as Rangers head coach.Asked after the game about Igamane, Martin said: “I wanted to bring him on around 60 minutes, and he said he has a sore quad so he can’t come on. He wouldn’t be on the bench if he’s not fit. So he said he’d done it warming up.“We turned down a bid this week, but we’ll assess his injury and I have to trust Hamza so we’ll see what happens. As a human being I have to trust that he has done it in the warm-up like he said and we’ll see.”Asked if the Morocco international fell into his category of players with one eye on the exit door, Martin replied: “I think when you’ve had a bid turned down in the week and then this happens, maybe … I’m quite calm about it. We’ll assess Hamza [for his injury]. Hopefully, it’s not too bad and we’ll see what happens.”Martin moved on to discuss Dessers, who could also leave Ibrox before the transfer window closes. “Cyriel’s not asked to leave. He’s not asked to leave once. But we’ve had a lot of discussions about it so we’ll see what happens.”“He’s worked really hard to get fit, hasn’t quite been fit, he’ll probably be fit for Wednesday,” the former Southampton manager added. “So while he’s made it really clear what his intention would be or what his desire would be, there’s been no problem, none. He trains properly, performs with the team, been great, but everyone’s different. Every human being is different.”View image in fullscreenFindlay Curtis (right) celebrates with Lyall Cameron after equalising for Rangers.Photograph: Vagelis Georgariou/Action Plus/ShutterstockFive minutes into the match in Paisley, the Saints goalkeeper Shamal George made a fine save from Oliver Antman’s 20-yard drive.St Mirrenlooked sharper and more aggressive as the half wore on, and striker Mikael Mandron just failed to get enough on a terrific Phillips cross to the back post.Just after the half-hour mark, Mandron split open the visiting defence with an incisive pass to fellow forward Ayunga, who left the visitors’ captain John Souttar trailing before confidently driving the ball past Butland.

But it was not long before Butland dived to save Ayunga’s angled-drive and the hosts, stronger and more cohesive, continued to threaten.St Mirren’s final shot or pass let them down on several occasions and they were made to pay when Curtis – on for Joe Rothwell – picked up a clearance from a corner and drilled a shot low past George and into the net. Rangers pressed for the winner in the final stages and George made a good save from substitute James Tavernier’s long range shot.Curtis fired over from a narrow angle and at the other end, Butland tipped an Alex Gogic header over the crossbar, as the match ended in a frantic finish and boos from the travelling fans at the final whistle.The St Mirren manager, Stephen Robinson, was proud of his players’ efforts. “I thought we were outstanding in the first half again, created numerous chances and just a little bit of decision making, lacking that quality in certain decisions,” he said.“Credit to Rangers, they come out second half, made changes. Spooked us maybe a little bit for 20, 25 minutes. So that’s something we need to improve on, but overall, we’re happy with the point, we believe it could have been more, but they may feel the exact same.”Celtic can go nine points clear of their rivals if they win the Old Firm game at Ibrox next Sunday. First Rangers have to rescue their Champions League hopes with a trip to Club Brugge on Wednesday, where they look to claw backa 3-1 deficit from the first leg of the playoff.Explore more on these topicsScottish PremiershipSt MirrenRangersnewsShareReuse this content"

It is understood the FA will look into the incident.Palace clinched their place in the Europa League with a shock FA Cup triumph against Manchester City in May, but subsequently were excluded from the competition due to the previous co-owner John Textor holding a controlling interest in Lyon. Uefa’s decision to rule that Textor held a controlling interest in two clubs in the Europa League only occurred after a drawn-out saga, with Marinakis reportedly writing to the governing body to raise concerns about Palace’s ownership.Forest were first in line to benefit from Palace’s exclusion after they finished seventh in the Premier League and qualified for the Conference League.After Palace were demoted to Uefa’s third-tier competition, they appealed to the court of arbitration for sport, but failed to overturn the decision and were consigned to Conference League football, while Forest received a last-minute promotion to the Europa League.It set the scene for a fiery occasion when Forest made the trip to south London on Sunday and even though Marinakis did not attend the fixture at Selhurst Park, the Palace fans made their feelings clear.The FAwill investigate the matter.Explore more on these topicsCrystal PalaceNottingham ForestThe FAnewsShareReuse this content"

The Black Ferns finished with 13 players on the pitch.New Zealand’s director of performance, Allan Bunting, had no update on either player after the game as they are waiting for them to be assessed. The lock Alana Bremner said she was proud of how they adapted.Bremner said: “We were talking after and said ‘we didn’t realise we were 13 for a couple of minutes there’. When they realised our game drivers really stepped up. It was awesome to see the way we did that and a lot of heart was shown, especially on defence. When you are two women down you have to work harder for each other.”It blighted a fairly positive outing for the six-time winners during which the World Cup record try-scorer ­Portia Woodman-Wickliffe added to her tally after being introduced in the second half.Brazil fans enjoy carnival atmosphere despite World Cup rout by South Africa | Luke McLaughlinRead moreThe scoreboard did not sufficiently tell the game’s story, where at times the Black Ferns were undone by their own mistakes. It was a mildly frustrating first half littered with hand­ling errors and was underlined by the entire squad included in a huddle before they hit the changing rooms. In the second half they sprinted away from Spain, who are 10 places below New Zealand in the world rankings.A brighter note for the Black Ferns was Jorja Miller’s solid performance, despite being substituted at the interval. The sevens player of the year has already won Olympic gold and Sevens World Cup silver, but made her 15s World Cup debut and scored two tries.“I was stoked,” Miller said. “Even just running out and putting the ­jersey on, it was a really special moment. As you see on the side [of the shirt which shows six World Cup wins] it shows how much legacy and history this team has created at Rugby World Cups. So to be a part of that, a positive part and add another year on, it’s really special.”View image in fullscreenThe New Zealand flanker Jorja Miller scores a try during an impressive personal performance in the win over Spain.Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty ImagesThe 21-year-old was the first try‑scorer and then linked up well with the 18-year-old Braxton Sorensen-McGee to score her ­second before Liana Mikaele-Tu’u, named player of the match, went over. Spain’s Amàlia Argudo kicked three points to round off the half.While the Black Ferns continued to be stifled by their own errors they were the first to score in the second half through Leti-I’iga. They were in again with Georgia Ponsonby and Leti‑I’iga crossed for her second just after ­Olsen‑Baker’s injury. The replacement wing ­Woodman-­Wickliffe was next among the action and scored her 21st Rugby World Cup try with Teresa ­Setefano ­scoring before Ines ­Antolinez ­Fernández got Spain’s deserved try after a hearty performance.New Zealand wrapped up all five points but eyes will be on if their two stars will be available for the rest of the tournament.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Rugby World Cup 2025New Zealand women's rugby union teamWomen's rugby unionRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

A moment that said plenty about Trump’s ego, sure. But ultimately, only a moment.Nope. It’s reality. Inescapable. Donald Trump will be everywhere Fifa is in the US, including at the 2026World Cup– due to start in about 10 months, when Canada and Mexico will co-host.If this much wasn’t clear already after that moment at MetLife Stadium andalltheothertimesTrump or his agenda haveaffectedWorld Cup affairs, it may have become so after Friday’s Oval Office appearance with Fifa president Gianni Infantino – the eighth reported meeting between the pair since January, and the fifth to take place in public at the White House.Trump says 2026 World Cup draw will be staged at Washington’s Kennedy CenterRead moreTrump wore a signature hat reading “TRUMP WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING” – one of his collection that was deemed noteworthy enough todisplay to world leadersin the middle ofhigh-stakes talkswith lives hanging in the balance. He then announced that the attention of the soccer world will once again be on him in December. On the fifth of that month, the World Cup draw will take place not at the Las Vegas Sphere as had been widely expected, but at Washington DC’s Kennedy Center – a historic venue and a worthy place to sort through some ping-pong balls, but also one that is now controlled by Trump, who has installed himself as chair, named himself as host of the institution’s annual honors, overseen upcoming renovations (“there’s nothing like gold,” he said on Friday in reference to his Oval Office redesign), and may soonlend his wife’s nameto the opera house.“Some people refer to it as the ‘Trump Kennedy Center,’ but we’re not prepared to do that quite yet,” Trump said on Friday. “Maybe in a week or so.”The World Cup is not federally controlled like the Kennedy Center, but it will now be subject to a similar dynamic. The tournament Trumphas taken credit for bringing to the USwill take place under his presidency, with the draw and “big press conferences” happening in a venue he controls, put on by an organization run by someone looking to befriend Trump at every turn – including bybecoming the Trump Organization’s tenant. There is almost no choice other than to accept that Trump will make sure he is front and center at this tournament – even in spots where he has no business, or where his involvement may be seen as uncouth or inappropriate. It’s a dynamic Americans know well now, more than a decade into Trump’s rise.After Trump’s announcement, Infantino allowed him to hold the single most valuable hardware in men’s soccer, the World Cup trophy –not unheard of for heads of state, but more uncommon when accompanied with Infantino’s comment: “Since you are a winner, of course, you can as well touch it.”Trump asked if he could keep the trophy afterward, and it was not immediately clear that he was joking, given that Infantino let him keep the Club World Cup trophy, where it has been on display in the Oval Office ever since.Trump made this latest World Cup announcement in practically the same breath as he expounded on his latest imposition on the American people –a strong-arm takeover of Washington DC, which he called a “crime-infested rat hole” despite the fact that the Justice Department had previously reported a 30-year low in violent crime in the capital. Trump continued to promote his crackdown later on, with the trophy directly in front of him on the Resolute Desk, as if it was a microphone meant to amplify his message. When Trump got to talking about immigration, Infantino moved the trophy out of the way.When prompted by Trump on Friday, Infantino – rather than demurring to comment on the domestic affairs of a foreign country – gave a solemn “oh yes” to express approval of the president’s plan for DC. It’s a plan Trump said he intends to spread to other American cities,mentioning Chicago specifically, but one can easily imagine that any city that voted against him – like 10 of the 11 US host cities for the upcoming World Cup – would be on the list.“Johnny”, as Trump calls Infantino, then gifted him a ceremonial ticket to the World Cup final – row 1, seat 1.Given all of this, expect the World Cup final camera to linger on Trump’s face longer than many of the players, coaches, and team staff who will have worked all their professional lives to get to that point.You’ll see him at the World Cup before then, too. He’ll boast endlessly about how well the tournament is going, only changing tack if things get so bad it’s obvious to everyone, in which case he’ll blame someone else (watch your back, “Johnny”). He’ll do at least one half-time interview on Fox, which is broadcasting the tournament in the US. Alexi Lalas,a big fan of Trump’s Maga movement, will shake his hand. Don’t rule out a gold-encrusted seat waiting for Trump at the final and any other games he chooses to attend.There can be no doubt now – the World Cup is not a guest in the house Trump runs. It is his plaything. AndFifaappears happy to do anything it takes for things to remain that way lest world football’s governing body be discarded or, worse, made a target.The World Cup, beneath all of the commercialism, is almost comically pure-hearted. It’s a celebration of the most popular sport in the world. It gives people across the world something in common to talk about, to bond over, to yell at. That feeling goes double for the host nations, and it’s a large part of the tournament’s singular power. It’s why it’s so coveted by countries that rule through authoritarian means – and that now arguably includes the US under TrumpIndelible, sublime moments will still happen at the 2026 tournament. People will still take joy, hurt, anger, and feelings from them. But those moments will be punctuated by Trump – eternally encroaching on even the most elevated of emotional experiences.If this news drives you to boo, ready your vocal cords. If it drives you to act, start thinking about what you want that to look like. If it thrills you, pace yourself. Whichever way, it’s time to get used to it.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026FifaFootball politicsWorld CupDonald TrumpTrump administrationGianni InfantinocommentShareReuse this content"

Here’s how they workSun 24 Aug 2025 13.21 EDTLast modified on Sun 24 Aug 2025 14.10 EDTShare“Ice is just around the corner,” my friend said, looking up from his phone. We were writing at a coffee shop in one of the oldest neighborhoods ofNew YorkCity, where schools and churches support thriving migrant communities as they have since long before the United States existed. Now the agents of this rogue federal agency – recognized for civil rights abuses like racial profiling, wrongful detention, medical neglect and inhumane detentions – were just footsteps away, shaking down our neighbors in their homes and at the park across the street.A day earlier, I had met with foreign correspondents at the United Nations to explain the AI surveillance architecture that Ice is using across the United States. The law enforcement agency uses targeting technologies which one of my past employers,PalantirTechnologies, has both pioneered and proliferated – tools I was once charged with illustrating as a graphic designer and writer, yet the consequences of which I am just coming to understand. Although largely invisible, technology like Palantir’s plays a major role in world events, from wars in Iran, Gaza and Ukraine to the detainment of immigrants and dissident students in the United States. But despite its ubiquity, lawmakers, technologists and the media are failing to protect people from the threat of this particular kind of weaponized AI and its consequences, partly because they haven’t recognized it by name.Known as intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance (Istar) systems, these tools, built by several companies, allow users totrack, detain and, in the context of war, kill people at scale with the help of AI. They deliver targets to operators by combining immense amounts of publicly and privately sourced data to detect patterns, and are particularly helpful in projects of mass surveillance, forced migration and urban warfare. Also known as “AI kill chains”, they pull us all into a web of invisible tracking mechanisms that we are just beginning to comprehend, yet are starting to experience viscerally in the US as Ice wields these systems near our homes, churches, parks and schools.US surveillance firms run a victory lap amid Trump’s immigration crackdownRead moreThe invisible nature of these surveillance structures – and how they influence our lives – is part of the reason the public understanding of what these tools do is so murky. It is also, however, what drew me to work for Palantir as an architecture writer. It was a chance to get to know the digital spaces where many people spend most of their lives today. Working with cloud software in offices, driving new cars in our commutes, doom-scrolling on social media at home – we all feed vast amounts of data to surveillance and targeting programs created by big tech which we often don’t recognize until it’s too late. This is why I continue trying to convey and illustrate how these Istar applications violate our civil rights and autonomy in increasingly perverse and violent ways.The dragnets powered by Istar technology trap more than migrants and combatants – as well as their families and connections – in their wake. They appear to violate first and fourth amendment rights: first, by establishing vast and invisible surveillance networks that limit the things people feel comfortable sharing in public, including whom they meet or where they travel; and second, by enablingwarrantless searches and seizures of people’s data without their knowledge or consent.They are rapidly depriving some of the most vulnerable populations in the world –political dissidents, migrants, orresidents of Gaza– of their human rights.There was a time when I wrote about the row homes in my neighborhood, with ornate windows and star-shaped iron studs, and how they welcomed migrants who sought hard work and opportunity in the US. With shared walls and affordable rents, they created tolerant and prosperous communities and accelerated the rise of the largest middle class in history. Now a new kind of architecture greets migrants and visitors to America and decides their future – one that is not made of bricks, mortar and lumber, but comprising these invisible and invasive digital surveillance systems.With names like Investigative Case Management (ICM) and ImmigrationOS, the big data platforms Palantir provides for the Department of Homeland Security, and like those it offers the IDF, are fundamentally composed of four shared elements: the underlying data integrated into the system, the interpretation and modeling of that data through analytics, and the execution of automated actions – with or without human involvement. At every layer of this architecture, there are significant ethical questions regarding civil rights, data collection, data quality, bias, discrimination, accuracy, automation and, most importantly, accountability.Ultimately, however, these platforms generate and track targets by exploiting a mind-boggling range of datasets. This can include deeply personal information such as biometric and medical data, social media data involving friends and family, precise location data derived from license plate readers, SIM card data, and surveillance drone data. They can also process data purchased from a thriving ecosystem of private data brokers, or subpoenaed from companies such as Waymo and Meta. The lack of transparency regarding datasets exploited in these applications, and how they are shared across systems, further distorts the picture. That’s why it’s important to focus on the victims.It’s time to embrace the cause of privacy  or we will witness the unbridled proliferation of these targeting tools in our public livesSoon, Trump’s mass resettlement agenda – from targeting and tracking to managing the arrest and removal of migrants from the country – could be seamlessly coordinated using Istar tools.Ice recently paid Palantir tens of millionsto enable “complete target analysis of known populations”, bolstering the Trump administration’s deportation efforts. In Gaza, Palantir provides the IDF with critical data infrastructure forwar-related missions. The Israeli armed forces, meanwhile, have developedIstar tools of their ownlike “Where’s Daddy”, which follow targets to their family homes for execution via cheap, non-guided “dumb bombs”.Palantir hascontested reportsthat it conducts widespread surveillance of Americans and says it is “committed to defending human rights”. For all the reasons above, I reject those claims. It is time to embrace the cause of privacy again, or we will witness the unbridled proliferation of these targeting tools in our commercial and public lives. As AI targeting technologies become more normalized in the United States, they are also increasingly incorporated into the private sector as companies build their own dragnets of data with platforms like Palantir to target their customers and employees – not to kill or deport them, but to shape their behavior and maximize revenue, increasing further systems of control.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In Colorado, the nation’s first consumer protection laws on AI – which aim to protect state residents from discrimination – are now under threat. This is the reason why last monthI took to the streets of Denver, along with around 40 other activists, to march to Palantir’s headquarters from the state capitol. We were joined by protestersfrom coast to coast, in Washington DC, New York, Palo Alto and Seattle, who, driven by loose connections but a shared cause, also picketed the offices of Palantir in their cities. Four people were arrested in New York, and in Denver our small group was met with animpressive and coordinated show of force. We faced just about as many police officers as protesters throughout our two-mile journey, where they shut down many streets and followed our convoy with drones.Riding in my truck bed, I yelled out for the release of my neighbors from Ice custody – such asEric Sanchez Goitia,Jeanette Vizguerra, andNixon and Dixon Perez– people who, like me, have built their entire lives in Colorado as immigrants who sought hard to contribute, learn and work for this country. The fact that they are imprisoned and driven out by technologies made in their home state, paid for with their taxpayer money, is a huge stain on our state’s history. As we approached the capitol on our return, I begged for the mayor of Denver, Mike Johnston, the governor of Colorado, Jared Polis, and our representatives to pay attention to the homegrown technologies that are harming our neighbors, to stoptrying to prevent the country’s first AI consumer protections from being implementedand to defy the federal governmentas it seeks to build more detention centers in our state.The Colorado senate is now meeting for a budgetary special session, where the state’s first-in-the-nation AI consumer protections are under risk of being watered down, delayed or dismantled by venture capital interests. Therefore, our protests this week will not only target the Palantir headquarters but the state capitol as representatives deliberate on the measure. They will support the new AI Sunshine Bill, a streamlined version of the consumer protection bill,and oppose a bill supported by big businessthat would strip individuals of their right to sue AI businesses. Our movement has also grown,with more than 40 marches plannedthis weekend against big tech and Palantir across the country.These days, I’m more worried about when, not if, I’ll become a target. I am a freelance journalist, I am an immigrant and I have demonstrated in support of Palestine – and these technologies have been used to target all three categories of people. Nonetheless, my fears don’t compare to the experiences of those being targeted by the IDF or Ice using Istar tools – including journalists killed in Gaza with targeted airstrikes, or migrants suffering inhumane conditions every night in their prison cells. If anything, I am exactly the kind of person that should try hardest to understand the real world consequences of this tech, having once participated in its dissemination. I only hope more tech workers and policymakers can do the same.Juan Sebastian Pinto is a writer, designer and civil rights organizer based inDenverand New York CityExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionPalantirSurveillanceUS constitution and civil libertiesLaw (US)DenverColoradocommentShareReuse this content"

Yet now the country is choosing tocede that leadership, letting Chinadominate and control the clean-energy market across the world. It’s no surprise that people are scratching their heads, wondering what happened.Our president is obsessed withfossil fuels. He wants to resuscitate what everyone knows is a dying coal sector while turning a blind eye to the health, environmental, and economic downsides of theclimate crisis. Coupled with inconsistent threats of increased tariffs against virtually all our allies, he has isolated the US and amplified threats to global security.Donald Trump’s giant budget bill, signed right before the horrific floods in Texas, North Carolina and New Mexico, ignores threats to communities from escalating climate risks while it cuts healthcare, raises energy costs, and puts the safety of our loved ones in harm’s way. And the administration’s executive orders,Environmental Protection Agency announcements, and efforts to gut our federal workforce make it abundantly clear our federal leaders are not working for the American people.But I have never been one to back down from a challenge, certainly not when it comes to protecting my kids and grandkids. And I am not alone. Millions of Americans across the country have no intention of letting this administration dictate our fate at home or abroad. We simply refuse to let this be the United States of America.States and institutions are still fighting in court when this administration disregards science and weakens federal efforts to protect people and our environment. Folks are still listening and speaking up at neighborhood gatherings, town hall meetings, and public hearings on issues such as the weakening of air, water and power plant pollution rules that increase risks to families. They are still fighting for our lives, our communities and our democracy.The US immigration system is being militarized. Now is the time to stand up | Kica MatosRead moreStates, cities and local communities have authority to act boldly and work with industries to advance market innovation and install clean energy that creates jobs and lowers the cost of living for families. They still have clean vehicle fleets for cities to purchase and EV charging projects to pursue. They still have tax credits for solar, wind and batteries. There’s more than a decade of geothermal and battery storage tax credits available for cities, schools and health clinics, as well as many more clean energy opportunities we can and must grab.California, the fourth largest economy in the world, ran on clean energy for 219 days last year. Florida built more large-scale solar infrastructure than California last year. Even in oil country, Texas is setting records for solar, wind and battery capacity.More than 40 states have green banks and clean energy financing institutions. Twenty-four states are committed to the goals of theParis climate agreement. They’re developing bilateral climate partnerships with countries that understand the threat of the climate crisis and the opportunity that clean energy provides.US leaders I have worked with for decades during international climate negotiations continue to work with colleagues in the United Nations, the European Union, India, China, development banks and the private sector to identify policies and strategies that allow the world to mobilize capital for climate projects. Why? Because the cost of not investing in resilience and decarbonization is far too high.Mike Bloomberg and Bloomberg Philanthropies have given our country a seat at the global table. America Is All In, partnering with the US Climate Alliance, Climate Mayors, Ceres and others, will be at the forthcoming UN climate negotiations in Brazil to showcase leadership on infrastructure, transportation, buildings, land use and more that protects our communities and cuts pollution.Mayors and governors will use this platform to inform negotiations, build new partnerships, and pursue creative financing for more projects at home, while US investors continue to explore opportunities to address the heartbreaking food and water challenges across the global south.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

The first quarter of 2025was the second-strongest everfor US clean energy, representing $10bn in domestic investments. Across the globe,investments in clean tech are slated to reach $2.2tn this year, twice the amount for coal, gas and oil.To stay competitive, meet rising energy demand, stop utility bills from soaring, and tackle aging infrastructure, we need more clean energy, battery storage, and energy efficiency, not less. These technologies are cheaper to build and operate than fossil fuels.Ninety-three per cent of new electric-generating capacitythis year is projected to come from solar, wind and batteries, according to Trump’s own energy department.Facts are facts.

These are good odds!Making sense of itis a column about spirituality and how it can be used to navigate everyday lifeSun 24 Aug 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 24 Aug 2025 19.17 EDTShareIonce had a therapist who laughed – not just a chuckle but an unrestrained, full-bodied laughter. Initially, it took me by surprise. I thought therapy was a solemn endeavour, a place to unearth my deepest fears and sorrows. On a significant birthday she asked to see photos of my party, her eyes sparkling with excitement. She joked that we could have had a bottle of champagne in our session to celebrate (we didn’t but I appreciated the sentiment). She never missed an opportunity for shared joy.Of course, we also did the hard work. She witnessed tears, frustration and confusion – often before 9.45am. She had seen a lot and had sat through a lot. She had been a tireless advocate, frustrated with a system that abandoned many of its vulnerable in the name of efficiency.Years later, as I prepared to lead a presentation on what Buddhists callmudita– often translated as appreciative joy, or rejoicing in the happiness of yourself and others – her laughter came back to me. On the morning of the talk I went for a walk and vowed to notice joy in the world around me. I stopped and watched brown ducks shaking their feathers by the lake. I watched children climbing precarious-looking play equipment and received an unprompted smile from a stranger.These weren’t remarkable moments. And yet the more I lingered, replaying them in my mind’s eye, the more I couldn’t stop smiling.Appreciative joy, sometimes also referred to as sympathetic joy, is one of thefour qualitiesthe Buddha encouraged practitioners to cultivate, alongside loving kindness, compassion and equanimity. It is often described as a state of mind that rejoices at the wholesome happiness of the self and others, and extends to all beings, including strangers and (as hard as this might be) our enemies.It is not superficial excitement or uncritical Pollyanna positivity, nor is it pleasure that arises from engaging in or witnessing self-centred gratification or unethical gains. It is a joy that is grounded, steady and sometimes subtle. Contrast it with envy; a widespread social emotion that damages society’spsychological health and wellbeing.Yet appreciative joy is often overlooked in modern Buddhism, which has tended to focus more on compassion and love (also important, of course). It is under-researched in psychology, where empathy is studied mainly in relation to suffering. Most social institutionsemphasise empathic sorrow, not empathic joy or what is now referred to as “positive empathy”. We are encouraged to care for others’ pain but not to celebrate their success and happiness.Appreciative joy is low-hanging fruit: it’s free, simple and immediate.Research also suggests thattraining in positive empathy can reduce social media-induced envyand lead to greater life satisfaction.This is echoed not only in psychology, but also in spiritual traditions. TheDalai Lamaonce said that when we rejoice in others’ happiness and success, we multiply our chances by billions. These are good odds!And yet the spirit of appreciative joy runs counter to many of our habitual ways of relating to the world. As the sociologistPierre Bourdieuobserved, in a stratified society we are often conditioned to see another’s success as a threat to our own status. Social media canintensify this, fuelling “upward social comparisons” which are linked to increased anxiety, depression andFomo.Of course, appreciative joy on its own will not fix structural or global injustices, nor will it solve complex social issues. But it can provide those of us caring for others and advocating for change with nourishment and connection, which can sometimes feel out of reach.It moves us beyond a narrow self-care framework into mutual celebration and solidarity. It is one way we can apply Buddhist ideas in contemporary times that canguard against burnoutand sustain the work of care and courageous advocacy. As the social commentator Rebecca Solnit writes: “Joy doesn’t betray but sustains activism. And when you face a politics that aspires to make you fearful, alienated, and isolated, joy is a fine act of insurrection.”And here’s the secret: you don’t have to be happy to practise appreciative joy. You can unapologetically draw on others’ successes to gladden your heart. As a pessimist, I would have once rolled my eyes at this idea but I can’t deny that it helps you sit with difficulty, yours and others – and it shifts you out of negative, ineffective mental states that cause unnecessary harm to the world around you.The evening after my talk, I had a realisation. Even if my lecture didn’t land as I’d hoped, I could still drop my fretting and focus on my students’ accomplishments: their wisdom, their moments of peace and their hard-earned successes. I didn’t have to be the centre of my own happiness. And I laughed, the raucous laugh of my dear therapist, who knew that joy isn’t optional – it’s a necessity.Dr Nadine Levy is a senior lecturer at theNan Tien Institute.

Hearing loss runs in my family. My mother was profoundly deaf, and so were my grandfather and great uncles. And yet when we were told our daughter had a moderate to severe hearing loss and would have to wearhearing aidsfor the rest of her life, I felt as if I had been hit by a bus. I was dead.It was 1996, and we were sitting in a spartan doctor’s office in downtown New York. It wasn’t a warm and cozy environment like our paediatrician’s – there were no pictures of dinosaurs on the walls or puzzles strewn about. No low, cushioned seats for the kids to sit on. The consulting room was dark, with one blinking fluorescent light, a metal desk and a couple of wooden chairs. The centre was a not-for-profit that cared for those withhearing loss and deafness. What they lacked in decor they more than made up for in their mission.We were here because there was something about Zoe, our two-year-old daughter, that gave me pause. At home she was the life of the party but whenever we left the house she became painfully shy. This is not exactly a textbook symptom of hearing loss, but given my family history I knew it could be.My husband and I were both seated at the desk, and Zoe was sitting on my lap. In this lifeless room she was a burst of colour. Dressed in her signature style of head-to-toe pink, she was wearing one of the three dresses she cycled through every week, accessorised by an oversized bedazzled bow that sparkled every time she twirled (which was constantly). She was adorable.As I watched the audiologist fit her with the kind of behind-the-ear aids my grandfather wore, I cried. She was so little and these beige medical devices were enormous. I am ashamed to admit it, but all I could think at that moment was: “Who will ever take Zoe to the prom with these big clunky things sticking out of her ears?”The audiologist saw my face and said a profound thing to me that has stayed with me through the years: “The hearing aids get smaller as the child gets bigger.”Back then I had no idea what she was talking about – or what a salve this advice would come to be. My head was spinning as I imagined all the kids pointing to Zoe’s ears and wondering what those ugly things were– they were like a billboard for Zoe’s disability. I worried she would become self-conscious and ultimately embarrassed about who she was. As if I had a crystal ball, I envisioned her as an insecure adult unable to form meaningful relationships.The doctor held the hearing aids up to her own ears and said: “See? Not so big.” And I had to admit she had a point. Then she gave me a mirror and suggested I hold them up to my own ears, and I was even more convinced that she was right.I stopped fidgeting and tapping my foot.But she wasn’t done.She opened her desk drawer and pulled out several pairs of hearing aids. She lined them up, the oldest model to the latest, and explained: “This is how far the technology has come in just four years.” I was shocked at how much smaller the most recently designed aids were. But it wasn’t only size that differentiated them: the newest ones looked, well, cool. Like something Apple would have designed.“I have no doubt the technology will keep evolving,” she reassured me.How I support families coming to terms with being told their child is deafRead moreThe doctor’s words rang true both literally and metaphorically. Zoe would grow up and those clunky things behind her ears would become almost unnoticeable. But even more, the big bad thing I thought would define my daughter would also fade into the background. Zoe would always be hard of hearing, but as I came to terms with her hearing loss, it became clear that would only be one data point in her life. She would also be hilarious, mathematical and steadfast in her belief thatLove Actuallyis the best movie ever made.Over the years, that conversation with the audiologist became a reminder that we had done right by our daughter. Fitting her at age two with big clunky hearing aids might have felt like a loss at the time, but early intervention meant Zoe did not become speech delayed and miss out on crucial developmental and socialisation milestones.Sixteen years after I sat in that office chair wondering if anyone would ever take my daughter to the prom, Zoe was stepping into a long pink gown and fluorescent pink heels on her way to the dance. The truth is it was never about the prom but about wanting Zoe to fit in. Her doctor’s words spoke to the moment, but they reverberated for years to come. Whenever I catch myself jumping to conclusions or pretending to know how others will react, I stop and remember what a wise, kind audiologist once said: “The hearing aids get smaller as the child gets bigger.” Nothing is static and everything is in a constant state of change.

Welcome to England 2025John HarrisThe rapid spread of these banners is unsettling – and shows how the hard right is reaching people and places the left cannotSun 24 Aug 2025 07.17 EDTLast modified on Sun 24 Aug 2025 14.30 EDTShareIt was a sun-soaked weekday in the West Country, and all I could think about was the flags. Around the sedate Wiltshire town of Devizes, they fluttered from trees and upstairs windows, with crude versions sprayed across roundabouts. In my adopted home town in Somerset, meanwhile, local desperadoes had vandalised a pedestrian crossing close to a school, which had sparked an online row, partly because they had jettisoned their paint cans down a nearby alley. “Apart from the paint being dumped, I applaud them,” said one Facebook post. There was talk of more St George’s crosses appearing at the car park near the GP surgery – and, in among scenes I usually associate with calm and quiet, a sudden and unsettling sense of mischief and menace.Such is the impact ofOperation Raise the Colours, a campaign which seems to have begun in the suburbs of Birmingham. Its origins apparently lie in a few flags being cleared from lamp-posts as the city council tried to install LED lighting. In the hands of online provocateurs, that was enough to confirm stories about woke local bureaucrats denying people their national identity. That narrative has quickly ballooned, with sometimes grimly comical consequences: the dependably restrained Reform UK MPLee Anderson saysthat any elected official who supports removing British or English flags “should be removed from office for betraying the very country they serve”, while hisparty’s council leaderin Northamptonshire insists that for health and safety reasons, “we may need to take them down in the best interests of our residents”.That very small subplot is probably the only halfway amusing part of the story: everything else is deadly serious. Despite claims that it is all about patriotism rather than prejudice, what has materialised up and down the country feels like an unauthorised version of what the Home Office used to call the hostile environment, as if football hooligans have taken control of road markings and street furniture. And the relevant mood music is not exactly subtle. On the campaign’sFacebook page, there are enthusiastic looks ahead to September’s “free speech” rally fronted by the far-right figurehead Tommy Robinson, notices about looming protests outside hotels used to house asylum seekers and terse allusions to the usual conspiracy theories (“our masters have sold us to Islam … the replacement has begun”).The anti-racist group Hope Not Hatepoints to known far-right activistswho are involved. Picking through it all, one thought repeatedly hits home – that whatever this self-styled operation’s apparently haphazard beginnings, it marks yet another instalment of a story that could not be more serious: the long march of a politics full of audacity and ambition, which is now reaching people and places that the left gets nowhere near.The result is a self-evident political emergency. For proof, look at Reform UK’s stubborn lead in the opinion polls, and the very real prospect of Nigel Farage becoming prime minister. Consider also the post-Brexit transformation of English Conservatism, and the fact that many Tories’ hopes now lie with Robert Jenrick, the aspiring leader whoserecent visit to a protest in Eppingput him in close proximity to an infamous far-right activist, and who hasloudly endorsedOperation Raise the Colours (Kemi Badenochsoon followed suit, in yet another example of who is really in charge of her party). But also bear in mind something much more frightening: the fact that what is afoot goes far deeper than the manoeuvrings of politicians and parties. It goes into the cultural spaces where people live their lives.Some of this is all about the grim synergy between the right’s use of disinformation and provocation, and how politics has changed in ways that most of its practitioners seem to barely understand. In the past, orthodox television and what we now call the legacy media ensured that people who supported the merchants of hard-right ideas were exposed to arguments against them. But the 21st century does not work like that: radicalisation happens in sealed-off onlinespaces that operate according to their own deranged logic, opening a path from unthinking first steps to full-blown conversion. One minuteyou might be spraying the road just for the likes; the next, you could be disappearing into a mob surrounding a mosque. From the outside, that is a very difficult cycle to break.But that is not to say that no one should try. At the moment, the new right’s bark is probably worse than its bite: once again, compared with all the talk of mass uprisings and social breakdown, this weekend’s hotel protests were a thoroughlydamp squib. But one of the most depressing aspects of this summer has been the sense of progressive forces so dumbfounded and confused by what is happening that they seem almost completely unable to respond, and a feeling that many people in positions of power now accept that ridiculous proposition that England is now the country Farage et al say it is. The Labour party, needless to say, either meekly echoes Farage’s talking points or makes the laughable claim that people shouldn’t support him or his party because of hisviews on the NHS. Even the trade unions, whose workplace reps and conveners presumably understand people’s support for the new right as a matter of everyday experience, are bafflingly quiet.Asylum seekers are being targeted – and so are those who help them. It’s a disturbing new reality | Enver SolomonRead moreAnd what of any fight on the terrain of popular culture? Older readers will recall a rightward cultural shift and the brief surge of the National Front in the late 1970s, which was met by the inspirational work ofRock Against Racismand the Anti-Nazi League, choking off the far right’s appeal to the young. I can well remember the anxiety and alarm triggered by the surge in popularity of the fascist British National party, which happened twice: 15 or so years ago, when it was undone bydogged Labour campaigningand its own ineptitude, and circa 1994, when the election of a single BNP councillor in east London sparked ahuge anti-racism concert, acres of coverage in the music press and the revival of Rock Against Racism’s old spirit.I know: that was a very long time ago, and comparing then with now risks ignoring how much popular culture has since been diluted and weakened. But there are still musicians with huge platforms and devoted fans, and organisations – such asLove Music Hate Racism– ready to play their part. The prominence of Palestine flags at this year’s festivals proves that music’s radical edges have not been completely blunted; even the most apolitical artists surely understand that what they do is a product of exactly the kind of cultural mixing and open attitudes that the new right wants to squash.Something else keeps nagging at me. Up until a few years ago, we heard a lot of talk aboutprogressive patriotism, a new vision of England that was truer to 21st-century reality, and the final wresting away of symbols of nationhood from people with the most malign and nasty ideas. It was right that we did: the fact that these conversations never really went anywhere might be one of the reasons we are in such a mess. The noise the new flag-wavers make is getting louder; there are increasingly brazen links between thugs and supposedly mainstream politicians that need to be called out. This is what defines the urgency and fear of this summer: as the Clash long ago sang in a peerless and prescient piece of music titledClampdown, what are we going to do now?John Harris is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But that’s what some psychologists in Spainare calling the childcare burdenfaced by older people in that country, where 35% of people over the age of 65take care of their grandchildrenseveral days a week. In my London neighbourhood, the sight of a grandparent pushing a baby in a buggy, or a toddler in a swing, is fairly common, but in Madrid, even more so. The latest Europe-wide survey, in 2016, found the proportion of over 65s undertaking childcare at least several days a week in southern European countries – Spain especially, but also in Italy and Greece –is much higherthan in France (13%) and Germany (15%) or the UK (18%).This is the result of historical cultural norms of shared care between generations, but now some Spanish grandparents are fighting back. After working all their lives, and years spent raising their own children, they hadn’t bargained for spending their retirements engaged in unpaid childcare, and they are not alone in that.Anyone who lurks on parenting internet forums will observe that these faultlines are emerging across the western world, with some parents saddened and frustrated at the lack of input or interest from grandparents (“they’d rather spend their money on cruises!”) and, on the other side, grandparents worn down and exhausted by the expectation, and sometimes entitlement, levied upon them by their children. I’ve seen memes and video content claiming that boomers are the most selfish generation of grandparents ever, but also had conversations with burnt-out older people who simply don’t have the energy to care for small, rambunctious children.Every situation is of course unique, but it’s an issue that has played out in many families in one way or another, mine included. My mother was very present in the first year of my son’s life, and that time was very special for all of us. Yet I wish I had been more mindful of the toll caring for a small baby can take.I still carry some guilt for how I handled things, most of all the fact that she was sleeping on the sofa. She claimed that it was comfortable, but if I could go back in time, I’d have invested in a really good-quality sofabed.“Looking after babies is for the young,” my aunt said to me. I spent my childhood in a small Welsh community where it wasn’t unusual to meet women in their early 40s who were grandmothers. As women have babies later and later, first-time grandparents are getting older, and with that, they have less energy and often greater health needs. There are many good reasons to delay parenthood – I did it myself – but it comes with a price, too. I sometimes wonder if I would have had children earlier, had I feared less the toll it would take on my education, career and finances, and had the system been more hospitable. It is not a system that was built for women of reproductive age, yet we are forced to try to work within it.Let’s not forget, either, that this is a gender issue. Most often, the grandparent doing the childcare is the grandmother. Her own pregnancies and births may have brought their own health issues. Often, she will still be working. She may have other care responsibilities, either her own parents, a partner, or offspring. For women, retirement from paid work doesn’t mean the unpaid care work stops. I’m not surprised that Carmen Díez, one of the Spanish grandmothers interviewed, enjoys her peace, saying: “I love my empty nest.”I don’t blame older women for fighting back, and in some cases saying that they deserve a salary. It doesn’t mean that they don’t love their grandchildren, and of course there are grandmothers – and grandfathers – who would be insulted by offers of payment. But even they would acknowledge that looking after small children can be physically and emotionally draining. My son now weighs more than 18kg, and I am lifting him daily. What grandparents are able to do does have limits.Often, grandmothers are running themselves ragged to support their own daughters’ careers – it is the mother who so often pays the penalty, career-wise, still. Dr Terri Apter, the author of Grandparenting: On Love and Relationships Across Generations, has pointed out that it’s often the feminist grandmothers who help out the most, because they know what a struggle it is.That capitalism thrives on the unpaid domestic labour of women isn’t exactly news, but the grandparental revolt is a new manifestation of it. Love shouldn’t come with a price, but the care work that comes with love: why shouldn’t it? Why should mostly older women be propping up insufficient childcare systems?I don’t blame parents for being frustrated. Whether they are in Spain, Germany, or the UK, they have all to some extent been shortchanged on the expectation of a family life that is easier than the generations that came before. Almost every parent I speak to is completely burned out. Meanwhile,politicians trytowork out howthey can improve dwindling birthrates.Despite the fraught internet forum threads, I don’t think what parents, and grandparents, want is actually all that different: quality family time that doesn’t feel like an endless slog, and a system that supports, rather than hinders, that. It’s sad that it feels so out of reach for so many.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsParents and parentingRepublic of ParenthoodGrandparents and grandparentingChildrenFamilySpainEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

It was a grim portrait of her home town – its vitality ebbing as the forces of modern life drained it of young people, polluted its water, exploited its resources and even turned the local school into a pigsty. Its quarter of a million sales reflected not just her distinctive writing, but the familiarity of the story. As urban China prospered with the Communist party’s turn to the market, 350 million villagers migrated to the cities, leaving behind increasingly desolate settlements.Now Beijing is promoting “rural revitalisation”. State media run a steady stream of articles lauding city dwellers who have returned to their home towns to set up cafes or run home-stays. The expansion of transport and telecommunications infrastructure has allowed rural inhabitants to expand their horizons. First came the“Taobao villages”, where at least a 10th of households were using Alibaba’s e-commerce platform. More recently, farmershave taken to livestreaming– selling fruit or flowers direct to urbanites.The push factors are equally potent.Disenchantedurbanites tired of the pressures of city life are seeking to take it easier inthe countryside, just as hippies in the west rejected their parents’ materialistic dreams in the 1960s. Some just aren’t willing to work round the clock; others see increasingly scant rewards for doing so. Some are turning to rural entrepreneurship because of thehigh youth unemployment rate. And the bulge in working-age citizens that fuelled China’s boom years is now becoming a wave of retirees.Migrant remittances were critical to lifting rural incomes. But thehukouorhousehold registration system,tying rights to benefits and services to your home town, forced working parents to leave their children with grandparents – fracturing families andblighting the prospects of many in the next generation. Now it prevents them fromretiring in the cities.China announced in 2020 that it haderadicated extreme poverty, which it characterised as entirely rural. That reflectedremarkable improvements in the lives of tens of millions of peoplethrough official programmes – even if the means used were often crude, such as forced relocation, and the headline target was reached because it was measured on extremely specific criteria.But new opportunities should not be overstated. Remote areas are unlikely to benefit as those near major roads or close to affluent urban centres are doing. Many policies are focused on towns – small by Chinese standards, not so by western ones – rather than villages. And disgruntled city dwellers who seek a rural idyll may find,as many in the west have, that they cannot make a go of it or that the novelty wears off.In fact, projections suggest that the rural labour force will continue contracting until 2035, with the urban labour forceexpected to grow.Increasingly, the government’s vision is of development being driven by hi-tech industries, while the countryside continues to provide cheap labour for the cities when needed and troops for the People’s Liberation Army. China needs better social protection and services – going beyond itshukoureforms to abolish the system, and investing more in education in the villages as well as the cities that house its cutting-edge enterprises. Otherwise, most will continue to see the countryside as a place to leave behind.Explore more on these topicsChinaOpinionAsia PacificChinese economyChinese literatureeditorialsShareReuse this content"

What drew him to his subjects - and what do they tell us about a changing world?ByMartin Parr.  Introduction: Wendy JonesSun 24 Aug 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 24 Aug 2025 01.19 EDTShareIf you sawMartin Parrand didn’t know who he was, you would barely notice him. He is Mr Invisible and Mr Normal rolled into one, in his sensible jumper – probably from Marks & Spencer – and sensible socks and sandals. He has a neat side parting and neatly cut hair. He has a mild and conventional manner and a mild and conventional appearance. There is something of the naff birdwatcher about him. But do not be fooled. This is the disguise of a man who is seeing far more than most of us ever see, and he’s hiding in plain sight. He is a genius who has changed photography, one of the great artists of our time.So who is Martin Parr? And what would he say if we listened? His life is, in many ways, an everyman’s life: he’s born into a family of mixed characters and classes; he has a devoted grandparent; he is undistinguished at school – perhaps not having the happiest of childhoods; he’s a silly boy; he goes to college; mucks around, tries new things, gets a girlfriend, has some holiday jobs. He enters adulthood in an inauspicious way, works hard, sees something of the world; gets married, becomes a father, builds up his career, travels; has conflict, success, illness, recovery; becomes a grandfather, gains wisdom and respect. An ordinary life that follows an ordinary arc.Martin Parr’s life is also a life of its century. He was there in the great freeze of 1962 – he records it with his first photo. He’s a grammar school boy who trainspots the last steam engines, then a hippy student with long hair in the 70s. He’s in Ireland during the Troubles, then, in the 80s, he’s capturing fashion, luxury, consumerism and British Conservatism. He sees the fall of communism in the 90s, the rise of McDonald’s and the explosion in international tourism. In the new millennium, he watches India transforming, industry dying in the Black Country, the traditional English village enduring. He sees South Africa after apartheid and the growth in the standard of living worldwide. He lives through the arrival of digital photography, mobile phones, selfies. He sees Gay Pride marches and Black Lives Matter protests, meets the elderly queen and survives the pandemic.Decks appeal: Martin Parr captures life on a cruise liner – photo essayRead moreAnd he photographs it all. He’s like a photographic Forrest Gump. In the mid-80s, like the film of The Wizard of Oz, his work burst into colour, not in a wonderland like Oz but in a downtrodden, dirty, unglamorous seaside resort near Liverpool called New Brighton. He photographed gulls, litter, sunbathers on cement walkways, babies crying and chip shops. Not for him the luscious aesthetic of 1930s seaside posters. This was a working-class day out, and Martin displayed it in vibrant, flash-induced, saturated colour. In New Brighton, Martin became the photographer we know him to be now – vivid, demanding our attention, socially aware and pulling us in like a magnet.Many years ago, I approached Martin and asked if I could write his biography. He said yes. We tried, we failed. I asked questions; he replied quickly and briskly. I asked the same questions again, I tried to dig deeper. I failed. I wanted to write something analytical, deep, full of myth, id and ego. Martin talked about birdwatching and regularly said the worst phrase a biographer can hear: “That’s all I’ve got to say about that.” How could I write a book with so few words? I couldn’t. Nearly all of Martin is in his pictures, not words.Fifteen years later, I went back to him and said, “How about you tell your life story through photographs and you talk about your photos?” And he said yes.Martin is older now, a statesman in his world. He has the air of someone who’s seen everything – which, in a way, he has. But he’s still at it. He recently held an exhibition of his photos on smoking, exploring the difficult borders between comfort and discomfort. He has work to do, an ever-changing world to document, boring things to find that he’s going to make us interested in.So if you see a mild-mannered man walking along and he points his camera at you – especially if you’re doing something unremarkable, such as standing at the checkout, having a cup of tea, taking a selfie or even just waiting in a queue – you may have been Parr-ed.WJFrozen Stream, Chessington, England, 1962-3View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosThe first photo I remember taking is this one, of my father on a frozen stream. I used to play here, next to our house. I would have been 10 when I took this during the great freeze of 1962–3. I remember helping my father sweep the snow outside our house and people thanking us – everyone was being nice to each other because it was a very cold winter.You can see my father’s got his binoculars on. He was a great birdwatcher, as was my mother, which meant all our trips out were to birdwatching places – to Thursley Common to see the Dartford warbler, and down to Pagham, looking for waders.We would go to Hersham Sewage Works, where I spent many Saturdays looking for migratory birds, because a lot came there to feed. It was smelly and we wore wellingtons. There were tomatoes growing. We used to pick green ones that had grown in human shit. They would never ripen; they were always green. We’d pick them and my mother used to make green tomato chutney.Birdwatchers, Surrey Bird Club, England, 1972View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosWhen I went home during the college breaks, I would take pictures of my father’s birdwatching trips with the Surrey Bird Club – my father was the president. He made lists of the birds, and the Dartford warbler was his specialism. This picture was taken when the bird club was having its picnic lunch. I guess this photo works because you’ve got these two couples, both with binoculars, so it looks quite surreal. They look like owls themselves.I was beginning to look at scenes that were familiar in a slightly remote way. And there’s humour in it – it was the first photo I could clearly see the humour in.Susie Mitchell, Paris, France, 1978View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosDespite being “utterly inattentive and lazy” in French at school (to quote one school report), in the late 70s I began to go on trips to France. I went to see Jean-Claude Lemagny, who was in charge of the photography collection of the Bibliothèque Nationale de France in Paris. He bought many early black-and-white prints from me – for bargain prices, but it was a great thrill. The trips were very exciting and helped build up my reputation in France. And Susie came along, because she could speak French.This was taken in one of those classic French bistros. Susie didn’t like being photographed by me at all. She’d put her hand up in front of her face. She has always said she looks awful, which is absolute rubbish. Her skin is beautiful. She still puts her hand up now. It doesn’t stop me taking pictures, so it’s a bit useless. I can easily outwit her. I’ve got lots of photos of Susie in the archive. We’ve been married for 45 years.Colour and Flash, New Brighton, England, 1983-85View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Parr/Magnum Photos, taken from The Last ResortIn 1982 Susie got a job in Liverpool and we found a house overlooking the Mersey. I knew the seaside resort New Brighton was a mile down the road and would be great for me to explore photographically. It was a tradition; people came here from all over Merseyside for a day out on the beach – if you could call it a beach. It was shabby, but it had an ice-cream parlour, an amusement arcade and funfair rides.I kept working in black and white because colour photography wasn’t taken seriously in the UK. In the 40s and 50s, it was regarded as commercial and trivial, used for family snapshots because you could get cheap colour cameras. Then, in the late 70s, I saw images from America of serious photography being done in colour: the likes of Stephen Shore, William Eggleston and Joel Meyerowitz were getting shows in the big museums. I thought, I must go to colour.I knew I was on to something with this combination of colour, flash and New Brighton. I could tell these were good pictures. It made me realise colour really had potential to express my attitude and subjectivity much more efficiently than anything else. Colour is real, isn’t it? It’s right in your face. It just looks great. I still love black and white, but once I moved to colour, I never went back.Something That Seems Ordinary, Salford, England, 1986View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Parr/Magnum Photos, taken from Spending TimeI was hanging around a petrol station like a pervert. Photographers at the time would have said that this was the craziest place to take a picture. Because it’s a very unglamorous subject matter. Boring. There’s no drama here. But there’s something very interesting about boring. Something that seems very ordinary at the time becomes interesting when you look back at it later, almost 40 years later: the pump has changed, the clothes have changed, the car has changed. It tells us something about consumerism, and how we depend on fuel, oil and petrol.Conservative Midsummer Madness Party, Bath, England, 1988View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Parr/Magnum Photos, taken from The Cost of LivingI went to the Conservative Party Association in Bath and asked if there was any chance of getting access to events happening in people’s gardens and houses. They said, “Yes, here’s a list.” They were so very agreeable. Access, back in the 80s, was a much easier game to play. I guess now they would look me up and would be horrified by my reputation.Every little component of this picture works – and that’s an unusual achievement. The men are dressed up in suits and ties, and they look very smug. This lady’s hair is like a helmet. It looks solid. It doesn’t look like it would blow in the wind in the Midsummer Madness.Small World, Kleine Scheidegg, Switzerland, 1990View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Parr/Magnum Photos, taken from Small WorldIn 1992, I had an exhibition of my ongoing project on tourism, Small World, in Paris. One of the guests wasHenri Cartier-Bresson, probably the most famous photographer in the world, and a founder of Magnum. He was so annoyed by the exhibition that when he got home he sent me a fax saying, “I don’t see your viewpoint. Your work is from a different planet. We belong to two different solar systems.” I thought, oh, this is fantastic. I replied, “I acknowledge there is a large gap between your celebration of life and my implied criticism of it … What I would query with you is: why shoot the messenger?” He was photographing the old style of life; I was photographing modern things. I usually relish criticism and opposition. When I realised people were against me, I thought: I must be doing something right.Lost ball, Chew Stoke, England, 1992View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Parr/Magnum Photos, taken from Chew Stoke: A Year in the Life of an English VillageIt’s classic to play cricket in summer in Britain, yet things can go badly wrong. It’s not a professional match. Everybody’s mucking in to find the ball so the game can continue.McDonald’s, Moscow, Russia, 1992View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosWhen the first McDonald’s in the USSR opened in Pushkin Square, Moscow, there was a queue of a thousand people trying to get in. I still remember the excitement and thrill of the diners. It was the largest McDonald’s in the world, with 600 seats. It was nicknamed Bolshoi Mac and heralded as an amazing advance; because of Gorbachev’s glasnost policy, the USSR let this icon of America in.This was the only time I have been allowed to photograph in McDonald’s. I’ve often taken pictures without permission; being thrown out by a faintly embarrassed duty manager gives a certain satisfaction.Pyongyang, North Korea, 1997View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosI’ve always been fascinated by North Korea. Finally, in 1997, I saw an advertisement in the Times for a trip that was leaving from Beijing and going to North Korea. I applied and said I was a lecturer – which I was; it wasn’t a lie – and they gave me a visa. We were a coachload of 20 people driven around all the propaganda sites, which were like film sets. There were no cars anywhere. We knew there was a lot of starvation, but we didn’t see evidence of that. Still, it felt poor.We were controlled the whole time, in what we did, where we went, and we had to have an interpreter or a guide with us constantly. They were OK with me having quite a big camera. They must have realised I was a photographer, but they didn’t stop me from photographing anything, because it was all so curated you could only take pleasant photographs, really. It was propaganda of the first order. Occasionally, like here, I had an opportunity to sneak an uncurated picture through the coach window. North Korea was the most surreal experience of my life.A perfect cup of tea, Sand Bay, England, 1997View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Parr/Magnum Photos, taken from Common SenseI’ve done many other pictures of cups of tea but this is the best: every component is correct. It’s a perfect cup of tea in a perfect Wedgwood cup and saucer on a perfect red gingham tablecloth.It was taken in a cafe near Weston-super-Mare that Susie and I used to frequent, called Monk’s Rest, on a hill overlooking the sea. Sometimes we would have poached eggs on toast, and sometimes sardines on toast, and one day someone put this cup of tea on the table and I took a photo of it. It’s a simple picture that’s become very well known, licensed and used many, many times.It’s very rewarding to take an iconic image. I have taken millions of photos, and I’m always looking to take one that will survive on its own without context, without the narrative.Benidorm, Spain, 1997View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Parr/Magnum Photos, taken from Common SenseI was very excited about going to Benidorm with a macro lens for the first time, because it meant I could take photos at close range. And the scale of the beach in Benidorm is quite amazing. It’s huge. It must be three miles long, with three different beaches, and there’s this long path by the water where the Spanish go promenading during the day, particularly in the morning. It’s quite an event. I call it the motorway.I took the picture of this woman very quickly. She was fast asleep. Those blue things are eye shields. It was one of those rare moments when everything fell into place. I was very close to her. I only took one frame and then moved on. I had a hunch that this would be a good photo, and it is now one of my most famous pictures.I’ve since had two people write to me and say, “That’s a photo of my grandmother.” They weren’t able to prove it. The woman hasn’t ever come forward.Senegalese street seller, Dakar, 2001View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Parr/Magnum Photos, taken from Fashion MagazineI went to Dakar for a fashion shoot for Rebel, a French fashion magazine. I had accessories to photograph: handbags, sunglasses and a Louis Vuitton cigarette case – the silver square in the front row. Every fashion picture is about solving a problem: how to make the picture look good while showing the item of clothing.This guy was selling his wares on the street for two or three dollars. I negotiated to pay him to take his photo – I can’t remember how much – and I placed the cigarette case into the tray. And Bob’s your uncle.It’s all cheap stuff, apart from the Louis Vuitton cigarette case, which is an expensive French luxury good. It devalues it. It’s ironic, isn’t it, really? I put it there as a form of subversion, because everything else on that tray would be worth under $10. And that Louis Vuitton cigarette case is going to be worth $1,000. Minimum.Shalfleet Church Fete, Isle of Wight, England, 2007View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosI have been to so many country fetes over the years. I can’t get enough of them, in particular church fetes, ideally in the vicar’s garden. It’s like stepping back in time to the 1950s. You can’t help but admire the notice here: “Do take ONE cherry tomato with your roll.” It’s a shame these days the food is often covered in clingfilm. I can get an interesting photo of the reflections when I’m using flash, but clingfilm just annoys me. You don’t need it. The food’s only going to be in the open air for a couple of hours before it’s eaten. It’s health and safety gone mad.Spectators in Switzerland Watching Polo, St Moritz, 2011View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Parr/Magnum Photos, taken from LuxuryI wasn’t interested in the polo. I wanted the spectators. And they’re very much spectating, wearing their sunglasses and watching intently. The way the dog is integrated into the fur works well, and I like the other dog, also paying attention.Employee of the Month, Rochester, New York, US, 2012View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Parr/Magnum Photos, taken from Tim Montondo is Employee of the Month at Wards Natural Science for the month of April. This is his sixth timeIn 2012, Magnum initiated a project called Postcards from America, in which photographers were sent to different towns in the US for 10 days. I was sent to Rochester, where I came across Tim Montondo. The sign tells the story: he’s Employee of the Month. It’s his sixth time. I love that he’s holding his cup, the way it’s held in one hand and the other just drops down. I wanted him to look very proud. I had to tell him not to smile. I wanted to take it seriously. People assume for a portrait you should smile. The opposite is the case. I want the subject to show dignity.The queen visiting Drapers’ Hall, London, England, 2014View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Parr/Magnum Photos, taken from Unseen CityThe Drapers’ Livery company said, “We’ve got the queen coming to lunch to celebrate our 650th birthday. Would you be happy to take pictures of the event?” and I immediately said yes. The livery companies in London are trade guilds, or professional associations, and they are famously very wealthy. They are also typically very male, very white and very old. But still they go on. Still rich. Still giving out money. Still having their dinners.As opposed to most of the times I’ve photographed the queen at public events, this time I was the only photographer, and I followed her around.Here she is leaving the event. By this time, a good few pedestrians had twigged that she was in the building. Hence, you see people with their phones trying to take pictures of her. The trouble is they’ll have me in them, with my camera. Sorry about that, folks.This has become a very popular image. It’s interesting in that the queen is perhaps the only person who’s recognisable from behind. She’s got that classic hat and a slight hunch. I’m sure she was photographed from behind many times, but here, it really works.Tomato Soup, Royal Infirmary, Bristol, England, 2021View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosParamedics came to pick me up because I was vomiting and there was something wrong with my stomach. I had to have an emergency operation because something had come loose – I’m not sure exactly what happened. Anyway, by coincidence, when they were doing the scans for that they found “nodules on the spine”. And when they say that it means it’s cancer.They removed my stem cells, gave me a blast of chemo, and put the stem cells back in. Then I had to remain in a highly controlled room for two weeks while my immune system was maintained. The only person allowed in was Susie, who came every day, God bless her. After that, I was in the ward. It took a long time for my bowel to start working again. I had to have food pumped in to me to keep me alive, it was nil by mouth. Then at some point they decided I was ready to eat.The first food I had in three weeks was tomato soup – I think it was Heinz – orange juice and an ice-cream. NHS ice-cream was surprisingly good. During those three weeks I could only drink sips of water. I remember getting my first cup of tea. It was the best cup of tea I had ever drunk.Amusement Arcade, New Brighton, England, 2023View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosBack in New Brighton, I saw this mother with her five kids in their green outfits. I said, “Is there any chance I can take your picture?” She agreed and didn’t ask why. She must have been proud of her brood, so it made sense I’d want to take their photo.New Brighton has changed, probably for the better. It’s virtually litter-free now, and there’s actually a beach, properly laid out. The amusement arcade hasn’t changed much, though: it’s brash, noisy and good fun. It’s the new New Brighton. Gentrification is the name of the game.Autoportrait, Hanoi Studio, Havana, Cuba, 2001View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosMy autoportrait project has run over 40 years. The aim is to demonstrate the different ways in which you can have your portrait done in a studio or public space, as well as the different techniques photographers employ. The only reason I use myself as the subject is because I’m the one person who’s consistently there. Hanoi Studio took five black and white shots of me in different poses, and in one they gave me naff sunglasses. They then did a montage, printed in black and white, and hand-coloured.I’m uninterested in how I look, as long as I’m presentable. I look in the mirror once a day – I have no choice, as I’ve got to comb my hair. I guess that’s interesting given I do fashion photography. I’m not interested in clothes, I just wear what’s comfortable. Socks with sandals is a good combination before it gets to the hottest part of the year. I guess you could call it my spring look …I have had a wonderful life with photography. From North Korea, to a vicar’s garden party in Somerset, or shooting Mar del Plata beach in Argentina – what a privilege it has been to see the world and record my response. I had a funny one in Morecambe last summer. I was taking photos and this couple came up and said, “That’s a nice camera. What are you doing around here?” I replied, “I’m documenting Morecambe.” They said, “You mean like Martin Parr?” I said, “I am Martin Parr.” They were rather surprised.I’ve been taking photos for almost 70 years, and in that time we’ve seen the amazing transformation from analogue film to the digital era, and I’ve got a lot older. We live in a difficult but inspiring world, and there is so much out there I want to photograph.This is an edited extract from Utterly Lazy and Inattentive by Martin Parr and Wendy Jones, published by Penguin at £30.

Classical picks byImogen TildenSun 24 Aug 2025 02.00 EDTShareJump toPop, rock and moreDavid Byrne – Who Is the Sky?For Byrne’s first album since his hugely acclaimed American Utopia tour – and the subsequentSpike Lee-directed film– he’s working with an orchestra, as well as St Vincent and Paramore singer Hayley Williams, among others. The two tracks released so far, She Explains Things To Me and Everybody Laughs, have proved to be sweetly sunny and driven by acoustic guitar. The accompanying tour – due to reach Europe next year – will apparently “blend visual art, storytelling and music into one compelling live performance”.Released 5 SeptemberSaint Etienne – InternationalSaint Etienne have been an endlessly fascinating fixture on the leftfield of pop for 25 years, spawning everything from Top 10 singles to documentaries about the Lea Valley and the South Bank. Their most recent albums I’ve Been Trying To Tell You and The Night have delved into concept-driven ambient experimental territory with hugely rewarding results, but International is to betheir final release. Something of the breadth of their approach is revealed by the list of collaborators, which stretches from DJ Erol Alkan to 80s heart-throb Nick Heyward.Released 5 SeptemberJade – That’s Showbiz BabyView image in fullscreen‘Eagerly awaited’ … Jade.Photograph: Stephanie Sian Smith/The GuardianJade Thirlwall’s former band Little Mix made a clutch of great hits but nothing that could prepare you for the deeply idiosyncratic charms of Thirwall’s tempo-shifting Puppet On a String-sampling Angel of My Dreams. If subsequent releases haven’t quite bent the rules in such a striking manner, then they’ve certainly been of an impressively high quality, pushing her debut solo album into the “eagerly awaited” category.Released 12 SeptemberSelf EsteemRebecca Taylor’s third album as Self Esteem,A Complicated Woman, didn’t propel her into pop’s big league in the way some people expected, but no matter. The high-concept, tightly choreographed live shows she’s thus far performed around it – in a West End theatre shortly before its release and at a packed-out Park stage at Glastonbury shortly after – were rapturously received and understandably so: a sometime actor, Taylor has a keen sense of theatricality, but she’s also a straightforwardly commanding, hugely engaging performer.Tour begins 15 September, 02 Academy BirminghamCardi B – Am I the Drama?The follow-up to a debut album that came out in 2018 – the rapper has been concentrating on motherhood in the intervening period – Am I the Drama? has been so long in the pipeline that at least one of the singles confirmed as part of the tracklisting, the chart-topping, controversy-generating Megan Thee Stallion collaboration WAP, isfive years old. Whatever your reasons, taking an extended leave of absence is a risky business in a genre as fast-moving as hip-hop: whether Am I the Drama? succeeds in re-establishing her at its centre remains to be seen.Released 19 SeptemberKokorokoView image in fullscreen‘When playing live, they come into their own’ … Kokoroko.Photograph: Delali AyiviThe London jazz collective’s most recent album Tuff Times Never Last offered up a gorgeous selection of midtempo but funky tracks influenced in equal part by Afrobeat, highlife and – occasionally – old-fashioned 80s British soul. Its contents were frequently gorgeous – blissful single Sweetie is a hot afternoon in musical form – but when playing live, the band really come into their own: the danceability is amped up, the fluid virtuosity of the musicianship becomes even more evident.Tour begins 19 September, Leeds Project HouseRobert Plant – Saving GraceRobert Plant’s “new” band – formed with musicians local to his home on the Welsh borders – first debuted six years ago with a handful of small UK gigs at which they performed an intriguing range of covers and a couple of Led Zeppelin classics. A similar approach informs their debut album, intermittently recorded over six years, with the admirably eclectic Plant and co essaying tracks by everyone from Memphis Minnie to Moby Grape to Low.Released 26 SeptemberLady GagaView image in fullscreen‘A theatrical extravaganza’ … Lady Gaga kicks off the Mayhem Ball tour in Las Vegas in July.Photograph: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Live NationThe noisy electronics, big pop choruses and dancefloor-facing beats of Lady Gaga’s last albumMayhemfelt like a restatement of her core pop values after the commercial and creative wobble of her appearance inJoker: Folie à Deuxand her accompanying jazz-infused album Harlequin. If US reviews are anything to go by, the Mayhem Ball tour offers a suitably eye-popping high-camp, high-production-value theatrical extravaganza, described by one unexpected concert-goer, Nancy Pelosi, as “the most fun I’ve had in a long time”.Tour begins 29 September, London O2 ArenaCMATPop is a notoriously tricky business to predict, but you wouldn’t bet against CMAT’s third album Euro-Country being a hit on a scale that far outstrips her past work. It’s musically more expansive than its country-infused predecessors and stuffed with fantastic, provocative songs, as evidenced by the viral success of Take a Sexy Picture of Me. And, as anyone who caught her Glastonbury appearance knows, she is absolutely fantastic live: sharp, exceptionally funny, blessed with an incredible voice and quite unlike anyone else around.Tour beings 2 October, O2 Academy BrixtonTaylor Swift – The Life of a ShowgirlView image in fullscreen‘Pop’s most high-achieving workaholic’ … Taylor Swift’s The Life of a Showgirl.Photograph: Republic RecordsRumblings of a new Swift album seemed impossible: the glitter from the Eras tour had only just settled; she had a new album just last year. Underrate pop’s most high-achieving workaholic at your peril: she recently revealed that she recorded her 12th album between Eras dates, flying to Sweden to record with Max Martin and Shellback – the co-architects of her most laser-guided pop smashes from Red, 1989 and Reputation. No one’s heard a peep, but she’s promised “melodies that [are] so infectious you’re almost angry … and lyrics that are just as vivid”.Released 3 OctoberLittle SimzSimz’s sixth album, Lotus, was not an easy listen: it emerged from a period of turmoil in which she started and scrapped four different full-length projects and ended up suing herformer chief collaborator Inflo; its angry, diaristic lyrics were matched with raw, occasionally rock-facing production. But it seems to have done nothing to halt the rapper’s continuing rise: after she curated and performed at this year’s Meltdown festival on the South Bank, she’s ascended to arenas for this autumn tour.Tour begins 16 October, Manchester Co-op LiveJalen NgondaIf your tastes run to classic soul, then US-born, UK-based singer-songwriter Jalen Ngonda represents the real deal. His voice is incredible – there are shades of Marvin Gaye and David Ruffin about his delivery, but his sound is his own – and he’s a skilled songwriter, as his 2023 debut album Come Around and Love Me and the handful of singles he’s released since displayed. He’s also reliably fantastic live: relentless touring means tickets are already running low for these UK shows.Tour begins 16 October, Newcastle City HallJasmine.4.tJasmine Cruickshank’s You Are the Morning is one of 2025’s finest debut albums. She has what would once have been called “heavy friends” on board – it was produced by Boygenius, whose Phoebe Bridgers signed Cruickshank to her Saddest Factory label – but, in truth, she doesn’t need the endorsement of alt-rock royalty. She’s a fantastic songwriter in the old-fashioned, rough-hewn indie manner, who’s transformed tough personal challenges into powerful and ultimately joy-bringing music.Tour begins 11 November, London ScalaKneecapView image in fullscreen‘More controversy’ … Kneecap.Photograph: Peadar Ó GoillSomewhere underneath the continual tumult surroundingKneecap, there lurks a band who are exceptionally good at what they do, not that the attendant furore has dented their popularity. Quite the opposite: a July gig in Glasgow sold out in 80 seconds after they were dropped from the Trnsmt festival, while this tour is bookended by a September date at Wembley Arena – which provoked more controversy after a poster advertising the show was banned from the London Underground – and two sold-out arena dates in Dublin.Tour begins 18 September at the OVO Arena Wembley LondonLordeLorde debuted her fourth album Virgin, in its entirety, at a not-so-secret performance at this summer’s Glastonbury, her first live appearance in the UK for three years. That it attracted a mixed response tells you more about playing 40 minutes of unheard material to a festival audience than said material’s quality: Virgin is an impressively dark, emotionally ragged restatement of the dance-pop sound of 2017’s Melodrama – and expectations understandably run high for her tour.Tour begins 15 November, Manchester Co-op LiveStereolabAfter a decade-long hiatus, Stereolab returned to a pop world that seemed to have come around to their way of thinking, at least a little. Critically revered outliers in the 90s – lyrics influenced by Marxist critical theory, music by Krautrock and esoteric electronica – they now find themselves acclaimed by Tyler, the Creator and Pharrell Williams, their motorik sound a regular rock trope, and their critiques of late-stage capitalism mainstreamed. And yet they still sound entirely unique and wonderful: comeback albumInstant Holograms on Metal Filmis a gem.Tour begins 15 December at Royal Festival Hall, LondonClassicalThe Dream of GerontiusView image in fullscreenDreaming … Kazuki Yamada.Photograph: Marco BorggreveA homecoming for Elgar’s mighty oratorio – the greatest of his choral works. Written for the Birmingham music festival, this performance will take place almost exactly 125 years after its premiere in Birmingham town hall. Kazuki Yamada conducts the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra with soloists Roderick Williams, Jess Dandy and David Butt Philip.Symphony Hall, Birmingham, 17 SeptemberOliver Leith’s GarlandThe young British composer most substantial work since his 2022 eye-catching Kurt Cobain-inspired opera Last Days has its world premiere at Peckham’s Bold Tendencies, the former multistorey. He describes it as a “big processional” piece; 118 performers will be involved, plus apparently, a horse, bicycles, a car and other pedestrian detritus “played” to create noise and rhythm.Bold Tendencies, London, 18-19 SeptemberCinderella (La Cenerentola)Her probing staging of Flying Dutchman earlier this summer for Opera Holland Park won acclaim; what will Julia Burbach make of Rossini’s Cinderella story?

The composer himself will conduct his choral symphony, Harmonium, his longtime collaborator the violinist Leila Josefowicz will perform Scheherezade.2 (written for her), and the UK premiere of his newest composition, the The Rock You Stand On, brings the mini-festival to a close.Bridgewater Hall, Manchester, 30 October to 1 NovemberThe Railway ChildrenView image in fullscreen‘A much-loved story’ … The Railway Children librettist Rachael Hewer with composer Mark-Anthony TurnageEarlier this year the Royal Opera’s triumphant staging of Festen confirmedMark-Anthony Turnageas one of the leading opera composers of our day.

A day of concerts, talks and music by her contemporaries offers a chance to hear much of her little-played and little-known music. Performers include Kitty Whately, Ailish Tynan and pianist Anna Tilbrook.Wigmore Hall, London, 8 NovemberBavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra and Simon Rattle in LiverpoolAlmost 50 years to the day since their last visit, the Munich orchestra returns to Merseyside with its new Liverpool-born conductor.

Their circus routines are interspersed with moves from 50s dance crazes but the concept really takes off with Jackie Wilson’s Reet Petite. Here, the singer’s distinctive vocal range and zany word stretching perfectly complement the men’s evident joy in testing their limits and winning our whoops. “Look-a there, ooh wee!”An overlong scene-setting intro in Alexander Sunny’s production, choreographed by Electra Preisner and Ahara Bischoff, finds the guys on a train station, having missed their connection to Chicago. Macs, hats and shades are taken off but Bilal Musa Huka, Rashid Amini Kulembwa, Seif Mohamed Mlevi, Peter Mnyamosi Obunde and Mohamed Salim Mwakidudu remain in otherwise formal attire.View image in fullscreenHuman pyramids are their speciality … Black Blues Brothers.Photograph: Gabriele TomeThe routines are performed as if a simple way to kill time while they wait for the next train. In a recurring gag, coins are used to either spin another record on the jukebox or call a lover who is being left behind. All of this is done through act-outs: the men remain as tight-lipped as they are loose-limbed.Human pyramids are their speciality: one may rest upside down on another’s head while their neighbour dangles from the side with look-no-hands glee. Buttocks are there for drumming; lower backs become springboards. The doo-wop of the Marcels adds comedy to the troupe’s towering attempt to reach a blue moon while Elvis Presley’s A Little Less Conversation powers a frenzy of hoop diving.But the scenario begins to feel stuck in a groove, the jokes repetitive, and it’s not just the soundtrack that’s a throwback to the 50s. A nagging female voice on the phone is an overdone joke. When a woman from the front row is brought on stage for the men to woo, it’s instantly cringy and the resulting scene has little to offer.Happily the songs keep coming, such as Choo Choo Ch’Boogie, and the men steam on with rope tricks, somersaults and limbo feats. It’s all the more impressive as they’re at the end of a gruelling festival run – and they never even undo those ties.AtMcEwan Hall, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalComedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)CircusreviewsShareReuse this content"

In June, heshut down New York’s Times Squarewith a set to announce his new album, Same Day Cleaning, followed by headlining his first North American stadium show. “It didn’t feel real, I was freaking out,” says Virji, still in disbelief.Also real:the tens of thousands singing alongas he spliced the dreamy intro of Radiohead’s Everything in Its Right Place with his 2023 trackIf U Need Itat this year’s Coachella. The 28-year-old from the market town of Witney, Oxfordshire, made his debut on the California festival’s second-largest stage in April. It was “the most nervous I’ve ever been,” says Virji, on a phone call from LA ahead of another festival set, “but I converted that into excitement and I was able to enjoy myself.”View image in fullscreenEnjoying himself … at Lollapalooza in Chicago this month.Photograph: Josh Brasted/FilmMagicThis bashful bass star has the demeanour of a nice young chap who is just genuinely gassed to be up there, giving massive grins and thumbs ups during his sets as if he almost can’t believe his luck. “I often don’t say what my aspirations are out loud because then it treats [music] like a business,” he says. “I’ve gone past what I always wanted to achieve – the most unachievable thing to me was doinga tunewith [bassline star] Flava D. And then the next most unbelievable thing would be getting in the studio with Skrillex, and then that happened. The whole thing’s very surreal.”In the past two years, he’s become dance music’s next golden boy off the back of a viral setat DJ Mag’s HQ, setting off the office fire alarm with a selection that called back to the2010s heyday of UK bass. But beyond the meme-able catchphrases (“it’s Virji, isn’t it”) and technical mastery, he’s most renowned for his well-crafted arsenal of self-made bangers. “Sammy’s tracks are an amazing hybrid of massively heavy-sounding but also catchy, joyous and fun to dance to,” says Dan Snaith, AKA Caribou/Daphni, who often deploys Virji’s big-hitters in his DJ sets, as do fellow dance A-listers Four Tet and Fred Again. “He has a kind of alchemy that makes his tracks bigger and bolder than anyone else’s.”Virji casts himself as “definitely a producer before I’m a DJ”, spot-welding the swinging drums and chopped-up vocal samples found in the UK garage of the mid-90s onwards to the four-to-the-floor rhythm of itsbassline sub-genre, which originated in West Yorkshire and the Midlands. Add in the melodiousness of house music, the cheeky womps of dubstep, the gruff superstyling of a soundsystem MC, elements of grime and speed it all up: you’ve got a formula for bridging the UK club underground with American EDM.Virji’s father Fayyaz is a trombonist who played on The Miseducation of Lauryn HillVirji has spent years perfecting his sound. Early on, Virji’s father Fayyaz – a trombonist who played onThe Miseducation of Lauryn Hill– introduced his son to production software Logic and Virji started off making “bad dubstep”, an attempt to emulatethe classic Rinse compilationshe discovered in primary school. By his teenage years, he had gravitated towards bassline, in thrall to Flava D, DJ Q and Dr Cryptic. With his 2020 debut album, Spice Up My Life, Virji cemented his transition to garage, and he’s released an impressive number of tracks since, such as 2023 masterpiece Shella Verse.There’s a certain irony to his music finding an audience in the US when the original UKG never did. “There seems to be a huge crowd ready to experience UK garage and bassline for the first time,” says Kieran Hebden, AKA Four Tet. “[It’s] the perfect next thing for the tech house and EDM fans.” Virji politely wonders whether it’s because his sound offers “a breath of fresh air” at festivals full of house and EDM, but it could also be the brightly lit positivity of his productions. “Optimism is very important, especially now,” Virji says.Hebden sees Virji’s real strength as “his musicality, taste and production skills – it’s not like he just picked the right genre and won. The clever stuff is in the sonics, melodies, dynamics, arrangements. He could be doing techno, jungle [or] psytrance and it would probably still be good. It’s exciting to have another UK producer cut through everything and make it all feel alive.”On Same Day Cleaning, Virji collaborates with UK rap royalty Giggs and Skepta, and Virji was fascinated by the latter MC’s creative process for their track Cops and Robbers. “He created the mood, put a UKG documentary on mute,” says Virji. “We must have sat there for half an hour with the beat on repeat, no one saying anything, until he goes, ‘OK, I’m ready to record.’ He hadn’t written anything down, he had it all in his head.”Virji also links up with UK garage pioneers of old, namely MJ Cole and returning duo Tuff Jam. “So many people don’t know how important these legends are,” says Virji. “As much as my role is about having fun and making people dance, it’s pointless doing it unless you’re helping to give them some history.”But while he recently released a 90s-trance-laced summer smash called Nostalgia, Virji would rather focus on what’s new. “There’s so many things that get recycled, everything’s trying to sound old,” he notes. “But if you can make something original that’s going to be used in the future,that’spretty cool.”Same Day Cleaning is released via Capitol on 19 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsDance musicElectronic musicClub cultureinterviewsShareReuse this content"

But for Nicholas Blincoe, the story is much closer to home. He reveals an astonishing family historyNicholas BlincoeSun 24 Aug 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 24 Aug 2025 09.14 EDTShareFor almost my entire life, I’ve known there’s a connection between my family and Oliver Twist. There’s little chance I could forget it. Charles Dickens’s story has exploded into an Oliver multimedia universe, with as many as a hundred screen adaptations, the brilliant Lionel Bart musical, two current TV shows based on the frenmity of Fagin and the Artful Dodger, and an Audible dramatisation starring Brian Cox and Daniel Kaluuya.I remember one Easter Sunday we were watching Oliver! on TV when my father snapped out of his post-lunch stupor to announce: “Oliver Twist was a Blincoe. He’s my great-great-grandfather.” The original Robert Blincoe was a foundling, abandoned in London’s St Pancras district in around 1792. He spent his early years in the care of the parish, entering the workhouse at four years old. By seven, he was one of 30 “parish apprentices” contracted to work in a Nottinghamshire cotton mill without pay until the age of 21. London’s parish councils shipped thousands of pauper children north between the 1790s and 1830s, but little was known of their lives until Robert’s memoir. His account of brutality, sadism, sexual abuse and starvation became a national sensation, running to five editions between 1828 and 1833.Twenty years ago, the historian John Waller wrote a new biography, The Real Oliver Twist, which traced Robert’s role in the early battle for workers’ rights. But only when I wrote my own history, Oliver Twist and Me, did I really understand how Dickens’s best-loved novel came about, which in turn brought me closer to my great-great-great-grandfather.My father knew nothing of Robert’s life when he enrolled at Manchester University in the early 1960s, but he had the good fortune to catch a new wave of social history, inspired by EP Thompson’s declaration that “the working class was present at its own making”. A lecturer named Albert Musson was researching a labour organiser of the 1820s and 1830s named John Doherty, an Irish-born Catholic who Musson describes as “the most outstanding Trade Union leader of that period”. Doherty shaped the emerging working-class identity not only through unions and strikes, but by publishing their stories. In 1832, he brought out a new edition of Robert’s memoir in support of the Ten-Hour Movement, the campaign for a shorter working day. At university, my father was asked if he was related tothatRobert Blincoe. He doubted it, but was prompted to hunt down Doherty’s publications in Manchester Central Library. He found letters and testimonials from people who knew Robert, alongside updates on his later life. There were references to Robert’s son, another Robert, born in 1826, who my father knew was his great-grandfather. Robert Jr had gone on to Queens’ College, Cambridge, before being ordained as a priest at Lichfield in 1848, and in 1853 becoming curate of St Luke’s Old Street, London.I discovered that my ancestor's memoir had been published on Fleet Street, out of a bookshop that Dickens passed dailyOn my desk is a scrapbook, passed down through my family, that the young vicar started in his days at St Luke’s. I coincidentally moved to Old Street, east London, while writing Oliver Twist and Me, and discovered from a wedding certificate tucked inside the scrapbook’s cover that my great-great-grandmother had lived just a few doors from my new home. After four generations and 160 years, a Blincoe has circled back to old family haunts. Yet given this strange proximity, it’s odd that we knew nothing of the original Robert Blincoe until my father went to university.Musson’s rediscovery of Robert Blincoe’s memoir was a source of pride for my father in 1960s Manchester, but the book was a blight on the life of an ambitious Victorian cleric. Robert Jr would not give his enemies any more reasons to look down on him. His scrapbook reveals a bitter man, once celebrated as a young preacher, who found his chances of preferment blocked, something he blamed on the jealousy of his superiors. Towards the end of his life he moved his family back north, where he was supported by a wealthier older sister, Martha, the wife of a mill owner. John Waller tracked down Martha’s ancestors to New Zealand and discovered they had always known the story of Robert and the workhouse. Only we had been kept in the dark.The Reverend Robert was also the chaplain of St Luke’s workhouse, which appears in David Copperfield. The Micawbers do a flit from their home opposite the workhouse, abandoning their orphan servant in the street. In real life, too, Dickens’s mother Elizabeth callously dumped the family maid in Camden. The girl was a parish apprentice, recruited from a workhouse. His mother’s cruelty explains Dickens’s deep feelings for both parish orphans and teenage prostitutes, the likely fate of their maid. The character Nancy is his archetype of an exploited girl.View image in fullscreenLeanne Rowe and Jamie Foreman as Nancy and Bill Sikes in the 2005 film of Oliver Twist.Photograph: R.p. Productions/AllstarRobert Blincoe’s memoir has remained in print since the late 1960s and the claim that it is the source for Oliver Twist has become well established. There is solid textual evidence for it. The workhouse chapters that open each book introduce the same events in the same order, ending with a dramatic confrontation with the local chimneysweeps. I discovered that the 1828 edition of the memoir had been published on Fleet Street, out of a bookshop that Dickens passed daily, running between his shorthand shifts at a courtroom near St Paul’s and his night shifts at parliament, where he worked for a rival to Hansard. Dickens was employed there when Doherty’s work was debated, and when Robert appeared as a witness at a parliamentary inquiry.The relationship between Robert’s memoir and Dickens’s novel is strengthened by a personal connection between Dickens and John Doherty’s circle in Manchester, through the reformer Lord Shaftesbury (then Lord Ashley). In the late 1830s, Shaftesbury organised tours to view the working conditions in Manchester’s factories, with Doherty as a guide. Dickens accepted Shaftesbury’s invitation in November 1838, one of a series of public events Dickens undertook with his illustrator, in a pairing known as Boz and Phiz. During the trip, Dickens – who had grown tired of sharing the limelight – abruptly returned to London and halted the printing of the stand-alone edition of Oliver Twist changing the author’s name from Boz to Charles Dickens.Two months after Dickens, rival novelist Frances Trollope also took Shaftesbury’s tour. Her meeting with Doherty went well, according to her son Thomas (brother of the author Anthony). Dickens felt Frances was dogging his footsteps. She turned her tour into a promotional vehicle for her new book Michael Armstrong, the Factory Boy, which began its serialisation on her arrival in Manchester. The novel lifts scenes from Robert’s memoirs, including a devastating account of starving children stealing from a pigsty. Dickens felt compelled to alter his plans for his next book, Nicholas Nickleby, to avoid repeating Trollope’s account of the factory system.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Yet, he appropriated the stories of parentless children to burnish his image as a self-made creative. On his Shaftesbury-funded trip to Manchester, he was given a snuff box which proclaimed him, “The Inimitable”. He turned this incident into a piece of branding: from then on, he was the Inimitable, a true original who owed nothing to anyone else.Twenty years ago, I saw Waller’s biography of Robert Blincoe as the story of a self-made man. He walked to Manchester crippled and penniless, starting on the lowest rung as a dealer in waste rags. He arrived at a time when even the abomination of slave cotton could not keep up with world consumption. The price of rags steadily increased, not least because of their use in the paper industry, booming thanks to writers like Dickens. Robert became a loved and respected figure around Manchester, seeing one of his daughters marry well, and his son become a vicar. It was a remarkable turnaround.But these days I feel I misinterpreted his story, and a different picture has revealed itself. Dickens frequently spoke of “conviviality”, the fellow-feeling that enhances life. This was a value also held in high esteem by Robert, who saw his friendships as a political bulwark against the brutality of Manchester’s factory system. He was proud that his partnership with John Doherty made him an emblem for the working man. Doherty commissioned a woodcut of Robert from the artist William Knight Keeling, which was used as a banner at a rally for the Ten-Hour Movement: Robert was literally the poster boy for an emerging working-class identity. But he never separated himself from the world of his upbringing. His memoir was a collaboration, combining his story, told through interviews, with letters from other parish apprentices.Thinking of Robert’s memoir as a group effort has made me reassess Dickens’s work. In the period around publication of Oliver Twist, he created his own legend as the great singular author. But his writing continues to hold such power because it blossomed into a multiverse thanks to contributions that came later, like Oliver!. Dickens lives not because he is unique, but because he has become part of a collective endeavour. God bless us, everyone.Oliver Twist & Me by Nicholas Blincoe is published by Bridge Street.

Then a visit to the Natural History Museum changed everythingAnonymous; as told to Kate PasolaSun 24 Aug 2025 02.00 EDTShareIstill remember the moment my body image issues began as if it were yesterday. The shaming came before the bingeing: I was 18 and my mum told me I needed to start being careful with my eating, because I was “getting fat”.She would say: “You’d be so pretty if you’d just lose weight!” I wasn’t overweight at the time, and I felt so angry. But young women aren’t allowed to be angry – so, with nowhere to put those feelings, I channelled them into food, spiralling into binge-eating as an act of revenge. Then came remorse and shame: a cycle of bingeing and restriction.By 25, I was attending Overeaters Anonymous, but it didn’t help. Over the space of the next two decades, I tried every diet – the “cabbage soup diet”, Slimming World, Weight Watchers, SlimFast, Atkins, low-carb, intermittent fasting. My weight fluctuated as I had two children – I just thought of myself as a blob. I’d tried to tentatively engage with the body positivity movement, but it was hard.Then, in October 2021, at the age of 42, I took my seven-year-old son Arthur to the Natural History Museum in Oxford, a couple of hours from where we live in Gloucestershire. The day out was more for Arthur than me. He wasn’t sleeping well at the time, so I was stressed and exhausted.My eyes fell on to her wonderful chubby bottom, her arms draped over her big breastsBut as I ascended the stairs up to the first floor, I spotted her. This tiny limestone carving, only 11cm tall: a replica of the Paleolithic Venus of Willendorf figurine. I was immediately transfixed.She is, by modern standards, either pregnant or could be described as obese. My eyes fell on to her wonderful chubby bottom, her arms draped over her big breasts. There’s a fat, pouchy bit above her vulva. A lovely protruding belly, with a belly button that looks just like mine.I felt intense joy, and immediate relief at this proof that humans come in all shapes and sizes, and always have have, as well as relief from the neverending shame that a fat person carries around. This woman’s body was worshipped, revered or even sexualised. For some reason, somebody had bothered to make her. I stared at her while my husband and son wandered off to the cafe, and stole another look on the way out. Seeing my own body mirrored back at me by this figurine from 30,000 years ago wiped the slate clean of all I’d been taught, all those painful beliefs. I realised I deserved to be free.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I felt immediately uplifted. I started doing things I was too nervous to do in the past, such as wearing a bikini or sleeveless dresses on a hot day. Wild swimming without worrying about what anyone thought. I used to scroll on my phone, comparing myself to other women, but now I’ve deleted my social media. I’ve stopped bingeing. No more revenge eating. Of course, I’m still going to order a takeaway when I want to, but eating is no longer self-harm.I’m even planning something bonkers that I’d never have dreamed of doing: performance art inspired by the Venus of Willendorf. After seeing her, I enrolled in an MA course in art education at Oxford Brookes University. For my thesis, which is about the links between knitting and neurodivergence, I’m knitting the details of her body, from her vulva to her head-beading, on to a nude, skin-tight elastic bodysuit. I’ll wear it in the museum and photograph myself next to her. A lifesize Venus of Willendorf.These days, I’m happily fat. I’m not impervious to diet culture – something will always come along and rock me. But I’m going to find a silver charm of the Venus of Willendorf to wear: a talisman to always bring me back to myself.In the UK,Beatcan be contacted on 0808-801-0677.

Her show riffs on the Friday afternoon reward for schoolchildren of an hour’s golden time – but only for those who have earned it by being good all week.The initial vibe is club meets classroom. We take our seats to thumping dance music and Giulia Grillo’s production grows akin to a lesson with a favourite teacher as Ireland asks for our memories of those Fridays. (No need for hands in the air.) There’s a blackboard of sorts, used for projections as well as creative captioning, still rare at the fringe. We are given a quick history lesson on the concept of “better behaviour through golden time” devised by education consultant Jenny Mosley and Ireland remembers how she was denied the reward, left staring at the blackboard in a purgatorial state.View image in fullscreenA performer who shines … Kate Ireland.Photograph: Beckett Guimaraes-TolleyWhen she returns to primary school as a teaching assistant, Ireland identifies with a vividly drawn neurodivergent pupil placed on “amber” in the class’s traffic-light system for golden time. Ireland takes us through a week in the job – she may be grown up, but the school system drains and confines her in the same ways as when she was young. Her bond with the young girl helps them both get through the days.All of this is captured with some lovely image-making: pupils with hands in the air “like windscreen wipers”, her unnamed young ally’s bloody knee, resembling a teacher’s red cross; the time-loop scrawled by the child when asked to depict their future. That last one leads to a head-rush flow of performance poetry that ties together, a little too explicitly, the show’s themes. By then Ireland has deftly conveyed the shortfalls of one-size-fits-all thinking, the march of productivity, ranking and targets not just in school but wider society.A dose more of that poetry would be welcome and balance out what sometimes feels like a workshop. But you leave feeling lighter, thanks in part to an exercise where the audience are encouraged to remember for themselves carefree times without constraints and then share those memories with Ireland. The room fills with afternoon scenes of dancing with siblings, playing football and talking to pet guinea pigs. Properly golden hours, conjured by a performer who shines too.AtPleasance Dome, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreComedy (Culture)Edinburgh festivalSchoolsPoetryComedy (Stage)reviewsShareReuse this content"

In caps, goggles and bathing suits, Alexander Burnett and Ellie Whittaker recount our abiding passion for the water, from the earliest forms of life to Napoleon diving into an especially wet misremembering of Waterloo, and on to an amusing pitch for The Great British Swim-Off. It’s a supremely silly sequence that could even withstand a few more laps of absurdity.The show’s focus, though, is on two contestants going head to head: Meeta (Burnett), drilled for competition since birth, and Steve (Whittaker), rehabilitated from a wayward youth by a newfound love of swimming. (He still has an over-developed right arm from throwing stones.) Meeta emits discipline and icy focus; have-a-go Steve is a bag of nerves, goggle-eyed even without the swim glasses.View image in fullscreenNever treads water … The Crawl.Photograph: PRIn a nice touch, Burnett and Whittaker are competitive with each other about how this story will be told and they also play overly fussy, antagonistic race organisers and buffoonish commentators. As for the other competitors, coaches, lifeguards and so on – they are all played by us, thanks to the most affably handled audience participation I’ve seen this fringe.With bombastic music from Andrés Hernandez, Olivia Zerphy’s production never treads water and the limber, Lecoq-trained performers are suitably synchronised. Who needs props when they can play gym equipment, a library or a glacier themselves?This is a genially amusing hour, never quite reaching hysterical heights, but with plenty of clever, goofy touches and a wide appeal (it’s for over-eights) even if the moral could probably be elucidated for younger audiences. The story grows surprisingly sweet and shows there’s more than one way to win in life.AtPleasance Dome, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Stage)TheatreComedy (Culture)Edinburgh festivalSwimming (Sport)Swimming (Life and style)reviewsShareReuse this content"

The show,nominated for an Edinburgh comedy award, takes the temperature of a divided America, and – even less fashionable, this – proposes how it might be healed.It’s not a perfect set: Jay has a diffident manner at the microphone, so there are punchlines that aren’t audible, far less impactful. But the range, ambition – and sometimes quality – of her thinking makes something distinctive, certainly at this year’s fringe, of this cool diagnosis of America’s ills.A marker of Jay’s intention to do things differently is put down early with a routine questioning “non-binary” as a gender category. Are we in the realms ofDave Chappelle-alike transphobic comedy? We are not. But looking at her country, Jay – herself black and gay – argues that the pace of change is alienating potential sympathisers, that people need to step out of their silos and meet halfway, that culture wars are “people fighting for what they understand”. She goes to a rodeo, and apprehends the gulf between red-state America and her world of veganism and trans bathrooms. She brings Jeffrey Dahmer in from the cold. She interrogates black people’s culpability for the state of her nation. (“We celebrated OJ too hard.”)Sometimes, these are useful as well as funny ideas. Sometimes, they’re arresting but glib – as with her argument for a return to a state of nature, or the arrogance v insecurity she identifies in colonialism v chattel slavery. But how thrilling to be, as that reference implies, at a show bandying big concepts around. And making them so provocatively funny, as with Jay’s extended riff on “fucked farmers” and alien abduction, or her visit to the UK to encounter whiteness at its zenith.The pleasure, at the performance I saw, was undermined by a bewilderingly abrupt ending. But We the People remains an eye-catching set from a comic who’s found lots to say, and lots to laugh about, in the not-ostensibly-amusing condition of modern America.AtPleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Edinburgh festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

That, what we think of as this precious great film music is … we’re remembering it in some kind of nostalgic way …“Just the idea that film music has the same place in the concert hall as the best music in the canon is a mistaken notion, I think.”He added: “A lot of [film music] is ephemeral. It’s certainly fragmentary and, until somebody reconstructs it, it isn’t anything that we can even consider as a concert piece.”Among the more than 100 movies he has scored are the Indiana Jones films, ET, Schindler’s List and the first three Harry Potter films.He is the world’s most nominated living Oscar recipient, with a record 54 nominations, recognising that his music has played a crucial role in enhancing and heightening a film’s emotion and atmosphere.With two haunting notes, he captured the chilling threat of the Great White Shark in Jaws, while his mournful Jewish lament in Steven Spielberg’s Schindler’s List conveyed the heartbreak of the Holocaust.View image in fullscreenWilliams conducting a concert in Washington DC in 2023.Photograph: Shannon Finney/Getty ImagesHe was interviewed by Tim Greiving for a biography,John Williams: A Composer’s Life, to be published by Oxford University Press in September.Greiving was taken aback by Williams’s dismissal of film music: “His comments are sort of shocking, and they are not false modesty. He is genuinely self-deprecating, and deprecating of ‘film music’ in general.”He said Williams referred to his film-scoring assignments, including the high-profile and much-lauded ones, as “just a job”. He added: “But I also don’t think we should necessarily take his words at face value. He clearly took the job of composing music for films as seriously as anyone in history ever has.“He has this internalised prejudice against film music. It’s a functional type of music, which is funny because I consider his film music to be kind of sublime art at its best. That’s not modesty. He’s just saying it’s a lesser art form. Typically that is true, though. It is written much quicker and much more economically. But I do think his music defies that. He perfected the art of film scoring. He took it to its greatest heights. He elevated film music to a high art form.”Despite the acclaim, Williams is self-critical, telling Greiving: “If I had it all to do over again, I would have made a cleaner job of it – of having the film music and the concert music all being more me, whatever that is, or more unified in some way. But none of it ever happened that way. The film thing was a job to do, or an opportunity to accept.”In the book, he also talks about working with Spielberg, for whom he scored Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Saving Private Ryan, among other movies.Williams was frustrated early in his career by directors who did not understand music, a typical complaint among film composers.With Spielberg, he has had a “very special collaboration”, he said. “He’s more … musically educated than most of the directors that I’ve worked with. He grew up with his mother who played … Clementi and Bach and Chopin and so on. And she took him to concerts … He played a little clarinet. And he is very musical.”Away from film, Williams has composed dozens of concerti, fanfare and other concert works. He was music director of the Boston Pops for more than a decade, inspiring countless children to pursue a career in the orchestra and winning the respect of the classical community worldwide, Greiving said.Williams has personally approved a new concert performance of his most famous scores, includingStar Warsand Schindler’s List.TitledJohn Williams Reimaginedand featuring new arrangements for flute, cello and piano, it will take place at Cadogan Hall in London on 27 October, with an accompanying album.Williams said: “Pianist Simone Pedroni, flutist Sara Andon and cellist Cécilia Tsan have enhanced and elevated my music and that brings me great joy.”Explore more on these topicsJohn WilliamsSteven SpielbergJawsStar WarsSchindler's ListnewsShareReuse this content"

Would they ever find a safe space?Arundhati RoySun 24 Aug 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 24 Aug 2025 07.53 EDTShareAteacher was what my mother had always wanted to be, what she was qualified to be. During the years she was married and living with our father, who had a job as an assistant manager on a remote tea estate in Assam, the dream of pursuing a career of any kind atrophied and fell away. It was rekindled (as nightmare more than dream) when she realised that her husband, like many young men who worked on lonely tea estates, was hopelessly addicted to alcohol.When war broke out betweenIndiaand China in October 1962, women and children were evacuated from border districts. We moved to Calcutta. Once we got there, my mother decided that she would not return to Assam. From Calcutta we travelled across the country, all the way south to Ootacamund – Ooty – a small hill station in the state of Tamil Nadu. My brother, LKC – Lalith Kumar Christopher Roy – was four and a half years old, and I was a month away from my third birthday. We did not see or hear from our father again until we were in our 20s.In Ooty we lived in one half of a “holiday” cottage that belonged to our maternal grandfather, who had retired as a senior government servant – an Imperial Entomologist – with the British government in Delhi. He and my grandmother were estranged. He had severed links with her and his children years ago. He died the year I was born.I don’t know how we got into that cottage. Maybe the tenant who lived in the other half had a key. Maybe we broke in. The cottage was dank and gloomy with cold, cracked cement floors and an asbestos ceiling. A plywood partition separated our half from rooms occupied by the tenant. She was an old English lady called Mrs Patmore. She wore her hair in a high, puffy style, which made us wonder what was hidden inside it. Wasps, we thought, my brother and I. At night she had bad dreams and would scream and moan. I’m not sure if she paid any rent. She might not have known who to pay it to. We, certainly, paid no rent. We were squatters, interlopers – not tenants. We lived like fugitives amid huge wooden trunks packed full of the dead Imperial Entomologist’s opulent clothes – silk ties, dress shirts, three-piece suits.I remember my mother, my brother and me holding hands, running through the town in panic, trying to find a lawyerWe found an old biscuit tin full of cufflinks. Later, when my brother and I were old enough to understand, we would be told the legendary family stories about him: about his vanity (he had a portrait of himself taken in a Hollywood photo studio) and his violence (he whipped his children, turned them out of the house regularly, and split my grandmother’s scalp open with a brass vase). It was to get away from him, our mother told us, that she married the first man who proposed to her.Quite soon after we arrived, she got a teaching job at a local school called Breeks. Ooty was, at the time, swarming with schools, some of them run by British missionaries who had chosen to stay on in India after independence. She became friends with a group of them who taught at an all-white school called Lushington, which catered to the children of British missionaries working in India. She managed to persuade them to let her sit in on their classes when she had time off from her job. She hungrily absorbed their innovative teaching methods while being simultaneously disturbed by their kindly, well-meaning racism towards Indians and India.A few months into our fugitive life, my grandmother (the Entomologist’s widow) and her oldest son – my mother’s older brother, G Isaac – arrived from Kerala to evict us. I hadn’t seen either of them before. They told my mother that under the Travancore Christian Succession Act, daughters had no right to their father’s property and that we were to leave the house immediately.View image in fullscreenRoy in 1963 in Ootacamund, with her mother and brother.Photograph: courtesy of Arundhati RoyIt didn’t seem to matter to them that we had nowhere to go. My grandmother didn’t say much, but she scared me. She had conical corneas and wore opaque sunglasses. I remember my mother, my brother and me holding hands, running through the town in panic, trying to find a lawyer. In my memory it was night and the streets were dark. But it couldn’t have been. Because we did manage to find a lawyer, who told us that the Travancore act applied only in the state of Kerala, not Tamil Nadu, and that even squatters had rights. He said if anyone tried to evict us, we could call the police. We returned to the cottage shaking but triumphant.Our uncle G Isaac could not have known then that, by trying to evict his younger sister from their father’s cottage, he was laying the ground for his own downfall. It would be years before my mother had the means and the standing to challenge the Travancore Christian Succession Act and demand an equal share of her father’s property in Kerala. Until then, she would shield and safeguard this memory of her mortification as though it were a precious family heirloom, which, in a way, it was.After our legal coup we expanded into the cottage, made ourselves some space. My mother gave away the Imperial Entomologist’s suits and cufflinks to taxi drivers at the taxi stand near the market, and for a while Ooty had the best-dressed taxi drivers in the world.Despite our hard-won but still tentative sense of security, things didn’t go our way. The cold, wet climate in Ooty aggravated my mother’s asthma. She would lie under a thick metallic-pink quilt on a high iron cot, breathing great, heaving breaths, bedridden for days on end. We thought she was going to die. She didn’t like us standing around staring at her and would order us out of her room. So my brother and I would go off to find something else to stare at.Mostly, we swung on the low, rickety gate at the corner of the triangular compound, watching newlywed couples on their honeymoon holding hands and walking past our home on their way to romance each other in Ooty’s famous botanical gardens. Sometimes they stopped and talked to us. They gave us sweets and peanuts. A man gave us a catapult. We spent days perfecting our aim. We made friends with strangers. Once, one of them grabbed my hand and marched me back into the house. He told my mother sternly that her daughter had chickenpox. He made me show her the blister on my stomach, which I had been showing off to anybody who cared to examine it. My mother was furious. After he left, she smacked me hard on my cheek and told me I was never to lift my dress and show my stomach to strangers. Especially men.It could have been her illness or the medication, but she became extremely bad-tempered and began to hit us often. When she did this my brother would run away and only come home after dark. He was a quiet boy. He never cried. When he was upset he would put his head down on the dining table and pretend to be asleep. When he was happy, which wasn’t often, he would dance around me boxing the air, saying he was Cassius Clay. I don’t know how he knew who Cassius Clay was; I didn’t. Maybe our father told him. I think those years in Ooty were harder for him than for me because he remembered things. He remembered a better life. He remembered our father and the big house we had lived in on the tea estate. He remembered being loved. Fortunately, I didn’t.It was Kurussammal who taught us what love was. What dependability was. What being hugged wasView image in fullscreenMy brother started school before me. He went to Lushington, the white-people’s school, for a few months. (It must have been a favour to my mother from the missionaries.) But when he began to call local children like ourselves “those Indian children” she pulled him out and enrolled him in Breeks, the school that she taught in.On days when her asthma was really bad, my mother would write out a shopping list of vegetables and provisions, put it into a basket and send us into town with it. Ooty was a safe, small town then, with little traffic. The policemen knew us. The shopkeepers were always kind and sometimes even gave us credit. The kindest of them all was a lady called Kurussammal, who worked in the Knitting Shop. She knitted two polo‑neck sweaters for us. Bottle-green for my brother. Plum for me.When my mother became completely bedridden for a few weeks, Kurussammal moved in with us. Our edgy lifestyle came to an end. It was Kurussammal who taught us what love was. What dependability was. What being hugged was. She would cook for us and bathe us outdoors in the bitter Ooty cold with water she boiled in a huge pot on a wood fire. To this day, my brother and I need to be almost boiled to feel properly bathed.Before she bathed us, she combed the lice out of our hair and showed us how to kill them. I loved killing them. They made a satisfying sound when I squashed them with my thumbnail. Apart from being a lightning-quick knitter, Kurussammal was a superb cook. She specialised in producing food from almost no ingredients. Even boiled rice with salt and a fresh green chilli tasted good when she put it on our plates. Kurussammal’s name meant “mother of the cross” in Tamil. Her husband was Yesuratnam (“Jesus jewel”, “jewel of jewels”). He had a goitre on his neck that he hid with his woollen muffler. He, like us, always smelled of wood smoke.Eventually my mother grew too sick to hold down her job. Even the steroids she was on didn’t help. We ran out of money. My brother and I grew undernourished and developed primary tuberculosis. After a few more grim months of fighting on all fronts, my mother gave up. She decided to swallow her pride and return to Kerala, to Ayemenem, our grandmother’s village. She was out of options.As our train crossed the border from Tamil Nadu into Kerala, the land turned from brown to green. Everything, including the electric poles, was smothered with plants and creepers. Everything glistened. Almost all the people who slid past the train window, both men and women, wore white and carried black umbrellas.My heart sang.And then sank.View image in fullscreenAs soon as the shouting began, I would flee. The river was my refuge. It made up for everything that was wrong in my lifeWe arrived in Ayemenem uninvited and manifestly unwelcome. The house whose doorstep we appeared on with our invisible begging bowl belonged to my grandmother’s older sister, Miss Kurien. She would have been in her 60s then. Her thin, wavy grey hair was cut in a style that used to be called a pageboy. She wore starched, papery saris with big, loose blouses. Miss Kurien was far ahead of most women of her time. She was single, held a master’s degree in English literature and had taught at a college in Sri Lanka (then Ceylon).My mother assured her that we would stay only as long as it took for her to find a job. Miss Kurien, who prided herself on being a good Christian, agreed to let us stay, but made no effort to hide her disapproval of us and our situation. She did this by ignoring us and showering her delicate affections on other relatives’ children who visited her. She gave them gifts, played her piano and sang to them in her quavering voice. Even though she made it clear that she did not like us (which made us not like her), she was the one person who helped us out and gave us a roof over our heads when we most needed it.My grandmother lived with her, too. She was almost blind by then and still wore her dark glasses. Even at night. She had a ridge that ran across her scalp – her famous brass-vase scar. Sometimes she let me run my finger over it. Every evening she would sit on the veranda and play her violin. She had taken music lessons when her Imperial Entomologist husband was posted to Vienna. When her tutor told him that his wife had the potential to become a concert-class violinist, he stopped the lessons and, in a fit of jealous rage, smashed the first violin she owned.I was too young to tell how well she played, but as darkness fell in Ayemenem and the sound of crickets swelled, her music made the evenings and the very dark nights more melancholic than they already were.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

At first, I was terrified of him. I only knew him as the tall, fat, angry man who had tried to turn us out of our home in Ooty. In Ayemenem, though, I grew to love him after he began to take my brother and me down to the river and teach me to swim. G Isaac was one of India’s first Rhodes scholars. His subject was Greek and Roman mythology. At the dining table he would suddenly say things like: “Isn’t it wonderful to have a god of wine and ecstasy?” Everybody would look at him blankly. And he would tell us about Dionysus, or whoever his god of the day was.After teaching for a few years in a college in Madras, he gave up his academic career to return to his roots and start a pickle, jam and curry powder factory with his mother. It was called Malabar Coast Products. They ran it out of the Imperial Entomologist’s family home in Kottayam town, which was a short bus ride away. (This was the house that would become the centre of the dispute when my mother challenged the Travancore Christian Succession Act.) G Isaac, notwithstanding his keen interest in inheritance and private property, was a Marxist. He said he had given up his career to start a factory to promote small industry and generate local employment. Fed up with his nonsense, his Swedish wife, Cecilia, whom he had met in Oxford, left him and returned to Sweden with their three young sons. In these strange and manifold ways, this constellation of extraordinary, eccentric, cosmopolitan people, defeated by life, converged on the tiny village of Ayemenem.Life there was like living on a ledge that we could be nudged off at any moment. Even Kochu Maria, the cook, would tell me that we had no right to be living there. She would mutter and grumble about the shamefulness of having fatherless children living under the same roof as decent people. Every few days the Cosmopolitans would quarrel. When they fought, the whole house shook. Plates would be smashed; doors broken down.View image in fullscreenI found it impossible to gauge what would anger my mother and what would please herAs soon as the shouting began, I would flee. The river was my refuge. It made up for everything that was wrong in my life. I spent hours on its banks and came to be on intimate, first-name terms with the fish, the worms, the birds and the plants. I became close friends with other children (and some adults) in the village. I picked up Malayalam quickly and was soon able to communicate with everybody quite easily. They inhabited a different universe from mine. Most of them worked in nearby paddy fields and rubber plantations, or picking coconuts or working as house-help. They lived in mud-and- thatch-roofed houses. Many of them belonged to castes that were considered “untouchable”. I didn’t know much about this horror at the time, because everybody in the Ayemenem house was too busy fighting with one another to bother about indoctrinating me.One young man who lived in Ayemenem but worked in Kottayam in Malabar Coast Products became my most beloved friend. We spent a lot of time together. He made me a fishing rod out of a culm of bamboo and showed me where to find the best earthworms to use as bait. He taught me to fish; he taught me to stay still and be quiet. He fried the tiny fish I caught, and we ate them together as though we were feasting at a banquet. He was the inspiration for the character called Velutha, Ammu’s lover, inThe God of Small Things.Within months of being in Ayemenem, I turned into a part of its landscape – a wild child with calloused feet who knew every hidden path and shortcut in the village that led to the river. I lived outdoors and went home as seldom as possible. In the non-human category, my closest companion was a striped palm squirrel who lived on my shoulder and whispered in my ear. We shared secrets. She wasn’t my pet. She had her own life, but chose to share it with me. She would disappear often because she had things to do. At mealtimes she would appear, perch on my plate and nibble at my food. She was constantly watchful, eternally alert to every possibility of looming danger. She taught me things.My mother unloaded the burden of her quarrels and the daily dose of indignity that she had to endure on to my brother and me. We were the only safe harbour she had. Her temper, already bad, became irrational and uncontrollable. I found it impossible to predict or gauge what would anger her and what would please her. I had to pick my way through that minefield without a map. When she got angry with me, she would mimic my way of speaking. She was a good mimic and made me sound ridiculous to myself. I clearly remember everything about every instance she did that. Even what I was wearing. It felt as though she had cut me out – cut my shape out – of a picture book with a sharp pair of scissors and then torn me up.The first time it happened was on our way home from Madras, where we had been for two weeks. Her older sister, Mrs Joseph, had asked if my mother could look after her three children while she and her husband were away on holiday. My mother agreed. She must have felt that she would – at least nominally – be earning her keep while she was there.View image in fullscreenA cold, furry moth on a frightened heart. That moth was my constant companionUnlike the quarrelsome Ayemenem Cosmopolitans, Mrs Joseph had a proper husband, who was a pilot for Indian Airlines; proper children; and a proper house with servants. Mrs Joseph was acutely conscious of the fact that in these matters she had succeeded where her siblings had failed. She was good-looking, with a high, smug voice that matched her starched, ironed saris and her neat hairstyle. She had a tight, knowing smile and always sounded as though she were confiding in the person she was talking to. There was no resemblance at all, neither physical nor temperamental, between her and my mother.When Mrs Joseph came back from her holiday, the sisters had a terrible spat about something. We returned to Kerala the next day by plane. My aunt’s pilot husband had a quota of free tickets. We hadn’t been in a plane before. Once we were seated, intending to conduct a reasonable, adult conversation as should be conducted by co-passengers on an airplane, I asked my mother how, if Mrs Joseph was her real sister, was Mrs Joseph so thin?My mother turned on me in a rage. I felt myself shrinking from my own skin and draining away, swirling like water down a sink until I was gone. Then she said: “By the time you are my age you’ll be three times my size.” I knew I had said something terrible, but I wasn’t sure what. (I was too young for “fat” and “thin” to be value judgments.) It was only years later, when I managed to think about it clearly without dwelling on my own feelings, that I finally realised how hurtful what I said must have been.The steroids my mother was on had made her suddenly gain weight. She had developed a typical cortisone moon-face. Her striking, fine-featured face had disappeared behind puffy cheeks and a double chin. She must have been feeling forlorn and hopeless after her visit to her slimmer sister’s perfect home. Her triumphant career was still ahead of her, but there was no sign of it then.My question to my mother about her thin sister would have felt like vinegar on an open wound. Careless words from a careless child. So she turned on me and mimicked my six-year-old’s way of speaking. And I turned on myself. I remember the colour of my dress. Sky-blue with polka dots. A perfect hand-me-down from my perfect cousin with straight hair and big doe eyes. I saw that the dress didn’t match my knees, which were full of scars and cuts – a comprehensive logbook of my wild, imperfect, fatherless, pilotless life on the banks of the Meenachil River in Ayemenem.I staged an imaginary competition with my perfect cousin, which I won hands down. She had a pilot father. And lovely hair. But I had a green river. (With fish in it, with the sky and trees in it and at night the broken yellow moon in it.) And a squirrel. I looked at my feet and saw that they didn’t belong in the sandals they wore.It was a horrible plane full of horrible people in a horrible sky. I wanted it to crash and for all of us to die. I especially hated the spoiled children with doting parents. But in a while my mother said: “I’m your mother and your father and I love you double.”And then the plane was all right. The sky was all right. But my feet were still strangers to the sandals they wore. And there were still some unresolved issues.If I was going to be three times her size, I would need three seats to sit on. So, three free tickets. Double. Triple. A maths class. A sum to solve. What is double-love divided by triple-my-size multiplied by free tickets divided by careless words? A cold, furry moth on a frightened heart. That moth was my constant companion.I learned early that the safest place can be the most dangerous. And that even when it isn’t, I make it so.This is an edited extract from Mother Mary Comes to Me by Arundhati Roy, published by Hamish Hamilton at £20.To support the Guardian buy a copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Was ‘Baroness Eloise,’ Known as ‘Crazy Panties,’ Who Ruled the Island With a Gun and Love, Murdered by One of Her Love Slaves After She Had Driven the Other to His Death? And Why is Frau Ritter Going Back to What She Once Called ‘Hell’s Volcano?’ – the Mystery of the Galapagos Island Which Germany Covets, to Be Solved At Last?”This florid passage from a tabloid newspaper caught the eye of the authorAbbott Kahlerdecades after it was published in 1941.“Basically it was the equivalent of a record scratch,” she recalls. “I was thinking: what the hell is the story?”The answer revolves around a group of Europeans from the 1930s who attempted to start anew on the remote island of Floreana, only to encounter the human frailties they hoped to escape: chaos, blackmail, betrayal, disappearances and murder. The enduring mystery of what exactly happened is known as “the Galápagos Affair”.Eden review – Ron Howard’s nasty, starry survival thriller falls over the edgeRead moreKahler became so obsessed that she wrote a book about it calledEden Undone. And she is not alone.Ron Howard, the Oscar-winning film director, learned about the story when he saw some photos at a museum in the Galápagos. This led him to makeEden, a movie starring Jude Law, Ana de Armas, Sydney Sweeney and Vanessa Kirby released on Friday.Kahler understands the Hollywood potential.“I’ve made a career of writing about stranger-than-fiction true stories and this is by far the strangest one I’ve ever come across,” she adds. “Just aside from the incredible cast of characters, it has timeless themes that still resonate today.”Indeed, Howard’s film opens with the blunt statement: “Fascism is spreading.” Germany between the wars faced mass poverty, social unrest and extremism that gave rise to the Nazi party. Some people looked for a way out and a new way of living free from societal constraints.TheGalápagos Islandsoff the coast of Ecuador, famed for scientist Charles Darwin’s expedition, were thought of as the last great unspoiled territory. Floreana, however, is not everyone’s idea of paradise. It is arid, rough and rugged and had historically served as a stopping point for pirates collecting tortoises for food.A German doctor called Friedrich Ritter left his wife and travelled to Floreana with a married woman, Dore Strauch. The austere, misanthropic Ritter was driven by Nietzschean ideals and a desire to escape civilisation and come up with a radical philosophy to save humanity from itself.Ritter was a strict vegetarian and extracted all his teeth and replaced them with steel dentures before leaving. He showed little sympathy to Strauch, his former patient, who was suffering from multiple sclerosis.A visiting US scientific party were fascinated by this “modern day Adam and Eve” and effectively publicised their lives for the press back home, attracting more utopia-seekers such as Heinz Wittmer, a veteran of the first world war, with his second wife Margret and young son. Margret was pregnant and gave birth to the first child officially born on the island.Tensions between the two families were further exacerbated when Eloise Bosquet de Wagner Wehrhorn, an adventuress who called herself the Baroness, arrived with her two lovers, Rudolf Lorenz and Robert Phillipson. The Baroness’s flamboyant lifestyle, declarations of being “empress of Floreana” and plans for a luxury hotel directly clashed with the other settlers’ visions.View image in fullscreenAna de Armas in Eden.Photograph: Jasin Boland / VerticalKahler says: “She shows up on Floreana in 1932 and immediately starts making enemies. The first thing she does is go to Heinz and Margret Wittmer’s home – they were pretty much the only truly stable people there – and wash her feet in their drinking water. That’s strike one.“Then she announces that she’s going to turn Floreana into the next Miami: she’s going to build a lavish hotel that’s going to cater to millionaires around the world. All of these other people who had gone there wanted solitude and to be away from civilisation and here she was directly saying that her goal is the opposite and she wants as many visitors as possible. She made it very clear that she felt the island was hers to do whatever she wanted to do with.”It’s people left to their own devices away from the rules of civilisation … What kind of lawlessness do they concoct?Abbott Kahler, author of Eden UndoneThe Baroness’s hedonism was jarringly at odds with Ritter’s asceticism. Kahler writes how the Baroness wielded a riding crop and pearl-handled revolver, staged fights between her lovers and had sex with American tourists. “She pretty much seduced anybody she could. One visitor called her hotel, the Hacienda Paradiso, a ‘festering sex complex’.”The remote and harsh environment of Floreana intensified the inherent tensions. Food scarcity and the constant struggle for survival amplified mistrust. The community descended into jealousy and animosity. Ritter became increasingly autocratic and the Wittmers struggled to survive amid the discord.Kahler observes:“It’s people left to their own devices away from the rules of civilisation. What kind of rules will they concoct? Or what kind of lawlessness do they concoct?”In March 1934 the Baroness and Phillipson mysteriously vanished. While the Wittmers claimed they left for Tahiti, no evidence of their departure or arrival was ever found, leading to strong suspicions of foul play.Lorenz, now isolated and fearful, fled Floreana. His decomposed body was found on a nearby deserted island months later, adding another layer to the mystery. Not long after, Ritter died from eating spoiled potted meat, despite his professed vegetarianism. Rumours circulated that Strauch had poisoned him.View image in fullscreenVanessa Kirby in Eden.Photograph: Jasin Boland / VerticalKahler comments: “Two people end up missing and two people end up dead.This is why it reminded me of the Agatha Christie novelAnd Then There Were None. A bunch of people show up on a remote island and not everybody makes it out alive.”The lack of definitive proof and conflicting accounts from memoirs by Strauch and Wittmer fuelled the mystery. Strauch returned to Germany, where she died from complications from multiple sclerosis in 1943. Margret Wittmer remained on Floreana until her death in 2000 at the age of 96; her descendants still run a small hotel on the island.When you get a bunch of people together whose visions of utopia clash, what happens?Abbott KahlerFor Kahler, the Galápagos affair taps into a universal human yearning to get off the grid, even if it turned into a grownup version of Lord of the Flies.“Everybody is always dreaming of escaping the drudgery and stress of their daily lives and going somewhere fresh where nobody knows their name and they can leave their problems behind and fashion a brand new utopia for themselves.“Of course, plenty of examples in history suggest that’s not possible. Wherever you go, there you are – that old adage certainly was true of those settlers in this story. Everybody has a different idea of what utopia is or might be and, when you get a bunch of people together whose visions of utopia clash, what happens? That’s also something that we see time and again throughout history. I’m not surprised it attracted Hollywood.”The screenplay for Eden was written by Noah Pink, who has previously tackled subjects such as the gameTetris’s unlikely journeyfrom the Soviet Union to global hit. He was introduced to the story by Howard in 2019 and became intrigued by the idea of three factions fleeing Europe with three very different philosophies.Pink says via Zoom from Toronto, Canada: “I’m boiling it down: Dr Ritter, the purpose of life is pain; Baroness, the purpose of life is pleasure; and the Wittmers, the purpose of life is family. Very simple and when you watch those three philosophies collide, that’s where the fun happens.”View image in fullscreenThe Floreana coastline.Photograph: Rory Stansbury/Global Wildlife ConservationWhat does he hope audiences will take away from the film? “One is the importance of sticking by your loved ones and, whether that’s chosen family or family, especially in these times when things are seemingly very dark around us, we need to stick together and stick to our community and help each other out.“It’s also that running away is not the answer because you cannot run away from yourself. If we want to fix things, we have to stay and we have to fix things.”The intrigue of Floreana also inspired a 2013 documentary,The Galapagos Affair: Satan Came to Eden, directed byDan Geller and Dayna Goldfine. Goldfine says they were particularly drawn to the “vibrant characters” and the “underlying theme of trying to escape oneself and escape civilisation only to bring your own baggage with you”.She continues: “It was that perennial humanity’s thirst for paradise and the philosophical issues around it, this notion of what if you actually do follow through on the dream to go off into the sunset and on whatever some paradise island and you get there and other people arrive with their own different notions of paradise.”Eden is out in US cinemas now and in the UK and Australia soonExplore more on these topicsFilmRon HowardJude LawSydney SweeneyDrama filmsThrillersVanessa KirbyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She discusses her surprising path to fame – and how much of her personal life she is willing to put into her musicSun 24 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTShareOne mark of whether someone has the boldness to be a good pop star is how they respond to overhearing someone slagging them off. A few weeks ago, the Icelandic-Chinese jazz-pop phenomenon Laufey was at a coffee shop close to her Los Angeles home when her ears pricked up at the mention of her name (it’s pronounced “Lay-vay”, by the way). “I used to love her,” a young woman told her friends. “I’ve met her and she’s so sweet, but her music is unlistenable now.”In that split-second, Laufey realised that she could do the Normal Person Thing (slink away unnoticed and furiously text her group chat), or do the Pop Star Thing. She spun around to face the group. “I’m so sorry,” Laufey said, her voice dripping with honeyed sarcasm. “I try my best.”The thought of being confronted by a celebrity you are gossiping about is enough to send most of us into an early grave, and I nervously laugh as Laufey tells me the story one morning in New York. She laughs too, perhaps a little shocked by her ballsiness. “I wasn’t even trying to clap back,” she says. “They didn’t know what to say, they were so dumbfounded.”This goes against much of what I thought I knew about Laufey. The 26-year-old has drawn an obsessive fanbase for winsome love songs that marry her jazz and classical training with sticky pop hooks. Her music is a giddy tumble into a retro-modern world of soft teen romance, with aurora skies, sunset kisses and crushes who leave you on “read”. It surges with the big feelings of modern young womanhood, swaddling them in tulle and sending them airborne amid cascading orchestration.Over the peppy bossa nova of her breakout, TikTok-buoyed hitFrom the Start,she comes across as an Austen heroine who speaks internet, tortured by the “burning pain” of listening to a crush “blah blah blah”-ing interminably about a new partner. Her fans, often young women, are drawn into Laufey-land by her big-sister energy: an edition of her 2023 album Bewitched came with a themed board game. At first glance, with her retro jazz-influenced sound, you might not peg Laufey as the most likely superstar, one who has racked up nearly 5bn Spotify streams and a string of sellout shows across the world. But you could also see her music as a lighter and more literal take on the vintage-hued introspection that has made Lana Del Rey and Billie Eilish stadium-fillers around the globe.I had a more shocking kind of success than I thought I would ever have. It got a bit hard for me to keep up mentallyNow Laufey is keen to rough up her reputation as gen-Z’s favourite jazz savant, at least a little. Her new album A Matter of Time splits the difference between sugar-plum symphonics with imperfect notes and vocals that crack with emotion. One song has jolting strings that she compares to a scream. “I wanted to make more of a statement on this album,” she says. “I’ve become known as a bit of a soft singer. I am that, but I also want to show parts of myself that aren’t that pretty.”She arrived in the hotel lobby this morning on time and as neat as a pin, with a cardigan-wearing bunny rabbit dangling from her handbag. (The critter, named Mei Mei, is Laufey’s mascot and alias of sorts – she releasesalternative versionsof her songs under its name, and it is alsoavailable to buy, with a portion of the proceeds aiding music education as part of the Laufey Foundation.) “Do you want to go in there?” she asks, leading me into a side room and getting out the best biscuits: “It’s the guests-only lounge.” The place is done up like a hunting lodge, with artfully oxidised mirrors, a wall-mounted antelope head and, most bizarrely, given that it is summer, a burning log fire. When I comment on the strangeness, Laufey says, wryly: “Well, it’s now reached a very cool 24 degrees.”View image in fullscreenAll that jazz … Laufey on stage earlier this year.Photograph: Tommaso Boddi/Getty Images/Gold HouseAfter beating Bruce Springsteen to take home the 2024 Grammy award for best traditional pop vocal album, Laufey’s career has gone into overdrive. She’s now a fashion week fixture, trading air kisses with Naomi Campbell on the front row of the Chanel show in July, and has celebrity pals in Olivia Rodrigo, Chappell Roan, PinkPantheress and the indie sensation Clairo, whom she recently challenged to a spicy chicken wing-eating contest ona Hot Ones episode. She has won over industry legends: earlier this year, she duetted with Barbra Streisand on aheartfelt coverof her song Letter to My 13 Year Old Self. “It’s beautiful to see a young artist inspired by jazz greats like Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday make such a deep connection with her fans,” said Streisand. This autumn, Laufey will embark on her firstarena tour, with two nights at Madison Square Garden.She says she was driven by a “hunger” to imbue the new experiences of a whirlwind few years into her new album. It radiates a sense of adventure, dovetailing between twangy campfire country to swoony ballads and sherbert-spiked pop. The record is produced by Laufey and longtime collaborator Spencer Stewart: between them, they can play just about any instrument you have heard of, as well as some you may not have. I was unfamiliar with the celesta, an obscure kind of idiophone that Stewart and Laufey play on the record (it sounds like a child’s musical jewellery box). On the Busby Berkeley-worthy confectionLover Girl, she knowingly leans into her Cupid-struck image, while on Carousel, Laufey reckons with inviting a partner into her circus-like life while a seasick accordion plays. The rapturous Forget-Me-Not, recorded with the Iceland Symphony Orchestra (for which she was a teenage cello soloist), is her most accomplished work of composition to date; her voice soars among flurries of flutes.View image in fullscreenKey phase … Laufey.Photograph: Erlendur Sveinsson“I wanted the album to reflect all sides of my emotional scale,” she says, huddling in air-con that has apparently been set to “Himalayan”. “Within one day, I will have a happy hour and a crying hour. I have no interest in making an album that’s one vibe throughout.” But there is, she says, an emotional through-line about learning to accept yourself while falling in love with someone else. She won’t talk about her relationship status today though, and I ask if internet scrutiny makes it hard to write candidly about her dating experiences. “There’s always a line of ambiguity,” Laufey says, before smiling mischievously. “But if you get into a situation with me, you kind of know that I might write about it.”There’s a playful looseness to Laufey that suggests she has settled into her success. She says that hasn’t always been easy. After her Grammy win, she struggled to balance the new attention with a punishing touring schedule. “I was a little bit scared,” she says. “I had a more shocking kind of success than I thought I would ever have. With the flurry of it all, it got a bit hard for me to keep up mentally.” It wasn’t just the shows; it was that being a pop star means being a piñata for online opinion. “It was the battle of seeing a bad photo of yourself online, or hearing bad comments about yourself,” she says. “It was tough.”View image in fullscreenSing when you’re winning … Laufey with her Grammy in 2024.Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty ImagesLaufey Lín Bing Jónsdóttir always knew what it meant to work. She was born in Reykjavík to a mother who is a professional violinist for the Iceland Symphony Orchestra, with maternal grandparents who are music professors. Aged four, Laufey began piano lessons, then added cello lessons at eight, cramming schoolwork around a dizzying schedule of rehearsals and performances. She credits that relentless regimen with giving her the strength – vocal, mental and muscular – to play for extended periods. When we meet, she’s in the middle of a six-date summer run of orchestral shows across the eastern United States.After an early brush with the spotlight as a finalist inÍsland (Iceland) Got Talent in 2014, Laufey won a scholarship to the prestigious Berklee School of Music in Boston, and began posting performances of jazz standards from her dorm room. In 2021, she released her debut EP, Typical of Me, which drew from the music of 20th-century Tin Pan Alley and found fans in Billie Eilish and Willow Smith.I literally have a career because an audience on social media showed me there was a space for the type of music I makeA Matter of Time marks her creative world opening up. Two spry new songs were created with Taylor Swift collaborator and the National founder member Aaron Dessner at his Long Pond Studios, in an experience that Laufey says “opened a third musical eye”. And she is more lighthearted than ever on Mr Eclectic, a bossa nova-inspired track featuring Clairo that pokes fun at men who mansplain classical music to her. “I just think it’s funny to be the type of man who performatively reads a beaten-up paperback outside a coffee shop,” she says, her nose wrinkling. “I’ve dated guys like that, but this is a forever type of man. Why do you think all philosophers are men? They just had the platform and the audacity.”Laufey’s spicy side makes me like her a whole lot more, not least because it feels refreshing after years of interviewing media-trained artists who won’t tell you their favourite colour in case it conflicts with their Dulux brand deal. That candour can also be seen in A Matter of Time’s waltzing Snow White, which addresses what she calls her lifelong struggle with body image and identity.In the video, set amid the jaw-dropping Icelandic tundra, she sings, “I don’t think I’m pretty, it’s not up for debate,” into a mirror while pulling at the side of her left eye to emphasise its shape.Today, she feels that her insecurity about her looks is as under control as anyone’s. (“We all have our moments,” she says.) She enjoys fashion, and attended the Met Gala last year wearing a custom veil featuring the notation of a favourite Bach classical piece. She can’t remember which violin fugue it was in the moment and pulls up the Spotify app on her phone. “It was this,” she says, as a delicate composition tinnily plays. “But it’s on guitar for some reason.” That won’t do. “Come on, violin!” she whoops, scrolling on.Laufey hopes that someone will be doing the same thing with her music a few centuries from now. “I think often about how artists in the past were not led by external sources,” she says. “Ella Fitzgerald wasn’t putting a 20-second clip of her new song out and having people read it to filth. I try so hard to not let [social media] shape my art.”View image in fullscreenDress to impress … Laufey at the Met Gala in 2024.Photograph: Gotham/Getty ImagesI wonder if that’s a challenge, given that social media has helped to power her fairytale rise since the very beginning. “Honestly” – her voice drops to a whisper – “I love it. I literally have a career because an audience on social media showed me there was a space for the type of music I make. I know that if I had gone to a label six years ago and said: ‘I’m going to make music that’s a mix of jazz and classical and about my own experiences, and I’m gonna play arenas one day,’ they would have said, ‘Bullshit.’ They would not have put a dollar down on my name.“I don’t know what miracle happened that I get to have this career,” she says. She’s determined to make every moment of it count. She drains the last of her iced coffee and heads off to a fitting for her upcoming tour. After that, she’ll go to Electric Lady Studios to work on more music – no matter that her new album isn’t even out on the day we speak. She jumps into a car with blacked-out windows, nattering away to her assistant in Icelandic. I can’t understand what she is saying, but it sounds like Laufey is planning her next move.A Matter of Time isout now.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockTikTokJazzinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The Guardian, no less, has called it one of the “finest station eateries in Europe”.An alternative pre-departure option for drinks and dinner isBistro Berlagein the undercroft of the formerBeurs(stock exchange), seven minutes walk from the station.View image in fullscreenThe Grand Café Restaurant 1e Klas in Amsterdam Centraal.Photograph: Greg Balfour Evans/AlamyThis can be a frustrating station, with fierce ticket barriers guarding platform access (luggage lockers in the east wing from €10 per day). It gets another black mark for the lack of showers for passengers arriving on overnight trains, but a big plus for being at the very heart of the city it serves – its enchanted canal network is right outside the station.Just head south from the station to hit the main sights. If, like me, you prefer to cut away from the crowds, then leave the station on the north side and hop on the F4 ferry for a free 15-minute ride to theNSDM Wharf, an old shipyard that is now a creative and cultural hub with many alt-vibe cafes.Berlin HauptbahnhofView image in fullscreenA stroll by the Spree River is an ideal prelude for a long distance train journey from Berlin.Photograph: John Kellerman/AlamyFor ÖBB Nightjets toBasel, Graz, Paris, Vienna and Zurich;SJ/RDCorSnälltågettoStockholm;MÁV EuronighttoBratislava, Prague and Budapest;European Sleeper toAmsterdam and Brussels; and, from later this year,PKPICnight sleepers toChelmandPrzemyślin eastern PolandA multi-level essay in glass with a striking vaulted roof, the station is on five levels, with level 0 in the middle and trains departing/arriving on levels -2 and +2 – all utterly confusing for a first-timer.

Or go two stops south on the U1 to Reumannplatz to cleanse the body in art deco elegance at thewonderful Amelienbad indoor pool– a triumph of progressive socialist design.

Power porridge and avocado toast go down a treat after a night on the rails, as do all sorts of shakes and juices. For pre-departure supper, tryMaru,a little oasis of Japan on level 2 of the shopping complex under the station serving matcha and “Japanese comfort food”.I love Zurich for its small-town feel.

These crunchy batons of firm, creamy fish in soft white bread, often topped with a tangy sauce, are surely the UK equivalent of Mexican fish tacos or West African fish rolls – a quick, nutritious and very satisfying light meal or snack.View image in fullscreenSigne Johansen’s sandwich uses readymade fish fingers. All thumbnail photographs by Felicity Cloake.(NB: if you’re skim-reading this before leaping below the line to demand to know who needs a recipe for a fish finger sandwich, I can assure you a lot of people online seem to feel there’s a demand.) Given their popularity (indeed, this column was a reader request), I must echoHelen Graves, who prefaces her recipe thus: “I am bracing myself for the comeback on this one, because everyone (or at least everyone in the UK) has an opinion on what makes the perfect fish finger sandwich.” As ever, all feedback much appreciated!The fishThe classic and, of course, the easiest choice is to use readymade fish fingers,as Signe Johansen recommendsin her book Solo. For some, nostalgia makes this the only option, and I certainly wouldn’t knock it; modern fish fingers tend to be much chunkier than the weedy grey sticks of my childhood, in which the filling always looked mysteriously ready-chewed.However, there are advantages to making your own, principally that you can choose your own fish and precision engineer the coating. Most recipes I find call for cod or haddock, or both if you’re Graves, but Edinburgh’s Little Chartroom chef Roberta Hall McCarronuses sole, and north London “sandwich genius” (I quote About Time magazine)Max Halleythrows the door wide open, writing inMax’s Sandwich Bookthat “cod is back in vogue, but who knows? Haddock? Whiting and sole would be delicious”.View image in fullscreenHelen Graves salts her fish before making the fish fingers, which she then coats in panko breadcrumbs for extra crunch.As so often with fish, the best option is generally the one that looks freshest on the day, and is most sustainable. My preference, however, if it’s available, is for anything that comes in thick fillets, because I find the sole and the end of one of the haddock fillets too thin: it throws off the ratio of fish to crumb. Go for whatever fits the bill, though – I suspect hake would be an excellent choice.Graves salts the fish for half an hour before cooking, “to firm up the texture, so what you get is really satisfying flakes of well-seasoned fish, not mushiness”. Though they’re rinsed afterwards, I like the way this seasons the dish from the inside out, but I actually prefer the softer texture of fish salted just before cooking – it shouldn’t be mushy. If you have similar textural objections, however, this is a step you may like to consider.The coatingI’m relieved to find that no one batters their fish fingers; this is not a fish supper in portable form, but flour, egg and breadcrumb territory. Graves, Hall McCarron and Halley all plump for panko, the large flaked, white, ultra-crisp Japanese variety that’s taken the western crumbing world by storm in recent years; onlyKirsty Scobie and Fenella Renwick, proprietors of Ullapool’s Seafood Shack and authors of an award-winning book of the same name,recommendthe fluffier kind made from fresh bread.For me, all breadcrumbed fish is delicious, but for this purpose I slightly prefer the crunchier texture of fried panko – if I were baking the fish, I suspect I might go for fresh crumbs instead, because dry breadcrumbs will inevitably become even dryer in the heat of the oven. (Home-dried breadcrumbs would, of course, be a perfectly acceptable substitute.)Flavour-wise, you could just stick to salt and pepper, as Halley does, or you could capitalise on the freedom of making your own to spice things up a bit. The Seafood Shack chefs suggest chopped fresh herbs such as parsley and dill, while Graves describes her mix of panko and cayenne pepper as “super-crisp with just a tiny bit of warmth”, before going on to explain: “We also added a titchy pinch of MSG because we like to live on the edge in this house. That’s totally optional, just as long as you know that being scared of MSG is pointless.” Hall McCarron, meanwhile, mixes her panko with blitzed oats and pumpkin seeds, then flavours them with garlic and onion powder and nutritional yeast, on the basis that, as she points out in her bookThe Changing Tides: “You can’t go wrong with a fish finger sandwich. And you certainly can’t go wrong when the fish is coated in breadcrumbs and yeast flakes.”View image in fullscreenSaucy! Max Halley’s salad cream and tomato ketchup-embellished fish finger sandwichAll of these are very valid options – my testers and I particularly like the savoury notes that the yeast and MSG bring with them. And, though I haven’t included them in my recipe, I’d also urge you to give the pumpkin seeds in particular a go; they give the crumb an interestingly nubbly texture.The saucesPersonally, like Scobie and Renwick, I’m a tartare girl; the combination of rich mayonnaise cut with acidic pickles, savoury alliums (they use shallots, I like chives) and salty capers is perfect with fried fish. It seems, however, that this is not the will of the people – Graves describes tartare as “the fancypants choice” (guilty as charged, Helen), explaining that the key to a perfect fish finger sandwich “is to use a mayonnaise-based sauceandketchup. I know. You are reeling,” she continues kindly. “The reason it works is because the ketchup offers something I was always missing in the fish finger sandwich: sweetness. People tend to go OTT on the acidity, I find, adding lemon juice, capers, vinegar et al, but let me tell you once more – double-sauce is where it’s at.”Halley agrees, but he uses salad cream (a mayonnaise-adjacent sauce, I suppose?), describing the mix of that and ketchup as “SO good”. Mind you, he goes on to boast about blending a whole pork pie in the stuff to make a dip, so he’s definitely a salad cream superfan, whereas it reminds me of early 1990s school lunches, and not in a good way, I’m afraid.Halley boasts about blending a whole pork pie in the stuff to make a dip, so he’s definitely a salad cream superfanConfession time: I find ketchup too sweet and vinegary in most contexts – like chocolate, it’s a flavour bully, dominating everything it touches – but I’m well aware this is a minority opinion. My own second choice is Johansen’s punchy green Nordic dill salsa, which also contains parsley, anchovies, gherkins, capers, horseradish, lemon juice and olive oil. “Admittedly,” she writes, “a good old fish finger sarnie tastes incredible with just a good squirt of ketchup, but once in a while I like a fresh green sauce to grace those crispy little fish sticks. This dill salsa is a great way of using up any odds and ends you have in the fridge – such as sad, forgotten herbs, condiments and pickles. Treat the recipe as a guide and please do play around with the flavours to make it your own.”Lest you be in any doubt that ketchup is not the only choice available, Hall McCarron gilds her fish finger sandwich with a two-ingredient roasted garlic mayonnaise, bringing back happy holiday memories of mountains of fried seafood dunked inaïoli. No doubt most of you will probably shake your head at such notions, but don’t knock them until you’ve tried them.The extrasGraves favours the cool crunch of iceberg lettuce, while Halley prefers the oily one of crumbledScampi Fries(a particularly noxious, yet undeniably moreish brand of pub snack, for readers outside the UK). Hall McCarron makes a celeriac and butternut squash slaw flavoured with crushed wakame, which delivers crunch and a more subtle touch of the sweetness that Graves feels is missing without ketchup (it is also much less work than it sounds (grate both vegetables, add salt and seaweed powder).View image in fullscreenThe addition of minty peas make Fenella Renwick and Kirsty Scobie’s fish finger sandwich the catch of the day.My favourite extra, however, is theSeafoodShack’s minty peas: frozen petits pois, blitzed with mint and lemon juice, which brings sweetness, freshness, and comforting echoes of my childhood (not that we pureed them). As this is not your childhood, you should feel free to replace it, or indeed eschew any sort of garnish as an unnecessary complication of what should be a simple pleasure.The cookingIf you’re using bought fish fingers, baking is the way to go; it’s classic and low-faff. If you’re making your own fish fingers, however, I regretfully share the ill tidings that the baked versions are a poor second to the fried variety, and drier inside and out. You don’t need to deep-fry them, though; a few centimetres of oil in a frying pan will do the job, and if you’re going to the trouble of making your own fish fingers, you may as well cook them right, too.The sandwich breadView image in fullscreenBaptastic: Roberta Hall McCarron’s fish finger sandwich.When I see that more than half the recipes call for toasted bread, I begin to question everything I thought I knew about fish finger sarnies – surely most of the pleasure comes from the contrast in textures between bread and filling? For this reason, I will only countenance soft, fluffy white bread (a white tin loaf from my local bakery for me, though you may well be in the Halley Mother’s Pride camp). Or, Hall McCarron’s white roll would work (she mentions brioche, but I think a bap would be nicer). You can fight me on this in the comments; I won’t change my mind – though I will make an allowance for Johansen’s happy suggestion that: “If you’ve had a really rotten day, or spent it doing seriously strenuous exercise, fry the bread in butter”. That I might come round to.Perfect fish finger sandwichesPrep25 minCook8 minServes4For the tartare sauce (or use ketchup and/or mayonnaise)200g mayonnaise, bought or homemade1 tsp dijon mustard1 heaped tbsp chopped capers1 heaped tbsp chopped cornichons, or other vinegary gherkins1 heaped tbsp chopped parsley, or dill½ tbsp chopped chivesFor the fish fingers (or use eight ready made)2 skinless fillets thick white fish(about 400g) – eg, cod, hake, haddockSalt and pepper50g plain flour2 eggs125g panko breadcrumbs, or other dried breadcrumbs20g nutritional yeast flakes, or ½ tsp MSG powder (optional)Neutral oil, for frying8 slices good soft white bread, or 4 soft white rollsButter, at room temperatureFor the minty pea puree200g frozen peas1 small bunch fresh mint, leaves picked½ tbsp lemon juice1 tsp horseradish sauce(optional)View image in fullscreenStir all the ingredients for the tartare sauce in a bowl, then adjust and season to taste.

A few months ago, however, Suffolk’s food capital welcomed a soupçon of fancy-pants Spain in the form ofBellotaon Churchgate Street, not far from the abbey. Bellota bills itself as offering an “elevated tasting menu” (seven courses, and eight at weekends) and boasts only a maximum of 20 seats, all of them lined up around a counter overlooking married chefs Ruben Aquilar Bel and Gabriella Fogarasi at work.On its website, Bellota promises to be “relaxed and welcoming”, which before going I severely doubted, because tasting menus rarely are: “I found the chef’s 657-word soliloquy on artichoåkes very relaxing,” said no one ever. However, on entering the restaurant on a recent Saturday and finding a room hewn in a rhapsody of calm browns and golds, and Fogarasi herself greeting us at the door, well, Bellota actually felt rather zen. There is a cosiness here that doesn’t at all feel like your average flash-harry fine-dining metropolitan joint. On a sold-out night of two sittings, there were a mere four staff working all evening. There were no hostesses leading us 40 steps to our seats, no pushy sommeliers, no kitchens stuffed with staff ostentatiously shouting, “Oui, chef!”View image in fullscreen‘Not remotely amateur-hour’: Bellota’s hake with squid ink, salsa verde and padrón pepper.Bellota is homespun, sure, but it’s not remotely amateur-hour, and the meal service is gloriously well honed. Within mere moments of us taking our seats, warm loaves of Fogarasi’s sourdough bread appeared in cute hessian bags and with a glut of salted butter; we were offered more bread throughout the meal, just in case the tasting-menu portion sizes weren’t already sating enough. As Aquilar Bel talked earnestly about the txakoli he’d paired with his hake in salsa verde and escalivada vegetable raviolo, a satisfied hum of Suffolk folk eating good bread and butter enveloped the room.Bellota’s genesis has been financed byLinda Keenan, who has connections to London’s well-lovedNoble Rotandthe Clove Club, and, although dissecting something as grubby as money is unappetising, her golden touch matters. Bellota may well be the brainwave of two relatively unknown chefs and tucked away in a quaint West Suffolk market town, but there’s something hugely beguiling going on here, and even verging on swaggering.View image in fullscreen‘Yes, you heard that right’: Bellota’s Thai green curry ice-cream with confit apricots and pistachio cake.From the first snacks of hot, crisp, truffled croquetas – better than many I’ve tasted even in Spain – moving on to that masterful al dente raviolo stuffed with roast sweet red pepper and aubergine with just a touch of sherry vinegar, all dressed in a heavenly manchego sauce, it’s clear that this is a restaurant without so much as a hint of naivety.A hunk of south-west coast hake is crisscrossed with sombre-looking squid ink and served with a fiery green pepper sauce, a piece of grilled langoustine, a padrón pepper and a few palourde clams. Next, rare slices of Creedy Carver duck on a silky puree of heritage carrots with a slick of rich duck jus. Each dish, as we finish it with a sigh, is swept away and replaced like clockwork with something else sticky, rich or magnificent. The chefs move purposefully and in relative silence, with no flapping, no fussing, no shouting and no underlings locked in the walk-in freezer for “banter”. Just fabulous food. How very modern indeed.Bellota opened three months ago, and without much fanfare. Curious locals turned up, word of mouth spread, then people began travelling from around Suffolk, followed by the down-from-London brigade, me included. Twelve or so short weeks later, Bury St Edmunds’ residents – or the ones I met in the local shops, anyway – are now lamenting that they hadn’t booked sooner, and in the forlorn tones that are usually reserved for the likes ofNoma’s summer season tables. After eating at Bellota, I now feel bad for them, too, because this small, almost perfect joint will most likely win a Michelin star very soon, and then it’ll be bonne chance for anyone wanting to try Gabi’s Thai green curry ice-cream with warm pistachio cake and confit apricots. Yes, you read that right: I did say Thai green curry ice-cream. And, yes, it works. Don’t try this at home, people.View image in fullscreenBellota’s ‘tantalising’ pre-dessert of goat’s cheese, walnuts and membrillo sorbet.In fact, all the sweet things here are done wonderfully, including the tantalising pre-dessert of monte enebro goat’s cheese with candied walnuts and glossy membrillo sorbet; rumour tells me there’s sometimes sourdough ice-cream, too. There are also some very good petits four, including immaculate black olive bonbons with a sweet tapenade filling.
