For some it was a “masterclass” in dealing with mainstream media, but for others it was “rude, dismissive, misogynistic, arrogant”.Behind the scenes, Farage’s treatment of the Financial Times’s Anna Gross – which was met with mirth and applause among Reform diehards in the room – provoked disquiet and anger among lobby journalists across the political spectrum.As the Reform UK leader was leaving the event, a Guardian political reportersuggested he had been rudeand had upset the journalist. “Good,” Farage responded.It is not the first time Farage has been accused of patronising a female journalist. When the former BBC Radio 4 Today presenter Mishal Husain asked him about the potential consequences of shooting down Russian planes last October, Farage responded:“Listen love, you’re trying ever so hard.”A month later heaccused the Telegraph’s Camilla Tomineyof playing a “silly little game” when she asked who his chancellor would be.Amid a busy news cycle, his most recent condescension could have been easily forgotten. But in a week where Farage hired a hardline anti-abortion theologian as his head of policy and promised torepeal the Equality Acton his party’s first day in government, it has sparked the question: does Reform UK, and its leader in particular, have a women problem?Jane Martinson, the former chair ofWomenin Journalism, said the run-ins with female journalists were a clear example of Donald Trump’s influence.“Nigel Farage is really offering a sort of Trump-lite for the British people, patronising a respected journalist and newspaper because he disagrees with its scrutiny,” she said. “This is all about ignoring the public’s right to know and trying to control your own message by turning on the messenger, especially if they’re just ‘silly’ women.”Reproductive rights and equality campaigners reacted in horror after Faragehired James Orr, a rightwing theologian who opposes abortion even in cases of rape, incest or serious risk to health, to replace Zia Yusuf as his head of policy. The Cambridge University professor, who heads the Centre for a Better Britain thinktank, is an influential figure in Trump’s administration and is admired by the vice-president, JD Vance, who once described him as his “British sherpa”.Kerry Abel, the chair of Abortion Rights, said it was “an alarming moment for Britain” and accused Farage of “borrowing tactics from America’s culture wars”, especially in relation to anti-abortion ideology.The hire came a little over a week after Matt Goodwin, Reform UK’s candidate in the Gorton and Denton byelection, was accused of wanting a“Handmaid’s Tale future”after unearthed YouTube footage revealed he had called for “young girls and women” to be given a “biological reality” check.For Heejung Chung, the director of theKing’s Global Institute for Women’s Leadership, Farage’s rhetoric around – and treatment of – women is part of a worrying trend that delegitimises discussion of gender inequality and women’s rights in a way that was “unthinkable” even five years ago.“It feels like a consistent and deliberate tactic,” she said. “I don’t think it’s that he’s an old-fashioned guy with questionable views, he wants to distract people into thinking their problems are because of women, or equality and diversity policies, or immigrants. Like Trump in America, it shifts the discourse, and that is very dangerous.”There are signs that Labour, and others on the left, are willing to meet Farage on this battlefield. On Thursday, Keir Starmer said plans to repeal the Equality Act, which gives women extra protection in the workplace, were“shocking” and unBritish, arguing that Reform wanted to send women back to the “old days”.Stella Creasy, the Labour MP for Walthamstow, described the attack on the 2010 legislation as “calculating, playbook, rage-bait politics” and bad economic policy. “The Equality Act gives the labour market more talent, which is good for productivity and good for growth,” she said. “What this is about is saying: ‘Here’s somebody to blame for why the world isn’t fair.’ It is not saying: ‘How do we fix it?’”Paul Nowak, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, called for a united front against the “nasty thread of misogyny” running throughReform UK. Farage was also a political risk, he said, noting that “Reform have already got a problem with women voters”.While it is true that Reform voters have skewed heavily male, there has been a shift. In the last election, 61% of voters who voted Reform UK were men, but on voting intention in 2026 that figure had dropped to 55%, according to polling from More In Common.Luke Tryl, More in Common’s executive director, said there was a “Reform seesaw” among women who expressed support for the party, with those in focus groups voicing concerns about the risk of backing Farage, while also showing interest in the radical change they thought his party could bring.Farage should be wary of comparisons to the US president, with polling showing that 25% of women considered Farage’s support for Trump as the top reason not to vote Reform, compared with 21% of men.Farage may also want to consider how he treats journalists at future press conferences. “Rudeness is a sort of thing that people do notice,” Tryl said. “It’s a sort of thing which, if it becomes a pattern, could go down badly. If you think about that seesaw, it’s all weighing down the side which says ‘this is too much of a risk’.”Asked for comment, a Reform UK spokesperson said: “Nigel Farage treats all journalists equally. Scrutiny is a two-way street.”Explore more on these topicsNigel FarageReform UKWomenanalysisShareReuse this content"

I started experimenting with mirror selfies, and spent whole evenings trying to take artful photographs of my own bum. I agonised over my three-line bio. I even put a notebook by my bed with the Hinge prompt “most spontaneous thing I’ve done” written on the first page, so if the answer came to me in a dream, I’d have a pen and paper handy.I’d spent my early 30s trying to cling on to a failing relationship, which had made me feel stuck in a holding pattern. As if I was fated to have a slightly different version of the same argument every night until I was dead. The thrill of scrolling on Hinge, when I first started dating, was that it felt like shopping for an alternate future. I’d pore over pictures of men cradling small dogs and swinging tennis rackets, and get high on the thought of all the tiny dogs and tennis games we would enjoy together. I started hiding my phone in a cupboard in the kitchen before I went to sleep, because when I kept it in my room, I could feel all my new lives calling to me. Sometimes, when I got up to hide it, I had motion sickness from scrolling so hard and so fast.When I went out on in-person dates, they weren’t always as fun as my fantasies. The flesh-and-blood men I met in pubs usually seemed smaller and less substantial than their 2D profile photos. I often got the sense I didn’t quite live up to the Hinge me, either. My real voice always sounded so much louder and less sultry than my voice notes. Once I asked a man whether I could kiss him, and he said, “I’m good, thanks”, as though I had offered him a crisp.Another man asked me who else I had on my “roster” for the week – the implication being that we both had our own private harems of partners whom we wined-and-dined on rotation. And in a sense, I did have my own private phone-harem. Maybe if I’d been more relaxed and carefree – more like the Hinge me – I could have casually spent time with lots of different partners, without compulsively mapping out our whole lives together. But there is a voice in my head that talks to me about house deposits and declining egg counts. I am embarrassed by this voice, but I can’t seem to drown it out.double quotation markI keep swiping, convinced that my husband is hiding from me in the next Hinge drop – just one more click awayIt has become a cliche to say that dating apps aren’t working. Almost1.4 million people left the UK’s top 10 dating appsbetween 2023-4, and Hinge alone lost 131,000 users. I organise the Guardian’sBlind Datecolumn, and every month I receive hundreds of emails telling me that dating apps are broken. Interestingly, many applicants frame the crisis as a peculiarly British problem. Recently, a woman wrote to me saying she couldn’t swipe any more because she had “completed the whole of England on Hinge”.Perhaps part of the issue is that here in the UK we still place so much emphasis on finding a life partner. In England and Wales, more than70% of people aged 30-64 are in committed relationships, so as a single person I feel abnormal. Finding a partner is also a financial necessity. The average person can’t afford rent – let alone a mortgage deposit – on their own. Since the explosion of Tinder in 2013, it has been possible to swipe through hundreds of potential partners in a single hour. Faced with so much choice, the rational thing to do would be to pursue many different short-lived love affairs in the course of one lifetime. But finding lasting commitment is still so central to what constitutes a worthwhile life in the UK that I keep swiping, convinced that my husband is hiding from me in the next Hinge drop – just one more click away.In the interests of broadening my horizons, I have spent three months investigating whether other cultures might be doing love more successfully. In the UK, we talk about the hopelessness of dating as though it were some kind of foregone conclusion. But what if it doesn’t have to be this way? Curious about whether other European cultures might be more sophisticated – or clear-eyed – in their approach to romance, I spoke to anthropologists, sex therapists and dating specialists in Berlin, Paris, Oslo and Rome. The dating styles detailed below aren’t meant to represent whole cities. But by speaking to people from various countries, I got an insight into how things are done outside of Britain, giving me a much-needed fresh perspective.‘Everyone is polyamorous here’BerlinA friend called me recently to say that if she ever wanted a monogamous relationship again, she would have to move cities, “because everyone is polyamorous in Berlin”. Interested in testing this theory, I contact the anthropologist Dr Fabian Broeker, who published a2023 study of dating app users in the German capital. Broeker, who is a fellow at the London School of Economics, tells me his research suggests that in Berlin, dating is no longer “necessarily tied to the traditional understanding of finding a long-term partner”. Instead, it has evolved into a kind of “leisure activity” – something you do purely for fun, like taking an afternoon stroll. You might have sex with three different people in one week, with zero expectations of seeing any of your dates ever again. And this wouldn’t be seen as abnormal.Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the city has been associated with sexual freedom. Klaus Wowereit, a former mayor of Berlin, famously called the city “poor but sexy” in 2003. More thanhalf of Berliners live in single-person households, according to data from 2024, which means that being single puts you in the majority, unlike in London, where coupledom is the norm. Maxi Wallenhorst, a Berlin-based cultural critic, tells me that Berlin’s hedonistic approach to intimacy is made possible, in part, by its rental market. “Even though the housing crisis is escalating here, too, there is less pressure to fall in love in order to save rent.”Some, like my friend, can find the city’s determinedly casual approach to dating frustrating. TikTok is awash with (mostly British) expats posting about how impossible it is to lock down a boyfriend. But Wallenhorst points out that even though Berlin is a “capital of non-monogamy”, it “doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s impossible to find commitment”. Commitment just has a different meaning in Berlin. When you want to have a baby, you might decide to do that with a best friend, rather than a partner. Or you could become part of a “power quadruple” and have three different, equally devoted boyfriends. In Berlin, you don’t need to find a partner to be seen as complete, or to make yourself financially solvent – romance is more like a nice add-on to an already fully functioning life.‘The most romantic thing you can have? Great sex and intellectual connection’ParisBerlin might be the capital of non-monogamy, but in Paris, “polyamory” is a dirty word. I call the author Alice Pfeiffer to ask whether her city’s reputation as the home of the ménage à trois is justified. She tells me that using the word “polyamory” is considered gauche – not because Parisians are faithful, but because it robs infidelity of its transgressive thrill. “People cheat; they just don’t talk about it,” Pfeiffer explains. “Cheating is a national sport.”The journalist Barbara Krief tells me the Parisian attitude towards monogamy is part of a larger cultural emphasis on passion. She says that among the 30- to 40-year-old Parisians she encounters, many see infidelity as something that can improve your marriage. “I can’t speak for the whole of Paris, but the people I know wait until the kids have grown up a bit, and then they seek passion outside their relationship.” You don’t stop having sex with your husband or wife when you start an affair – your marriage ticks on as usual. It is just understood, without needing to be explicitly expressed, “that you can have flings or crushes and it doesn’t jeopardise the relationship”.UK statistics suggest thatmen cheat more frequently than women, but Krief tells me that sexually, “Parisian women seek romantic pleasure in a way that is associated with the male sex drive.” My experience is that in London, the woman still expects to wait until the second or third meeting to have sex. If I’m really honest with myself, I wonder whether I still think that by having sex with a man I am giving away one of my limited assets, and making myself too vulnerable to being hurt. Krief says that among her circle of friends, no woman will ever deny herself sex if she wants it. “They would say that not sleeping with a man they want to sleep with just because it’s the first date is wasting their time – because they like sex and they want to get their pleasure.” Krief, who is queer, says all the lesbians she knows think nothing of having sex on the first date, too. “We always see these British women in Paris wearing tiny dresses and we think – are they not cold? But I bet they are not as promiscuous as French women. A French woman will be wearing sweatpants, but she will go down on you on the first date.”Perhaps the Parisian dating style can be explained in terms of French art and culture, in which marriage isn’t necessarily seen as a happy ending. “Our movies and books do not end with marriage,” Krief says. Marriage and partnership is conceptualised as one part of an evolving story, rather than a crowning achievement. “French movies give us the sense that the most romantic thing you can have is not marriage – it’s great sex and intellectual connection. And not just with one person. You can have it with more than one!”View image in fullscreenIllustration: Javi Aznarez/The Guardian‘You try to keep an exit door open’OsloIn Oslo, sex tends to happen more quickly. According to Julien S Bourrelle, cross-cultural expert and author of The Social Guidebook to Norway, sex is seen as much less intimate than having a dinner date, or even going for coffee with a love interest. “You meet in a bar, go home together, and then meet again in town the next weekend and have sex again.” Only after people have had casual sex a few times might they start to consider taking the next step and going on a date. “It’s the inverse of the romantic American or Italian way, where, as a man, you would try to court the woman with coffees and dinners.”Bourrelle puts Oslo’s dating culture down to an emphasis on independence. You never want to make anyone feel indebted to you, so you try to “keep an exit door open” for yourself and your lover during the early stages of a relationship. “If I were to pay for your coffee, then subconsciously you would owe me something – so in order to preserve that independence, we will refrain from paying for others,” he says.Bourrelle doesn’t see this insistence on an “exit door” as commitment-phobic, but as a sign of Norwegians’ excessive empathy. He said Norwegians are reluctant to “inflict pain”, so are careful to avoid making their sexual partners feel trapped, and conversely, try not to lead their lovers on, because they fear inflicting the “pain of rejection”.Norwegian culture is fiercely egalitarian. Men and women receive equal pay and are expected to perform similar roles in the home and in wider society, but interestingly, women seem to have the power when it comes to dating. Bourrelle tells me it is typically the woman, not the man, who will hold her partner at arm’s length until she is “100% sure she wants to commit”. The woman is also more fearful of being too effusive when she first starts sleeping with a man, because she doesn’t want to hurt his feelings if she changes her mind further down the line. I still expect the man to make the first move, or send the first text after we have gone on a date. If I really dig into it, I suppose my assumption is that being a man, he will be somehow inherently stronger and less easily wounded by rejection than me – but in Oslo’s dating culture, it is the man’s feelings that need to be protected.In Norway, they have even developed a specific mating ritual to ensure the “exit door” remains open. Bourrelle tells me it is typical for a woman to identify a man she finds attractive in a bar and then pretend to bump into him. So instead of saying hello directly, or offering to buy the man a drink, she will gently shoulder-barge the object of her affections to get their attention. If you don’t find one another attractive at close quarters, you just apologise for the “accidental” knock and walk away. The thought of shoulder-barging someone in a London pub sounds rather appealing. The woman makes the approach, but you both have plausible deniability. No one has to get rejected at all.‘Couples on a first date always look elegant’RomeIn Rome, the dating culture is much more formal. Donatella Fiacchino, a psychologist and clinical sexologist, tells me it is still routine for a woman to get her hair done and maybe even buy a new outfit before a date. “I can usually tell when a couple are on a first date, not just because they seem nervous, but because they will look very elegant and the woman will be wearing full makeup,” she says. Typically, the woman will get a wax in advance of the big day. “She will even wax her forearms.”Fiacchino is careful to stress that “Rome is like an onion; it has layers”, so attitudes towards dating can vary drastically between districts. The southern parts of the city are less conservative, whereas in the north, there are “very stereotypical gender roles within straight couples”. The man is expected to pay the bill, or at least offer, and to make the initial approach. In London, it is extremely rare to have a stranger ask you out in the street or at a bar, because we’ve outsourced the pursuit of love to apps. Intimacy is now something we look for privately – and often frantically – in the dead of night on our phones. But in Rome, according to Fiacchino, it is still common for singles to ask each other out in public, although the onus is on the man.The man is expected to take the initiative when it comes to sex, too, Fiacchino says – but because singles in Rome tend to live in multigenerational households, finding a place to have sex can be rather complicated. Almost70% of 18- to 34-year-olds live with their parentsin Italy, according to 2023 data, and rents are rising in Rome, making independent living more difficult. Fiacchino says she treats many patients who live in multigenerational households and have developed sexual dysfunctions, such as an inability to reach orgasm, that are partially related to the lack of privacy.Sexual constraints aside, Romans do seem better than the British at savouring romantic moments. Marina Iakovleva, who specialises in cultural differences and hosts the YouTube channelDating Beyond Borders, tells me that Romans place emphasis on choosing a “romantic place” and creating a “beautiful environment” during a date. Whereas in London it is typical to down three pints not for pleasure but to cope with the pressure of a first date, Romans will meet for an “aperitivo” and drink moderately. Stefano Petrella, a gay Roman journalist I speak to, says when he dates in other European cities, it is typical for men to ask to meet him directly at his hotel, so they can have sex immediately, but that “would never happen in Rome; you would always have aperitivo”. Even the most casual encounters have a sense of occasion.Recently, I met someone I like, and I can already see myself behaving in a way that feels horribly British. I wait for him to text first, because I am frightened of putting myself out there. In the very beginning, I would have a minimum of four drinks every time we met up, because I wanted to drown out the nerves. I am also having difficulty stopping myself projecting decades into the future. I’m fantasising and also panicking about the next 25 years, rather than just living in the moment.It probably isn’t fair to blame my problems on my nationality, and I should take responsibility for my own neuroses. But there is also something freeing about seeing my dating habits as culturally determined. If the way I pursue love isn’t some kind of innate, inevitable quirk of my personality, then maybe I can change. If I could cherrypick from other European dating styles, I would like to be able to assume I have the power, like the women in Oslo, and learn to savour the moment, like the Romans. Most of all I’d like to try to be more French, and stop thinking about marriage as some kind of perfect happy ending.It will never work. I reckon I’m too far gone.

But in order to thrive, museums need sustainable, long-term public funding to help meet the annual costs of keeping the doors open and welcoming everyone to our public collections,” she said.The UK is an outlier among leading cultural nations in not charging at the door. France’s Louvre charges £28 for entry, Spain’s Prado £13, the US’s Museum of Modern Art £22, and the Vatican Museums £17.Against that backdrop, a growing number of senior museum figures – some of whom once supported free entry – have begun to argue that the policy may no longer be fit for purpose.They include Nick Merriman, the former leader of the Horniman Museum & Gardens and English Heritage, whotold the Daily Telegraphlast week that while free entry had driven up visitor numbers, it had done little to diversify audiences. “You just get more middle-class people going,” he said. “In principle, why not charge? Most people, for the national museums, are willing to pay.”Roy Clare, the former head of Royal Museums Greenwich, called for a “more sophisticated approach”, arguing that free access did not need to apply “24/7 or 365”.View image in fullscreenThe Royal Observatory, part of the Royal Museums Greenwich, London.Photograph: AaronP/Bauer-Griffin/GC ImagesMark Jones, the former director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, and interim director of the British Museum from 2023 to 24, described universal free entry as “regressive and inequitable”. He has said that taxpayers on modest incomes are subsidising access for tourists who can afford to pay, while charging could also help alleviate overcrowding.Writing in the Art Newspaper, the art critic and historian Ben Lewis said it was time to “dump the British art world’s gold-plated, diamond-encrusted sacred cow” and introduce entrance fees.The debate is unfolding against a stark financial backdrop. Between 2010 and 2023, core funding for UK arts and cultural organisations fell by 18%. In its latest survey, the Museums Association found61% of respondents were planning service cuts in 2024–25.At the Tate,staff staged a seven-day strikelast year in response to repeated restructures, redundancies and below-inflation pay rises, with some workers reporting they had to use food banks.View image in fullscreenStaff at the Tate Britain on strike last autumn.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianNoel McClean, of the Prospect union, which represents workers at the National Gallery, National Portrait Gallery, and Tate, said workers were “bearing the brunt” of the crisis. “If nothing is done, drastic action may follow,” he warned. “There are already fears that free access could be at risk – yet it is vital for social, economic and educational purposes.”While national museums remain free for now, many regional and independent institutionshave already begun chargingwhere entry was once free, including the Kettle’s Yard in Cambridge.

Not only that, the policy they struck down is Trump’s signature economic policy – he has used tariffs to bash, lord over and terrorize dozens of other countries and make himself the King of the Economic Jungle.In the court’s main opinion,joined bythree conservative justices and three liberals, chief justice John Roberts used some sharp language to slap down Trump’s tariffs, writing that the constitution specifically gives Congress, not the president, the power to impose taxes and tariffs. (Roberts notedthat tariffs are indeed taxes.)Roberts added that Trump had misinterpreted the law he invoked to impose tariffs against more than 80 countries, noting that the law – the International Emergency Emergency Powers Act –doesn’t mentionthe word tariffs even once as it lays out numerous ways presidents can regulate imports. Roberts added that if Congress had wanted to give presidents the power to impose tariffs under that law, it would have specifically said so.In the tariffs case,Learning Resources Inc v Trump,Roberts seemed appalled at the extraordinary powers Trump had seized to impose whatever tariffs he wanted at any amount he wanted against any country he wanted. Roberts wrote that “the President asserts the extraordinary power to unilaterally impose tariffs of unlimited amount, duration, and scope” and that under the administration’s reading of the law, “the President is unconstrained by the significant procedural limitations in other tariff statutes and free to issue a dizzying array of modifications at will.”Over the past year, the court’s six-person conservative supermajority has ruled in Trump’s favor in aremarkably high percentage of shadow docket cases– letting Trumpgut the Department of Education, letting Icestop people based on their ethnicity, letting Trumprefuse to spend appropriated USAID funds, letting the Pentagondischarge transgender service members.After all that water-carrying for Trump, it’s encouraging to see the court stand up to him and trumpet in the tariff case that Trump was interpreting laws in implausible, illogical ways in order to use his executive powers to the max. It would be good, for instance, if the court similarly rules that Trump is interpreting the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 in implausible, illogical ways when heseeks to deport Venezuelan immigrantswithout due process, even though that act applies only when the US isfacing an armed, organized attack.Soon after the tariff ruling was issued, Trump quickly slandered and savaged the justices who had ruled against him. “They’re just beingfools and lapdogs” for political opponents, including “the radical left Democrats”, he said. “They’re very unpatriotic and disloyal to our constitution. It’s my opinion that the court has been swayed by foreign interests.”Trump also said the justices who ruled against him were a “disgrace to our nation” and that he was “ashamed of” them “not having the courage to do what’s right for our country”. Trump beat up mercilessly on the six justices who ruled against him, including conservatives Roberts, Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch, even those three hadruled for Trump about 80%of the time in shadow docket cases, many of them highly controversial and contentious.After Trump insulted the justices and whipped up Maga loyalists against them, let’s hope the justices will be more motivated to put their Trump sycophancy behind him and be more emboldened to rule against him. When will the justices admit to themselves that they shouldn’t be so quick to defer to Trump and shouldn’t rush to give him more power under the “unitary executive theory”, considering that he is so autocratic and thuggish and often pays scant heed to the law and the truth.It’s high time that the high court realize that Trump’s elevator doesn’t go all the way to the top. Remember last December when he wrote that if the supreme court ruled against him in the tariffs case, that would be “the biggest threat in history” to US national security. In October, he said something even more ludicrous: that if the tariff ruling went against him, it “would literally destroy the United States of America.” (When I woke up this morning. the US was still standing,)The importance of the tariffs case will turn in part on which of two roads theUS supreme courtwill take: a limited, pro-corporate route or a broader, more robust course defending the constitution against the most authoritarian president in history.Many US supreme court watchers predict that the high court will rule against Trump in only two important cases this year – cases in which much of Corporate America has parted ways with the president. Roberts and the other conservative justices don’t like to part ways with Corporate America. Those two cases are the tariffs case and the case in which Trump sought to fire Federal Reserve member Lisa Cook, without giving her any due process, after a Trump ally alleged that Cookmade false statements on a mortgage application. She denied any wrongdoing.Corporate America detests Trump’s tariffs, convinced that they muck up trade relations and undermine economic growth. Corporate America also opposes Trump’s heavy-handed effort to eliminate the Federal Reserve’s independence and transform it into a group of Trumpian puppets who will, per Trump’s wishes, slash interest rates, which could cause inflation to spike in a few years, very possibly after Trump leaves office. At a minimum, let’s hope the court rules for Cook over Trump, but doesn’t stop there.Let’s hope the court removes its pro-Trump glasses and starts to see how he so often holds the truth and the law (and the justices) in contempt. We all need to stand up and defend the US constitution. And the US supreme court needs to do that more than anyone else.Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author, focusing on labour and the workplace, as well as economic and legal issuesExplore more on these topicsTrump tariffsOpinionUS supreme courtDonald TrumpTariffsUS CongressJohn RobertsAmy Coney BarrettcommentShareReuse this content"

The identity dilemma facing the BaftasFew UK nominations this year as industry tries to balance attracting global attention and celebrating homegrown projectsNadia KhomamiArts and culture correspondentSat 21 Feb 2026 08.30 ESTFirst published on Sat 21 Feb 2026 07.00 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleIt may be billed as Britain’s premier film awards, but when nominations for the Baftas were announced last month, the lack of British representation in the top categories was hard to ignore. Just one British actor, Robert Aramayo, appeared in the leading actor category, while there were no British nominees at all for leading actress (the UK-based Irish actorJessie Buckleynotwithstanding).Peter Mullan was the only Briton in the supporting actor category, while representation for best supporting actress fared better, with Emily Watson, Carey Mulligan and Wunmi Mosaku nominated.The awards, announced on Sunday, are shaping up as one of the most competitive in years. Paul Thomas Anderson’s One Battle After Another leads the field across several categories, with Hamnet and Ryan Coogler’s vampire thriller Sinners emerging as its closest challengers.Experts predict Hamnetmay benefit from a home-crowd advantage, but the question heading into Sunday is whether it can realistically topple One Battle After Another – or whether Bafta will once again position itself less as a national awards body than an international bellwether for the Oscars.Last year, Conclave swept the competition, beating buzzy international contenders such as The Brutalist and Anora. In other years, widely celebrated British films including Aftersun, All of Us Strangers and The Zone of Interest have failed to break into the best film category – a pattern that continues to complicate the Baftas’ sense of identity and purpose.“Hollywood has officially gentrified the UK awards. At this point, just rename it Oscars: London Branch,”said one X user. The film critic Guy Lodge,writing in Variety, argued that Bafta should “fly its own flag a little higher”.For the Bafta-winning producer Rebecca O’Brien, known for her work withKen Loach, the problem is structural. “In other countries, you have awards tailored to their national film industries, like the Goyas in Spain and the Césars in France,” she said. “The Baftas fall between two stools: it’s both a British awards show and an Oscars bellwether. It makes sense to do both, but it’s a real dilemma.”View image in fullscreenRebecca O’Brien (left) on the Baftas red carpet in 2024. Ken Loach’s The Old Oak was nominated in the outstanding British film category.O’Brien, who won an outstanding British film Bafta for I, Daniel Blake in 2017, said she believed the Baftas had “got the balance about right”. “You need the global films to attract the attention and the money,” she said.“The UK punches above its weight globally. Look at the Oscar successes for the Brits over the years, which have been amazing. Our national industry is independent and supported by public funders, which helps feed the international industry with talent and skills. That’s why we have the Bifas [British independent film awards]. Maybe the Baftas have to stick to where they are.”To navigate the dual mandate, Bafta created the outstanding British film category, first awarded in 1948. Expanded to 10 nominees five years ago, it guarantees a high-profile platform for British work. This year’s candidates span prestige cinema (Hamnet, H is for Hawk, Mr Burton), popular crowd-pleasers (28 Years Later, Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy), and distinctly British independent fare (I Swear, The Ballad of Wallis Island, Pillion, Steve, Die My Love).But only four – Hamnet, I Swear, Pillion and The Ballad of Wallis Island – have been recognised in other categories. “The problem is, you might get one or two that end up in the best film category, like Hamnet this year. Then you get the feeling the other British films have no chance, because one is already in the top category,” O’Brien said.This year,Timothée Chalametis widely tipped to win the best actor award for Marty Supreme in a strong category that also includes Leonardo DiCaprio and Michael B Jordan. Elsewhere, Jessie Buckley is predicted to edge out Chase Infiniti and Rose Byrne for leading actress, while Paul Thomas Anderson remains the favourite for best director.View image in fullscreenTimothée Chalamet is the favourite to win both the Oscar and Bafta award for best actor.Photograph: Jordan Strauss/Invision/APMany eyes, however, will be on Sinners, one of the night’s most symbolically charged contenders. With multiple nominations –the most ever for a film by a Black director at the Baftas– its performance will be read as a broader verdict on recent gains in representation.That question has hovered over the awards since Bafta launched a sweeping internal review in response to sustained criticism over the lack of Black and minority ethnic nominees. The academy reshaped its membership and voting processes, and by 2025 reported it had met most of its targets.Delroy Lindo secured a best supporting actor Oscar nomination, but he was overlooked by the Baftas. Elsewhere, however, Akinola Davies Jr received a nomination for outstanding debut by a British writer, director, or producer for his Cannes hit My Father’s Shadow. Chase Infiniti is nominated for leading actress (no black woman has previously won in this category).View image in fullscreenThe London-born actor Delroy Lindo, 73, is up for an Oscar for his role in Ryan Coogler’s Sinners.Photograph: Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for IMDb“Nominations are one thing, wins are another, so we’ll see what happens on the night,” said the film critic Amon Warmann.“The best path is greenlighting more films from diverse film-makers with diverse casts, and [having] more people of colour in decision-making positions. That way, more films can rise to the top instead of banking on one or two.”Sinners star Miles Caton: ‘I didn’t know how much I would be in the film … it might have scared me’Read moreClive Nwonka, an associate professor of film, culture and society at UCL, said the focus on awards could obscure deeper industry inequalities.“The Baftas don’t have a problem with representation per se,” he said. “Over the last 15 years, there has always been some Black representation. The issue is overemphasising visibility as evidence of progress. Does a nomination or win mean there’s an equal playing field across the industry? I would argue no – the Baftas are just one element of the wider film ecology.”Nwonka said that while Sinners may win multiple awards, the Academy has long recognised Black talent without lasting shifts. “Moonlight got multiple nominations in 2017. Will Smith won in 2022 for King Richard, Daniel Kaluuya in 2021 for Judas and the Black Messiah. But visibility alone does not equal structural change.”He also criticised the reactive nature of awards in general. “Recognition usually comes after a moment: #OscarsSoWhite, #BaftasSoWhite, George Floyd. That makes awards an unreliable measure of change. Black film-makers and actors want to work in conditions where race is immaterial to the outcome.”Explore more on these topicsBaftasAwards and prizesOscarsDelroy LindoTimothée ChalametJessie BuckleyPaul Thomas AndersonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But as the pair drove back to Alhaurín el Grande that night, heavy rains turned the usually tranquil Fahala River into what the mayor would later call an “uncontrollable torrent”. Police found their van overturned the next day. Their bodies followed after an agonising search.“We are used to some floods. Not many,” said Conchi Navarro, the headteacher of Los Montecillos secondary school, whom Zea Bravo was supposed to succeed upon her retirement at the end of the school year. “But since December, theseborrasca[low-pressure storms] have come one after the other.”The quiet fallout of a broken climate – a book club short of one member, a rock band without a bassist, a cafe that lacks a pastry chef – has been echoing around western Europe for weeks. The back-to-back storms that batteredSpainhave killed at least 16 people in neighbouringPortugal. Soils acrossFrancehave reached unprecedented levels of saturation, with weather forecasters issuing flood alerts that demand “absolute vigilance”. Parts of theUKhave broken records for the number of days without a break in the rain.Portugal flood drone loopThis is Europe’s new reality:under waterin winter,witheredin summer. Yet even as the weather extremes worsen, the voices of denial have grown louder and more influential.“We’re moving toward self-destruction of the planet,” said Navarro, adding that at the age of 60 she had witnessed the effects of climate change first-hand. “It’s not something ‘they’ told me, it’s something I’ve seen. How can anybody say this is an invention?”View image in fullscreenDonald Trump at the White House in Washington earlier this month as rules that regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles were repealed in the US.Photograph: Will Oliver/UPI/ShutterstockThe answer, particularly in the US, is with breathtaking ease. The president, Donald Trump, has ramped up his attacks on climate policy in recent weeks –quittingthe Paris agreement again andrepealinga finding that underpins pollution controls – while going global with his “drill, baby, drill” policy. Chris Wright, the US energy secretary and former fracking executive, has pressured Europe to roll back methane standards and sustainability rules that could threaten American exports of liquefied natural gas. On Wednesday, he urged spreadsheet-wranglers at the International Energy Agency to “drop the climate” from its models.Even inEurope, where polls show citizens overwhelmingly accept climate science and support stopping planet-heating pollution, a quiet but deadly form of denial has emerged.Far-right parties have gained ground across the continent, even as they make fighting climate policy –aided by the Heartland Institute, a US thinktank funded by fossil fuels – their second priority after immigration. Centrist leaders, alarmed by their success and anxious to placate polluting industries, are rolling back green rules with a vigour that has surprised even some lobbyists. This month, ahead of a meeting in Antwerp between the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and business leaders, the EU’s carbon price – the cornerstone of its pollution-cutting efforts – found itself in the crosshairs of the powerful chemical industry.All the while, evacuation alerts are lighting up phones and rivers are bursting their banks as new storms form before the waters from the last have receded. Alice, Benjamin and Claudia were the storms named by meteorologists that started the season in southern Europe in October and November. David, Emilia and Francis led to a wet December. In January, five storms struck in quick succession – Goretti, Harry, Ingrid, Joseph and Kristin – while in February there were just as many – Leonardo, Martha, Nils, Oriana and Pedro – in the first two weeks. The season is one storm shy of the record 17 that hit in the 2023-24 season, with forecasters having reached the second half of the alphabet in far less time.View image in fullscreenCars partly submerged in flood waters on 15 November in Monmouth, Wales.Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesThe storms lashing the Iberian peninsula and the relentless rains in the UK are the result of a southward shift in the jet stream, a conveyor belt of fast-moving air, which has coincided with high pressure over northern Europe and blocked weather systems in place. Global heating amplifies the damage as warm air can hold more moisture. As water pounds sodden soils that have not had time to dry out, the risk of floods increases exponentially.Scientists complain that European governments are in denial about the scale of the threat. Christophe Cassou, a climate scientist and research director at the French National Centre for Scientific Research, said the flooding in France was unprecedented in terms of area and the result of record cumulative rainfall since the start of the year.“What is surprising is that the authorities are surprised by such an outcome,” he said. “We are not experiencing the worst possible scenario, but simply a probable one, entirely within the range of what can be expected from climate simulations.”View image in fullscreenResidents clean the street next to cars piled up after being swept away by floods in Valencia, Spain in October 2024.Photograph: Alberto Saiz/APIn Spain, the consequences of such negligence are fresh in people’s minds. On 29 October 2024, Empar Puchades listened to a lunchtime press conference in which the president of Valencia said the storm sitting over the region would soon move on. Puchades still felt troubled. The 70-year-old former healthcare worker looked up the rainfall on official meteorological platforms. Worried about the volume of water and conscious that she lived on flat farmland in a highly urbanised region, she spoke to a friend in a higher-up village who told her an “unimaginable flood” was coming.Spain flood evacuation - loopPuchades dutifully warned her neighbours and asked her middle son not to work the night shift, but he told her he had to relieve a colleague, and set out early instead. “If my son had left at his usual time, he would have been caught in the full force of the water,” she said.The floods that evening killed 229 people in Valencia. The disaster sparked public fury at authorities, who delayed sending alerts, and hammered home the harm that fossil fuel pollution is causing rich countries. Global heating increased rain intensity by 21%, astudyin Nature Communications found on Tuesday, and expanded the area under 180mm of rain by 55%.The night the floods struck, Puchades grabbed the dog, went upstairs, and opened the shutters to see a tongue of water – “not very high, with a lot of debris, making a very strange noise and with an unrecognisable smell” – approaching her home. It came slowly at first, and then quickly. “I will always say that what struck me was how fast it was.”Spain’s lack of preparedness echoes Germany’s three years earlier, when rains made worse by climate breakdown killed 134 people in the Ahr valley after botched warnings. The disasters are among many examples that have led the EU’s scientific advisers todecryEurope’s efforts to adapt to a hotter planet as “insufficient, largely incremental [and] often coming too late”. In a report on Tuesday, they told officials to prepare for a world 2.8-3.3C hotter than preindustrial levels by 2100 – double the level of global heating that world leaders promised to aim for when they signed the Paris agreement in 2015 – and to stress-test hotter scenarios.Maarten van Aalst, a member of the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change and head of the Dutch meteorological agency, said climate risks would rise rapidly in such a scenario but that Europe still had a choice about how to navigate those risks.View image in fullscreenA train passes a railroad crossing between flooded fields in Nidderau-Eichen, near Frankfurt, Germany, on Wednesday.Photograph: Michael Probst/AP“Even with the much milder but quite significant warming that we’ve seen so far, we’re already seeing extreme events that surprise us and that kill people when they possibly shouldn’t have if we had anticipated better,” he said. “I hope we will not get to 3C … but there’s a significant chance that the world at large will not meet its targets.”Temperatures are creeping closer to the 1.5C threshold. The world has warmed by about 1.4C since preindustrial levels and few experts see the goal as still being within reach. As losses mount, climate scientists warn that “every fraction of a degree” of warming still matters.Navarro, who used to turn to Zea Bravo for reassurance when the busy school became too demanding, said she would remember his chatty character and calming presence. The school held a memorial for him in early January once term restarted, which she said left students silent and motionless. After the “terrible” first two weeks since the floods, they had begun to recover, she added.“Now we will wait for the fires in summer.”"

After that, the administration has to seek congressional approval. During that 150-day period, his administration will work on issuing new and “legally permissible” tariffs, Trump said.While Trump’s announcement claimed that the new tariffs would take effect “immediately”, it was unclear whether any official documents had been signed confirming the timing. A White Housefact sheetissued on Friday regarding the original 10% tariffs said the levies would go into effect at 12.01am ET on Tuesday, 24 February.German chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Saturday that he would travel to Washington with a coordinated European position after the US supreme court’s blow to Trump’s tariff agenda, and warned of the “poison” of more uncertainty.He said that he expected the burden on German companies to ease after the supreme court’s ruling but added: “I want to try to make it clear to the American government that tariffs harm everyone.”“The biggest poison for the economies of Europe and the US is this constant uncertainty about tariffs. And this uncertainty must end,” Merz said.French president Emmanuel Macron told journalists in Paris: “It is not bad to have a supreme court and, therefore, the rule of law. It is good to have power and counterweights to power in democracies.”He said France would consider the consequences of Trump’s new global tariff and that the fairest rule was “reciprocity” and not to “be subjected to unilateral decisions”.The new 15% tax rate also raises fresh questions for countries such as the UK, which had previously agreed to a 10% tariff with the US.William Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chamber of Commerce, said of the latest hike: “This will be bad for trade, bad for US consumers and businesses, and weaken global economic growth. Businesses on both sides of the Atlantic need a period of clarity and certainty. Higher tariffs are not the way to achieve that.”Some products will be exempted from the temporary tariffs including critical minerals, metals and pharmaceuticals. Other exemptions include USMCA-compliant goods from Canada and Mexico.Meanwhile, the supreme court’s ruling doesn’t affect separate, industry-specific tariffs that Trump slapped on steel, aluminum, lumber and autos under a different US law, which remain in place.Trump has pursued his aggressive tariff policies in a bid to revitalize US manufacturing. The US has already collected at least $130bn in tariffs using the IEEPA, according to themost recent government data.However, studies show that the vast majority of that sum – 90% – has beenpaid by US businesses and consumers. Top associations of US businesses have already begunclamoring for refundsfrom the federal government, but Trump indicated on Friday that reimbursements would not come without a lengthy legal battle.Also on Saturday, Trump continued to lambast the supreme court’s 6-3 ruling as “ridiculous, poorly written, and extraordinarily anti-American” in his Truth Social post, following unusually personal attacks directed at justices the day before.At the White House on Friday, Trump told reporters: “I’m ashamed of certain members of the court. Absolutely ashamed for not having the courage to do what’s right for our country.”He praised the three justices who dissented in the opinion: Brett Kavanaugh, who wrote the main dissent, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. He was scathing in his remarks about the others – including two of his appointees, Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch.“They’re just being fools and lapdogs for the Rinos [“Republicans in name only”] and the radical-left Democrats, and not that they should have anything at all to do with it,” Trump said. “They’re very unpatriotic and disloyal to our constitution.”He called Barrett and Gorsuch “an embarrassment to their families” and said they were “barely” invited to the State of the Union address next week.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTrump administrationTariffsEconomicsEconomic policyUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The envelopes from across the world – some sent on a prayer, addressed only with her name and thevillage in Provencewhere she once lived – piled up at the courthouse in Avignon in southern France in late 2024, when she became famous worldwide as asymbol of couragefor waiving her right to anonymity in thetrial of her ex-husband and dozens of menhe had invited to rape her while she was drugged unconscious.For almost a decade,Dominique Pelicot, to whom she was married for 50 years, had crushed sleeping tablets and anti-anxiety medication into her mashed potato, coffee or ice-cream. In an online chatroom called “Without her knowledge”, he had invited dozens of men to rape her in her own bed at the yellow house with blue shutters in Mazan in south-east France, where the couple had retired. “I’m looking for a pervert accomplice to abuse my wife who’s been put to sleep,” was one of his lines. The trial, which Gisèle insisted must be held in public, shocked the world, raised awareness of drug-facilitated abuse –which is termed “chemical submission” in France – and brought an outpouring of recognition from women, from Spain to the US, teenagers to 80-year-olds, all of whom wrote to her with their own stories.“I have all the letters in a beautiful box,” says Pelicot, 73, at the office of her literary agent in Paris’s Left Bank.She arrives with her new partner, Jean-Loup, a retired AirFrancesteward. They are smiling and clearly happy. She never expected to fall in love again, she says. But in the four years between the “devastation” of being informed by police in 2020 that her ex-husband – who had been caught upskirting in a local supermarket on 12 September that year – had also raped her while she was sedated, and the trial in 2024, she had sought refuge in solitude on the west coast of France. Gisèle had arrived with just two suitcases and the family bulldog, Lancôme, in a state of shock and desolation. Slowly, while out walking, she made new friends. One of them introduced her to Jean-Loup.double quotation markYou can love again, you can have several lives in one“Neither of us had ever thought we’d fall in love again because Jean-Loup lived for 30 years with his wife who then sadly passed away from a neurological illness,” she says. “He was her carer until the end. He’s a very beautiful person. We met and fell in love. We couldn’t have foreseen that. And we’re really happy today. It has changed our lives. So you see, hope is allowed. Even for women who are not necessarily victims of violence, but who can find themselves widowed or alone, divorced. You can love again, you can have several lives in one. That’s my case and I think it’s the case for many women, too.”She would sit down with Jean-Loup, each night of the trial, in the house they had rented near Avignon, and they would read the letters that were sent to her. “It was a ritual … we’d use a paper knife to open them graciously, out of respect for the writers. And each time, on reading them, tears would flow, because there was a lot of suffering. I think there are some that I still haven’t opened, because there was so much suffering and so many tears in them. But of course I will read them all and I’ll keep them for ever. And maybe, when I depart this earthly world, I’ll pass them on, I’ll entrust them to my grandchildren. And maybe one day they will also be read in schools. I hope that by then, we’ll all have stopped this chemical submission and all sexual violence. But I think there is still a long way to go.”View image in fullscreenA court sketch from 19 December 2024, showing Dominique Pelicot on the day of his guilty verdict and sentencing to 20 years in prisonPhotograph: Benoît Peyrucq/AFP/Getty ImagesGisèle, a former logistics manager at the state electricity company and a grandmother of seven, is now beginning an international book tour after the publication of her memoir,A Hymn to Life. It’s a book about hope, she says. It was an exercise in “introspection” for her to examine her difficult, grief-filled childhood, her “love at first sight” for Dominique (whom she now refers to only as Mr Pelicot), a long-haired 19-year-old wearing a striped Breton top and driving a 2CV, and their subsequent life together. It’s an examination of the “joie de vivre” she says she inherited from the women in her family who overcame tragedy, which gave her the determination to face the trial.Born in a garrison town in west Germany in 1952, where her soldier father was posted, Gisèle describes a moment when she was four when her mother had slipped on ice. In the doctor’s office, Gisèle spotted a scar under her mother’s hair – a radiotherapy burn, she realised many years later. Nobody had told her about her mother’s brain tumour – it was never discussed. Her mother just kept smiling, never wearing her pain on the outside, something Gisèle says she also learned to do very young.When Gisèle was nine, her mother died at home in the French countryside in Indre, in the Centre-Val de Loire, where they were living. She remembers trying to wake her. “For me, she was sleeping. But when I saw my father close her eyes, and start crying, he was really devastated by grief.” She and her brother weren’t taken to the funeral but went to the grave a few days later when it was snowing. “I thought: ‘She can’t be OK here, she must be cold,’” she says.Her father remarried, a stepmother who Gisèle says was verbally abusive and rejected her. But aged 19, on a visit back to her mother’s village, Gisèle met and fell in love with a local electrician: Dominique. He was shy and sweet, another wounded soul, she felt. His family was troubled, harbouring secrets, sexual abuse, violence. She didn’t know the full extent of that then, but she felt they would save each other, make a break, be happy and start a family.Gisèle had long struggled with sleep, after the death of her mother and later her father and brother, who all died young. “I couldn’t sleep in the dark, I needed the light on,” she says. “I felt it was because I associated sleep with death.”View image in fullscreenBeing interviewed on BBC Newsnight.Photograph: BBCToday, after being drugged so many times, in a way that court medical experts said could have easily killed her, she says she sleeps well and is at peace with death. “I know it’s inevitable. All of us will face it one day.”For almost 10 years, from around 2011, Gisèle experienced what she thought were serious neurological issues, including memory lapses she feared were a brain tumour like her mother’s, or an onset of Alzheimer’s, as well as gynaecological problems. She was having black-outs and memory lapses, forgetting what she’d done the day before, forgetting she had been to the hairdresser even if she could see in the mirror that she had had a cut and colour, afraid to drive or that she might miss her stop on the train.She didn’t know she was being drugged and raped. “I didn’t even know that could exist,” she says. Crucially, neither did the many neurologists and gynaecologists whom she consulted, always accompanied by her supportive husband. One doctor wrote it off as anxiety.But on a regular basis, her husband was putting medication in her food and drink that sedated her so heavily that it was as if she was on an operating table. “It was really a kind of general anaesthetic,” she says. “And all done with drugs you could have to hand in a medicine cabinet at home.”double quotation markI didn’t wake up wearing something else, thinking: ‘Hang on, I wasn’t like this last night.’ It was all calculatedHis concoction of prescription drugs, honed with online advice from a man who had worked as a nurse, included muscle relaxants, which allowed her limp body to be abused and for Dominique to dress her in underwear he had chosen.“I feel the cold, so I always wear pyjamas in bed,” she says. “And he managed to undress me, re-dress me as he wanted, and put my pyjamas back on afterwards. Because when I woke up the next morning, I was in my pyjamas. I didn’t wake up wearing something else, thinking: ‘Hang on, I wasn’t like this last night.’ It was all calculated.”At the time, Gisèle and Dominique Pelicot were living the retirement they had always dreamed of: a house in Provence with a pool, board games on the patio, and visits from their children and grandchildren. Dominique, she says, “was loved by everyone, his children, his friends, his family. There was nothing to trouble the perfect picture. That’s what is so terrifying.”Looking back now, she says there were some strange moments. She remembers him pouring a cocktail he had made for her down the sink when she said it tasted odd. Or another time, “when I found bleach inexplicably on new trousers and, I don’t know why, but I said to him: ‘You’re not drugging me by any chance are you?’ And he started crying, and I was so destabilised by that. I thought: ‘What have I just said to him?’ And it was me who apologised. Like many victims, you know, I said to myself it was impossible that he could be doing any harm to me. I took it on myself.”View image in fullscreenGisèle Pelicot followed by her lawyer Stéphane Babonneau, right, is congratulated by women outside the Avignon courthouse after the prosecution concluded its case in November 2024.Photograph: Christophe Simon/AFP/Getty ImagesShe does not regret insisting that the trial of her husband and 50 other men be held in public, when normally in France a rape trial can take place behind closed doors. Today she feels it was her life’s “mission” to expose not just the crimes, but the justice system’s treatment of rape survivors. That every man on trial was found guilty of rape, attempted rape or sexual assault was a “victory” she says.The most painful moment for her was having to view the “unbearable” videos that Dominique had carefully saved in a file called “Abuse”. “When you see that body, that rag doll, inanimate, treated as it is being treated …” she begins. “I put myself at a distance from that sedated woman, who isn’t really me. That woman who is in that bed with all those men, it’s not at all me. I think that helped me. Not because I was in denial, but it was to protect myself.”double quotation markThey were so casual, it was as if they were there for snatching a handbag. I think they hadn’t understood the scale of their crimesIn the courtroom, she had to face the accused, many sitting very close to her, aged from their 20s to their 60s at the time of the abuse, including a soldier, a journalist, lorry drivers and a nurse, some high-fiving each other outside court and laughing and joking.Dominique told the court “I am a rapist,” but the majority of the other men denied the charges, saying her husband had said it was OK, or that they thought it was a game.“They were so casual, it was as if they were there for snatching a handbag,” she says. “I think they hadn’t understood the scale of their crimes. That’s when you realised this was all about the triviality of rape. They looked me up and down as if to say: ‘Why is she troubling us with all of this?’”View image in fullscreenDefendants in the Avignon courtroom during the final week of their trial with Dominique Pelicot.Photograph: ZZIIGG/Reuters“It was the trial of cowardice and denial,” she says. “My decision to make it public lifted the veil on the evils in society, because our society fosters denial. And we’re still seeing it today through what’s emerging in theJeffrey Epsteincase … Everybody shut their eyes.”For her, this culture of denial means “handing all the strength and power to these types of men”.She was struck, too, by the testimony of some men’s wives, girlfriends or female friends who attended court to say their loved ones couldn’t possibly have raped anyone. And the three former police officers who appeared as character witnesses for one of the guilty men, who once worked as a karate coach for the police. “They said he had a deep respect for women. I said he had a funny way of respecting women. It says a lot about our macho and patriarchal society, that image of these former police officers, public figures, coming as character witnesses.”The applause of women who began gathering every day at the courthouse mattered greatly to her. “It carried me,” she says. “I felt less alone. Without them, maybe I wouldn’t have had the strength.”The shame survivors feel, she says, must change sides, because it is “a double sentence, a suffering we inflict on ourselves”. But there is also “an extreme loneliness” in being a survivor. When we meet, she is wearing the scarf sent to her during the trial by an Australian organisation working to raise awareness of sexual assaults on older women. “It’s a nod to them, to show I’m still connected to them,” she says.View image in fullscreenGisèle Pelicot with her daughter Caroline Darian  and one of her sons at the courthouse during the trial in September 2024.Photograph: Christophe Simon/AFP/Getty ImagesOne of the hardest aspects of the case has been the impact on her children and grandchildren. At the trial, Dominique was also found guilty of secretly taking indecent images of their adult daughter,Caroline,and the wives of his two sons.Caroline, 46, who was also photographed asleep, has now filed a legal complaint accusing her father of drugging and raping or sexually abusing her when she was in her 30s, which he has denied. The relationship between Caroline and Gisèle was strained for a time but Gisele says it has grown closer again. “Caroline feels certain her father sedated her and raped her,” she says. “Unfortunately, that can’t be ruled out. She’s in great suffering and I understand and hear her.”double quotation markI need answers. Why did you betray us like this? Why did you do so much harm to us? Why? I don’t have answersFor Caroline, not having clear proof is a “never-ending hell”, Gisèle says. “It’s wrong to think this type of tragedy brings a family together. It blew everything apart. And each of us is trying to rebuild today in their own way.”Gisèle says she will visit Dominique in prison, probably later this year, to talk to him face to face one last time. “I need answers,” she says. “Why did you betray us like this? Why did you do so much harm to us? Why? I don’t have answers. I’ve tried to understand. I’ve thought about whether it was connected to rapes that he may have suffered himself when he was young, that he was a ticking timebomb in some way, because he never got psychiatric help. But he nonetheless chose the depths of the human soul. He made that choice.”View image in fullscreenActivists outside the Avignon courthouse on 19 December 2024, the day of the verdicts and sentencing.Photograph: Coust Laurent/ABACA/ShutterstockQuestions also still remain about Dominique’sactivities in the 1990s. He has admitted to the attempted rape of a young estate agent outside Paris in 1999, but has denied the rape and murder of another estate agent in Paris in 1991, which police continue to investigate. Gisèle, who has helped police with investigations, said she doesn’t have any knowledge. She remembers him coming home twice in tears in the 1990s but doesn’t remember the dates. “I never saw any blood stains on Mr Pelicot. I never saw he’d been scratched,” she says. She hopes the two families of those women can get closure.In her own case, there is still the chilling fact that the police were unable to identify all the men filmed raping her. “There are around 20, maybe more, walking free,” she says. “And I do wonder whether one day they will be caught doing it again. It’s terrifying to think they could keep on doing this, as Dominique Pelicot copycats. Because today you can see there are still similar cases happening, and it’s universal, it’s not just in France.”French society has beenchanged by the trial. It has opened up crucial public discussion on drug-assisted rape and politicians pushed to havea clear reference to consentadded to the rape law.A Hymn to Life by Gisèle Pelicot review – a unique memoir by a figure of astonishing powerRead more“Although it’s good to change laws, I think above all you have to change mentalities,” Gisèle says. Sexual offences by drugging are about the attacker “feeling all powerful … There has to be a collective awakening. I think this case has started that, but there is still much further to go. It’s about education – respect and kindness towards others. It’s that simple.”Men as well as women regularly approach her in the street to give thanks and support, she says. “Men, too, were totally sickened to see the behaviour of the accused.”In the future, she would like to speak to law students in universities, who may go on to be defence lawyers, on how to treat rape victims. She says her own trial was “like being in a pit with the lions”, where some defence lawyers “sought to humiliate me, say I was complicit, I was consenting, or I was suspect”. She was asked about her sex life, if she drank, if she was an exhibitionist, if she locked the door when she went to the toilet.View image in fullscreen‘In a way I was prepared for sadness and tragedy. But now I hope that’s over’ … Gisèle Pelicot in Paris this month.Photograph: Joel Saget/AFP/Getty ImagesThe trial also showed that there is no such thing as a minor sexual offence. Ten years before Dominique’s arrest in 2020, he had been caught taking photographs up women’s skirts in the Paris area but got away with a €100 fine and Gisèle was never told. There was a feeling then, she says, that upskirting “wasn’t so bad”. Stopping him then could have saved her a decade of abuse.Dominique was arrested in 2020 thanks to the young security guard at a supermarket in Carpentras who had caught him upskirting again. She has since been to meet him. “We fell into a hug and I thanked him because if he hadn’t seen what Mr Pelicot was doing in that supermarket – and if the local police officer, Laurent Perret, hadn’t persevered in searching his phone and computer, I think Mr Pelicot would have been missed, he would have continued. And I’m not sure I would be sitting here in front of you today.”Gisèle Pelicot: The Newsnight Interview review – you can only gaze admiringly at her strength and graceRead moreToday, she says she is doing well. Since Dominique’s arrest, she no longer has memory problems, she has regained weight, her hair-loss has stopped. The rapes infected her with several sexually transmitted diseases which doctors have treated and are being monitored. “I think I’m doing well. I’m a survivor, I miraculously survived,” she says.One day when leaving court, she saw a young woman of 25 weeping uncontrollably, having, potentially, watched the video evidence. Gisèle asked her lawyers if she could go to comfort her. “I wiped away her tears with my hands and said to her that I was OK, and that I needed her to be OK too,” she says. “If she cried, I would collapse in tears, too, and I needed to stay strong.”She says: “As a child I understood I had to grow up faster than other children and I had to protect my father and my brother because they were devastated by grief at my mother dying. It’s not that I didn’t also carry that grief, but I kept it to myself and I built myself up as a little tin soldier of joy, moving forward step by step each day. And I think that’s what forged my personality.” Maybe, she says, “that’s also why I could accept what happened to me. Because in a way I was prepared for sadness and tragedy. But now I hope that’s over, I’ve had my dose of it. And now I can allow myself to be happy for the years I have left to live.”A Hymn to Life: Shame Has to Change Sides by Gisèle Pelicot, translated by Natasha Lehrer and Ruth Diver, is published by Bodley Head (£22).

This compares with 70% of children who do not qualify for free school meals, the party added.Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, said: “These reforms are a golden opportunity to cut the link between background and success – one that we must seize.“Our schools have made great strides in recent decades. Yet for too long, many children in our country have been let down by a one-size-fits-all system, denied opportunity because they’re poor or because they have additional needs.“Our schools white paper presents the blueprint for opportunity for the next generation, with an education system that truly serves every child, whatever their needs and wherever in the country they grow up.”At present, disadvantage funding for schools costs about £8bn a year. There is no guarantee the pot would be increased to reflect the proposed changes, with government sources saying this would be determined at the next spending review.Some MPs and campaigners have questioned how effective these proposed reforms will be without more guaranteed funding.Munira Wilson, the Liberal Democrat education spokesperson, said: “Basing funding on income alone risks hard-wiring regional inequalities into the system.“Instead of reshuffling a fixed pot of money – risking new cliff edges that will leave struggling families even worse off – ministers must restore the pupil premium to its 2015 real-terms value.“Starmer must also guarantee that any investment will rise with inflation, so no child is left without the support they need.”Pepe Di’Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “We very much agree with the provision of more targeted funding for schools supporting the most disadvantaged children and have advocated for such a measure for several years.“However, it is vital that this is done through additional investment into the education system, rather than distributing the same pot of money in a different way, with the risk of creating winners and losers.”The white paper will also outline plans for two new programmes – Mission North East and Mission Coastal – to tackle the performances of deprived pupils in certain parts of the country. The Guardian understands the precise locations for these initiatives have yet to be decided.They will be based on the London Challenge, a New Labour project aimed at driving up attainment in secondary schools in the capital that focused on schools working together to share learning and ideas. It was praised by Ofsted for helping to improve educational standards.The government is also planning a radical overhaul of the special educational needs (Send) system as part of its plans. It plans to give every child with Send an individual support plan.However, some Labour MPs are thought to be nervous about some of the plans, particularly whether parents will retain the right to appeal if they are unhappy with the level of support their child is receiving.The white paper was originally due to be published last autumn, but was delayed to allow for further consideration of the Send proposals.Ministers are also expected to announce new attendance targets in an effort to recover 20m lost school days a year.It will propose pay rises for newly appointed headteachers to incentivise them to work in parts of the country where the need is greatest. This could be worth up to £15,000 to individual teachers.Explore more on these topicsSchool fundingSchoolsPublic services policyLabourInequalitynewsShareReuse this content"

In September, shecancelled a trip to the UKto receive an award for fear of arrest.In an exclusive interview with the Guardian, Rooney said: “I am of course immensely pleased and heartened that the high court has found the proscription of Palestine Action unlawful. This is a victory not only for the Palestine solidarity movement but also for civil liberties in Britain.“The proscription of a political protest group under the Terrorism Act represents a truly extreme assault on ordinary rights and freedoms, and the high court acknowledged as much.”The “very significant interference” with the rights to freedom of speech and freedom of assembly was one of two grounds on which Ammori’s claim was successful. Rooney said the issue was fundamental to the ban, as the legal question was “not whether Palestine Action is justified in carrying out its activities, but whether it ought to be a criminal offence even to have that debate”.She added: “It’s important to bear in mind that the primary purpose of the Terrorism Act is not to criminalise acts of violence, which are already illegal, but to criminalise otherwise lawful acts of speech, association, financial dealings, and so on.“These measures, which represent a significant infringement on free speech and other rights, were intended for use against armed groups that pose a serious threat to the public. The parliamentary debate on the Terrorism Act at the time of its passing testified clearly to this intention.“The use of such measures against a protest group that poses no threat whatsoever to the public is totally unprecedented and, we now know, unlawful,” she added.While the judges’ found in favour of Ammori, they rejected the idea that Palestine Action was non-violent or that it was engaged in civil disobedience, describing it as an organisation that “promotes its political cause through criminality and encouragement of criminality”.Responding to the judgment, the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, cited those findings while expressing disappointment at the result. “The proscription of Palestine Action followed a rigorous and evidence-based decision-making process, endorsed by parliament,” she said.“As a former lord chancellor, I have the deepest respect for our judiciary. Home secretaries must, however, retain the ability to take action to protect our national security and keep the public safe. I intend to fight this judgment in the court of appeal.”The high courtsaidthe proposition that Palestine Action was non-violent “rests on the premise that damage to property, regardless of extent, does not involve the use of violence. That is a view that many would struggle to comprehend, and we for our part are unable to accept.”Rooney disagreed. “To me, and I think to many other people, the word ‘violence’ implies harm to a living being,” she said. “Inanimate objects cannot suffer. And damaging one’s own property – for instance, breaking up old belongings in order to dispose of them – clearly is not a form of violence. Does the same act become violence if the property belongs to someone else? That’s a philosophical question as much as it is a legal one.“Of course, Palestine Action does intentionally use property damage in service of a campaign against genocide and apartheid. This is absolutely consistent with the tradition of civil disobedience, from the suffragettes to the environmental movement. I must admit that I am baffled by the judges’ claim that civil disobedience must be ‘characterised by restraint’. We have obviously been reading very different history books.“So yes, I disagree with some sections of the judgment – though, unlike the home secretary, I do agree with its conclusions.”In her second witness statement in the case, Rooney said it was “almost certain” that she wouldno longer be able to publish new workin the UK while the ban on Palestine Action remained in effect and that her existing books might have to be withdrawn from sale, describing such a scenario as “a truly extreme incursion by the state into the realm of artistic expression”.While the judges said they proposed quashing the proscription decision, for the time being Palestine Action remains banned as the court said it would await arguments from the Home Office on why it should remain in place pending an appeal.“If an order is found to be unlawful or unconstitutional, then it seems to me that it ought to be quashed there and then,” said Rooney. “But I am now feeling confident that the order will soon be quashed altogether, and that my work will remain in print in the UK as a result. I will look forward to visiting Britain again when that time comes.”Explore more on these topicsPalestine ActionSally RooneyCounter-terrorism policynewsShareReuse this content"

The focus is instead on the purity of the enrichment and the number of centrifuges to be permitted.There had been discussion of the stockpile being sent to Russia, and for Iran’s domestic enrichment programme to be linked in with an overseas consortium, but Iranian sources are insisting the concept of a consortium has not been raised.Iranian media close to the government quoted an Iranian diplomat as saying: “We emphasised this position during the negotiations that nuclear materials will not leave the country.”The Iranian account of its relatively uncompromising position means a great deal of weight will have to be placed on the degree of access the IAEA would be given to inspect nuclear sites.The Iranian offer is likely to determine whether Trump feels compelled to launch military action against Iran.In an interview in the US, aired on Friday, Araghchi said: “Washington has not asked Tehran to permanently suspend uranium enrichment,” adding that Tehran had not offered Washington a temporary suspension of its uranium enrichment.He rejected reports that Iran had proposed suspending uranium enrichment for two to three years, saying: “It is not true that the United States has called for a complete cessation of enrichment.”His remarks were contradicted by the US ambassador to the UN, Mike Waltz, who, prompted by his interviewer, said the US was seeking “zero enrichment” by Iran.Reza Nasri, an Iranian lawyer with contacts inside the foreign ministry, warned: “If Iran is attacked while nuclear disagreements can still be settled diplomatically in a fair and equitable manner, other regional states will inevitably draw one conclusion: nuclear weapons are the only real deterrent against the US and Israel.”The news came as protests erupted at some universities, prompting fresh clashes in the street, at Mashhad University of Medical Sciences and at least two Tehran universities.The universities were reopening after being closed due to fear of protests. At Sharif University, the students chanted “Javed Shah”, “Until the mullah is shrouded, this homeland will not become a homeland” and “Death to the dictator.” The Sharif University president urged the students to stop, warning that the authorities would force classes back online.View image in fullscreenDemonstrators marched from Whitehall to the Iranian embassy in London calling for regime change in Iran.Photograph: Jeff Moore/PAIn London, about 1,500 protesters marched on Saturday to call on the UK government to close the Iranian embassy.Some people held pictures of Iran’s exiled crown prince, Reza Pahlavi, who one demonstrator said was “standing with the people of Iran”.One participant, an Iranian national who did not want to be named, said Pahlavi was the “only alternative” leader.He added: “We are not a dictatorship, we don’t want a dictatorship, we just want a democracy.”Protests are also expected at a meeting of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva on Tuesday when an Iranian official, Afsaneh Nadipour, takes her seat for the first time as a full member of the advisory council. Nadipour, a former Iranian ambassador to Denmark, is due to provide input on women’s rights.The UN Human Rights Council Advisory Committee is comprised of 18 independent experts from five UN regional groups and serves as the intellectual arm of the Human Rights Council.

Ilia Malinin had the chance to replacesome disappointing memorieswith much better ones.The two Americans were among more than 40 Olympic figure skaters who took part in the traditional exhibition gala on Saturday night, which not only serves to wrap up the program but to celebrate the entire sport.Malinin performed to Fear by American rapper NF,a routine he had trailedin a social media post earlier this week in which he referenced the “inevitable crash” that comes when people are under immense pressure.Alysa Liu released the pressure, reclaimed her joy and turned it into Olympic gold | Bryan Armen GrahamRead moreThe 21-year-old, who had helped the US to gold in the team event, was the heavy favorite to also win the men’s gold medal, especially after a strong short program. But Malininstruggled so mightilyin his free skate last Friday that he failed to make the podium at all, and he later acknowledged that the weighty expectations had caused him to buckle.Fear is a raw song about mental health struggles and the feeling of losing control. During Saturday’s routine Malinin, dressed in a grey hoodie and frayed jeans, pretended to scroll through his phone. He flinched under imaginary flashbulbs, crouched down and pulled his hood over his head and batted away jarring noises meant to represent social media criticism.He also showcased his undoubted talent. He did one quadruple jump and then unleashed his trademark backflip with a one-footed landing that had the crowd on its feet roaring with what felt like both an appreciation of his skill and an acknowledgement of the weight he had carried. In a powerful ending, he pretended to put on headphones, to immediate silence.View image in fullscreenMikhail Shaidorov performed an unusual routine dressed as Kung-Fu Panda.Photograph: Matthew Stockman/Getty ImagesAs tradition dictates, the gold medalists went last in the program. Kazakhstan’s Mikhail Shaidorov, who won gold in the men’s competition, performed a light-hearted routine dressed as Kung-Fu Panda.Liu went last of all. The 20-year-old Californian, who had been so burned out by skating after the 2022 Beijing Games that she had walked away from her sport,completed a remarkable comebackby winning team and individual gold. On Saturday, she performed a joyful routine to Stateside by Zara Larsson and PinkPantheressView image in fullscreenAlysa Liu followed up her gold medal with an upbeat routine on Saturday.Photograph: Qian Jun/MB Media/Getty ImagesThe opening act featured former Italian figure skater Carolina Kostner, who won a bronze medal at the 2014 Winter Games. She performed a duet with a 3D projection that was meant to describe the journey of athletes, beginning with their first steps in their sport to the point at which “talent finds its home, merging with the skater,” and they ultimately “draw the very best from it.”Amber Glenn, who helped the US defend its Olympic team gold medal, performed to That’s Life by Lady Gaga. The lyrics could hardly have been more fitting for the three-time and reigning national champion, who bounced back from a major mistake in her short program that cost her a shot at an individual medal by laying down one of the best free skates of her career.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsIlia MalininAlysa LiuFigure skatingUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Helium flow is required for launch.Nasa had said on Friday it was targeting 6 March for the launch of four astronauts around the moon and back as part of its Artemis II mission after successfully completing a fueling test that had caused it to stand down earlier this month.The Artemis II mission’s four astronauts, three Americans – Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover and Christina Koch – and one Canadian, Jeremy Hansen, were entering a second period of quarantine on Friday in anticipation of the new target launch date, whichNasaannounced “with caveats” because it said there was still much preparatory work to do after Thursday’s fueling test.Nasa has several dates available in early March to launch Artemis, which will conduct a 10-day trip around the moon, but not land. The flight will take humans further into space then ever before and, according to Nasa, the mission will fly about 4,700 miles (7,600km) beyond the far side of the moon, surpassing the distance record set by Apollo 13 in 1970. The mission will test systems for future deep-space exploration.The mission is in preparation for Artemis III, scheduled for 2028, which will be the first human landing on the moon since the final Apollo program flight in December 1972.Richard Luscombe contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS newsNasaSpacenewsShareReuse this content"

The executions onMay Day1944 have haunted him since he was a boy.“Their heroism was the stuff of myth,” said the veteran leftist, casting his eyes over the photographs that have dominated Greece’s press in recent days with a mixture of fury and awe. “The years may have passed, but I haven’t forgotten.”At 96, Sakkatos never imagined the time would come when he would be able to “put a face” to the protagonists of a tragedy that would go down as one of the worst atrocities of Nazi occupation. The 200 communists, executed by machine gun fire in the Kaisariani shooting range, barely a mile away from his first-floor flat, were killed in retaliation for the fatal attack on a German general ambushed by communist guerrillas a few days earlier.View image in fullscreenVangelis Sakkatos was a child during the Nazi occupation of Athens from 1941 to 1944.Photograph: Helena Smith/The GuardianThe pictures depict the men walking into the firing range in Athens, their heads held high as they stare, seemingly unafraid, into the camera. Famously, they went to their deaths chanting partisan songs in a final act of resistance.“That is what we have always heard,” said Sakkatos, who for years lobbied with other leftists for a monument to be erected in their honour. “And now we can see that courage before our eyes.”Until last week, when the photographs were posted on eBay by Tim de Craene, a Belgian collector specialising in Third Reich memorabilia, it was not known whether the images existed.View image in fullscreenA monument to the dead now stands at the Kaisariani shooting range in Athens.Photograph: Angelos Tzortzinis/AFP/Getty ImagesIn the absence of pictorial evidence, testimony of the communists’ last moments rested on the handwritten notes the men had thrown out of trucks as they were driven to their deaths from Block 15, the notorious camp in Chaidari, on the western fringes of the Greek capital, where political prisoners were detained.On Friday, after days of outcry in the wake of the pictures’ emergence, the Greek culture ministry said it had signed a preliminary agreement with De Craene to buy the photos and he had withdrawn them from sale.The prints, believed to have been taken by Hermann Heuer, a Wehrmacht lieutenant, amounted to “a monument of exceptional historical importance”, it said.View image in fullscreenThe second world war photographs capture the final moments of 200 Greeks executed by a Nazi firing squad.Photograph: eBayFew events in the collective memory of a nation that endured more than three years of German occupation have held such sway. The May Day executions – seen as the high point of the country’s communist-led anti-Nazi resistance – would inspire some of the country’s greatest contemporary artists. Poets, songwriters, painters and film-makers have all drawn on an episode that ever since has gripped the popular imagination.“It’s one thing to hear about their bravery and quite another to see it,” said Yiannis Eris, a communist party volunteer who gives guided tours of the firing range and national resistance museum in Kaisariani. “Now we know they faced the firing squad not only with immense pride but raising their fists. The night before they had made sure to wash and shave. They weren’t afraid of what was about to happen. They saw it as an honour.”The executions occurred months before Hitler’s defeated forces began withdrawing from Greece in October 1944, more than three years after the Wehrmacht marched into Athens and four after Mussolini ordered a full-scale invasion of Greece from Italian-occupied Albania.Heuer, who was stationed in the country from 1943 was probably part of a unit dispatched by Joseph Goebbels’ ministry of enlightenment and propaganda to document daily life in territories under occupation. “The images allow us to frame the drama of occupied Greece also through the eyes of the occupier,” Lina Mendoni, the culture minister, said in a statement.‘Wake-up call’ for Greece as air force officer accused of spying for ChinaRead moreThe collection is thought to include 262 photographs. Some bear the handwritten note “Aten 1.5.44” – the date of the massacre.Greek historians, who have long lamented the paucity of archival material from the period, have described the pictures as exceptional, saying their unexpected discovery will not only help research into Nazi-era atrocities but “open up the space” for further discussion into the bloody 1946-49 civil war that followed the country’s liberation.For decades, Greece’s communist KKE party was deemed illegal and commemoration of events such as the May Day executions was prohibited, in part because access to sites such as the Kaisariani firing range was off-limits. Until the collapse of military dictatorship in 1974, successive rightwing governments marginalised the role played by the leftist-led resistance during the second world war.View image in fullscreenImages capturing the final moments of the communist resistance fighters will soon be returned to the public realm.Photograph: eBayIn recent days, relatives who have recognised ancestors in the photographs have come forward demanding that the events of a period steeped in such trauma be finally acknowledged.“At last, we have pictorial confirmation of what has haunted the Greek left for decades,” said Kostis Karpozilos, a professor of history at Panteion University in Athens. “These images will open up the space for much-needed debate around the politics of memory in contemporary Greece which for so long have been overshadowed by the divisions of the civil war.”Indicative of that rancour, the marble plaque commemorating the 200 was vandalised and smashed by far-right vandals within hours of the photographs coming to light last weekend.On Friday, the memorial honouring the dead, in front of the wall where the men were shot, was covered with a mound of red carnations, testimony, say officials, to the surge in visitors wanting to pay their respects.View image in fullscreenFlowers have also been left at the entrance of the Kaisariani memorial site.Photograph: Angelos Tzortzinis/AFP/Getty Images“There has been a huge emotional response to these images,” said Anastasis Gkikas at the history department of the communist party’s central committee. “We’ve been inundated by calls from descendants of our dead comrades asking for the photographs to be returned to Greece.

A group of backcountry skiers had been on the mountainside, returning home from a three-day expedition, during a heavy winter storm. While six had survived, more than half their group was missing.The ensuing rescue mission in harrowing conditions would bring those six home. In the additional days since the disaster unfolded, family and friends have shared glimpses of the tight-knit group of women, all experienced skiers, whose backcountry excursion took a deadly turn, becoming one of the worst avalanche disasters in US history.After receiving the emergency call, the sheriff’s office quickly marshaled a team of 46 first responders. But the conditions outside remained treacherous. The University of California, Berkeley’s Central Sierra Snow Lab, near Donner Pass,reported28in of snow that day, with another 3ft expected in the next two days. The risk of another avalanche occurring during the rescue effort was high.View image in fullscreenA search crew next to a California highway patrol helicopter on 20 February, in Truckee, California.Photograph: Godofredo A Vásquez/APAt first, the sheriff’s office believed 16 people had been in the group trapped on the mountainside: 12 clients and four guides with an expedition group called Blackbird Mountain Guides. But when they arrived on the scene, Blackbird told them that one person had decided to back out of the trip “last minute”, according to the Nevada county sheriff Shannan Moon. Among the missing was the spouse of one of the search-and-rescue volunteers.The Blackbird group had been on a backcountry ski trip, sleeping two nights at the Frog Lake ski huts – upscale cabins equipped with heaters, wall sockets and bathrooms – before returning to the trailhead on the third day, when the avalanche hit.Amid the ongoing storm, ski rescue teams headed out into the field onboard a Sno-Cat, a truck-sized vehicle equipped with tank-like tracks that allow it to navigate polar conditions. By 5.30pm, the rescue team had reached a location about 2 miles from where beacons told them the surviving skiers were sheltering. First responders skied the remaining 2 miles of mountainous terrain until they reached the six survivors.In the hours since the avalanche had occurred, the survivors had built a shelter out of tarps and managed to uncover the bodies of three of their group members. First responders found five additional bodies. On Saturday, all nine bodies were brought down off the mountain with the aid of helicopters and Sno-Cats.It took several more hours to get the group off the mountain. At a press conference the following day, Placer county sheriff Wayne Woo implored the public to stay off the Sierras as the storm continued. “Please allow us to focus all of our resources on continuing to recover these bodies for the family and bring them home,” he said. The recovery was expected to last into the weekend.‘They cherished time together in the mountains’With eight skiers confirmed dead and one still missing, the Castle Peak avalanche is now the fourth deadliest in US history. In its wake, details are beginning to emerge about the deceased – the majority, a group of mothers and close friends from the Bay Area.In a statement, the families of six of the deceased identified them as Carrie Atkin, Liz Clabaugh, Danielle Keatley, Kate Morse, Caroline Sekar and Kate Vitt, of the Bay Area, Idaho and the Lake Tahoe area. Two of the women – Sekar and Clabaugh –were sisters.“They were passionate, skilled skiers who cherished time together in the mountains,” the families said.View image in fullscreenDanielle Keatley, in an undated photo.Photograph: Courtesy of the Keatley family/APThe families added that the six were part of a group of eight friends, indicating two of the survivors were among the group who went on the trip. They were experienced backcountry skiers “fully equipped with avalanche safety equipment”, the families said.Max Perrey, mayor of Mill Valley, a town north of San Francisco, acknowledged that some of the women were residents of the city in a statement tothe Marin Independent Journal, calling it “a huge tragedy and a huge loss”.School district officials there said authorities were preparing to support students whose mothers may be among the dead. At least one of the victims was the mother of two children in the Kentfield school district, according to local media.Three of the deceased were guides with Blackbird Mountain Guides. Zeb Blais, the company’s founder, issueda statement calling itan “enormous tragedy, and the saddest event our team has ever experienced”, adding that the guides had all been trained or certified in backcountry skiing by the American Mountain Guides Association and were instructors with the American Institute for Avalanche Research and Education.Blackbird Mountain Guides referred additional questions from the Guardian to the Nevada county sheriff’s office.Information about what went wrong on the mountainside is still forthcoming – including why the group decided to leave the huts where they had sheltered the night before. An analysis bythe San Francisco Chronicleshows that the group took a route on Tuesday that passed over terrain rated at a higher risk for an avalanche than a longer, slower alternative exit, although the reasons for doing so are not yet clear.View image in fullscreenKiren Sekar and Caroline Sekar, a victim of the deadly avalanche, in an undated photo.Photograph: Courtesy of Kiren Sekar/APThe Nevada county sheriff’s office and Cal/Osha haveopenedstandard investigations into the incident, to determine whether criminal charges are warranted.A mountain range with a history of avalanchesAvalanches are not uncommon in the Sierras, although Tuesday’s is the most devastating in modern California history.“Naturally occurring avalanches are relatively common in mountainous areas that receive snow, like the greater Tahoe area covered by our daily avalanche forecast,” said David Reichel, executive director of the Sierra Avalanche Center. “Every time a major storm hits the area, it is reasonable to assume many avalanches occur.”TheSierra Avalanche Center, which provides forecasts for the region, has observed at least 50 avalanches in the area near Lake Tahoe since September 2025, and people have died in avalanches in the Lake Tahoe area in six out of the past 10 years. Most recently, a snowmobilerwas killedearlier this year when an avalanche occurred in the same area near Castle Peak.Perhaps the most well-known avalanche to occur in the region was the Alpine Meadows avalanche of 1982, which killed seven and was memorialized in the film Buried: The 1982 Alpine Meadows Avalanche and the book A Wall of White by Jennifer Woodlief.View image in fullscreenAlder Creek Adventure Center, one of two sites where search crews were launched to try to locate the missing skiers, in Truckee, California, on 18 February.Photograph: Jenna Greene/ReutersWhat specifically caused the heavy sheet of snow to break loose and cascade down the slopes remains unclear. But a series of conditions set the stage, and forecasters had warned that the risks for an event like this were perilously high.Before this week’s storms blanketed the Sierra in dense and heavy snow, the mountains were worryingly bare. In an exceedingly warm winter, where precipitation fell more often as rain and a more rapid melt-off was likely, brown patches could be seen poking through the thin icy layer at elevations typically shrouded in white during the early months of the year.This created a dangerous foundation for new snowfall, which couldn’t easily integrate onto frozen landscapes. It also meant hidden hazards – rocks, gravel and downed trees – could slip into layers near the surface, increasing the dangers.This one-two-punch – a devastating snow drought that produced a thin layer of ice followed by heavy and rapid snow accumulation – “fits the pattern of major avalanche events we have seen in this part of California in the past”, said climate scientist Daniel Swain. Swain has long warned of the compounding threats posed by these extremes, and how the climate crisis will fuel more damaging swings between extremes.View image in fullscreenCastle Peak, near Soda Springs, California, on 20 February.Photograph: Godofredo A Vásquez/APThe storm at the center of this tragedy was not extraordinary by Sierra standards, where furious winter elements can turn turbulent quickly, but it was intense. More than 66in had fallen over three days, the UC Berkeley Central Sierra Snow Lab reported on Wednesday morning, the day after the avalanche. Whiteout conditions and gale-force winds added threats faced by the skiers and complicated rescue efforts.Before Tuesday’s avalanche, the Colorado avalanche information centerhad talliedsix US avalanche deaths so far this season. It says avalanches have claimed an average of 27 lives a year over the past decade in the US.The communities affected by this particular disaster are only just beginning to come into focus, as family members mourn their loss.“Our focus right now is supporting our children through this incredible tragedy and honoring the lives of these extraordinary women,” the families shared in their statement. “They were all mothers, wives and friends, all of whom connected through the love of the outdoors.”Gabrielle Canon contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsCaliforniaAvalanchesNatural disastersWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Another time, a wolf walked past.” Her eyes sparkle at the memory. “It was just amazing.”The dream holiday ended abruptly on Friday 26 September, as Karen and Bill were trying to leave the US. When they crossed the border, Canadian officials told them they didn’t have the correct paperwork to bring the car with them. They were turned back to Montana on the American side – and to US border control officials. Bill’s US visa had expired; Karen’s had not.“I worried then,” she says. “I was worried forhim.I thought, well, at least I am here to support him.”She didn’t know it at the time, but it was the beginning of an ordeal that would see Karen handcuffed, shackled and sleeping on the floor of a locked cell, before being driven for 12 hours through the night to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centre. Karen was incarcerated for a total of six weeks – even though she had been travelling with a valid visa.Karen has no criminal record. She is a grandmother who spent eight years working as an admin assistant at a primary school before her retirement. “I don’t even have parking tickets in the background anywhere,” she says. “I am not a dangerous criminal. I didn’t enter the country illegally and I had everything I needed to be there.”So why did ICE detain her, and keep her locked up for so long? A possible answer began to emerge over the weeks she was incarcerated. As Karen got to know the guards at the Northwest ICE Processing Center where she was held, she kept hearing the same thing from them: that ICE officers are paid a bonus every time they detain someone. “Individual ICE agents get money per head that they detain – the guards told me that,” Karen says.It’s no secret that theTrump administrationhas been pouring money into ICE. Its annual budget – $6bn a decade ago – is now $85bn; ICE is now the highest -funded law enforcement agency in the US. Since last August, new recruits can expect to receive a signing-on bonus of up to $50,000. Karen’s experience has left her convinced that ICE agents are being given even more incentives – to arrest and detain anyone they possibly can, even blameless tourists who have all the paperwork they need to be in the US.Within days of Donald Trump’s second inauguration on 20 January 2025, his administration ordered ICE officials to detain more people, with new quotas that would increase the total number of arrests from a few hundred to 1,200-1,500 a day. Reports immediately began to emerge of international travellers being detained by ICE officers.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Edel Rodriguez/The GuardianOn 25 January,German tourist Jessica Bröschewas stopped by ICE and held for 45 days (including eight days of solitary confinement). Early in February, Germans Lucas Sielaff andFabian Schmidtwere also detained. In late February,the British backpacker Rebecca Burkewas incarcerated for 19 days in the same ICE facility where Karen would later spend six weeks. (Like Karen, Burke had been trying to leave the US when she was detained.)Canadian actor Jasmine Mooneywas held in an ICE detention centre for two weeks in March. In July,New Zealander Sarah Shaw and her six-year-old sonwere detained for three weeks.These stories may be the tip of the iceberg: we only know about them because they involve people who were prepared to talk publicly about being seized by ICE. They are generally young people who were held on suspicion of being in the US to work without the correct visa. That’s why, when Karen heard some of their stories before she left the UK, she assumed their experiences had no relevance to her: she was a retired person taking a holiday. In the end, Karen was detained for longer than almost every one of them.I meet Karen in her home, on a quiet road in Hertfordshire. She sits in the corner of her sofa, next to a magnifying light and a trolley that holds a sewing box, thread and everything else she needs for her cross stitch. The walls of her home are adorned with frames containing her embroidery. The first thing you see when you come through the front door is a framed 9,000-piece puzzle of the Tower of Babel that took her two years to finish. “I don’t like staying away from home for a long time,” she tells me, over tea and Jammie Dodgers biscuits.double quotation markIt was scary. You have no way of knowing what’s going to happen. It got darker and darkerWhen they were turned back from Canada, and US border control agents saw that Bill’s visa had expired, Karen fully expected to be allowed to return home. The Newtons immediately offered to pay for their flights – they had funds available to cover the tickets – but the officials “weren’t interested”, she says. Instead, they were taken into an office and made to wait there, from 10.30am until nightfall.At first, Karen was bewildered. “There was no reason to hold me,” she says. “Bill’s an adult. Why am I held responsible for him?” When she asked why she was being detained, an officer told her his supervisor had instructed him to hold her. The hours ticked by. “It was scary. You have no way of knowing what’s going to happen. It got darker and darker. And then other agents turned up with all these chains and handcuffs.”Karen and Bill were shackled at the wrists , waist and ankles and bundled into a vehicle. Karen doesn’t know how long they were on the road for. “It just seemed to be a never-ending day.” They arrived at Sweetgrass border patrol station in Montana in the middle of the night, and were held there for three days, sharing a cell without beds; they slept on mats on the floor, under foil blankets. “I was very nervous and frightened the whole time. And I was chilled to the bone – I couldn’t warm up.”They were interviewed separately. Karen was not offered a lawyer; she wasn’t entitled to one, she says, because she had been detained, rather than arrested. She didn’t think she needed one, anyway. “I just thought, ‘When they listen to me, when they come to their senses, they are going to let me go.’ I thought they might escort me to the airport and put us on a plane – hopefully both of us. But that didn’t happen.”Bill had been working in the US with a valid work permit, but did not have a green card – fed up with the appeals process, he had decided to leave and retire back in the UK. Karen was told that she was “guilty by association”, and that she had broken the terms of her valid B2 tourist visa by helping her husband pack for the trip. “It just went from crazy to ridiculous. It felt like they just wanted an excuse to detain me.”There was a way to make things easier, the agent said: Bill and Karen could volunteer for self-removal. Last May, the White House announced Project Homecoming, a scheme whereby so-called “illegal aliens” could opt for self-deportation. Anyone who agrees to it gets their flight home paid by the US government, as well as an “exit bonus” payment of $1,000. (The Department of Homeland Security announced on 21 January 2026 that the bonus had increased to $2,600 to “celebrate one year of Trump”.) Project Homecoming was funded by repurposing $250m previously intended to be spent on refugee aid.double quotation markIt’s called a detention facility, but it’s really a prison. Locking doors, guards everywhere, cells, everything clamped to the floor“He said, ‘If you volunteer for self-removal – and because of the special relationship the US has with the UK – it will be over very quickly,’” Karen continues. They’d have to sign a document that would mean they would be banned from the US for up to 10 years, and waive their right to go before a judge. If they chose not to, and waited for their day in court, they would be prolonging the ordeal, she was told.“I said to him, ‘I’m on holiday. I want to go home.’ I would have taken the shortest route, whatever it was, which he said was volunteering for self-removal.” So they signed. Karen had no way of knowing that she was only on day three of what would turn out to be 42 days of detention.The Newtons were transferred in shackles once again. A border control SUV drove them from Sweetgrass to Spokane, in Washington state, where they waited for an hour before being put on what Karen calls a “prison van”, and taken to the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma.“It’s called a detention facility, but it’s really a prison,” she says. “Locking doors, guards everywhere, cells, everything clamped to the floor – it’s how I imagine a prison to be. Prison would actually be better, because if you’re in prison, you get a sentence – they tell you how long you are going to be there.”Karen was given a grey sweatshirt and jogging bottoms to wear and issued with an ID card and wristband. She didn’t allow herself to be afraid. “I didn’t want to give it headspace. I was just in disbelief, incredulous that this could happen.”View image in fullscreenThe Northwest ICE Processing Center, Tacoma, Washington.Photograph: Jason Redmond/AFP/Getty ImagesIn the early hours of the morning, she was separated from Bill, and taken to the women’s unit: a vast room filled with bunk beds and metal picnic tables. The guard on duty asked if she was able to climb a ladder to get on a top bunk; Karen said she wasn’t. “I can’t do heights. And I am in my 60s – it’s not something I wanted to do.” The guard told Karen sharply that she was fed up with “this crap”. She led Karen to a cell on the mezzanine level, where an inmate was occupying the lower bunk. “The guard said, ‘Your choice is either the top bunk or the floor.’ So I set myself up on the floor. That’s where I stayed for the next month.”Karen had pain in her hips and back from sleeping on a thin mattress on the floor, and constipation because she was afraid of going to the toilet in a place where anyone could watch her. Her cellmate, Maria, spoke no English, but they got along; Maria was an older woman, and Karen felt safe with her. After a month, Maria asked to be transferred to a cell on the ground floor because her knees couldn’t handle the stairs up to the mezzanine level, so Karen eventually took over the bottom bunk.Time passed slowly at Tacoma, but Karen says she lost all sense of it. From her cell, she was unable to see the one small clock affixed above the guard’s desk in the main hall. The unit had no windows, and the lights were always on, so it was difficult to tell night from day. Once, Karen woke up and went to make herself a cup of tea. She sat at one of the metal tables to drink it, and one of the other inmates asked her if she was having trouble sleeping. “I said, ‘I slept all right.’ And she smiled and said, ‘What time of day do you think it is?’” The clock on the wall said 11.30; Karen had assumed it was 11.30 in the morning. “I thought I’d had a night’s sleep, and I hadn’t. I must’ve been in bed for three hours.”Karen tried to keep herself busy with the jigsaw puzzles and books that were left out for inmates. She kept to herself much of the time; most of the other women didn’t speak English anyway. But those who did shared traumatic stories of being separated from their young children, and agonising details of delays in their legal fight to stay in the country. Some had been living in the US for decades, building lives and families. A few of them had been detained for more than a year. “People think it is just criminals that are being deported, but they’re just a lot of people who went there for a better life. Is that really criminal?”While the Northwest Detention Center is an ICE facility, it is run by GEO, a private company. Aside from her experience with the first guard who took her to her cell, Karen says the staff were “nice enough” to her. None of them could understand why she was there. “One of them said to me, ‘You need to find a pro bono lawyer and sue.’” Another guard turned out to be British. “I had several conversations with her. She said, ‘I can understand them holding your husband, but I don’t understand why they would hold you.’”It was during these conversations that Karen was told repeatedly that ICE agents are paid a bonus every time they detain someone. “I was told this by multiple sources,” she says. “There is all the incentive in the world to find a reason – any reason – not to let someone go.”When I contacted ICE to ask if they could confirm or deny whether individual officers are paid a bonus for every person they detain, a spokesperson said, “Bonuses for ICE officers are not based on arrest or detention numbers. Pay and bonuses for ICE officers are administered in accordance with office of personnel management policy. ICE officers risk their own safety day in and day out because they took an oath to enforce the nation’s immigration laws, not to make large sums of money.”After a couple of weeks, one of the guards asked Karen when she was going to see her husband. Until then, she’d had no idea that she was entitled to. The guard told her she needed to apply for permission. At first her application was turned down, but she eventually did get to see Bill. “It was bittersweet. It was nice to see he was OK, but in a way, I wished …” Her voice trails off. “It brought it home more. It was a slap in the face. You’re in a prison, and now you’re going to have to go back to your unit.”View image in fullscreenDetainees exercise in an outdoor recreation area at the Northwest ICE Processing Center.Photograph: David Ryder/Getty ImagesKaren had messaged their son, Scott, when they were initially held at the border. “We have been unavoidably detained,” she’d texted, “I will let you know when I am home.” But her phone was soon taken away from her. It was several weeks before she rang him from the detention centre. Why did it take her so long? “It was humiliating.” Her eyes fall. “I was ashamed to be locked up.”When she finally called Scott, he was angry with her for not having rung sooner: he had been worrying ever since the first day. He had already contacted the UK Foreign Office, who eventually told him there was no way his parents could be released while the federal government shutdown was ongoing; it ran from 1 October to 12 November. Karen knew this couldn’t be true: she saw people leaving the detention centre every day. (In fact, ICE deported 56,000 people during the 43 days of shutdown, when most government business was halted.)Both Karen and Bill separately tried to contact the British consulate. After weeks of effort, Karen managed to speak to someone, but the consular official told her they couldn’t interfere. “She said she’d look into it, but we never heard from her again. They were absolutely terrible.” Every week, ICE agents would visit the unit to update inmates about any developments on their cases, and tell them when they were going to leave the detention centre. “Their stock answer was ‘two weeks’ or ‘soon’.” One week, ICE didn’t turn up at all.Karen began to feel hopeless. “I was talking to others and thinking, ‘Maybe Ishouldhave gone the route of asking to see a judge?’ I was thinking, ‘Did I do the wrong thing?’”And then, out of the blue on Thursday 6 November, when the guards were doing a headcount and the inmates were supposed to be locked in their cells, Karen’s door suddenly opened. “I thought it was some sort of glitch.” She peeked out of her cell and saw a guard, who informed her that she was being released, and handed her a bag for her to return her used bedding. She was taken away from the unit to the “intake” area of the detention centre, and given her own clothes to change into. It was here that she was told Bill was being released, too. “Sucha huge relief.” But Karen would spend several more hours locked in a cell without him before they were finally reunited, handcuffed and shackled once more, shuffled outside, and driven to Seattle-Tacoma international airport.double quotation markYou only really appreciate your freedom when you’ve had it taken awayKaren arrived home in Hertfordshire to find her car battery flat and her houseplants dead. After failing to pay two months’ worth of bills, her credit score has been affected. There were mounds of post, and six weeks’ worth of emails that she says she is still trying to catch up on. Their luggage, which was confiscated when they were detained, has never been returned. “Every so often I think of something else that was in my suitcase that I’m never going to see again.” She’s made a claim on her travel insurance to see if they are prepared to cover the cost of the possessions seized at the border.But Karen has become grateful for little things. “It was just lovely to be in my own bed,” she sighs. “One day Bill commented on the poor weather, and I said, ‘Yes, but you know what? We can go out in it if we want to. We’re free.’ You only really appreciate your freedom when you’ve had it taken away.”Trump entered his second term in office promising a crackdown on unauthorised migrants. Ever since, tourists have suffered – and so has America’s tourism industry. The US saw 4.5m fewer visits from international travellers in 2025; visits from Canada were down by more than 22%, from Germany by more than 11% and from the UK by 15%. The World Travel & Tourism Council, the global body representing the industry, estimated that the decline in international tourism last yearcost the US $12.5bn in lost revenue.It is expensive to detain people, keep them locked up for weeks on end, encourage them to declare themselves illegal aliens in exchange for a cash bonus and cover the costs of their transportation home. (Karen received the $1,000 bonus but, like others who have opted for self-deportation, Bill never received the promised payment.) Karen is still bewildered that they were prepared to spend so much money incarcerating her.“I think it’s Trump insisting they generate figures on how many people they are detaining. I can’t think of any other reason. ICE just do it because they can, and because they are told to round up people and deport them. It seems to have gone down the slippery slope of just kicking everyone out who isn’t American – and now even Americans are getting in trouble. It’s really scary.”View image in fullscreenBritish backpacker Rebecca Burke.Photograph: Francesca Jones/The GuardianRebecca Burke, the British graphic artist detained by ICE when she was backpacking through North America, was released after 19 days once her story became international news. Karen may have been released sooner had she shared her story earlier. But when she was in the detention centre, she had balked at the idea. “I was mortified at the thought,” she says. “It was only afterwards I thought, ‘No, I do need to speak up. How many other people like me have been detained and not said a word? If we don’t speak up, nobody is going to know, and it will happen to somebody else.’”She has a message for other tourists considering a trip to America: “Don’t go – not with Trump in charge. It’s totally out of control over there. There’s no accountability. They don’t seem to need a reason for detaining you.”But this year is set to be a big one for international travel to the US. As one of the hosts of the 2026 Fifa World Cup, the country is expecting to see tourists from across the globe. “I worry about young people going out there for theWorld Cup– I really do. I imagine a group of young guys getting drunk at a game, getting arrested. I could see themeasilyending up in the same place as I did. They’d find some reason to detain them. If it can happen to me, it can happen to anybody.”Explore more on these topicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)US immigrationTrump administrationUS politicsWorld Cup 2026World CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That is one of the poshest things I have done. I became aware of how posh it was when I started calming down and realised I wasn’t going to fall out of it.There’s a scene in which youspit an hors d’oeuvre squarely at Katherine Waterston. How many takes did you need to get it right?Thirty-three. But that’s because I asked for 20 more just because I was enjoying it. I hit her in the face one time – she was very good about it.[laughing]It was almost like she enjoyed it.What has been your most memorable interaction with a fan?Well, I had a stalker. We had an injunction on her and I thought that everything was safe and then I was on stage doing a press night in the West End and someone stood up out of the front row and put flowers at my feet and I realised it was my stalker. My blood froze. I wish I could have a nicer one!What is the worst job you have ever done?I think it was selling overcoats at Burberry. I kinda got fired because I was not very good at it. I was conning people into wearing the wrong-size raincoats and telling them that it was the fashion, and they were really too big or really too small. And then I got found out. I just did it for the badness of it. I had that job for about three weeks.What are you secretly really good at?I think I’m really good at garden cricket. I play Tests with my son.Whatfilm do you always return to and why?Withnail and I. I first watched it when I was a drama student, training to be an actor, and I didn’t get any of the jokes. It just seemed horribly real, and I had to watch it again to realise that it was a comedy masterpiece. But when I first watched it I sat there sort of glum and increasingly depressed at these two out-of-work actors because I hadn’t started as a professional actor yet. But it’s become one of my favourite all-time films.What is the best piece of advice you have ever received?Don’t read your reviews. I was told this by a guy called Tim Pigott-Smith, who was a wonderful actor, and he was directing me in Hamlet. I was playing Hamlet – this was early, I was about 24. He said, “Just know yourself the strengths and the weaknesses of the production and of your performance, and don’t read any reviews.” Excellent advice.View image in fullscreenDamian Lewis in Hamlet, directed by Tim Pigott-Smith, in 1994.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianWhat is the oldest thing you own and why do you still have it?Either Clowny or Ellie. They were my two favourite stuffed toys when I was five. I gave them to my kids. They’re in good shape – I mean, the clown’s lost a few eyes and a nose. They sleep with me in my bed, obviously.What has been your most cringeworthy run-in with a celebrity?It was late at night on a film lot in Los Angeles and I nearly got into a fight with an A-list celebrity. He thought I was driving too fast – I was driving home at the end of the night. He was with four of his pals. I don’t think about it any more – it happened 20 years ago, everyone was tired.What is the strangest thing you have done for love?[Singing I’d Do Anything for Love by Meat Loaf]I’d do anything for love, but I won’t do that … I’ve done a lot of strange things. How strange am I prepared to go right here? Very, verrry strange. Actually, I don’t know if you do strange things for love.

It works fine as a drama, but the humour of the novels is sadly missingLucy ManganSat 21 Feb 2026 17.05 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleAny fan ofMarian Keyes(and we are legion, as her 23 books, 30-year career and millions of sales attest) can give you a potted but passionate account of why (most often) she loves her. Keyes captures life as it is truly lived. It is lived as part of a family (Keyes is mercilessly attuned to the specific cadences and attitudes of a large, Irish Catholic one, but she is adept at rendering it universally relatable). We live as part of a couple, part of an office, part of a community (wanted or – if you are, for example, an addict, a woman having fertility treatment, or a domestic violence victim – unwanted). Or as a sister, a daughter, a polished professional, or a hot mess (the last two by no means mutually exclusive).In Keyes’ version, all life’s highs are burnished and its lows made bearable by the human capacity for finding the humour in everything. Her books – once dismissed as “chick lit”, “romcoms” or AN Other of the sniffy labels people have attached to novels written by women, largely for women, about largely female experiences (though I think we are starting to move out of that tiresomely reductive era) – hold all these elements in perfect balance.They are, unfortunately – not fatally, but unfortunately – out of whack in the first television adaptation of her work, by Stefanie Preissner and Kefi Chadwick. The Walsh Sisters is an amalgamation of the main plotlines of Rachel’s Holiday (published in 1997) and Anybody Out There? (2006), which are part of Keyes’ beloved series about the large, loving, chaotic family of five daughters, their matriarch Mammy Walsh and – somewhere in the background but with a steadying hand on the tiller – their father, Jack.Rachel (Caroline Menton) is one of the middle sisters and, ostensibly, a party girl. The six-part series opens with her boyfriend Luke (Jay Duffy) calling an ambulance when he can’t wake her the morning after the night before. When she does come to, she and her sister Anna (Louisa Harland, of Derry Girls and Renegade Nell) mock him for his overreaction. But he sees what Anna does not and Rachel will not – that his girlfriend’s appetite for oblivion is dangerously out of control. In a slightly rushed and unconvincing manner, Anna is shown the error of Rachel’s ways and comes to support the idea of rehab.Anna is recently engaged to her fairly new boyfriend Aidan (“Just another one of your notions,” reckons Rachel; this appears to be a hangover from the books, in which Anna is – for an Irish Catholic, you understand – a relatively free spirit, though there is little sign of it here). The central tragedy of “her” book comes in episode two, in attenuated form, and the ensuing grief and guilt complicates the relationship between the sisters.Rounding out the set is dutiful Maggie (Preissner), who is trying for a baby without success and without much emotional support from her husband, Garv (Stephen Mullan). Plus, there is oldest sister Claire (Danielle Galligan), who is divorced and technically a single mother, although as volatile youngest sister Helen (Máiréad Tyers) points out: “We’re all raising that child.”View image in fullscreenLuke (Jay Duffy) and Rachel (Caroline Menton).Photograph: BBC/Cuba Pictures/Metropolitan Films/Enda BoweThere is – perhaps inevitably, given that the source material comprises a 400-page novel devoted to each sister in turn – a flattening of all the characters. But there is also alteration, which throws off the whole dynamic and presents us with something very different from what any Keyes fan will have been expecting. The most obvious example is Mammy Walsh (Carrie Crowley) who, instead of being the Magnum-disbursing, joyfully self-confident borderline narcissist who loves soaps, magazines and Harrison Ford and “wears the smile of a woman whose husband has done the hoovering for the past 15 years”, has been turned unfathomably into a bitter shrew.Transforming Helen into a stroppy-teen-a-like and concentrating on the selfishness and bleakness of addiction, with the addition of Anna’s suffering, hardly helps. Nor does reducing Daddy Walsh to a cash dispenser, which is a waste of his tenderly drawn character – and of Aidan Quinn, who plays him. But it is the loss of the “real” Mammy Walsh that strips The Walsh Sisters of the vital love and warmth that defines Keyes’ creations, and gives us something distinctly cheerless instead. The portraits of addiction and grief are very well done, but you find yourself wondering whether Preissner and Chadwick shouldn’t just have gone the whole hog and written something fully dramatic and interrogative of the subjects, and abandoned the comedy that Keyes blends into it with such apparent ease.On its own terms, and as a drama rather than a comedy-drama, it’s fine. And, of course, the books remain, and are as clever and comforting and funny as you remember.The Walsh Sisters aired on BBC One and is available on iPlayer.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewMarian KeyesDramareviewsShareReuse this content"

A car entourage of arts workers were headed to Cherbourg to run beat making, songwriting and dance workshops.As I drove up into Highgate Hill, the sun was just coming up. Ahead of me I saw Patty leaning against a yellow ute wearing a striped 70s men’s T-shirt, a rat’s tail catching the light. She looked electric. I remember thinking: “Uh oh. This person is literally shining”.I felt something inside me when I spotted her. My stomach turned, and I knew something big was about to happen, almost like a premonition. In Queensland back in the 2000s, the queer scene still felt quite small. Seeing her in that morning light, I fell for her straight away.I was nervous to meet her properly, and even more nervous that we were about to spend five days sharing a cabin. But we were there to work, so I played it down and tried to keep my cool. Connection came easily. We bonded over music – Patty is a drummer and producer, I’m a songwriter and guitarist – and our shared belief in art as a force for social change. I had recently returned from working in East Timor, and Patty was working in youth transitional housing programs.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningMonths later, Patty invited me to a gig she was playing in Lismore with her queer band Bertha Control. That night, our crush just opened up. We ended up pashing in a tree in a nearby park. The next day she had to play another gig up the coast, and texted me from a payphone (which used to be a thing): I’ve got the biggest crush on you.Right from the start, I loved how her spirit made everything feel like an adventure. Jumping on trampolines, exploring forests and oceans, going to gigs, running around at festivals or along beaches at night – we built a world together.There were many moments where we were so consumed by the experience of being together, it was like time would stop. We would look at each other and the magic in her eyes would draw me in.We moved to a massive house deep in the forest in the Channon, between Lismore and Nimbin. It was a six-bedroom house with a big orchard. We had the whole place to ourselves to set up a little music studio. It was a really beautiful time to fall in love in paradise.View image in fullscreen‘I still look at her and am amazed at this incredible person’: Melania Jack and Patty Preece on their way to Island Vibes festival, Stradbroke Island, Queensland in 2011.Photograph: SuppliedSince then we’re done a lot of regional and international touring – amazing, but also exhausting. Our work is political and sits on the fringes of many art forms. We’ve had situations where the venue manager would kick us off stage saying: “we don’t want to hear that fucking lesbian shit”.But we just keep coming back to knowing that this is what we want to do in the world.Creativity brought us together, and it continues to be the way we love, work, and imagine new futures. I still look at her and am amazed at this incredible person, who is always trying to learn and grow with me. The rat’s tail disappeared among a million haircuts and costume changes over the years, but the love and her shining heart is with me – in life, on stage and in our continuing adventures together.Melania Jack and Patty Preece perform as the multidisciplinary arts duoThe Ironing MaidensTell us the moment you knewShare your experienceShare your love storyDo you have a romantic realisation you'd like to share?

I didn’t need my daughter to ask if I wanted to see her “magic dance show” to confirm it – she was a dance kid.Despite efforts to offer trucks and tutus, sports with sparkles, I was quietly thrilled. I’d been a dedicated dance kid (and later an unhinged ballet teen) and was excited to see her join the tribe. But when I mentioned ballet lessons to my partner, he was horrified. He spiralled about the pressure, the body image, the gender stereotypes and, most of all, the makeup.As a child, wearing makeup for competitions and concerts was a fun, if minor, part of dance culture. Increasingly though, the question of whether children should be encouraged to break out the grease paint has been pressing on parents and dance teachers alike. Like my partner, many are wondering whether it’s really appropriate to encourge preteens to master winged eyeliner before they’ve earned their pen licence.double quotation markRemoving makeup requirements reduces cost and pressure on familiesAmy Graham, dance teacherBefore founding AwakenDance& Fitness Academy in the northern suburbs of Wollongong, Australia, Amy Graham danced professionally, worked in childcare, and held roles supporting at-risk youth and children with additional needs. These experiences inspired her to open a studio focused on inclusivity, confidence-building and student comfort.With that philosophy, she joined a growing wave of studios that don’t require uniforms, hair in buns, competitions or performance makeup. “Dance, especially in the early years, is about joy, movement, self-expression and belonging rather than appearance,” Graham says.“Children are already beautiful without enhancement, and we’re mindful of the subtle messages makeup can send about needing to ‘look different’ in order to perform.”For Graham, dance has always been a nourishing and affirming pastime. She wants her students to form similar associations, unburdened by expectations about how they should look. “We want our students to look back on their performance memories and see themselves as they truly were at that age: natural, expressive and happy.”She also believes makeup presents practical barriers to participation. “Removing makeup requirements reduces cost and pressure on families, particularly during concert season,” she says. “Our approach ensures no child feels singled out or uncomfortable for personal, cultural or medical reasons.”double quotation markA little common sense goes a long wayDamian Smith, artistic directorDespite this reasoning, many still see makeup as integral to performance. Onstage makeup plays a practical role, explains Damian Smith, artistic director of the National Ballet and Drama school in Melbourne. “Under theatrical lighting, the face quickly becomes washed out and expression is lost.Makeupexists not for vanity, but to restore definition, allow the audience to read facial expressions, and clearly identify the performer on stage.”Even so, he stresses the need for restraint with younger dancers. “The purpose [of makeup] is to subtly highlight natural features, not overwhelm them … it must remain age-appropriate, tasteful and restrained.“Makeup should support the dancer, not compete with them. A little common sense goes a long way.”double quotation markIt wasn’t about beauty standards; it was about putting on a costume and becoming a characterYahna, former dancerBeneath practical considerations – can you see the child’s face from the audience, and does that really matter in nonprofessional settings? – the question of to blush or not to blush taps into a deeper debate about the role and value of dance in young people’s lives.Looking back on her own career, Yahna, a former professional dancer who requested to be identified by her first name only, has fond memories of wearing makeup on stage.“Most of the time it was just winged liner, maybe some blush and lipstick,” she says. “But as I got older – with more intense competitions and more elaborate costumes and tutus – we wore fake eyelashes as well.“I enjoyed the process; it was part of the performance, the presentation and the magic. It wasn’t something that was pushed on us.”She believes children can distinguish between onstage aesthetics and everyday beauty ideals. “It wasn’t about beauty standards; it was about putting on a costume and becoming a character. It’s part of the storytelling.“You got on stage, and you were Giselle, or Aurora, or a rat in The Nutcracker. Then you stepped off, and you were back to being a seven-year-old.”With that perspective, she didn’t hesitate to enrol her own daughter in dance when she showed interest as a toddler. Like Smith, she sees stage makeup as part of the tradition, culture and values of dance – something she’s keen to pass on.“What dance really teaches children is presentation, discipline and respect. You arrive 15 minutes early to stretch, your hair is in a bun, your uniform is neat, and when you go on stage, you wear winged liner. It’s a beautiful, diligent art form that pays homage to tradition.”Not everyone views that tradition so romantically.double quotation markI thought, ‘I don’t want her to lose her sparkle’Lauren, whose daughter attends a no-dress code studioLauren, a social worker, takes her three-year-old daughter to general dance classes at a studio that doesn’t enforce requirements around makeup, costumes or hair in class or on stage.“The kids naturally dress up on their own,” she says. “They wear ballgowns and tutus, which I think is great. It allows them to express their individuality through movement.”Lauren and her daughter visited more formal studios with strict presentation standards. Preparing for one class, they visited a dance shop to buy new clothes. “She picked this bright blue, very jazzy number,” Lauren says. “Then she was in ballet class with all these little ballerinas in standard uniform, and I thought, ‘I don’t want her to lose her sparkle, the thing that makes her different, or start worrying about what the other girls are wearing.’”She doesn’t want her daughter to be overly disciplined, or to experience dance through that lens. “I want dance to be an expression of who she is.”For Lauren, stage makeup works against that goal. “I know people wear makeup for lots of reasons, but the underlying message is often that you need to enhance yourself – to look a certain way – in order to fit in and play the part.”My rookie era: I signed up for ballet on a whim. I still can’t tell my left from my rightRead more“When we’re older, we can make those choices for ourselves. But when they’re three, the message I want my daughter to receive is that everything she’s doing is already enough – she doesn’t need to change how she looks to participate.”Dance can be many things: a space for expression, joy, connection, discipline and tradition. Or it can be an early introduction to gendered beauty expectations that children may grapple with for years.Watching my daughter twirl in front of the mirror, I wonder where she’ll land between those two experiences. But I’m not convinced the answer hinges on whether she wears fake eyelashes a few times a year.I was lucky. Like Yahna and Amy, dance was a formative and affirming part of my life. That doesn’t mean my partner – or Lauren – are wrong to raise concerns. Ultimately, the issue extends beyond makeup to questions of control and agency: how we teach young people to see themselves, on and off the stage.When the time comes to choose a dance studio, I don’t know whether makeup or hair requirements will influence my decision. What I hope for is a community where my daughter’s face and body feel like her own, where she’s never judged or pressured, and where the option to occasionally take part in stage traditions is genuinely hers.If it helps her feel connected to centuries of history, or allows her to better inhabit a character, I’ll support it. Otherwise, I’ll be the first to step in with a wet wipe.Explore more on these topicsParents and parentingAustralian lifestyleFamilyBeautyDanceBalletMakeupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Restaurants and fast-food chains rapidly expanded their meat-free offerings, racing to meet growing demand from diners. McDonald’slaunched its first plant-based burger, joining a wave of operators embracing non-meat options.Fast forward to 2026 and the landscape looks markedly different. Last month, the fast food chain announced it was axing most of its vegetarian range – sparing only its McPlant burger – owing to weak sales. Wagamama hasremoved some vegan dishesfrom its menu, while Domino’s has also scaled back its plant-based options. The final Veggie Pret, a standalone concept store from the high street sandwich chain that started in 2016, closed in February 2024.Some industry observers say the shift reflects growingconsumer scepticism around ultra-processed foods, with certain vegetarian meat alternatives criticised for being overly processed. In their place, data shows whole sources of protein are regaining ground, particularly chicken. Others argue the change is less dramatic: rather than retreat, the sector is stabilising after a rapid boom.Data from Lumina’s Menu Tracker shows that in the first three months of 2025, pubs and bars served two fewer dishes compared with the same period the previous year. Vegetarian options were described as “explicitly shrinking”, as average main course listings remained high at 54 items but menus leaned more towards meat-led dishes.View image in fullscreenWagamama has removed many vegan menu options, such as the plant-based Korean corn dog.Photograph: Richard Saker/The GuardianLiv Warren, an insight manager at Lumina, said pubs were “stripping back lower-volume categories, with vegetarian dishes shrinking, while doubling down on high-margin core meat dishes”.A similar pattern has emerged in restaurants. Traditional meat mains grew in prominence, with pizzas and burgers recording an uptick. “Vegetable dishes were present but declining marginally,” Warren said. High-protein chicken dishes were a key driver, increasing by 4.2 percentage points of mains share over the period analysed.Looking across the first half of 2025, Warren said that while menus were expanding in some channels, growth was firmly meat-led. “Pubs are explicitly reducing vegetarian dishes,” she noted, with expansion driven by “chicken and protein”. She added: “Vegetable dishes are present but not leading growth … indulgence and protein are outperforming plant-based innovation.”Operators were reallocating menu space towards higher-margin meat dishes, particularly chicken, she said. The shift reflects ongoing cost pressures, anormalisation of demand after the plant-based boomand a change in health messaging from “meat-free” to “high-protein”.View image in fullscreenHigh-protein meat dishes are much more popular in resturants and food chains.Photograph: Eugene Mymrin/Getty ImagesBia Bezamat, the cultural insights director at the market research firm Kantar, said: “A lot of people won’t realise how algorithm-driven food trends can be, too. TikTok is full of micro-trends like high protein, which often lean heavily towards meat, and gut health which is behind the rise of fermented foods like kefir and pickles.“The rise of GLP-1 medicines also means there’s a trend towards smaller and more nutrient-dense meals. So, restaurants are ultimately responding to all of these different trends.”Kara Buffrey, the founding partner of restaurant agency Chomp, believes the changes amount to adjustment rather than reversal. “The scaling back of veggie options at McDonald’s and Domino’s, along with the closure of concepts like Veggie Pret and other fully vegan restaurants, feels more like a market correction than a cultural reversal,” she said.“Veganism arguably went through a hype phase and brands were bold in responding to that momentum. But fast food operates on very tight margins and is entirely demand-led. If people aren’t ordering veggie takeaways in high enough numbers, those products won’t survive.”She added that the pressures of rising menu prices may also be influencing consumer choices. “I don’t think vegetarianism itself is necessarily declining, rather, with eating out becoming more expensive, consumers may feel they get more value from meat options. This looks like brands responding pragmatically to purchasing behaviour rather than making a broader ideological shift.”Inflation, higher wages, increases to national insurance and business rates are all squeezing margins – and with nearly 38% of diners now eating out less thanthey did a year ago, citing rising costs and the need to save money, businesses are making difficult decisions about which dishes to cut.View image in fullscreenThe last Veggie Pret store closed in 2024.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianLaura Hellwig, managing director at the vegan charity Viva!, agreed that wider economic factors could not be ignored. “Hospitality is dealing with higher wages, inflation and rising costs … Across the sector, operators are cutting lower-performing items from menus.”According to Hellwig, consumer interest in plant-based lifestyles is still strong – and actually growing. She cited the GoodFoodInstitute, which released research in May last year stating that 31% of people in the UK were actively reducing their meat intake while 9% said they followed meatless diets. Veganuary 2026 was record-breaking, with about 30 million participants worldwide, up from 25.8 million the previous year.For these reasons, she rejected the idea of a plant-based collapse. She also emphasised that Wagamama still offered an extensive vegan range and argued the sector was entering a period of consolidation. “It’s normal. That level of rapid growth wasn’t sustainable long term. Many brands jumped on the plant-based bandwagon and launched large numbers of products; it’s inevitable that some of those would fall away.”Importantly, Hellwig said, strong performers were still in place. “The McPlant remains very popular. The products that work are sticking.” Affordable high street options, such as the McPlant and the Greggs vegan sausage roll, continue to sell strongly.Helllwig added that “minimally processed, whole-food and naturally high-protein options such as tofu, tempeh, seitan and falafel are growing, as are functional foods with additional health benefits”.Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industryVegetarianismVeganismFast foodFoodRetail industryMcDonald'snewsShareReuse this content"

After four years of thinking about this Olympics, and 11 days of competing in this Olympics, there is no doubt about how Bruce Mouat and his three teammates will weigh their achievement here after they were beaten by Canada 9-6 in the final. It was an excruciatingly tense game, which twisted and turned on its way to the very final stone of the 10th end. And when it was over, two of the British players were left in tears. Great Britain’s fourth medal of these Olympics was more bitter than sweet.“I’m heartbroken,” said Grant Hardie. “We lost that final four years ago. It took us a long time to get over it and find the motivation to go again and we found it and we were so hungry to go and deliver this time, and unfortunately it just didn’t quite happen.” His cousin Hammy McMillan felt the same way. “It took me four years to get over the first silver,” he said, “so it will probably take a lot longer this time.”Winter Olympics 2026: Canada curlers beat GB to gold, bobsleigh, ice hockey and more – liveRead moreView image in fullscreenThe Canada team show their delight after the match.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThey were the better team for much of the match, but then they were the better team for much of the last four years, too. In that time they won two world championships, two European championships, and four grand slam events. Even the Canadians, led by Brad Jacobs, describe them as “the best team in the world”. Jacobs would. He and Mouat have played each other in 14 games now, and this was only the second time that Jacobs has ever won.Milano Cortina Winter Olympics 2026 day 15 – in picturesRead moreMouat, who many reckon the best shotmaker in the game, has now played in four Olympic medal matches across the mixed doubles and men’s events at two Games, and lost every one of them. “I’m trying to remind myself that I would have been extremely proud of this when I was five, six, seven years old, when all I wanted was to be an Olympian,” Mouat said. “That’s what I’m going to try and just keep on telling myself.”Mouat will carry on to the next Olympics in France. “100%” he said. “I love the sport, I love my teammates. And I’m not done yet.” But he isn’t sure whether his three friends – Bobby Lammie the third – will be with him. “I would love to play with the guys again. We’ve not actually had that conversation as four individuals, so we would need to go and have that discussion. I know personally that I want to continue and we’ll go from there.”Hardie spoke about wanting to retire after the last Olympic final, when they were beaten by Sweden. “The pain from four years ago was that much, we thought: ‘Let’s go and give it another go,’” Hardie said. “We wanted to win it for each other. We gave ourselves a chance, too, there was so much good work to redeem ourselves.”View image in fullscreenThe sides show contrasting emotions on the podium.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe British had the better start and were leading after the second end. But Jacobs is a gnarly competitor and he and his team worked their way into a 4-3 lead at halfway.By then, the crowd in the Cortina Ice Arena had fallen breathless, even the bands of mad keen Scottish curling fans who had flown over especially were too nervous to talk, except in the odd moments when their excitement at the shot just played compelled them to break out one or another of the chants they had written for the team, or else McMillan’s cousin struck up Loch Lomond on his bagpipes from his seat in the stadium eyrie.They sang loud after the sixth end, when Mouat put Great Britain back in front with a superb double take-out. But the decisive moment came in the ninth end. Canada had the hammer and Mouat’s team seemed to get stuck in two minds about how to play it.View image in fullscreenBritain’s skip Bruce Mouat (centre) will carry on to the next Olympics in France, he said “I love the sport, I love my teammates. And I’m not done yet.”Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“We were in the exact same spot in the semi-final and we said: ‘Look guys, same again,’” said Hardie. They tried to force a blank end, which would have put them one shot up with the hammer in the 10th. “We didn’t want to play it too aggressively. And unfortunately we missed four or five shots in a row, and after eight brilliant ends that flipped control of the game.”The Canadians managed to pick up three and all of a sudden they were sitting on an 8-6 lead. In such a tight game, it was too much for Mouat to claw back, even with the hammer in the 10th end. You can only you hope that one day they will look back on all they have achieved together and think very differently about it to the way they do now.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsTeam GBCurlingnewsShareReuse this content"

After a little over two hours of racing Johannes Høsflot Klæbo won his sixth gold medal of these Games when he beat his Norwegian teammate Martin Løwstrøm Nyenget by 17.4 seconds to win the men’s 50km classic.The triumph meant the 29-year-old set the record for the most gold medals in a single Winter Games, set by the US speed skater Eric Heiden when he won five at Lake Placid in 1980.

Were he a nation, he would be ninth in the 2026 medal standings. In this past fortnight he has competed in 10 races across 115km, in six different events, in the space of just 14 days, and won every single one of them.Nobody has ever swept all the cross-country events in a single Olympics before; truth is nobody has ever imagined it was possible in such a gruelling sport.Only the American swimmer Michael Phelps, with 23, has ever won more Olympic gold medals than Klæbo. In this past week he has overtaken Laris Latynina, Carl Lewis, Katie Ledecky, Paavo Nurmi and everyone else in the Olympic pantheon. “Is it 14 left or something?” Klæbo said after he had won his fifth gold on Wednesday. “It’s going to be way too many.” Only 13 now.View image in fullscreenJohannes Høsflot Klæbo savours the greatest of his 11 gold medals as he crosses the line in the 50km mass start final.Photograph: Javier Soriano/AFP/Getty ImagesBut he had to earn it. The 50km is the hardest event in the Olympics. For the majority of the race, Klæbo was out alone with Nyenget and Emil Iversen, all tucked one behind the other like three geese flying south for the winter. They moved in lockstep as they looped in, out and around the trails, between larch trees and up and down the hills. There were only tenths of seconds between the three of them. By 30km the man racing in fourth place, the Russian Savelii Korostelev, was almost two minutes off, and he was another half-minute on from everyone else.Milano Cortina Winter Olympics 2026 day 15 – in picturesRead moreIversen finally broke and slipped back halfway through the last lap, but Nyenget kept on. He attacked twice in the final two kilometres but couldn’t shake off Klæbo and by the time they came into sight of the finish line they were dead level. Then, on the final uphill, Klæbo finally made the move everyone had been waiting to see, wondering, all the while, whether he still had it in him after all this racing. He did. As he entered the bend into the home stretch he was a tenth of a second ahead, and was cheered into history by thousands of raucous fans.It was Klæbo’s greatest victory. He began this sport as a sprinter, competing in the 1,500m, but over time has moved up into marathon racing too, with the ultimate aim of winning this, the most prestigious event in the sport. To do it, he has had to master two entirely different techniques: classical, in which the skis have to run parallel on groomed tracks, and freestyle, in which they move in a V-shape. The two are as different as breaststroke is from butterfly.Not satisfied with that, Klæbo invented one all of his own, an uphill running technique, a sort of high-tempo diagonal stride that he used to devastating effect in the cross-country classic sprint. Theclip of him storming upa 240m hill, in skis, at six-minute-mile pace, is one of the most startling sights of these Olympics. It is, his childhood coach has explained, something he first learned by accident, “because he didn’t have enough wax on his skis, and it was a bit slippy, and he just found out ‘OK, if I run I can make it.’” It sounds like it was born out of the same sheer bloody stubbornness which has driven him to these six victories.View image in fullscreenMartin Løwstrøm Nyenget, Johannes Høsflot Klæbo and Emil Iversen were locked together for a large part of the race.Photograph: Michel Cottin/Agence Zoom/Getty Images‘Worst skis I ever had’: Swedish biathletes blame poor Olympic form on waxing teamRead moreIf you still don’t get it, measure him by the opinions of his rivals, even if it it means they end up like little sketches drawn on the foot of the page to give everything a sense of true scale.“He’s the GOAT in the whole sport, the greatest skier we will ever see,” said France’s Theo Schley. “I like to go to every race thinking that it’s a race for the win, but these days, a lot of the time it’s a race for second,” said the USA’s Ben Ogden. “He is just at a different level here, he is the greatest of all time,” said his teammate Einar Hedegart. “He’s the best skier of all time,” said another Norwegian, Oskar Opstad Vike, “and it’s an honour to share a podium with him.”And these are just the athletes who are at least competing for the other medals, let alone the people making up the field. “I think,” said Great Britain’s Andrew Musgrave, who finished sixth, “that Johannes could probably have gone backwards faster than me up the last hill.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsSkiingnewsShareReuse this content"

Nobody wanted to get the gold,” said Stolz, the 21-year-old from Wisconsin who captured a pair of golds with Olympic-record times in the 500m and 1000m before Thursday’s silver in the 1500m.USA’s Elana Meyers Taylor storms monobob to win first Olympic gold at age 41Read moreBergsma, who claimed bronze in the 10,000m eight days ago, becomes the third athlete in his 40s to win an individual gold at the Milano Cortina Games, joiningUS bobsledder Elana Meyers TaylorandAustrian snowboarder Benjamin Karl. Before these Olympics, the only athlete aged 40 or older to win an individual Winter Games gold was Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Bjørndalen in 2014.Bergsma did not panic when he started near the back of the pack, sitting 15th after the opening lap. He steadily worked his way forward alongside Thorup and spent much of the middle of the 16-lap race out in front, conserving energy and staying out of trouble. With five laps to go, Thorup and Bergsma led by nearly 300m and were close to lapping the field. Bergsma made his final push on the second-to-last circuit, taking control of the lead and powering through the closing stretch with barely a fight.“That was crazy, mind-blowing,” Bergsma said. “I was expecting a really hard final, but nobody wanted to do the first attack. I did it. I had a gap together with Viktor and that was it.“We had a gap in no time, and then I knew, ‘OK, I have a big, big chance right now’. I just wanted to keep the gap with the peloton and keep the speed in it a bit. I had to keep my cool and finish it.”Stolz went out in front immediately before slipping back into the middle of the peloton after two laps but staying in the mix throughout. He was still right there entering the final trips around the oval and even produced one of the fastest closing bursts in the field, but could not overtake Giovannini down the stretch to the rapture of the Italian fans.Milano Cortina Winter Olympics 2026 day 15 – in picturesRead more“I thought maybe the other guys would pull, but they all decided to follow me,” Stolz said. “If I pull back the two leading guys, I’ll have no chance of getting a medal. So even in the last four laps, I was still in front pulling them. I was close to getting a bronze, but there was no chance we would have caught the two guys up in front.”Stolz entered the Olympicswith immense expectations, already a seven-time world champion and the favorite here across three individual distances. While he fell short of sweeping his program, he departs Italy as only the second man to complete the 500m-1000m double in speed skating at a single Olympics.“I would say it was pretty successful,” Stolz said of his medal haul. “There are things that could have gone better, but two golds and a silver, I have got to be pretty happy with that.”Bergsma will be 44 at the nextWinter Olympics, but he did not rule out a title defense in the French Alps in 2030.“Four years is going to be really tough, especially with the young guys coming up on the single distances,” he said. “I will see by year by year, but I am not done yet.”USA’s Mia Manganello, competing in her final Winter Games at 36, took bronze in the women’s mass start. The gold went to reigning world champion Marijke Groenewoud of the Netherlands while Ivanie Blondin of Canada took the silver for the second Games in a row.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsSpeed skatingUS sportsJordan StolznewsShareReuse this content"

But crooked boxers from ancient Greece never confessed their indiscretions on live television. The Norwegian biathlete Sturla Holm Lægreid did exactly that after winning bronze in the men’s 20km biathlon for his first individual Olympic medal, publiclyadmitting he’d two-timed his girlfriendthree months earlier and calling it “my biggest mistake” in an overshare for the ages carried live by national broadcaster NRK. Lægreid’s shot appeared to have missed the target one day later when the wronged party, wishing to remain anonymous,told the Norwegian paper VGit was “hard to forgive” what he did.View image in fullscreenSturla Holm Lægreid in tears after receiving his bronze medal.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Reuters2) Nazgul unleashedEvery Olympics produces at least one breakout star. Few of them, however, arrive on four legs. Nazgul, a two-year-old Czechoslovakian wolfdog who lives at a nearby hotel in Tesero,burst on to the courseduring the women’s cross-country team sprint qualifier and launched a pell-mell dash for the line behind Croatia’s Tena Hadzic, though his time did not count because he is male. And a dog. Hadzic briefly wondered if she was hallucinating before officials escorted the crowd favourite off the snow. “He was cute but not aggressive,” Greece’s Konstantina Charalampidou observed. Nazgul, a very good boy according to multiple sources, has yet to comment on his tactics.View image in fullscreenNazgul, the friendly hotel wolfdog, wins it by a paw in the cross-country skiing.Photograph: Reuters3) Canada’s sweary curlersCanadians’ near-mythical reputation for politesse took a hit on the curling sheet during a bad-tempered game near the start of the competition. Tempers flared as Brad Jacobs’ Canada beat Sweden ina spicy round-robin tie, with Niklas Edin’s team alleging the Canadians were double-touching the stone after release. After a passive-aggressive back-and-forth in which each side asked the officials to monitor the other’s deliveries, tensions boiled over in the penultimate end when Marc Kennedy responded to Oskar Eriksson’s accusations of impropriety by telling him to “fuck off”. In a sport that prides itself on self-policing civility, thememes alonemay have been worth it.View image in fullscreenMarc Kennedy of Canada and Oskar Eriksson of Sweden get stuck into each other after the former was accused of illegal ‘double tapping’ his stone.Photograph: Joel Marklund/BildByrån/Shutterstock4) PenisgateThere was no bigger story during the early days of the Milano Cortina Gamesthan “Penisgate”, the scandal that alleged ski jumpers, seeking marginal aerodynamic gains after tighter suit regulations, had resorted to injecting hyaluronic acid into their members to inflate 3D body measurements and secure looser suits with the goal of increasing drag. World Anti-Doping Agency officials were asked, for perhaps the first time, to comment on penile enhancement as performance aid. The body’s Polish president, Witold Banka, clearly as amused as the rest of us, said: “Ski jumping is very popular in Poland, so I promise you I’m going to look at it.”View image in fullscreenSki jumpers know that looser suits could give them vital lift and thus extra distance.Photograph: Matthias Schräder/AP5) Broken medals“Don’t jump in them,” was Breezy Johnson’s warning after the downhill champion’s gold medaldetached from its ribbonduring a moment of customary excitement on the podium. The American was hardly alone. The German biathlete Justus Strelow and the US figure skater Alysa Liu both reported a faulty clasp connecting the medal to the ribbon, while the Swedish cross-country skier Ebba Andersson said her silver medal split into two after falling in the snow. Some have attributed the design flaw to a breakaway mechanism required by law to prevent choking, but the rapid accumulation of complaints represented a rare wobble for Italian craftsmanship.View image in fullscreenOlympic downhill champion Breezy Johnson shows her broken medal to the media.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA6) France’s fraudster wins goldOne of the more original Olympicredemption arcs belonged to Julia Simon. The 29-year-old French biathlete, fined €15,000 (£13,100) and given a suspended sentence last October for using the credit card details of her teammate Justine Braisaz-Bouchet and a team physiotherapist, won gold in the women’s 15km – light years ahead of 80th-placed Braisaz-Bouchet. Simon had denied the fraud for three years before admitting guilt after photos of the cards were found on her phone, saying in a court hearing in Albertville: “I can’t explain it. I don’t remember doing it. I can’t make sense of it.” Before themassive hordesthat packed the biathlon stadium at Rasen-Antholz, her aim proved considerably more reliable than her memory.View image in fullscreenJulia Simon gestures towards the TV compound as she crosses the finish line to win the women’s 15km individual biathlon.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian7) Quad God brought down to earthIt was difficult to see anyone derailing Ilia Malinin in the men’s figure skating. He had gone nearly three years unbeaten in competition, owing to a stunning array of quadruple jumps including the quad axel, the heart-stopping four-and-a-half-revolution jump that had never been landed in competition until he came along. The Olympic debutant had shown traces of fragility in helping the US to team gold but, after falling twice during a catastrophic free skate thatdropped him out of the medalsinto eighth place – one of the biggest shocks in Olympic figure skating history – the 21-year-old from the northern Virginia suburbs described in effect having a panic attack on the ice. Ascension must wait for the Quad God, at least until French Alps 2030.View image in fullscreenHot favourite Ilia Malinin falls in the free skate to crash out of the medals.Photograph: Jamie Squire/Getty Images8) Team GB’s first gold on snowIt took only 102 years but Charlotte Bankes and Huw Nightingale finally broke through forTeam GB’s first gold medal on snowat the Winter Olympics by winning the mixed team snowboard cross. Seeded 13th out of 16 teams entering the final rounds, having both turned inforgettable performances in their individual events, Bankes and Nightingale both held their nerve in the four-team final, with the former overtaking France’s Léa Casta with a decisive move during the second leg that flipped silver into gold. “It’s hard to describe in words,” Nightingale said. “We both put in so much hard work. The singles were tough but now there are tears of joy.”View image in fullscreenCharlotte Bankes (right) takes the final jump in the lead ahead of Italian (left) and French rivals to win gold with her teammate Huw Nightingale in the mixed snowboard cross.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian9) Golden oldiesThe Winter Games can seem like a purpose-built showcase for gen Z prodigies and teenagers, but Milano Cortina often felt like a millennials’ playhouse. Nick Baumgartner wasback for snowboard crossat 44. Canada’s Deanna Stellato-Dudek made headlines competing in the figure skating aged 42. Lindsey Vonn returned at 41 and was the biggest star of the whole Olympicsfor about 13 seconds. But the highest honours go toAustria’s Benjamin Karl, 40, who won the men’s alpine snowboarding parallel giant slalom in Livigno to become the oldest individual gold medallist in Winter Olympic history, a record that stood for exactly eight days, when it was lowered (raised?)by the American bobsledder Elana Meyers Taylor.View image in fullscreenBenjamin Karl shows off his muscles after winning the men’s parallel giant slalom, and setting a record as the oldest gold medallist at 40.Photograph: David Ramos/Getty Images10) Vance booedJD Vance was seemingly everywhere all at once in Milan during the first week of the Games. The US vice-president soft-launched what looked suspiciouslylike the 2028 GOP presidential ticketalongside Marco Rubio at the women’s hockey, kibbitzedwith the boxer-influencer Jake Paulfrom the VIP seats – perhaps evenslipping him a few talking points– squeezed in some figure skating before a state visit with the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, then drew a chorus of lusty boos at the opening ceremony in a moment of audible dissent that wasapparently scrubbed from the American broadcast. If the Olympics are usually a sanctuary from politics, Vance treated them more like a campaign stop with better lighting and tighter security.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After his side’srecord humbling by Irelandon Saturday, Borthwick said his side are being punished for their poor starts to games and are leaving themselves “a mountain to climb” against quality opposition.This was England’s worst Six Nations defeat since they lost53-10 at home to Francein 2023 and Borthwick said he was “bitterly disappointed” with his team’s latest sub-par first-half showing. “Unfortunately, for two weeks now, we have given the opposition too many points and we have not got scoreboard presence. We will be looking closely at that and how I set the team up to make sure it doesn’t happen again.Record-breaking Ireland humble woeful England in Twickenham demolition jobRead more“Everybody can see we turned the ball over too many times. You get in field position opportunities to score and then you turn the ball over. Credit Ireland’s defence and Ireland at the breakdown. They were very, very strong there.“Two weeks ago, there was a lot of talk about 12 wins on the bounce. People were saying all kinds of positive things about this team and not all of them were true. Right now, after two losses, people will be saying other things about this team and they won’t all be true either.“The truth is somewhere in the middle. We are a team that has plenty of work to do, we know that. I have always said that. Ultimately, in the last two weeks, we have played against two high-quality teams and they have been better than us. Huge credit to Ireland, they took their chances and their kicking game was excellent.”Borthwick also defended his fly-half, George Ford, who was jeered by large sections of the crowd after squandering two crucial penalty opportunities by kicking the ball dead instead of finding touch. “George has done so much good for England for such a long period of time and particularly over the last spell,” said Borthwick.“In the autumn he was outstanding and two weeks ago he played really well hereagainst Wales. You want to talk about individuals, but it is about the team. It is all of us today and it was all of us last week. We didn’t find a way to get the result we wanted and that’s all of our responsibility.”England v Ireland statsEllis Genge told BBC Sport: “What do you do? Two weeks in a row conceding so many points in the first 15 minutes. No one knows what the answer is right now or we would have sorted it out. It opened up scar tissue from last week. We have to be better at managing that period and stop turning the ball over.“We probably believed the hype from the first week too much. We can’t let the noise in now. Sorry to the fans, you have been outstanding. We have let everyone down, apologies for that but I promise we will make it better. ”Borthwick’s plans in shreds as ruthless Ireland heap more misery on England | Michael AylwinRead moreMaro Itoje,making his 100th appearance for England, also acknowledged his side had been the architects of their own downfall. “Ultimately, we weren’t accurate. We weren’t accurate in and around the breakdown and then when we had opportunities in Ireland’s 22 we weren’t accurate in taking them. We need to look at how we can make sure that when we do have territory and opportunities we convert them.”Ireland’s Dan Sheehan, in contrast, felt his team and their head coach, Andy Farrell, deserved significant credit. “That performance was right up there with one of the best we’ve ever had,” he told ITV Sport: “To get this win at Twickenham is special.“He [Farrell] just reminds us that if we get our systems right we have a plan to beat anyone. He gives us incredible belief. You look outside the group and there isn’t too much belief. But he and the coaching group have made us believe and helped us put a performance in today.”Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2026England rugby union teamIreland rugby union teamSteve BorthwickMaro ItojeRugby unionSix NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

For the neutral the final 11 matches for City and the Gunners promise to be a cannot-miss spectacle.By early Sunday evening Mikel Arteta’s side will be down to 10 games and 30 points left to play for, after theytravel to Tottenham. Emerge as victors from the north London derby andtheir advantage will be five points, with one match fewer to play, but after this City victory over Newcastle it is a mere two so a severe test of nerve awaits at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.‘Caipirinhas, daiquiris’: Guardiola tells City players to chill and ignore title pressureRead moreCity moved to 56 points with a goal difference of 31 (one fewer than the Gunners) courtesy of Nico O’Reilly’s first-half double. Towards the end Rayan Aït-Nouri could have calmed home tension when scampering free but a miskick in front of Nick Pope’s goal enabled Newcastle’s keeper to collect the ball.So the game finished 2-1 as City reeled off a 17th consecutive home league victory over the visitors, Eddie Howe’s men managing only Lewis Hall’s 22nd-minute equaliser.Despite the 5,058 miles round trip, Howe stood down only Harvey Barnes fromWednesday’s 6-1 hammering of Qarabag, with Jacob Ramsey the replacement. Fourteen minutes in and he was part of a midfield that went awol when O’Reilly scored the opener.Dan Burn ceded possession to Omar Marmoush clumsily. The Egyptian ran forward and squeezed the ball left; O’Reilly took a look, then fired beyond Pope, the goalkeeper’s right fingertips merely brushing the finish on its way past.Delight for those of a sky blue stripe and reward for a fast, physical mode. But there was an instant warning. The lightning fast Anthony Gordon broke along the left, turned Marc Guéhi in the area and shot low, with Gianluigi Donnarumma saving.Next, a similar counterattack forced two corners, and Newcastle equalised. Sandro Tonali dropped the second in, the ball came to Hall and his effort ricocheted off Aït-Nouri, defeating Donnarumma to his left.City’s lead lasted eight minutes, Newcastle’s parity five. O’Reilly’s second was a leaping header that went in to Pope’s left after a smart Antoine Semenyo feed to Erling Haaland was complemented by a deft right-foot cross.

An example came when a Tonali free-kick was headed in by Burn but the centre-back was offside – pushed into the position by Rúben Dias, though afterwards Howe said he had not seen this. Dias’s sluggish pace had forced him to haul down Gordon for Tonali’s set piece, and he was booked, then substituted for the second period – tactically, Guardiola confirmed – the far quicker Abdukodir Khusanov coming on.Soon after the break Hall curved a free-kick wide, then moments later Semenyo was off target, too, after a rapid central burst through wide-open opponents.Quick GuideManchester City 2-1 Newcastle key factsShow• Nico O’Reilly’s opener was Manchester City’s 500th Premier League goal at the Etihad Stadium under Pep Guardiola. They have netted 68 more home goals than any other team in the competition since 2016-17, while only Manchester United at Old Trafford under Sir Alex Ferguson (910 goals) have scored more goals for one manager at one stadium in Premier League history.• Lewis Hall’s equaliser (pictured) was Newcastle United’s first Premier League goal at the Etihad Stadium in 2,730 days, since September 2018 (DeAndre Yedlin), having failed to score in any of their six away league games against the Citizens in between.OptaPhotograph: Carl Recine/Getty Images EuropeWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Before the hour Rayan Cherki replaced Marmoush and Barnes and Joelinton took over from Nick Woltemade and Joe Willock.More chances followed. Anthony Elanga’s foray down the right ended with him crashing into the boardings before Semenyo, teed up at the other end, fluffed an attempt, Guardiola visibly disappointed.At 2-1 Newcastle retained hope – and Arsenal, too – of a second equaliser at least. For a prolonged passage they pinned City back, the hosts unable to get up the field – a rarity.As the four minutes of added time began, the substitute Phil Foden blazed at goal and Pope saved. Just before the close, City defended a corner at which Pope joined his outfield colleagues but still Guardiola’s men ended in the ascendancy.You might not bet against them ending there, too, when the title is handed out in May.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester CityNewcastle Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Hosts Wales had the lead until the 74th minute thanks to a spark lit by the wing Josh Adams, leaving the visitors with a feeling that they were lucky to come away with five points, which sent them to the top of the Six Nations table.This was just the third time Scotland have won the match directly after a victory over rivals England in theSix Nationsand their second-half resurgence came at the hands of their maverick Finn Russell. Who else could it have been? The fly-half is one of the best in the world and has been the architect of Scotland’s biggest victories over the last few years. He was largely quiet in the first 40 minutes, such was Wales’s impressive start, but two fast-paced tries either scored or created by Russell set Scotland on the comeback path.Wales 23-26 Scotland: Six Nations rugby union – live reactionRead moreAlthough in years to come the history books will just tell the story of a Scotland win, nothing can take away from Wales’s revitalised performance. In the first two rounds they were convincinglybeaten by Englandand France but here they had a chance to win right up until the last minute. That may not be a consolation to a proud nation who are fighting to be back to their best, and for their first win in this competition since 2023, but it is a step in the right direction.Wales also contended with injuries to Sam Costelow and Taine Plumtree; the head coach, Steve Tandy, said both “don’t look great”. The Wales captain, Dewi Lake, added that the loss is gut-wrenching: “It’s a tough feeling because you know the performance is there. The things we spoke about working on in the week I think we delivered. In that first half we were dominant, we applied pressure, we attacked them.“We have spoken a lot about staying in moments and we probably didn’t do that for the full 80, which is why the scoreboard has gone against us. I think we did enough to win that game which is what makes it so tough.”View image in fullscreenGeorge Turner burrows over to score the decisive try for Scotland.Photograph: Kieran McManus/ShutterstockCardiff on a Six Nations day is a special place to be, no matter the form of the home side. The city was buzzing with anticipation for some quality rugby and there was a bright note before kick-off with a healthy attendance of 70,649, a huge improvement from last week’s lowest Wales Six Nations crowd at home.Supporters watched on as two penalties saw Scotland gain territory in the early stages and in a resulting attack, a dangerous tackle by Joe Hawkins led to a yellow card for the Wales centre. A certain try looked on for Scotland, trying to take advantage of being a man up, but pressure was relieved from Welsh shoulders as Adams stole a long pass meant for Duhan van der Merwe.Quick GuideMatch detailsShowWales:Rees-Zammit; Hamer-Webb (Murray 62), James, Hawkins, Adams; Costelow (Evans 56), Williams; Carre (Smith 42), Lake (Elias 56), Francis (Griffin 51), Jenkins (Thomas 75), Carter, Plumtree (Botham 9), Mann, Wainwright.Tries:Carre, Adams.Cons:Costelow 2.Pens:Costelow 2, Evans.Scotland:Kinghorn; Steyn, Jones (Jordan 67), Tuipulotu, Van der Merwe (Graham 54); Russell, White (Horne 54); McBeth (Schoeman 34), Cherry (Turner 54), Z Fagerson (Millar-Mills 54), Williamson (Bayliss 34), Cummings (Gilchrist 67), Brown, Darge, M Fagerson.Tries:Steyn, Russell, Graham, Turner.Cons:Russell 3.Referee:Matthew Carley (Eng)Att:70,649Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.A lineout steal, two penalties and a few attacking phases later Rhys Carré was over. The try was met with a blur of celebrating arms and the air in the Principality Stadium switched from scepticism to belief.Kyle Steyn got Scotland on the board but it was Wales who continued to shine. Such was the hosts’ dominance that Gregor Townsend made two first-half changes with Nathan McBeth and Max Williamson axed before the break and Wales turned their pressure into points to go 17-5 up.The start of the second half saw Wales heap more coal on the fire by winning penalties and crucially finding a way to stop Russell being at his best. But eventually the Bath man came good and his try gave Scotland a lifeline back into the contest before an imaginative play by the fly-half, from a restart, put Darcy Graham through. A tight and contentious affair ensued with some excellent defence enabling the hosts to repel multiple Scotland attacks. But it was only a matter of time before the dam burst and Welsh hearts broke as the replacement George Turner’s try decided the game.Quick GuideSix Nations standingsShow1 ScotlandP3 W2 L1 PD +11 BP 211pts2 FranceP2 W2 L0 PD +64 BP 210pts3 IrelandP3 W2 L1 PD +6 BP 19pts4 EnglandP3 W1 L2 PD +9 BP 15pts5 ItalyP2 W1 L1 PD -4 BP 15pts6 WalesP3 W0 L3 PD -86 BP 11ptsWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Wales did win their first point of this year’s competition and will have the fallow week to lick their wounds before they play Ireland in round four.

Perhaps it was towards the end of the first half ofWest Ham’s game at Chelseaat the end of January with the away side leading 2-0. Or perhaps it was when West Ham took the lead against Manchester United 10 days later. As it turned out, West Ham won neither fixture; had they done so they would have had five points more and so been level with Tottenham going into this weekend. And then Tottenham’s proximity to relegation could not have been denied.West Ham’s revival means this isn’t like last season, when a win at Ipswich at the end of February took Tottenham to 33 points and as good as confirmed their continued presence in the Premier League, allowing Ange Postecoglou to focus on Europe. Were Spurs to pull off something extremely unlikely and beat Arsenal on Sunday, they would move to 32 and, for all the glee their fans would feel, nobody would feel secure.Mauricio Pochettino’s odd jab at Tim Weah misread the player and the moment | Leander SchaerlaeckensRead moreIf Nottingham Forest’sperformance at Fenerbahceis indicative of what is to come under Vítor Pereira, this may be a season when it actually does take 40 points, the traditional mark seen as necessary for survival, to stay up. Which should make every club in the bottom half a little anxious. Quite apart from the fact that Spurs really shouldn’t be in a relegation battle, it wasn’t at all clear under Thomas Frank where the four wins they may need were going to come from.For Spurs, this season has been the Niles Crane to last season’s Frasier. The obvious thing to do when the sitcom was created as a spin-off from Cheers would have been to make Frasier’s brother his opposite; the genius lay in making him an even more extreme version. For Tottenham, the relegation fears became more acute, the injuries even worse, the potential European redemption sought not in the Europa League but the Champions League. Everything was amplified.How do you follow winning the Europa League while finishing fourth bottom of the Premier League? By winning the Champions League while finishing third bottom of the Premier League, of course. Sadly the decisionto sack him has prevented Frankfrom ruefully agreeing with Ange Postecoglou that the third seasonisalways better than the second.View image in fullscreenIgor Tudor makes at least superficial sense as interim head coach.Photograph: Eric Gaillard/ReutersBut it was probably a necessary call. Spurs had won just two of their previous 17 league games and only five home games since November 2024. They have 12 players out injured. Fans were in almost open revolt. Something had to change and when a club reaches that point, the thing that changes is usually the manager.Frank had withered in the Spurs job. The affable, engaging figure of Brentford became brittle. He seemed to lose faith in himself and his players in him. The cohort of fans who had doubted whether Spurs should be appointing a manager from Brentford had grown by the week. They may not be a club much used to success, but Spurs are a club who expect to fail stylishly. Joyless football that brought only record low expected goals are not part of the history of Tottenham.It’s what comes next that is vital. Everything that has happened until now could be blamed on the old regime, onDaniel Levy, who was ousted as club chairin September. Frank was his appointment. Every signing up to Xavi Simons was his. Since then, as the Lewis family took greater control, there’s been a sense of waiting to see which direction the club would take, the situation only confused by the sporting director Fabio Paratici’s return to Italy three monthsafter resuming his postfollowing the expiration of a ban imposed for accounting irregularities while at Juventus.View image in fullscreenIgor Tudor is a relegation firefighter, his experience at Udinese ideal preparation for Spurs’ survival drive.Photograph: Chloe Knott/Tottenham Hotspur FC/ShutterstockDecision-making now is in the hands of the chief executive, Vinai Venkatesham, and the technical director, Johan Lange. After the two January arrivals – Conor Gallagher from Atlético and Souza, a 19-year-old Brazilian left-back from Santos – replacing Frank is their first big decision, the first clear indication of what the future might look like.Igor Tudor as an interimmakes at least superficial sense. He had worked for Paratici at Juventus and been discussed as a potential short-term option to replace Frank even before the sporting director’s move to Fiorentina. In Italy he became almost a specialist firefighter and, while all such appointments are risks, that is probably less of a gamble than turning to one of Frank’s assistants, or putting out the call for Ryan Mason, recently sacked by West Brom, to return for a third interim stint.But still, that’s three seasons out of the past six under a short‑term appointment (and one of those, Mason’s second reign, wasreplacing another acting manager in Cristian Stellini). That’s eight changes of manager in five years, which suggests neither stability nor a club particularly good at making appointments.The summer itself could be chaotic. Manchester United and Real Madrid will be appointing new managers. It would surprise no one if Manchester City, Liverpool and Barcelona were also hiring. Would Mikel Arteta stay on if Arsenal do not win the Premier League or the Champions League? Luis Enrique may leave Paris Saint-Germain and Oliver Glasner is leaving Crystal Palace, while Andoni Iraola and Marco Silva will be out of contract. Xabi Alonso and Roberto De Zerbi are available. By the middle of July, the World Cup will have released a host of managers on to the market, including, enticingly for Tottenham, Mauricio Pochettino.But before Spurs can begin to consider that, they have to know what division they will be in. The problems have not all disappeared with Frank. The injury crisis remains deep. Without Dejan Kulusevski and James Maddison there is an obvious dearth of creativity. Confidence is low. Tudor has worked with Randal Kolo Muani before and it would be very helpful for Spurs if he could get him back to something like his best to relieve the goalscoring burden on Dominic Solanke.Tudor has come through crises before, notably saving Udinese in 2018 by winning their final two games of the season. But at Spurs he takes over an injury-ravaged squad that has no experience of relegation battles. And this, assuredly, even if the gap to West Ham in third bottom is five points, is a relegation battle.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurInside footballcommentShareReuse this content"

In keeping with those over recent weeks, much of the performance was befitting of another three points. But, thanks to a couple of smart Djordje Petrovic saves and some profligacy in front of goal, the hosts had to make do with a draw – an expected goals (xG) total of 2.87 from 20 shots yielding a blank in the only column that matters.West Ham v Bournemouth: Premier League – liveRead moreTheir side’s continued resurgence does provide some encouragement for the home fans, however. From a position of hopelessness in mid-January, West Ham have lost just one of their last six league games, and the gap to a safe position is down to two points, at least until Nottingham Forest host Liverpool on Sunday. That is something to take heart from despite the fact they largely overwhelmed aBournemouthside whose unbeaten run extends to seven league games.“We were really close,” said Nuno. “That is the feeling that stays with us – that we feel it is almost there for us to take and we didn’t take it.“At the same time, we played well, we competed well and we were solid. But, overall, it was us who were really close and that’s why we are sad. Unfortunately today it was not to be.”In a match devoid of life for the best part of the middle hour – all sense of urgency dissolving in the early evening drizzle – it was the start and end that provided the notable moments.In the opening six minutes alone, West Ham had four shots. They should have scored at least one of them, but that would become a recurring theme as the afternoon wore on.View image in fullscreenAxel Disasi competes for the ball in a goalmouth scramble.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersAxel Disasi had head in hands after Petrovic palmed away his initial header and he turned the rebound over the bar from a couple of yards out, all within 45 seconds of kick-off. A fabulous flowing move swiftly followed, culminating in Taty Castellanos delivering a peach of a cross for Crysencio Summerville, but the in-form winger could only prod into Petrovic’s hands.Summerville has waited a considerable time for his West Ham career to catch light, but played with the confidence of someone who has scored six goals in his last seven appearances – a tally that makes him his team’s second highest scorer this season, despite all of them coming since the turn of the year. As West Ham’s main attacking outlet, Summerville displayed an abundance of trickery and a permanent desire to take on his opposite number, but provided little in the way of cutting edge.Having earlier seen a shot deflected on to the roof of the net, he might have scored when presented with a prime opportunity inside the Bournemouth box in the closing stages, but could not get the ball out from under his feet.Substitute Callum Wilson had a first-time flick excellently beaten away by Petrovic, a Castellanos bicycle kick briefly threatened the spectacular, and, deep in injury time, Jarrod Bowen failed to hit the target from a few yards out. “I was praying,” said Nuno, of the moment Bowen was played through on goal. It rather summed up the home side’s afternoon.Having appeared motionless for the first few minutes of the match, Bournemouth did improve after half-time, but largely fed off scraps.Bidding to become the first teenager to register a goal involvement in each of his first fourPremier Leagueoutings, the precocious Rayan produced his side’s one notable moment. After picking the ball up deep inside his own half and nonchalantly flicking it over a slide tackle, he continued all the way to the edge of the West Ham 18-yard box and curled it against the outside of the post.“It’s a good point for us,” said Andoni Iraola. “I didn’t like our performance in the first half; second half was much better. [West Ham] are in a good run and in need of results, and you can feel that from the beginning. We knew they would start strong, but we couldn’t equal their intensity.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueWest Ham UnitedBournemouthmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Luke Donald, who is expected to remain in office for a third stint as Europe’s Ryder Cup captain, wanted the situation with Hatton and Rahm resolved. Donald has only partly got his wish, with Adare Manor in 2027 looming ever closer.‘Pay up’: Rory McIlroy delivers Ryder Cup warning to LIV pair Hatton and RahmRead moreHatton joined Laurie Canter, Tom McKibbin, Thomas Detry, Adrian Meronk, Victor Perez, Elvis Smylie and David Puig in reaching agreement with the European Tour Group. Until now members of the DP World, formerly European, Tour were punished each time they played in the Saudi-backed LIV.“The conditions these members have accepted will provide additional value to the DP World Tour and benefit to the entire membership,” said the European Tour Group . “Provided each member satisfies the conditions of their individual releases, no disciplinary action under the regulations will be taken against them for playing in conflicting tournaments on LIVGolfin 2026 and they will retain their membership status.“The releases apply for the 2026 season only and they are not precedent-setting. Requests for releases will continue to be considered on their individual merits in accordance with the regulations that all members agree to abide by.”Notable by his absence is Rahm, who remains in conflict with the European Tour Group. The two-time major winner has been adamant he will not pay fines in Europe, which is due to lead him towards an appeal hearing.Should Rahm lose – and precedent suggests he will – he would be in default and facing suspensionfrom the Ryder Cup. Other Ryder Cup regulars placed in this position – Lee Westwood, Sergio García and Ian Poulter – resigned from the DP World Tour after losing appeals over fines. Rahm, a key part of Europe’s past four Ryder Cup teams, has yet to comment on the situation.In Dubai last month, Rory McIlroy called on Hatton and Rahm to step forward for Europe. “We went really hard on the Americans about being paid to play the Ryder Cup,” he said of events at the 2025 event. “We also said we would pay to play in Ryder Cups. There’s two guys that can prove it.”Explore more on these topicsRyder CupLIV Golf SeriesGolfnewsShareReuse this content"

The minnows kept themselves in this contest for far longer than 9.58 seconds, testing the second-tier side for just under an hour, before eventually the home side’s superiority told.Given they are paid only their travel expenses, while their opponents are chasing promotion to the top tier, that was an admirable effort from the lowest-ranked side in the Women’s FA Cup fifth round. They were powerless, though, to stop Birmingham charging into the quarter-finals with a hat-trick from Océane Hurtré.Selfies and juggling day jobs: Chatham Town land ‘amazing’ Women’s FA Cup tieRead moreThe hosts opened the floodgates in the later stages of a game they would have had wrapped up before half-time had it not been for an inspired performance from the Chatham goalkeeper, Simone Eligon, who represents Trinidad and Tobago. Boanas said afterwards that she was “an excellent keeper and probably deserves to be playing at a higher level”.She saved superbly from Hurtré and Lee Geum-min in the first half, before Hurtré’s cross-cum-shot opened the scoring. Eligon expertly tipped Veatriki Sarri’s strike on to the bar when the score was 2-0, before the hosts’ superiority became irresistible.The final score demonstrated the gulf in athleticism and fitness levels in the women’s pyramid and was not far off the standard set by the second-tier leaders, Charlton, in their 10-0 victory over fourth-tier Swindon in the fourth round. This competition is still waiting for its first shock since the top women’s sides turned professional. But Chatham’s Elle Jeffkins, who scored four times in their Cup run, said: “We’re proud to get this far, regardless of the score. We gave them a test in the first half. We came here today to enjoy it, regardless of the result, and we’re just proud.”Chatham will take away £127,000 in prize money for their run, which began in the third qualifying round at Beaconsfield and included eliminating two higher-league sides, AFC Wimbledon and Exeter, away from home. Boanas said: “They all did their best. They [Birmingham] are training every day and it was incredible to see the power and the pace. We couldn’t cope with that pace and power. I’ve said to them: ‘Hold your heads up high, no one can take away from you what you’ve done.’ It’s a special club and I’m glad we’ve been able to repay the chair to a point.”View image in fullscreenVeatriki Sarri scores Birmingham’s second goal with the Chatham keeper, Simone Eligon, is left on the ground.Photograph: Harriet Massey/The FA/Getty ImagesThis was their fourth away trip of their run and their first appearance in the fifth round. Their travelling supporters appeared to make up most of the crowd, outnumbering and outsinging the hosts. The club thought they could have brought several hundred more than the approximately 200 fans who did travel, if the game had not clashed with a home fixture for the men’s side. The Birmingham forward Lucy Quinn said: “We knew it was going to be difficult for us initially. When I heard their fans I was buzzing, that’s what you want to see, travelling fans, and it was a great atmosphere.”Chatham travelled to the Midlands on Saturday morning and enjoyed lunch together as a squad in Solihull, where Boanas showed the team a motivational montage of all 17 of the goals in their five victories to reach this stage.Birmingham’s head coach, Amy Merricks, is from Kent and began her coaching career at Gillingham, who rebranded as Chatham in 2023, so has something of a soft spot for the club. That certainly did not stop her side being ruthless in their pursuit of goals.Hurtré completed a classy treble while Sarri, Lee and Birmingham’s record signing, Wilma Leidhammar, were all on the scoresheet, with the lively substitute Batcheba Louis adding two goals. Quinn, who provided two assists, said: “We like to create and be fluid. It took a while for us to find that quality in the final third and then we did and it was really pleasing to see that training ground work come off.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's FA CupBirmingham City WomenWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

Colour theory? Yet more ways we’re supposed to live our livesFrancesca NewtonIn these times of social, political and even environmental instability, is it any wonder that we turn to influencers for instruction?Sat 21 Feb 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 21 Feb 2026 06.56 ESTShareAgroup of young women are about to try colour analysis for the first time. One says she suspects she’s not “supposed to wear gold”, and then holds up both hands swathed in gold rings and bracelets. The video cuts to the same woman with a strip of gold fabric laid across her chest. A sad trumpet sound plays before the strip is whipped off and replaced with a silver one. “See?” the analyst says. “Way better here.” The woman says: “Yeah”, but she sounds unhappy.Colour analysis is a method of picking out the shades that suit your skin tone. After its first life in the 1980s and 90s, “getting your colours done” found a new audience on TikTok in 2024 and has only become more popular since. This clip was one of many thrown up by my Instagram feed but it stuck with me, largely because it seemed so depressing in its portrayal of the trend as something to be endured rather than enjoyed. Directions on what you’re “supposed” or “not supposed” to wear, it intimated, should be followed even if it means sacrificing your own preferences.Some videos are more explicit, annotating photos of celebrities dressing “against their palette” withred crosses, or stating that “Wrong coloursdon’t whisper… they SCREAM”, as if by wearing a certain green you’re subjecting yourself or others to a form of torture.This doctrinal tone doesn’t just extend to what colours women should allow in their wardrobe. Social media platforms are full of messaging about the “right” hairstyle, neckline or skirt length. One trend sees women telling each other to “always remember” specific combinations of necklines and hairstyles, as though there were a singular formula for successful self-presentation and we will shortly have to sit an exam. Under the guise of “etiquette”, rules reach into the most trivial parts of life: howto sit, for example, or howto eata forkful of rice.Part of this must come down to the economics of engagement. To “influence” someone is to affect their actions, and using the imperative mood creates a sense of authority regardless of credentials (of which I suspect most aspiring rulemakers have none). Declamatory language attests to its own gravity, urgency and universality. It’s used because it presses you to listen.Still, I don’t think the demand is entirely confected. The thing in me that watches these videos – something in millions of us, judging by the engagement on these posts – does actuallydesiresome guidance on how to look, live, be. It wants to get ahead of life’s uncertainties by doing the things it’s told that smart, desirable women do – to comply with broadest-possible-appeal homogeneity if that also means approval and success.Few of us are consistently satisfied with our lives. Those few become fewer in periods of instability and living-standards decline. The rules on your feed promise a shortcut: act the right way or buy the right things and you will create a version of yourself so correct that this correctness forms a layer of insulation against the world’s problems. It’s no surprise that one of the most visible strains of rules-based content concerns “the grind”; even in the fashion and beauty posts, “elegance” often serves as an analogue for wealth.To an extent, all this is just a rehash of established advertising principles. Good marketing doesn’t make audiences want something: it convinces them they need it. But this time our status as rule followers is a part of the promotional package. We’re being sold belief systems and gurus rather than specific jumpers or pairs of jeans. And that, I think, speaks to a broader phenomenon: a desire not only for the outcomes but for rules themselves.Beyond Order by Jordan Peterson review – more rules for lifeRead moreWe live in a moment when real-world rules feel particularly weak. That applies both at the highest geopolitical level and at the point of personal conduct.Young people feelthe conventional tenets of hard work and financial prudence no longer apply, and even the rules we learn as kids – to treat others kindly or say sorry when we’ve done something wrong – our leaders nowopenly mock. TikTok and Instagram’s frantic energy is filling that gap, sometimes consciously. Search “rules for life” on Instagram and you’ll find millions of Jordan Petersons proselytising their way to be a person.On an individual level, of course, lots of the rules have merit. Meditating every morning probablywouldmake me calmer. Following the60-second rulewouldhelp me structure my day. But I’m not convinced that happiness can come in the context of the minutely prescribed existence that incorporating more than a few would demand. You can’t discipline yourself out of your historical context; you can only find ways to face it. Friends will laugh at me writing about colour like this, given I mostly wear black, but the point is that it’s what I like.Francesca Newton is a writer and editorDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Their next opportunity to demand more cash arrives when Rachel Reeves delivers her spring statement on 3 March.All the signs are that the chancellor will try to marry caution about the public finances – directed at backbench MPs – with an optimistic message about the economic recovery to cheer the public.Whatever she says, there will be many on her own side who will demand that economic orthodoxy be ditched in favour of a bolder outlook delivered with a Liz Truss-like energy. Where the former prime minister extolled the virtues of tax cuts as economic rocket boosters, Labour MPs will instead trumpet public spending as the engine of growth.Last week’s figures showinga record haul of tax receipts in Januarywill have fuelled this desire, revealing, supposedly, that the Treasury is in good shape and able to accommodate their many and varied spending demands.A drop in inflation from3.4% in December to 3% in Januarywas also good news, as was the increased likelihood of a cut in interest rates by the Bank of England for struggling businesses and the mainly younger half of the population up to their ears in mortgage debt.UK manufacturing still beset by low orders and price pressure, says CBIRead moreLower inflation and lower interest rates, possibly cut from 3.75% to as low as 3% by the end of the year, will not only ease the cost of living crisis – which is still a crisis – it will also help the public finances.Record tax receipts in January were joined by lower interest bills on government borrowing. Lower inflation will give public sector bodies more spending power and quell demands from unions for mega pay rises.City economists estimate that there could be £10bn to £11bn more headroom when the chancellor gives her update on the public finances next month. That would push the Treasury’s financial buffer up to more than £30bn.More broadly, surveys of the private sector show businesses are feeling more confident about the coming year, and company directors say that after a long hiatus, they are considering making investments again.A major injection of private sector investment is what has been missing from the UK economy since the 2008 financial crash, so a rebound would be exactly the kind of lift Reeves and the government would cherish.Retail sales improved in January beyond City economists’ expectations. Shoppers bought electronic goods by the bag load, trading in their barely out-of-the-box TVs and mobile phones for new models.Yet the improved economic news cannot disguise the weaknesses at the heart of the UK economy and the excess demands on the public finances, which should put Labour MPs who agitate for more spending on the back foot.Looking again at January’s tax receipts, it’s clear that much of the extra money came from capital gains tax (CGT) payments, and these were generated by individuals offloading assets to avoid tax hikes in the future.That means the jump in CGT revenue was likely to have been based on one-off property and financial asset sales, and so gives little indication of the longer-term prospects for tax receipts.Whatever happens between now and the end of the financial year, UK borrowing is likely to total about £130bn and be just short of 4.5% of annual national income – a figure the financial markets believe indicates the government is financially incontinent.Baked into the forecasts of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) are deep budget cuts for most Whitehall departments to preserve more generous funding for the NHS, schools and defence. It’s only when the stringent spending limits imposed on most civil servants are kept in place that the annual deficit begins to fall.Where are the pressure points on the public finances? One example is the £6bn in funding unaccounted for in 2029 from the additional cost of supporting children with special educational needs.A report last week from the County Councils Network said spending on transport for Send children alone could be as much as £3.5bn in 2030. This is another bill that lies outside the current budget forecasts.The prime minister has his own pet projects. Defence is currently his main focus and the budget for it may need to rise by as much as £10bn to meet a commitment to boost defence spending to 3% of national income by the end of the parliament.Quite how he plans to carve out the funds to reach the 5% of national income in 2034 demanded by Donald Trump is not clear, but assuredly for a future prime minister to consider.It is an illustration of how spare money is largely illusory at the moment. The public finances are in a precarious position and can still be blown off course by a rise in borrowing costs or the rising cost of youth unemployment, which will continue unless more investment can be deployed to boost growth.Labour’s leftist MPs are in the same camp as the Green party leader, Zack Polanski, and the many Tory and Reform UK MPs who wish for things they cannot afford. There is no magic money tree. Liz Truss gave us an object lesson in chutzpah that no one wants to relive.Explore more on these topicsEconomic policyViewpoint columnEconomicsLabourTax and spendingInflationInterest ratesnewsShareReuse this content"

But though our faces anxiously turn to the sky, our hands are joined in a solidarity that rises above hungerSat 21 Feb 2026 07.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 21 Feb 2026 07.25 ESTShareEvery year, Ramadan comes as a sanctuary for the soul. For Muslims like me, it is a sacred pause in the chaos of life. But this year, as a woman displaced from the familiar streets of Gaza City to a rented room in Al-Zawayda, I am searching for a peace that feels like a ghost. The world calls this a “ceasefire”, yet from my window the silence feels heavy. We are holding our breath because the fear of death has not disappeared, it has just become unpredictable.I did not welcomeRamadanthis year with the golden lanterns that once adorned our balconies. I welcomed it to the roar of bulldozers clearing the bones of neighbouring houses and with the constant buzz of thezanana, the Israeli surveillance drones, overhead. Even as we stand in prayer, that metallic humming drowns out theadhan, the call to prayer, reminding us that we are still watched and that our “calm” rests at the mercy of a sudden strike.My heart remains in theruins of Gaza City. I mourn the vibrant life of Al-Zawiya market, the scent of its spices, and theal-Omari mosque, where our collective prayers once felt like an unbreakable fortress. Ramadan used to mean true warmth to me. I experienced it at my family home in Gaza, in the Rimal neighborhood, where the table brought us together, filled with laughter and peace. Sometimes I would break my fast with my family, sometimes with friends or neighbours, as if the month were teaching us that the heart had room for everyone.Today, we stand in cramped rooms, our ears tilted toward the sky. We pray for mercy and listen for the whistle of a missile that may decide our “truce” has expired. Displacement has turned every ritual into a mountain to climb. The cost of food and drink for the entire month of Ramadan used to be no more than 1,000 shekels, while today it is easily 3,500 shekels without even fully meeting basic needs.As I walk home from work just before sunset, I move through rubble and sand that fill the air and sting the eyes. The road I take is a winding path between collapsed buildings and deep craters. At that hour, my thoughts are simple: what can I prepare foriftar, when we break our fast, from so little? Ramadan evenings once meant anticipation – choosing where to break our fast, stepping into spaces filled with light and laughter. Now, I calculate portions of lentils and count what remains in the cupboard, trying to create something that still feels like home.Even through this grief and exhaustion, I see a defiant and beautiful hope. In Al-Zawayda, neighbours share their small portions of lentils or dates with dignity that rises above hunger. This solidarity is our sacred resistance. It is our way of declaring that even if our homes are destroyed, the human spirit within us will not be crushed. We light a single candle, not because it will keep the darkness away, but because the act of lighting it is itself a victory over despair.Young Muslims have created an inclusive Ramadan that works for everyone. Now that’s in danger | Nosheen IqbalRead moreRamadan for the children is the hardest part. They have learned the language of war, and can hear the difference between a shell and an explosion, even before they have learned the songs of Ramadan. When they ask “Will the bombing return tomorrow?” they are really asking if they have a future. Something we can’t answer – for them or ourselves. Yet when I see them hanging a torn decoration on the side of a tent, I understand something essential: inGaza, hope is not a feeling. It is a decision.Please understand, while you at home may hear that it is quiet here – with fewer stories in the news about usand afragile “ceasefire”reported – quiet is not peace. Real peace is the right to the ordinary. To walk to a market that still exists and hasn’t been turned to rubble, to pray in a mosque that has not been desecrated, to go home to a neighbourhood that hasn’t been flattened, to sleep without wondering whether silence is merely the prelude to another nightmare.This Ramadan in Gaza comes with a different spirit. As theadhansounds tonight, I feel a flicker of tranquility. Not because the world is just or we can see an end to our suffering, but because we are still here, weaving hope from threads of ruin. We fast, we pray and we remain – not out of habit, but as an act of reclaiming our souls from the wreckage.Majdoleen Abu Assi is a project coordinator and humanitarian practitioner based in Gaza, PalestineDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s not just the sickening subservience shown to Vladimir Putin, an indicted war criminal and mass killer. It’s not only the victim-blaming and bullying of Kyiv into making concessions. It’s not even Donald Trump’s crass attempts tomonetise the warand milk the misery of millions forNobel glory, while undercutting Nato allies and trampling sovereign rights.What really shocks, and hurts, is the sheer bad faith shown by a country that Europeans always counted a friend. As the 18th-century English gothic novelist Ann Radcliffe noted, “few circumstances are more afflicting than a discovery of perfidy in those whom we have trusted”. To echo Trump’s dark warning after he was rebuffed over Greenland:Europe will remember.As the full-scale war Putin launched in 2022 stumbles into its fifth bloody year this Tuesday, Europe, like Russia, is in deep trouble. Yet so too is the US, though Trump and his mouthy muppets, Marco Rubio and JD Vance, don’t realise it yet. Most Europeansnow regardtheir foremost partner as unreliable, even a foe. US global influence and leadership is fading fast, to gleeful China’s huge advantage. Everywhere, autocrats rejoice, as do Europe’s advancing far-right parties.“The question of how this war is going to end is actually an existential question for Europe,” said Wolfgang Ischinger, chair of this month’s Munich Security Conference. “It will determine – in more ways than one – the future of this continent.” But the war is proving definitive, too, for Trump and his blinkered, bigoted Maga ideologues. Glossing over Russian depredations (and the illegal Venezuela coup), Rubio chose in Munich to target globalisation, “climate cults” and multiculturalism. The US secretary of state urged a return to ultranationalism, protectionism, closed borders andChristian culture. “Yesterday is over,” he declared.Little Marco (as Trump calls him) is confused. Trumpism is all about recreating yesterday, about fantasies of “the good old days”. Putin suffers similar delusions. The war is part of his revanchist project to make Russia great again, to rebuild the Soviet sphere. Likewise, Xi Jinping, China’s leader, isattemptinghis own great leap backwards, by accumulating dictatorial powers to an extent unseen since Mao Zedong.The open-minded, freedom-loving rainbow Europe of democracy and the rule of law is a living rebuke to these lumbering Frankenstein’s retro-monsters and their hard-right emulators. They revile and fear it. LikeUkraine, it stands in their way.10:37Does Trump really care about peace in Ukraine? - The LatestThe US betrayal of Ukraine, foreshadowing its broader treachery, did not start with Trump. Bill Clinton’s post-independence 1994 security assurances for Kyivprovedmeaningless. Barack Obama blinked when Putin seized Crimea in 2014. Joe Biden, haunted by cold war ghosts,reactedwith fatal overcaution to the 2022 invasion.What’s changed is that Trump’s betrayals are deliberate, and are happening now. Each dawn brings another day of infamy. Last year, Ukraine’s civilian casualties hit their highest annual levelsince the war beganas Putin expanded a war that Trump pledged to end in 24 hours. Direct US weapons supplies have been cut to almost zero. Trump’s risible “peace process”, overseen by a business crony and his simpering son-in-law,indulges Putin’s maximalist demandswhile excluding Europe.Trump’s 28-point “peace plan” – a lopsided roadmap to Russian victory – was swiftly discredited. Yet he is still insisting Kyiv surrender sovereign territory, setting a catastrophic precedent, and withholding security guarantees. He still aims to make a quick buck out of Ukraine’s mineral resources and postwar deals with Russia. He still habitually bullies Ukraine’s admirable president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy. And still he belittles European allies while courting Putin and authoritarians such as Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, Argentina’s Javier Milei and Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu.For shameless treachery, Trump has no modern equal. Yet the belief is growing that it cannot and will not continue. How much longer can willing dupes such as the Nato chief,Mark Rutte, prate about vital transatlantic ties when Trump is daily dissolving them in acid and vitriol? How dare Rubio lecture Europeans on Christian civilisation while he and other New World barbarians wink at Israeli atrocities in Gaza? Now they plan to attack Iran, again, and maybe Cuba, too. By what right?A war foretold: how the CIA and MI6 got hold of Putin’s Ukraine plans and why nobody believed themRead moreTrump’s perfidious tyranny, equally toxic at home and abroad, will only worsen the longer it’s tolerated. Despite all the obvious obstacles and difficulties, it’s imperative that Europeans, and the pre-midterms, anti-Trump American majority, begin to speak with one voice – and match words with actions. And where better to start than in Ukraine, the actual and symbolic frontline in the battle between liberal democracy and the Trump-Putin axis?Here’s what must be done: deploy troops from a European “coalition of the willing” to secure and defend Kyiv and other unoccupied cities; Russia cannot be allowed a veto. Enforce a no-fly exclusion zone, as I haverepeatedly urged. Surge defensive missiles and drones. Beach Russia’s shadow fleet. Step up covert “active measures”, including cyber and sabotage, to counter Kremlin hybrid warfare. Seize assets, expel spies, expose lies, change the narrative. Europe must demand an immediate ceasefire, followed by phased Russian withdrawals, and assume a lead role in any final settlement talks.If not, why not? For consider the alternatives: endless war, endless killing, or an unsustainable, unjust peace on Trump-Putin terms. Europe is on notice: the US cannot be trusted. The challenge is indeed existential. All that it stands for and holds dear is potentially at stake. No matter how it’s done, for the sake of Ukraine’s exhausted, undefeated people and their own future peace and security, Europeans (including Britain) must finally find the unity, courage and wherewithal to take the military, economic, diplomatic and moral offensive.Europe musttake the fightdirectly to Putin’s door. And tell Trump to get lost.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorExplore more on these topicsUkraineOpinionDonald TrumpVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyyUS foreign policyRussiaNatocommentShareReuse this content"

Stephen Colbert takes his interview with a rising Democratic politician to YouTubeinstead of his own late-night show. The CBS Evening News anchorpresents a misleading versionof the network’s own exclusive reporting on Ice arrests. And a news producer writes a farewell note to her CBS News colleaguesblaming the loss of editorial independence.If you connect the dots, the picture of what’s happening at CBS becomes all too clear. That picture comes into even sharper focus once you recall an underlying factor: the network’s parent company istrying to get a big commercial deal doneand needs the help of the Trump administration to bring it over the finish line.“Media capture” is the name that University of Pennsylvania scholar Victor Pickard gives to what we’re seeing unfold before our eyes.What’s happening at CBS and elsewhere “isn’t a singular breakdown”, Pickardwritesin a new analysis.It’s a whole cascade of layers – media ownership, control and market structure – that “endanger our information and communication systems, our First Amendment freedoms, and our democracy”.In theCBSsituation, the immediate motivation is easy to understand. The network’s parent company, Paramount Skydance, wants to buy Warner Brothers Discovery, which also owns CNN – one of Donald Trump’s favorite punching bags and a news organization he would love to see take the same rightward turn as CBS.Paramount Skydance is run by David Ellison, son of Larry Ellison, the Trump pal and one of the richest people on earth. Their effort is somewhat against the odds, since Warner Brothers Discovery’s boardfavors a competing offerfrom Netflix.But the Ellisons haven’t given up, and they have some powerful friends in their corner, since any deal may need FCC approval. The Trump-appointed chairperson of the FCC, Brendan Carr, has shown himself to be a political animal, not the impartial and public-spirited leader that this crucial role calls for.So much of what’s happened at CBS – the back-of-the-hand treatment of Colbert and the rightward drift of the news division – are ways of signalling that the Ellisons are more than willing to serve Trump’s interests.If Paramount Skydance does end up controlling CNN, Cooper – one of the cable network’s most prominent faces – may find that trouble is following him. (Publicly, Cooper, who has had an unusual arrangement working for both CNN and 60 Minutes, says he wants to spend more time with his children; but he’s alsoreportedlyunhappy with the direction of the show under CBS News editor Bari Weiss, who reports directly to David Ellison.)As for Colbert, he has made no secret of where he stands, not just this last week when his interview with a Democratic Texas lawmaker ran into internal network roadblocks.Months ago, after CBS settled a frivolous lawsuit brought by Trump last year, Colbert – on air – labeled the settlement a “big, fat bribe”. Soon after, the network decidednot to offer him another contract.It’s all a vivid example of a worrisome problem in American media. As media companies become more consolidated, and ever more in the hands of the richest Americans, priorities change radically. Editorial independence weakens; self-censorship grows.The dominoes of capitulation seem to tumble voluntarily.“The government doesn’t have to formally censor anyone,”wroteParker Molloy on her newsletter, The Present Age. “It just has to make enough threats that corporations start censoring themselves.”No surprise then that, in presentingCBS News researchabout immigrants arrested by ICE, the network’s evening news anchor, Tony Dokoupil, earlier this month inverted the original reporting to emphasize the crimes – not that so few of the crimes are violent. After all, that would have been contrary to how Trump has portrayed ICE-arrested immigrants as rapists and murderers. (DUIs, or driving under the influence, the reporting showed, far outpaced homicides and sexual assaults.)And no surprise that, in leaving the network, journalist Alicia Hastey lamented that stories increasingly are “evaluated not just on their journalistic merits but on whether they conform to a shifting set of ideological expectations”.I’ve heard fascism described as the dangerous combination of state power and corporate power. And here we are.With a politicized FCC, a self-interested president surrounded by soulless lackeys, and corporate media bosses trying to protect commercial interests, we’re far down that road.To pull it back means serious policy reform. For starters, that would mean strict limits on media consolidation, support for independent local journalism, and a truly nonpartisan FCC.At the moment that’s highly unlikely, since such reform must be driven by those who understand that journalism is meant to serve the public – not to help the rich and powerful buy their next yachts.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsCBSOpinionAnderson CooperStephen ColbertUS television industryWarner BrosNetflixMergers and acquisitionscommentShareReuse this content"

Patients went without treatment – not because health workers failed them, but because the system did. For a nation committed to universal healthcare, free at the point of use, it was a moment of hard truth.Even outwardly strong public health systems can be fragile. As donor assistance bites across the continent, governments cannot afford to delay building resilience.As a stable, middle-income country, Botswana was only ever a peripheral recipient of aid. Yet whendiamond revenues – the country’s primary export – fellamid a market downturn, the fiscal shock was no different in effect.For many, the conclusion was simple: less revenue leads to worse health outcomes.The reality is more nuanced. Diamond revenues enabled Botswana to build a universal public health system. Even in one of the world’s most sparsely populated countries, most people in Botswana are rarely more than five kilometres away from a clinic.Yet the same diamond revenues that built our system also masked its weaknesses. Problems were paid away rather than fixed. Drug prices were inflated many times over. Supply chains were inefficient. Public capacity was hollowed out through outsourcing. These failures did not suddenly appear but accumulated over the years.double quotation markWhen shortages hit, it is the government that people turn to. Democratic responsibility cannot be subcontractedFalling revenues simply made them impossible to ignore. When healthcare systems face a moment of reckoning, the same prescription is reliably offered: inject more “private-sector rigour” into inefficient public health delivery. But greater reliance on private provision fragments care, raises costs and diverts scarce health budgets into profit margins.Private providers have an important role to play. Still, where care can be delivered at cost within a strong public system, it is simply more affordable – and more sustainable – than outsourcing it.Moreover, when healthcare is outsourced, accountability becomes blurred. But when shortages hit, it is the government that people turn to. Democratic responsibility cannot be subcontracted.Botswana is expanding public capacity. We are bringing our largest private hospital into public ownership to relieve pressure on overstretched facilities.We are restructuring the national medicines procurement body, making it autonomous to cut bureaucratic delays. A national health intelligence centre will soon be operational, using real-time data to forecast medicine demand and prevent shortages. And once the health insurance bill passes parliament, health funding will be ringfenced – ending our exposure to swings in commodity markets.Together, these reforms will determine whether a mother can find antibiotics for her child, or whether a patient needing dialysis must travel huge distances for care.But no country of two-and-a-half million people can fully secure its medicine supply alone. Africa must ultimately produce more of the treatments its people rely on. The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which brings55 countries into a single market, offers a chance to do what Europe and Asia did decades ago: build regional pharmaceutical industries designed to serve public health first.‘A bright life ahead’: Botswana on path to seeing no babies born with HIVRead morePharmaceutical manufacturing needs scale and predictable demand. AfCFTA provides both, turning fragmented national markets into a regional economy large enough to draw investment. It also creates the conditions for governments to use African suppliers in public procurement, turning health budgets into a driver of industrial development.AfCFTA has been largely ratified, yet implementation remains uneven. Now governments must give it force through their laws, their institutions and their choices.Ambition for the continent only works when governments take responsibility at home.Resilience is not created by spending alone; it is built through public capacity, which only governments can sustain. Botswana has learned this through crisis. Diamond revenues built our healthcare system; dependence on them weakened it. Shock exposed the cracks. Now reform must rebuild it.Duma Gideon Bokoispresident of BotswanaExplore more on these topicsGlobal developmentOpinionHealth policyBotswanaAfricacommentShareReuse this content"

Mountbatten-Windsor has denied Giuffre’s allegations and the payment was made without any admission of liability.He was stripped of his remaining royal titles late last year as more information about his links to Epstein emerged, but retains his place in the line of succession, behind Prince William and his three children and Prince Harry and his two children.Line of successionMountbatten-Windsor, who was arrested and questioned on his 66th birthday on Thursday, is still officially a counsellor of state – a member of the group of royals who could stand in for the king if he is ill or abroad. However, it is understood that this is highly unlikely to happen in practice, as only working royals are asked to deputise.Removing him from the line of succession would require fresh legislation, which would need the support of MPs and peers, as well as royal assent from the king. It would also have to be backed by the 14 Commonwealth countries where the king is head of state.Ministers have suggested that the government has already made overtures to the palace about plans for a law change once the police investigation has concluded. Luke Pollard, a defence minister, told BBC Radio 4 that the government had “absolutely” been working with the palace on its plans to stop Mountbatten-Windsor from “potentially being a heartbeat away from the throne”.He said this was something he hoped would “enjoy cross-party support” but added that “it’s right that this is something that only happens when the police investigation concludes”.James Murray, the chief secretary to the Treasury, told Sky News: “The government is considering any further steps that might be required, and we’re not ruling anything out. But at this stage, it would be inappropriate for us to go any further because there is a live police investigation under way.”Ed Davey said the Liberal Democrats would support any legislation to remove Mountbatten-Windsor from the line of succession, saying any ascension to the throne would be “intolerable”.Mountbatten-Windsor is the first royal to be arrested in more than 350 years, since Charles I was taken prisoner after his defeat by parliamentary forces in 1647 in the English civil war. He was found guilty of treason and executed two years later.The former Duke of York was questioned by detectives from Thames Valley police on Thursday and spent 11 hours in police custody. He was released under investigation and there are understood to be no restrictions on his movements while officers continue their inquiries.The force said on Saturday that searches at his former home, Royal Lodge in Windsor, were likely to continue over the weekend. Detectives have already searched Mountbatten-Windsor’s new home, on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk. Items seized from the properties are now being examined, it is understood.View image in fullscreenKing Charles III at a fashion show this week.Photograph: Pixelformula/SIPA/ShutterstockThames Valley police said it was yet to take formal early investigative advice from the Crown Prosecution Service, meaning a decision on whether to charge Mountbatten-Windsor could be some time away.Mountbatten-Windsor has declined to comment on any of the recent developments, but has previously denied wrongdoing in relation to his friendship with Epstein, who took his own life in a New York prison cell after being charged with child sex trafficking offences in 2019.The former prince continued his friendship with Esptein after his conviction for child sex offences in 2008, visiting him in New York, inviting him to Buckingham Palace and sending him intimate family photographs.Ghislaine Maxwell, another close friend of Mountbatten-Windsor and an accomplice of Epstein, is serving a 20-year prison sentence in the US for her role in his crimes.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

There was no immediate comment from Kabul, and reports on social media suggested the strikes were carried out inside Afghanistan.Pakistan’s information minister, Attaullah Tarar, wrote on X that the military conducted “intelligence-based, selective operations” against seven camps belonging to the Pakistani Taliban, known as Tehreek-e-TalibanPakistan(TTP), and its affiliates. He said an affiliate of Islamic State was also targeted in the border region.In October, Pakistan also conducted strikes deep inside Afghanistan to target militant hideouts.Tarar said Pakistan “has always strived to maintain peace and stability in the region”, but added that the safety and security of Pakistani citizens remained a top priority.The latest development came days after a suicide bomber, backed by gunmen, rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into the wall of a security post in Bajaur district in north-western Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan. The blast caused part of the compound to collapse, killing 11 soldiers and a child, and authorities later said the attacker was an Afghan national.Hours before the latest border strikes, another suicide bomber targeted a security convoy in the nearby Bannu district in the north-west, killing two soldiers, including a lieutenant colonel.After Saturday’s violence, Pakistan’s military warned it would not “exercise any restraint” and operations against those responsible would continue “irrespective of their location”, language that suggested rising tensions between Islamabad and Kabul.Tarar said Pakistan had “conclusive evidence” that the recent attacks, includinga suicide bombing that targeted a Shiite mosque in Islamabadand killed 31 worshippers earlier this month, were carried out by militants acting at the “behest of their Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers”.He said Pakistan had repeatedly urged Afghanistan’sTalibanrulers to take verifiable steps to prevent militant groups from using Afghan territory to launch attacks in Pakistan, but alleged that no substantive action had been taken.He said Pakistan urged the international community to press Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities to uphold their commitments under the Doha agreement not to allow their soil to be used against other countries.Pakistan has seen a rise in militant violence in recent years, much of it blamed on the TTP andoutlawed Baloch separatist groups. The TTP is separate from but closely allied with Afghanistan’s Taliban, who returned to power in 2021. Islamabad accuses the TTP of operating from inside Afghanistan, a charge the group and Kabul deny.Relations between the neighbouring countries have remained tense since October, when deadly border clashes killed dozens of soldiers, civilians and suspected militants. The violence followed explosions in Kabul that Afghan officials blamed on Pakistan.A Qatar-mediated ceasefire has largely held, but talks in Istanbul failed to produce a formal agreement, and relations remain strained.Explore more on these topicsPakistanAfghanistanSouth and central AsiaTalibannewsShareReuse this content"

Lots of mobile type homes? Lots of ‘Dags’”. He then added: “You are the MSOC pikey liaison.”The misconduct panel during a tribunal concluded that these were “deliberate messages that clearly link the Irish Traveller community to acts of theft”.The word “dags” is believed to be a reference to a scene in the Guy Ritchie film Snatch in which Brad Pitt plays a Gypsy. During the scene, the character played by Stephen Graham struggles to understand Pitt’s accent when he says “dogs”. The panel found that the word was “derogatory” because it refers to an instance when a Gypsy character’s accent is “mocked”.Luker was a member of a WhatsApp group called “Selbie Gumshoes” with other members of the Major Serious and Organised Crime (MSOC) team.During another WhatsApp conversation on 17 March 2025, Luker wrote: “Off to find some scrap metal, lead roofing and cable”, in response to a video sent by another group member of “Paddy Day parade on Inishbofin” alongside the message “Just like a Disney World Parade. They know how to put on a show”.The panel said that Luker’s message was “deliberate and discriminatory” because it linked the Gypsy, Roma and Traveller community to theft.He also used the word “pikey” again in messages that were sent on 27 March 2025.During the tribunal, the panel heard that Luker accepted that “scrap metal, lead roofing and cable” was a joke to associate theft with the Irish Traveller community but said he did not intend for the word “pikey” in the messages to be offensive.Luker was one of the first responders to the terror attack on London Bridge which took place on 3 June 2017. He said that one of his coping mechanisms for dealing with the day was the use of humour, the panel heard.The panel concluded that DC Luker is not “inherently racist”.“As an experienced BTP police officer used to dealing with a whole range of people, the panel found that, on the balance of probabilities, he probably would have known that this was an especially offensive use of language directed towards members of a minority community,” the panel wrote.Explore more on these topicsPoliceRacenewsShareReuse this content"

He added that it could be a solution for countries needing to get water to marooned communities after hurricanes such as Beryl and Melissa, which left thousands without water.View image in fullscreenOmar Yaghi is a professor of chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley.Photograph: Brittany Hosea-Small/AP“Hurricanes such as Melissa or Beryl unleashed heavy flooding, destroying homes and crops and impacting thousands of lives in the Caribbean. This devastation is a stark reminder of the urgent need for enhanced water supply resilience in vulnerable areas, particularly small island nations susceptible to extreme weather events,” Yaghi said.The invention, Yaghi added, could provide a climate-friendly and sustainable alternative to other water sourcing options such as desalination, which may pose a threat to ecosystems when concentrated salty brine is released back into the ocean.Last month, aUN report saidthe planet had entered a “global water bankruptcy era” with nearly three-quarters of the world’s population living in countries classified as water-insecure or critically water insecure.“Around 2.2 billion people still lack safely managed drinking water, 3.5 billion lack safely managed sanitation and about 4 billion experience severe water scarcity for at least one month a year,” the report said.View image in fullscreenDamage caused by Hurricane Beryl in 2024 on Union Island in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.Composite: ReutersIn the three-island Caribbean nation of Grenada,which was devastated by Hurricane Beryl in 2024, Yaghi’s invention offers a ray of hope, particularly for Carriacou and Petite Martinique that bore the brunt of the disaster and face a triple threat of storms, drought and coastal erosion.“The technology’s ability to function off-grid using only ambient energy is particularly compelling for our context,” said the Carriacou government official and environmentalist Davon Baker.Carriacou and Petite Martinique, which are still experiencing the after-effects of Beryl, are forced to import water from Grenada to deal with dry seasons that appear to be getting more intense and longer every year.“We’re currently considering comprehensive recovery and resilience strategies, and the atmospheric water-harvesting technology Prof Yaghi developed addresses several critical challenges we face: the high cost and carbon intensity, as well as the contamination risk, of water importation; vulnerability of centralised systems to hurricane damage; and the need for decentralised solutions that can operate when traditional infrastructure fails,” Baker said.Extreme heat lab: enduring the climate of the futureRead moreYaghi, who grew up in a refugee community in Jordan, said he was inspired by the hardships he endured in a home with no running water or electricity. Giving his Nobel prize banquet speech, he recalledwater arriving to his desert community from the government once every week or two.“I remember the whisper through our neighbourhood, ‘the water is coming’, and the urgency as I rushed to fill every container I could find before the flow stopped.”Describing the invention as “a science capable of reimagining matter” he urged leaders to “remove barriers, protect academic freedom” and “welcome global talent”.“On climate, the hour for collective action has already arrived. The science is here. What we need now is courage – courage scaled to the enormity of the task – so we may gift the next generation not only carbon capture, but a planet worthy of their hopes,” he said.Explore more on these topicsWaterClimate crisisExtreme weatherNobel prizesPeople in scienceChemistrynewsShareReuse this content"

Corpse flower blooms, once vanishingly rare, are becoming more commonplace in Australia.More than a dozen bloomed across the country in 2025, including the infamousPutricia in Sydney, Morpheus in Canberra, Big Betty in Cooktown, and Spud and co in Cairns. But with plants kept in gardens across the country, and blooming more frequently after their first flower, you could catch a whiff of one soon.“Australia has one of the highest flowering events in the world,” said Matt Coulter, senior horticulture curator at the Botanic Gardens ofSouth Australia. The country was among the top three places for the number of corpse flowers blooming, he said, with plants coming to an age where they were likely to flower more often.Adelaide, known for its hot, dry summers, has become an unlikely capital for propagating these endangered plants from the equatorial rainforests of Sumatra, Indonesia.She looks like a ‘deformed penis’ and smells like a dead possum: Sydney goes wild for its blooming corpse flowerRead moreThere, Smellanie, one of three original plants grown from seeds acquired in 2006, had just finished its second flowering. Coulter has propagated many more from both leaf cuttings and pollination. The state’s corpse flower collection now holds in excess of 250 plants across different generations – the largest in Australia, and possibly the world.Smellanie “turned out to be a perfect flower”, he said, with a deep crimson outer layer and powerful stench. At 2.13m tall it was the largest the garden had shown to the public – its aroma reminiscent of “fermenting cabbage”, “strong blue cheese” or “old sweaty socks”.Corpse flowers are notoriously unpredictable. Most plants take 10-12 years to be able to produce their first flower, he said. Afterwards they could flower at intervals of three to five years, although in some cases it could be longer.1:50Putricia the corpse flower: would you wait 3.5 hours to smell a rotten carcass? - videoThere were no guarantees. In order to produce their extravagant display, corpse plants needed to store up enough energy in underground tubers, or “corms”, which could grow up to 75kg. When there’s a bud, you never know if it will be a leaf or a flower until it’s about 10-15 cm long, Coulter said. Even then, he was aware of incidents where the tuber hadn’t been strong enough to enable the flower to open.Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletter“They’re not an easy plant to grow because at certain times of the year they need lots of water and lots of nutrition. Other times of year, they just need to rest and have nothing.”After its first flower in 2015, Adelaide now has corpse flowers blossoming every year, but not all are placed on public display. Transporting these precious plants from their climate-controlled glasshouse to the Adelaide botanic gardens was “quite a stressful event for the plant”.Map of where to find a corpse flowerGeelong was on tenterhooks. The botanic gardens currently has four titan arums in its collection. The plant, affectionately known as Betsy,bloomed in November 2024– producing a pungent fragrance of decaying possum with overtones of parmesan cheese – and there’s another corm of similar age and size. That plant has a nickname too, which the garden was yet to reveal.John Siemon, horticulture director at the Botanic Gardens of Sydney, where three flowers bloomed last year – Putricia, Baby Stink and Stinkerella – said the plant personas helped people overcome “plant blindness”. Although attributing a gender wasn’t quite right, he said, given the plants had both male and female organs.The public’s curiosity for corpse flowers appeared to be insatiable. Nearly 27,000 people turned up to get a whiff of Putricia’s fragrance, “like the rich stench of a public bin on a 40 degree day”. The vibe was “akin to having the Olympics back in town”, Siemon said.Sydneysiders may not have to wait long for the next performance.1:25'A horrific smell': Geelong's corpse flower blooms – videoPutricia has three other siblings, all made from leaf cuttings that were genetically identical. Three have flowered, he said. “So there’s every chance that fourth clone – the quadruplet – might come into bloom in the next 12 months.”As well as becoming a hub for theAmorphophallus titanum, Australia has its own native corpse varieties – the elephant yam and cheeky yam – native to northern Australia.Carol Davis, acting nursery general manager at the Australian National Botanic Gardens in Canberra, said while their flowers were smaller and different in shape, the native varieties shared a similar structure, including the central column, or “spadix”, and the distinctive rotting aroma.“The smell is a highly evolved strategy designed to attract pollinators like beetles and flies that are drawn to decaying organic matter,” she said.The ANBG has one titan arum in its collection, known as Morphy – short for Morpheus, the god of sleep and dreams – which was among those that flowered in 2025. Morpheus was known for appearing in different forms, Davis said. “We think this is a fitting reflection of the flower’s dormancy period and also the different forms it takes when it’s actively growing in either its leaf stage or its flower stage.”“The core collection that’s being held in conservation facilities is now of a mature age where we will see quite a few individuals flower,” Siemon said.When or where will the next corpse flower bloom? “There’s a bit of crystal ball, a bit of science and horticulture, and a lot of good luck.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentAustralian climate and environment in focusPlantsSouth AustraliafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Daily Telegraph, for example, paid handsomely for a Chelsea garden every year until 2016. However, the number of corporate sponsors has dwindled since the 2008 financial crisis and the Covid pandemic.Supported by Project Giving Back’s grants, 63 charities have stepped in to fill the gap, using show gardens to celebrate their causes. This year’s include Asthma & Lung UK, the Children’s Society, the Eden Project and Parkinson’s UK.The event has in recent years become more focused on eco-friendly gardening, with bee- and butterfly-friendly flowers taking centre stage and a focus on growing native plants.Much of this has been driven by Project Giving Back, whose rewilding garden, which caused some controversy in the gardening world over its purposefully unkempt look, won best in show in 2022, an accolade the charity’s sponsored gardens have won three times.View image in fullscreenA Rewilding Britain landscape by Lulu Urquhart and Adam Hunt, which won best in show at Chelsea in 2022.Photograph: Jim Powell/The GuardianThe flower show, run by the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS), for a long time enjoyed the largesse of the investment firm M&G, who was the headline sponsor for 11 years until 2020. This year, Range Rover takes over lead sponsorship from the Somerset hotel The Newt.But to fill the void left by Project Giving Back, the RHS is looking for new charitable funding for 2027.A spokesperson said: “Over its 100-year history, RHS Chelsea flower show has always attracted sponsors and charities to benefit from the international platform and high-profile stage of the world’s most famous gardening event. Over the last five years, and in the aftermath of the pandemic, Project Giving Back played a significant role in supporting small and large charities and demonstrating the power of gardens to make a real difference.“RHS Chelsea has always and continues to attract show gardens associated with charitable work and it remains the Royal Horticultural Society’s biggest fundraiser enabling us to engage millions of people across the UK with gardening.”Hattie Ghaui, the CEO of Project Giving Back, said: “This is our final year of funding gardens for good causes through application for the RHS Chelsea flower show. We were initially set up as a three-year project and extended for a further two years based on the positive impact and feedback we had.”She added that the charity would be wound down after the show, but would share its experiences with others: “We believe we have created an inspiring blueprint that other sponsors can follow.”The charity’s final garden will be designed by James Basson of the Provence-based Scape Design. It will feature towering red sandstone cliffs, coloured by natural ochre pigment and gently weathered over time, which sit among pine woodland.View image in fullscreenJames Basson’s 2017 garden, inspired by a Maltese quarry, won best in show.

Inspired by a desolate Maltese quarry, the garden featured stark limestone pillars covered in wild shrubbery. It won best in show, which may be what Project Giving Back is aiming for as it bows out from Chelsea.The charity said this work will show that gardens, “when thoughtfully designed and generously supported, can continue to inspire, heal and give back long after the show has ended”.Explore more on these topicsChelsea flower showCharitiesGardensLondonEnglandRewildingnewsShareReuse this content"

He was readmitted in November 2024, butlost his CBEsoon afterwards.He told the Guardian he was suspended from the party because he had refused to apologise to the complainants. “I have been a member of the Conservative party since 1978, inspired by Edward Heath,” he said. “My support, financial and otherwise, has always been grounded in belief in free trade, enterprise, limited bureaucracy, and Britain’s competitiveness as a trading nation.”Another party backer, however, said: “The rehabilitation of Rami Ranger just shows how desperate this Tory party is for money from anywhere.”The Conservative party has been approached for comment.Ranger made his successful bid during a 1920s-themed event at the five-star Peninsula hotel in central London. Tables for the fundraising party cost as much as £10,000 each, giving Tory backers the chance to bid for lots including dinner with Michael Gove, lunch with Jacob Rees-Mogg and a shooting trip with the shadow housing secretary, James Cleverly.The eventreportedly raisedaround £220,000 for the party. A lunch with the shadow energy secretary, Claire Coutinho, sold for £10,000 and a round of golf with David Cameron for a rate of £2,000 a hole.The most popular lot, however, was the dinner with Badenoch, which attracted bids from a number of senior donors, according to attendees.Ranger’s invitation to the event and his successful bid show how far the party has shifted in its attitude towards him in the last few years.The Guardian revealedin 2022 that Ranger was under investigation by the House of Lords after being accused of bullying and harassing the freelance journalist Poonam Joshi.In a series of tweets, Ranger made an unfounded allegation that Joshi’s husband was a domestic abuser, called her an “evil woman”, a “total disgrace” and the “epitome of filth and garbage”. He threatened to take her to court, warning: “I will teach you a lesson.”Joshi criticised the revelation about the Tories reintergrating and accepting money from Ranger again, calling it “appalling and totally unethical”.The Lords commissioner for standards ruled he had abused his power by “persistently undermining, humiliating and denigrating Ms Joshi”, but decided not to suspend Ranger from parliament after he promised to undertake social media training and re-attend a seminar on the parliamentary behaviour code.As the investigation was taking place, Ranger wrote a letter to the BBC in which he demanded to know “if your Pakistani-origin staff” had been involved in a documentary critical of the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi.He laterapologised and withdrew the comments, saying they were “by no means a reflection of how I see the British Pakistani community”, but he was suspended from the party in September 2023 after an internal investigation.Party officials did not announce his suspension, and quietly reinstated him in late 2024, updating the official parliamentary register to show he had previously been suspended.Soon after he was reinstated, Ranger was stripped of his CBE, a move he said at the time had devastated him. Electoral Commission records show he gave £5,000 to the party in early 2024 during his suspension, but that he has not donated since.Explore more on these topicsConservativesKemi BadenochnewsShareReuse this content"

The bishop has been released on conditional bail, and the Guardian has attempted to reach him for a comment.Earlier, the diocese of Lincoln confirmed that the bishop had been suspended from his duties. It said in a statement: “The bishop of Lincoln, the Right Rev Stephen Conway, has been suspended from ministry while a complaint made to the national safeguarding team is responded to according to House of Bishops code of practice. This includes referral to the appropriate statutory authorities.”No details of the complaint were given.According to the statement, while proceedings take place the bishop of Grantham, the Right Rev Dr Nicholas Chamberlain, will take over diocesan duties during the suspension.The diocese added: “Support is in place for those affected and there will be no further comment while the process is ongoing. We understand that this will be a deeply unsettling time. The diocesan safeguarding team is available for anyone who wishes to contact them.”Conway was installed as bishop of Lincoln in 2023, previously having served as bishop of Ramsbury and bishop of Ely. He has been a member of the House of Lords since 2014.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

It represents serious misconduct.”Lisa Smart, the Liberal Democrats’ Cabinet Office spokesperson, said Simons should consider his position. “We were told this government would be cleaner than clean,” she said. “Instead, we’re stuck with cabinet ministers whose previous spin tactics literally involved reporting journalists to the intelligence agencies.”Emails written in January and February 2024 by Simons and a subordinate to the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), a unit ofGCHQ, show that he pressed officials to investigate journalists. He told officials that one journalist was “living with” the daughter of a former adviser to Jeremy Corbyn. He claimed that the former adviser was “suspected of links to Russian intelligence”.Simons was hoping the security agency would investigate the sourcing behind a story in theSunday Timesabout Labour Together’s failure to disclose political donations. But despite the accusations, the information was not obtained via a hack and the evidence of Russian involvement nonexistent.One person named in Labour Together’s emails to the NCSC accused the minister of orchestrating a “McCarthyite smear” campaign, while a second said the false accusation was “disturbing, creepy and deplorable”.Earlier this month, it emerged that Simons had commissioned Apco, an American public affairs agency, to investigate two Sunday Times journalists and the sources of a story critical of Labour Together that was published in 2023.The story had revealed fresh details about £730,000 of undeclared donations to Labour Together, run at that time by Morgan McSweeney, Starmer’s erstwhile chief adviser. The Electoral Commission had fined the thinktank more than £14,000 for failing to declare the donations.After Apco completed its report, Simons concluded the information came from a hack of the Electoral Commission, and told the NCSC early in 2024 that “our evidence” showed it had been “disseminated to people known to be operating in a pro-Kremlin propaganda network with links to Russian intelligence”.At Simons’ direction, his chief of staff at Labour Together told the security officials that because the information “was disseminated to pro-Russian journalists linked to other ‘hack and leak’ operations, we believe that the likeliest culprit is the Russian state, or proxies of the Russian state”.However, Paul Holden, a freelance journalist who provided the Sunday Times with documents for their original report, recently showed the Guardian his source materials. They indicate the story was based on files leaked from the Labour party by whistleblowers.Meanwhile, at the time of Simons’ correspondence with the NCSC, the cybersecurity agency had already concluded there had been a hack of the Electoral Commission, but that it had been conducted by China. Also, the information stolen consisted of electoral records, not of the watchdog’s correspondence on regulatory matters.A spokesperson for Josh Simons said: “Labour Together commissioned Apco to investigate the information Paul Holden obtained for his book, as has repeatedly been made clear.”Explore more on these topicsLabourThinktanksGCHQRussiaConservativesNewspapersLiberal DemocratsnewsShareReuse this content"

Combined with strong winds and weak snowpack below, the conditions were especially susceptible to avalanches, it said.Tirol police said five off-piste skiers were caught up in a nearly 450-metre-wide avalanche on Friday afternoon in the St Anton am Arlberg area at an altitude of about 2,000 metres.An American and a Pole were among the five dead whose bodies were recovered after the avalanche, and a 21-year-old Austrian died of injuries after being taken to hospital, police said.Dozens of mountain-rescue team members, ambulance and fire department staffers, as well as several dog squads, were deployed for the operation.Late on Friday morning in the Nauders-Bergkastel resort to the south-east, a 42-year-old German man and his 16-year-old son were caught in an avalanche. The teen survived with injuries and called for help, but his father was killed.In Klösterle in the neighbouring Vorarlberg region, a 39-year-old Swiss snowboarder was caught and killed by an avalanche in an off-piste area, regional police said.“The recent snowfall is currently drawing many people to the mountains – even off-piste,” Tirol’s governor, Anton Mattle, said in a statement. “It is painful that we have already had to record several avalanches with injuries and fatalities.”His office said nearly three dozen avalanche incidents were reported on Friday, among more than 200 over the past week. So far, 11 people have died in avalanches this month, the governor’s office said.“No relief is in sight for Sunday either,” the region office said. “The weather remains turbulent.”Explore more on these topicsAustriaAvalanchesEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Then, as the 50 or so families in the building grappled with what to do next, a series of construction projects would probably be launched in the building to ramp up pressure on them to leave.“One by one, all of the situations that the union described began to happen,” said Oteyza. “Construction work was the weapon they used to make our lives impossible; power cuts, leaks, noise, drilling through walls, ceilings collapsing on top of gas stoves.”It’s a pattern that housing campaigners say is playing out across much of urban Spain, as investors seek to cash in on the country’sroaring housingmarket. The aim is simple: to force out long-term tenants as quickly as possible to make way for more profitable tourist, short-term or luxury lets.It’s come to be known acrossSpainasacoso inmobiliario,roughly translating as real estate harassment. The phrase refers to the myriad ways in which long-term tenants are subjected to worsening conditions so that they end their contracts on their own accord.But within the walls of one nondescript building in themadrileñoneighbourhood of Lavapiés, tenants may have found a way to fight back.View image in fullscreenCristina Gómez and Jaime Oteyza, neighbours in the building, are trying to fight back through the courts.Photograph: Pablo Garcia/The GuardianLast year, a dozen tenants,including Oteyza, turned to the country’s courts, alleging that the construction work was a bid to coerce them into ending their leases prematurely.Late last year, a court in Madrid agreed to hear the case, launching what housing campaigners say is the country’s first preliminary investigation into real estate harassment.For residents of the building, the groundbreaking case has added another layer of complexity to their long-running battle. “It’s bittersweet,” said Cristina Gómez, who has lived in the building since 2020. The court’s decision was “nice, as it confirmed we’re not just imagining things,” she said. “But at the same time, this is the result of a lot of suffering. It’s a shit situation for everyone.”View image in fullscreenCristina Gómez said she felt legal action was the only option.Photograph: Pablo Garcia/The GuardianThe construction work began in November 2024. As the work led to flooding in some apartments and turned parts of the building into no-go zones, residents saw a clear attempt by the new owners to bypass the costlier, more time-consuming process of going through courts to evict them individually.The tenants said they tried to negotiate with the new owners – at one point even offering to buy the building for the same amount that the investment fund had paid for it – as the company offered some tenants a few thousand euros to help with the move.“They were very tough, very long conversations, at no point did they accept anything other than us leaving the building,” said Gómez.View image in fullscreenDamage to the building caused by the construction work.Photograph: Pablo Garcia/The GuardianNoise levels in the building skyrocketed, as drills and jackhammers rang out and rubble was felled, said Oteyza. For those at home during the day, it was a form of “psychological torture”, he said.“It’s really difficult to live with noise, eight hours a day, day in and day out.”The father of two young children, Oteyza also worried constantly for their safety. “There’s a real fear that there will be an accident,” he said. “There might be a power tool plugged in on the landing. Or they’ve left a hole in the courtyard. These are risky situations.”As one tenant, who asked to be named only as Nani, put it: “We’re resisting and we’ll continue to resist, but it’s really difficult,” she said. “But we have to do it – it can’t be that those who have money can come and buy and sell buildings without caring about the lives of the people inside.”On at least five occasions, police and firefighters were called to the building as tenants wrestled with the fallout of the construction work. About 15 months after it began, residents say that about half of the tenants in the building have opted to leave.View image in fullscreenNani points out problems in the building caused by the work.Photograph: Pablo Garcia/The GuardianIt’s a hint of the kinds of situations that are playing out across Spain, said Alejandra Jacinto, a lawyer with the tenants’ union who helped draft the pioneering legal challenge. “From sending in eviction companies to carrying out construction works that cause damage, to putting glue in people’s locks, real estate harassment is a tool that is increasingly being used,” she said.Both the legal challenge and the court’s decision to launch a preliminary investigation were trailblazing steps pushing back against this trend, she said. “I think it’s already sending a message that there’s no impunity and that not everything goes. You can’t act outside the law to achieve your goals.”The court battle had made headlines across the country, she said, offering a glimmer of hope as many in Spain reel from thesoaring cost of housing.In January, campaigners in Barcelona announced that a local court had become the second to admit a case alleging real estate harassment. The case argues that the new owners of a five-floor building had left tenants without a working lift for more than a month, stranding elderly tenants and those with mobility issues, including one person who uses a wheelchair, in a bid to get them to leave.In Madrid, weeks after news broke of the court’s investigation, the tenants said it had already had an impact. “Curiously enough, we noticed that when the case made headlines, they continued working but in a more orderly, more systematic way and respecting the noise levels,” said Oteyza.View image in fullscreenScaffolding has been erected as part of the work.Photograph: Pablo Garcia/The GuardianIn a statement to the Guardian, a legal representative for the building’s owner said the construction work was aimed at improving accessibility, reinforcing the building’s structure and renovating the roof, noting: “all of which are essential measures to ensure the safety and habitability of the property”. The company had all of the necessary permits to carry out the work, it said.The spokesperson said agreements had been reached with more than 30 tenants in the building, in a show of their “commitment to dialogue and the search for mutually agreed upon solutions”.It added: “Aware of the inconvenience that this type of work can cause, and in order to minimise the impact on the lives of the residents, the owner has offered alternatives from the outset to the residents directly affected by the work, providing them with options for temporary relocation to other homes and accommodation adapted to their needs.”At the building in Lavapiés, the tenants were bracing themselves for a legal battle that could stretch on for months, if not years. But for Gómez, it was an absolute necessity. “What’s happening to us is something that is happening every day, all the time around us,” she said. “I think we need to show them that we’re willing to enforce the law, that we know our rights and are going to assert them.”In a country where the average renthas doubledin the past decade, it also felt as if it was the only option, she added.“It’s not like I can just go to somewhere nearby or another neighbourhood, it’s impossible,” she said. “So where does one go?”Explore more on these topicsSpainEuropeHousingCommunitiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Some critics have called it “dictator vibes”.Trump’s mighty persona, it seems, cannot be escaped. And it cannot be ignored. Here’s a look at the some of the places where the president has made himself omnipresent, or seeks to, since his return to office last year:Public buildingsPlaces where people congregate in numbers, or at least used to, are top of Trump’s list to get his face, and name, seen.The most prominent example is theJohn F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, inaugurated in 1971 as a “living memorial” to the assassinated president but hijacked by Trump cronies who quickly installed him as the leader of its board. Ticket salescrumbled, artistswalked away, and it was announced earlier in February that the venue wouldclose for two yearsfor “refurbishment”. In December, Trumpadded his own nameto the center – illegally in the view of critics, including Kennedy’s relatives.TheUS Institute of Peacewas an early victim of Trump’s second-term Doge (department of government efficiency) drive to cut perceived wasteful government spending. Similar to the Kennedy Center takeover, the previous board was ousted, and its Washington headquarters became a shell of its former self after most staff were fired. In December, the engravers moved in, andTrump’s name was chiselledinto the institute’s wall.Giant banners of Trump’s face almost identical to the recent justice department installation were erected at theDepartment of Agricultureand at thelabor departmentlast year.Public transportationFlorida state legislature Republicans on Tuesday voted torename the airportin West Palm Beach, where the president flies frequently between the White House and his private Mar-a-Lago club, the “President Donald J Trump International Airport”. Just days previously, the Trump Organization applied to trademark the name, opening the door to lucrative merchandising opportunities and taxpayer-funded licensing agreements, although the company insisted it was not seeking to profit from the move.Between the airport and Mar-a-Lago, the president is driven across a section of roadnewly renamedPresident Donald J Trump Boulevard, formerly plain old Southern Boulevard, in another act of fealty by Florida’s Republican-dominated legislature.Trump also has designs on other transportation hubs. New York’sPenn Stationis said to be his prime target. And recent reportssuggestedhe would unfreeze billions of dollars in federal funding for a major infrastructure project in the north-east only if the Democratic US Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, supported his efforts to rename the railroad station and Washington’s Dulles international airport after himself.US militaryOne of the president’s most frequent boasts is how he has “rebuilt” the US military into a leaner, meaner fighting machine. As part of this perceived revival, it was announced in December that a new “golden fleet” of warships known asTrump-class destroyerswould be commissioned, complete with hypersonic weapons, high-power lasers and nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles.Sports facilitiesTheWashington Commanders’ new $3.7bn,65,000-seat domed stadium, set to open in 2030, will be named Trump Stadium – if the White House gets its way. “It’s what the president wants, and it will probably happen,” a presidential administration official told ESPN, insisting that Trump was responsible for getting the project off the ground because the stadium is being built on land controlled by the National Park Service.Public monumentsIt hasn’t happened yet, but Trump’s face could one day get carved into the face ofMount Rushmore, the South Dakota memorial to four presidents of the past: George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln. Proposedlegislationby the sycophantic Florida Republican congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna last year went nowhere. But the site has long been on Trump’s radar, even before his controversialindependence day speechand divisive fireworks there in 2020.The president’s most recent monumental wheeze, meanwhile, is a plan for a 250ft arch: a so-calledArc de Trump, to be built on land adjacent to the Potomac River in Washington DC. Critics say the project exudes “dictator for life” vibes – while Trump himself has portrayed it as acrucial ingredientof domestic policy.FinanceIf the word Obamacare became synonymous with his predecessor’s signature health care achievements, Trump aims to emulate the success of name-branding withTrump accounts, a forthcoming savings initiative for new parents. Any baby born before 31 December 2028 will receive a $1,000 head start from the Trump administration in a venture critics say will become another tax-shelter for already wealthy American families while excluding children born to immigrants.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

He denies any wrongdoing. But what was that role?What was the trade envoy job that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor held?The Duke of York, as he was then known, became the UK’s special representative for international trade and investment in October 2001. The role was described by UK Trade & Investment as an “extensive programme of targeted engagements both in the UK and overseas to promote the interest of UK industry and the UK as a whole”.In essence, the role involved high-level lobbying, as well as the handling of sensitive “confidential briefs” regarding investment opportunities. It required close coordination with the UK’s trade and diplomatic missions abroad.Who appointed him?He started the role during Tony Blair’s government, after retiring from the navy in July 2001. In 2011, No 10, then under the Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition, said the appointment was made “with the agreement of the then foreign secretary [Jack Straw] and the trade and industry secretary [Patricia Hewitt]”.So he was backed by Labour?Not just Labour, no. When Mountbatten-Windsor was facing calls to step down from the role in 2011, endorsements still arrived from Conservative ministers. George Osborne, the then chancellor, said: “We have confidence in him doing the job and we think he’s done a good job in recent years. He’s promoted British exports. What we want is everyone promoting British exports at the minute and Prince Andrew has done that.”Later, the former trade minister Digby Jones joined in, stating that Mountbatten-Windsor had “put the country first”.“It’s important we, as business, say, let’s use what he can do to actually create some profit, employ some people, pay some tax,” the peer added.Was Mountbatten-Windsor a controversial choice when he was first appointed?He was. Even at the start of the new millennium, there were strong views held by supporters and opponents of a man who had a reputation for acting as a “playboy prince”.In his book Entitled, the author Andrew Lownie outlines how the former trade secretary Peter Mandelson assisted Mountbatten-Windsor in landing the role of the UK’s special representative for international trade and investment – while his brother, the then Prince Charles, tried to scupper it.“It was also claimed that Prince Charles was trying to block Andrew’s new role as ‘a disaster waiting to happen’ on the grounds that his brother simply couldn’t be trusted not to disgrace himself,” Lownie wrote. “A palace source said that the Prince of Wales was extremely concerned about Andrew’s playboy image: ‘He thinks he won’t be able to resist the temptation of mixing business with pleasure. This is a high-profile appointment which demands tact and discretion.’”Whom did he meet in the role and why?The post involved meetings with a series of UK and international business people, as well as foreign leaders, where he would essentially facilitate introductions. These could be mundane and, according to those involved, useful, but dealings with allegedly corrupt regimes, including Kazakhstan, caused awkward publicity. This was particularly true when it emerged that the Kazakh president’s son-in-law, Timur Kulibayev, had bought Mountbatten-Windsor’s former house at Sunninghill Park in 2007, allegedly for £3m over the asking price.The Kazakh ties persisted, however. In 2010 Mountbatten-Windsor met the UK’s BG Group on three occasions in the five weeks between 25 March and 28 April, including a rendezvous in Kazakhstan.In March 2011, his links to Saif Gadaffi, the son of the then Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi, led to calls for him to be stripped of the role.Did Mountbatten-Windsor get paid for the job?No. There was no salary for the post. However, expenses and travel costs were paid, which one MP suggested in 2011 “has cost the taxpayer about £4m in the last 10 years, not including the costs to protection officers”.It seems as if the job description could benefit the UK, though?It could, and the UK still has a variety of figures acting as trade envoys. There are a series of parliamentarians who fill region-specific roles. While many of these posts are a lot less high-profile, the former cricketer Ian Botham was appointed a UK trade ambassador to Australia in 2021.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

They could read state news and use a local navigation service.What they couldn’t do was check international headlines about thousands of people being killed by government forces during one of the bloodiest weeks in recent Iranian history. Nor, for the most part, could they get evidence out of Iran to the outside world – no pictures, no videos, no testimony of military vehicles being driven into protesters or family members being dragged from their homes and shot.What Iran has, a splinternet, is becoming reality for many millions of people. It is likely to get far worse.More than half of Russia’s regions are able to access only a limited, government-approved version of theinternetthrough their mobile phones. The “great firewall of China” blocks most of the global internet, including sites such as Google and the Guardian. The Myanmar junta hasexperimentedwith targeted internet shutdowns and so recently have authorities in Afghanistan andPakistan.For nearly two decades, the US backed a global effort to make it extremely difficult for governments to divide up the internet in this way. It hinged on funding tools built by groups worldwide to circumvent censorship. These made it very costly and very hard to shut down the internet entirely, and they ensured that governments that did seek to cut off their people often had to isolate themselves and their financial institutions as well.Like many US soft-power initiatives, the programme was imperfect, morally complex and at times at odds with the policies of other governments. Yet it is one foundation of what the internet is: a global commons. Today’s online world is dominated by large tech platforms and awash with illegal content and misinformation. But it is still a structure in which facts, ideas and information accessible from London are largely accessible from Delhi, Johannesburg and São Paulo as well.That could change rapidly. On the one hand is the matter of US funding, now cut or apparentlyredirectedtowards a Trumpian, politicised effort to undermine global attempts to regulate US big-tech platforms.On the other is the mounting export of censorship technologies, which are constantly improving and increasingly marketed overseas. These includedevicessold by companies in China that give their customers – governments in Pakistan, Myanmar and Ethiopia among others – extremely fine-tuned control over what comes in and out of a country. It is believed that similar technologies are the foundation of Iran’s current shutdown.US funding for global internet freedom ‘effectively gutted’Read moreCensorship technologies are growing more powerful at the same time as programmes designed to stymie them have been decimated.To those who work on the problem, the stakes are high. “When governments want to not be scrutinised for how many people they’re killing in their streets, they’ll shut the internet down,” said a former US official.It is not easy to build a splinternet. The internet is, by design, a decentralised and deeply inter-dependent network. But Iran’s recent example indicates that it is becoming far more plausible. Russia has beenattemptingto create a similar cut-off internet for some years, and other authoritarian regimes appear to share the ambition. It will become cheaper and easier to achieve.Governments worldwide, including in Europe, arepromotingnotions of sovereign data, sovereign AI and, in some cases, sovereign internet. Accompanying this is an ambition to nationalise infrastructure, for example to keep UK citizens’ health records stored in UK data centres. This is an understandable goal, given the increasingly authoritarian bent of US tech platforms that are the custodians of much of the world’s data.But if fascist or authoritarian regimes ascend, such an approach risks replacing one set of despots with another. Iran’s ability to cut off its internet was prefigured by a years-long push to nationalise its underlying infrastructure. Shutdowns such as Iran’s become far easier when a country’s data is entirely accessible to its domestic authorities.Those fighting for digital freedoms in harsh environments – in Iran and beyond – are approaching Europe, hoping the EU might pick up some of what the US has dropped and fund anticensorship technologies.It is doubtful that Europe has the money or the willpower to do much, given the other responsibilities it must shoulder. Next to defence, it seems a marginal concern. But the information environment as we know it – the ground of shared fact that allowed this piece to be written and you to read it – is at stake.Explore more on these topicsCensorshipInternetFreedom of speechIranRussiaChinaanalysisShareReuse this content"

Congress must act now | Bernie SandersRead moreKhanna and Sanders declined to specify which tech executives they met with during the senator’s visit to California, but the congressman said it was “senior leaders” at the “most prominent tech companies”.“I think it was important for both Senator Sanders to hear from tech leaders and tech leaders to hear from Senator Sanders, who represents and understands the concerns of so many working-class Americans,” Khanna said in an interview after the event.During his remarks, Sanders reissued hiscall for a moratoriumon the expansion of AI data centers to “slow down the revolution and protect workers” while policymakers catch up.Khannadoes not wanta moratorium, but has instead pushed to “steer” AI, advocating for the US to adopt a “Singapore model” for data center growth, with an emphasis on renewable energy and water efficiency. In his remarks before an auditorium of mostly students, Khanna outlined seven principles to guard against “oligarchic capture and dominance” of wealth generated by AI innovation.“We must ask not what America can do for Silicon Valley, but what Silicon Valley must do for America,” said the congressman, who is eyed as considering a 2028 presidential bid.The event capped a days-long visit to California, a state he won in the 2020 presidential primary and where he returned to rally thousands during his Fight Oligarchy tour last year. In Los Angeles on Wednesday, Sanders delivered ascathing denunciation of the “greed” of the billionaire class. There he helped formally launch a campaign for a ballot initiative that would impose a one-time 5% tax on residents worth more than $1bn – a proposal that has already prompted some ultra-wealthy tech leaders to flee, or threaten to do so.At Stanford, Sanders focused his remarks on his concerns over how AI would impact not only the labor force but personal wellbeing and people’s ability to interact with one another. He mentioned that a restaurant in DC offered a Valentine’s Day special for people and their “AI buddies”, which drew laughs from the students.It may seem funny, Sanders said, “but the truth is that a lot of people are becoming dependent upon AI for their emotional support. What is the long-term impact of that? What is the long-term impact if we lose work as an important part of our lives? What do we do with our lives?”Sanders read statements from industry leaders who have predicted widespread automation, and cited projections that AI and robotics could eliminate tens of millions of jobs in the coming decade – from truck drivers to fast‑food workers and many white‑collar roles.Polling has found Americans are deeply concerned, as federal regulators and states debate how to impose guardrails on the nascent but fast-developing technology. A2025 Pew surveyfound that 64% of the public thinks AI “will lead to fewer jobs over the next 20 years”. Just 17% of Americans say “AI will have a very or somewhat positive impact on the United States” over the same period.The tech CEOs leading the AI race have argued that AI will drive productivity, innovation and new kinds of employment as technological advancements have always done. But critics, like Sanders, say the “unprecedented” speed and scale of the changes threaten to enrich the “multibillionaires” while deepening inequality and leaving policymakers and the public ill-equipped to mount a response in time.Sander urged his colleagues in Washington – and the public – to begin a serious public debate about the future of work as AI disrupts the economy, democracy and people’s emotional lives.“AI and robotics are neither good nor bad,” he said. “The question is: will a handful of billionaires benefit from it, or will the general public benefit?”Explore more on these topicsUS newsBernie SandersAI (artificial intelligence)DemocratsUS politicsComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

For instance, I believe TV’s reliance on reviving old shows is a risk-averse, creative regression. On the other hand, I love it. I particularly love it when fictional characters have visibly aged. There’s a broken humanity that you don’t get with flawless, collagen-rich skin. You sense you could talk to them about your sciatica and they’d get it.I got that feeling with the new series ofScrubs(Disney+, from Thursday 26 February), a show I once mainlined on E4. Scrubs was as comforting as tea and toast. Surprisingly malleable, too. In its bones, it was a coming-of-age workplace bromance between junior doctors JD and Turk, played by then newcomers Zach Braff and Donald Faison. Their chemistry was the show’s anchor, balancing sassy racial harmony with irreverence and heart, as they bore witness to universal human drama. But is it healthy enough to survive resuscitation, more than 15 years after its last episode aired?Sensibly, the writers have shaken things up. JD has grown into complacent early middle age, working as a private doctor for the affluent and elderly. “You write scripts in the suburbs” is Turk’s withering appraisal. (For a hot second, I thought he was beefing with Braff’s indie film-making.) Braff directs the first episode, in which a problem with one of JD’s pampered patients takes him back to Sacred Heart, the training hospital where he earned his wheels.The move brings him face to face with old comrades, including old flame Elliot, cheerful chauvinist the Todd and an emotional Turk, who is suffering from burnout. “I wish this guy would die all at once, instead of in tiny little pieces,” the baby-faced chief surgeon shockingly exclaims in theatre. In fairness, he’s a father of four now. It’s amazing he’s standing.At least JD’s irascible mentor can’t call him “Newbie” any more, like he used to, right? “What can I do for you there, Oldie?” asks Dr Cox. John C McGinley is still electrifying, his character a methamphetamine Martin Sheen, given to virtuosic, rhetorical putdowns, delivered in sentences longer than those of a 19th-century novelist.Cox has a problem, though. Tough love is out, political correctness is in, as policed by the figure of Sibby, a wellness/HR figure, who pops up genie-like at any impassioned outburst, with instructions to “take it down a few degrees” or attend cultural sensitivity workshops.I was dismayed when she appeared, and by recurring jokes about the “feelings police”. Scrubs isn’t the only comedy that has to address a vigilant climate around banter and power dynamics. It’s particularly an issue for returning series that made their name in the good ol’ days. I sympathise – puritans haven’t enjoyed this much cultural power since they closed the theatres. But it’s a defensive stance for TV shows to take. The anxiety of being muzzled leads to an obsessive preoccupation with it, so you no longer talk about anything else. It’s half of how the culture war perpetuates itself, and it’s boring.View image in fullscreen‘Feelings police’ … Vanessa Bayer as Sibby in Scrubs, season 10.Photograph: Jeff Weddell/DisneyHappily, after two episodes the show decides it can only be itself. “Why do you have the physique of a menopausal lesbian?” an insolent younger character asks the older, not yet dignified JD. It’s funnier for it, and the show clearly has affection for gay people, among other minorities. It begins to take on worthy subjects: the dehumanising US healthcare system; patient quotas doctors must meet to maximise hospital profits; TikTok diets that threaten health; orthorexia in gym bros. Speaking with conviction, and an open heart, matters more than speaking correctly. That’s also something I believe.Will Scrubs Redux evolve, Gray’s Anatomy-style, with generations of younger characters taking the torch? Scenes with the new newbies fall a little flat – but if Dr Cox taught me anything, it’s that you have to give people time. The chemistry between the seasoned leads sparks enough to sustain things for now. Turk is soon moonwalking again, the writers are throwing out zingers you’ll want to keep in your back pocket. I liked this far more than I expected. We all need a little TLC, more than ever, and it turns out I actually do want a scrub. It gets some love from me.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe watcherZach BraffTV comedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If there was anybody destined to be president, it was him.”‘Fashion murder’: Carolyn Bessette Kennedy fans aghast at first images from Netflix seriesRead moreIn the US, the Kennedys occupy territory somewhere between the British royal family and Greek tragedy, a tale of impossible glamour pierced by spectacles of public mourning. More than a quarter of a century after the single-engine plane piloted byJohn Kennedy Jrplunged into the Atlantic Ocean, killing him; his wife, Carolyn Bessette; and her sister, Lauren Bessette, Camelot is being mined for content once more.Ryan Murphy’s new FX and Hulu seriesLove Story: John F Kennedy Jr & Carolyn Bessette, starring Paul Anthony Kelly and Sarah Pidgeon, dramatises the couple’s volatile courtship, marriage and deaths. Adapted from a bestselling book by Elizabeth Beller, the show has drawn ire from the Kennedy family.Jack Schlossberg, Kennedy’s nephew,said last yearthe show was profiting off his family “in a grotesque way” and accused Murphy of “making millions” off Kennedy’s legacy. Murphy retaliated on the podcast of California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, saying it was an “odd choice to be mad about your relative that you really don’t remember”.Schlossberg, now running for Congress in New York, shared memories of his uncle on social media. “My earliest memories are of John calling me Jackolatern and ‘the nudist,’ picking me up from school, his Pontiac convertible,”he wrote on Instagram. “I remember being the ring bearer at his wedding and the day he died. I remember Wyclef singing at his funeral.”For everyone who knew the man behind the myth, the return of Kennedy to the screen is a complex, often painful reminder of a life at once more ordinary and more extraordinary than the tabloids, or now television, have managed to convey.Steven Gillon, a historian and author who forged a close friendship with him during their days at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, says: “I knew the real John. I don’t need to see the fake TV version of him. But I have nothing against the series.”Gillon remembers Kennedy as a man who constantly wrestled with a bifurcated existence: “He told me that he was two people, that he was John, a typical though privileged member of his generation, but the role he played his whole life was that of John Fitzgerald Kennedy Jr, the son of a slain president. The great thing about John was that he was able to separate the two.”Love Story tries to capture this duality. Kennedy is seen cycling around the Tribeca neighbourhood of Manhattan and feels drawn to Bessette precisely because she is not part of the political establishment. But the paparazzi are a constant reminder of his celebrity and there is a pervasive expectation that he will join the family business. Bessette observes: “The Kennedys are like the Beatles. I feel like Yoko.”View image in fullscreenPaul Anthony Kelly as John F Kennedy Jr and Naomi Watts as Jackie Kennedy Onassis in FX’s Love Story: John F Kennedy Jr & Carolyn Bessette.Photograph: Eric Liebowitz/FXHis princely role had begun on “John John’s” third birthday in 1963 when, standing to attention, Kennedy salutedhis assassinated father’s coffin as it was carried to Arlington national cemetery. His mother, Jackie (played in Love Story by Naomi Watts), moved the family to New York and worked hard to keep Kennedy and his sister, Caroline (Grace Gummer), away from the public gaze.After Brown, Kennedy studied law and joined the staff of the Manhattan prosecutor’s office. Described by People magazine in 1988 as “the sexiest man alive”, he dated Hollywood celebrities including Madonna, Julia Roberts and Sarah Jessica Parker.Daryl Hannah, his girlfriend of five years, receives an unflattering portrait in Love Story as a needy, narcissistic Hollywood actor who compares the death of her pet dog to the death of Jackie Kennedy. The caricature is hard to square with Hannah the environmental activist now married to musician Neil Young. The journalist Emma Specterwrote in Vogue magazine: “Indeed, if I were Hannah, I’d consider suing.”Kennedy quit the law and launched a political magazine called George with the subtitle “not politics as usual”, fuelling speculation of a run for New York governor and eventually the White House. Its first cover featured the supermodelCindy Crawford dressed as George Washingtonand within 18 months it achieved a circulation of 400,000.RoseMarie Terenzio, who was executive assistant to Kennedy and a founding staff member of George, recalls fondly: “He was the same with everyone. You never went somewhere or were in a room with John and were like, wow, he’s different in this circumstance than he is in the office. He was always himself – approachable, down-to-earth, irritating. He was a big practical jokester and it was fun in the office.”Bessette, who never gave an interview, remains a more enigmatic figure who was sometimes compared to Britain’s Princess Diana. She was born in 1966 in White Plains, New York, and grew up in Greenwich, Connecticut. In 1983, her high school yearbook crowned her the “Ultimate Beautiful Person” and at Boston University she featuredin the 1988 college calendar.She took a job as a sales assistant at Calvin Klein in Boston and steadily climbed the ranks. By the time she relocated to New York, she had become the brand’s chief publicist and a confidante of the designer himself.Bessette dated the future ice hockey player John Cullen, Alessandro Benetton of the Italian fashion dynasty and the Calvin Klein underwear model Michael Bergin, later of Baywatch fame andnow an estate agent in Los Angeles(Bergin did not respond to an email requesting comment on his portrayal in Love Story).Terenzio, co-author with Liz McNeil ofJFK Jr: An Intimate Oral Biography, recalls: “Photos don’t do her justice. She was gorgeous but in the way that was not like this perfect, pristine Upper East Side girl. She was way more bohemian and cool and so down to earth and warm and funny and loved to have fun.”Accounts vary on how Kennedy and Bessette’s paths first crossed. According to Elizabeth Beller’s bookOnce Upon a Time: The Captivating Life of Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy, it was the spring of 1992 and Kennedy arranged a fitting in the VIP room at Calvin Klein. Bessette was chosen to handle the appointment. Kennedy emerged not only with several sharply cut suits but with Bessette’s phone number.Love Story tells it differently, with Calvin Klein introducing Kennedy and Bessette to each other at a fundraising event in 1992. Kennedy is immediately smitten and asks for her number but she replies: “I don’t give my number out to strangers,” adding: “You know where I work. Try reception.” Kennedy then turns up at the Calvin Klein showroom seeking a new suit.Bessette would be seen by some as icy and remote but Beller, whose book inspired the new TV drama, says via email that she was drawn to the story by the “discrepancy between what people who knew Carolyn said about her and how the media portrayed her.“A happy couple doesn’t make headlines, so the tabloids created a narrative, using incendiary photographs taken by cornering her alone, getting too close and screaming epithets. I was happily surprised to learn that when the press wasn’t hounding her, she was fantastically witty, with quick repartee.”The course of true love did not run smooth. Kennedy and Bessette dated on and off for a while but he did not completely break from Hannah until 1994. Then the relationship blossomed and, in the spring of 1995, Bessette moved into his loft apartment in Manhattan. The couple were constantly hunted by the paparazzi.Beller says: “They had the usual ups and downs of most couples who in the early years face learning curves about work-life balance and where to live. For them, staying at the Tribeca loft without a doorman was like stepping on to a stage every day. His family certainly was not a burden, but the name came with a sense of duty and obligations that added to their already busy lives. Factoring in the tabloid media hounding their every move, everything becomes exponentially harder.”Kennedy hoped that, once the couple married in 1996 –in a secret ceremonyon Cumberland Island, Georgia, releasing just one photo – the media frenzy would calm. But it did not turn out that way.Terenzio recalls: “He was under the impression that once he got married, it would sort of die down because he wasn’t the world’s most eligible bachelor any more. It was the exact opposite. The scrutiny became way more intense after they got married and everyone was surprised by that, including them.”The pressures grew as Kennedy tried to cope with the impending death of his cousin, Anthony Radziwill, from cancer, and intensifying demands from George, which was struggling financially. Gillon, author ofAmerica’s Reluctant Prince, recalls a scene of strife one night at Kennedy and Bessette’s apartment:“It was probably about 10 o’clock at night and she was wearing this oversized Columbia University sweatshirt. They had a little bar area in their kitchen and I’m on one side and he and Carolyn are on the other and he hands me this letter and I’m trying to read it. I said, John, they’re coming after you: they are going to blame the failure of George magazine on you.“She flipped out, not on me but on him. She’s like, ‘John, you let everybody fuck you, John. Everybody fucks you and you’ve got to start fucking people back, John. I’m tired of this. I’m tired of everybody fucking you – you’re not fucking them back.’ They’re passing a cigarette back and forth.”Kennedy and Gillon left the apartment and went into the cold, dimly lit street: “I walked out the door and turned right toward civilisation and he turned left. For some reason, I turned around and saw him.His hands were in his pockets, his head was bowed and he looked so dejected. I was thinking God, he’s such a nice, sweet guy. I felt so bad for him and little did I know it would be the last time I would see him.”View image in fullscreenSarah Pidgeon as Carolyn Bessette in FX’s Love Story: John F Kennedy Jr & Carolyn Bessette.Photograph: FXLove Story begins at the end with a prologue showing Kennedy, 38, Bessette, 33, and her 34-year-old sister Lauren unhappily meeting at a small airport en route to a family wedding on Cape Cod. It was 16 July 1999. Kennedy had had a cast removed shortly before the flight due to a broken ankle sustained in a paragliding accident.The Piper Saratoga planeplunged into the Atlanticafter Kennedy became disoriented while flying through dense fog off Martha’s Vineyard. He, Bessette and her sister were killed on impact, according to postmortem findings released after their bodies were recovered from the sea on 21 July.Terenzio was staying at the couple’s apartment that weekend because her own air conditioning had failed. As the hours of uncertainty turned into days, the reality set in: “In some ways it felt like the earth cracked open. It was earth-shattering to imagine that this could happen to them.”For Americans who remembered theassassination of his father, it felt like history was repeating itself to strike down the crown prince. Terenzio adds wistfully: “He was the hope. There was always that hope that he would some day take up the family business, so to speak, and save the world. It was a profound unimaginable loss, and especially for his sister and his family and her family.”Kennedy and Bessette were the loves of each other’s lives but no one can be sure if their topsy-turvy marriage would have endured. Terenzio comments: “It was tough but she was getting used to it. She knew he was going to run for office and was completely onboard. She would have loved campaigning. She had a very outgoing personality.“They loved each other, were committed to each other and had a lot of similarities. They both had that authenticity. She was very much about the underdog and they had that in common. They were drawn to each because they both had very similar kind of personalities.”Gillon adds: “The relationship was rocky but there also was this underlying attraction and love. I talked to the surgeon who removed John’s cast on the morning of the flight. When the doctor walked into the room, John and Carolyn were there on the table making out, like they couldn’t keep their hands off each other. That’s the challenge with trying to figure out where the relationship was going to go. There clearly was a lot of physical attraction and there was a genuine love.”Love Story: John F Kennedy Jr & Carolyn Bessette is streaming now onHuluin the US and on Disney+ in UK and AustraliaExplore more on these topicsUS televisionRyan MurphyTelevisionThe KennedysFXHuluJackie OnassisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

No soonerhad he been enshrined as frontrunnerto succeed Daniel Craig, than he was nudged from the DB5 driver’s seat by the latest heir apparent, Jacob Elordi, installed as the new bookies’ favourite after his smouldering, highly profitable performance in Wuthering Heights. Smarting somewhere in the background is Aaron Taylor-Johnson, who seemed locked in for the job a couple of years ago, enjoying the backing of former 007s Pierce Brosnan and George Lazenby, but now seems to have fallen out of favour. And don’t forget the succession of other dead cert Bonds now banished to the back of the odds market: the long-rumoured likes of Tom Hardy and Idris Elba (both now likely to have aged out of the role); Theo James; James Norton; Josh O’Connor; Harris Dickinson; Bridgerton’s Rége-Jean Page; and approximately 5,000 other predominately British actors who have enjoyed box office success/led a successful TV drama/look good in a tuxedo.On and on the hunt goes. Five years after Craig’s final outing, one thatleft absolutely no wriggle roomfor his return, and not far off a year since Denis Villeneuve was pegged as director of the next, still-untitled instalment, the next 007 has still not been found. Or if he has (and it seems certain to be a he), everyone involved in the Bond operation is keeping characteristically tight-lipped about it.It has been an unusually long wait – one presumably stretched out further by thebaton-passing of creative controlfrom long time Bond-stewarding siblings Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson to MGM and its parent company, Amazon – though perhaps it is not an entirely unwelcome one. Because the “search for the next Bond” is as crucial a part of the franchise as martinis, femme fatales and product placement; a vital act of self-promotion that keeps Bond in the headlines even when no film is forthcoming.View image in fullscreenBattle of the tuxes … Jacob Elordi (left) and Callum Turner.Composite: Valerie Macon/AFP/Alessandra Benedetti/Corbis/Getty ImagesThe idea of Bond as cinema’s most desirable role has always been carefully cultivated by the franchise’s stewards. Stories of the A-listers (Paul Newman, James Brolin, Mel Gibson, and other famous names) who were approached or screen-tested for 007 have become part of the Bond lore, as have the lengths that producers went to to find the right man for the job. The very first Bond film was preceded by a contest, announced in the Daily Express, to find the man to play its title character. Among the qualities required for competitors was a height of six feet, an English accent and “a determined chin”. The winner, London model Peter Anthony, definitely looked the part, but his lack of acting chops led longtime Bond producer Cubby Broccoli and Eon Productions to look to more established figures. As would become a running tradition whenever a new Bond was sought, there were contrasting views over what sort of characteristics were required: his creator Ian Fleming prioritised “suaveness”; Broccoli wanted “a ballsy guy”. Broccoli won out, and Sean Connery was hired.When Connery stepped away from the role for the first time, it was claimed that Broccoli and his co-producer Harry Saltzmanauditioned 400 peopleto be his replacement, before ultimately landing on George Lazenby, a Australian former car salesman who Broccoli and Saltzman spotted looking dashing in anadvert for Fry’s Chocolate– unlike with Peter Anthony, it didn’t seem to matter that Lazenby had never delivered a single line before playing Bond. In contrast to Lazenby, Roger Moore’s pre-Bond apprenticeship made a lot more sense: he was already appearing as a similarly smooth character in TV series The Saint. The same could be said of the first choice for Moore’s replacement, Pierce Brosnan, who appeared as a Bond-a-like in US TV detective drama Remington Steele. Famously, when Brosnan was offered the role of 007, NBC who had just cancelled Remington Steele, promptly uncancelled the show due to the surge of attention on its lead, forcing Broccoli to offer the part to Timothy Dalton instead.It was a to-and-fro that came right at the time in the mid-80s when celebrity and entertainment news was ascendant, covered breathlessly in UK tabloids, US publications like Premiere magazine and onnightly news bulletins. The search for the next Bond had become a media event, one capitalised on by bookmakers, who had started making novelty or ‘special’ bets a bigger part of their offering (kickstarted by William Hill’smuch-publicised bookon who shot JR): when Dalton officially stepped back from the role in 1994, bookies offered 20-1 on Kenneth Branagh, 25-1 on Lenny Henry and 50-1 on Emma Thompson replacing him, though the smart punters would have backed Brosnan at a less generous 2-1.By the time Brosnan (reluctantly) departed the role, the hoopla around finding his successor had intensified yet again thanks to the rise of the internet. Chatrooms were abuzz with speculation, piggybacked on by the tabloids: reportedly in the Eon offices there was reportedly a list of every potential actor tipped for the role by newspapers, 72 in total, including “a dwarf and two women”. The studio’s ultimate casting of Daniel Craig, announced via a dramatic Thames speedboat stunt, was bold and contentious – a gruff,blond-headed stepchildin a family of charming brunettes – and prompted negative headlines and internet boycott campaigns.Of course Wilson and Broccoli were proved resoundingly right in their pick. A subject ofhigh-profile mockeryin the 90s and early 00s, Bond has been restored to event-cinema status by the wild success of the Craig years. Which is presumably why such caution is being exercised in finding his replacement by the franchise’s current handlers. They can probably take their time – the breathless hype machine will ensure that no one will lose interest in Bond any time soon.To read the complete version of this newsletterplease subscribeto receive The Guide in your inbox every FridayExplore more on these topicsCultureThe Guide newsletterJames BondSean ConneryPierce BrosnanDaniel CraigRoger MooreJacob ElordinewslettersShareReuse this content"

Or 75. Or 100. Screenshots of spreadsheets circulate, templates for tracking pages and percentages are downloaded, friends publicly pledge to “do better” than they did last year. What was once a private pastime is announced, quantified and, in some corners of the internet, judged.The appeal is obvious: in a distracted age, reading can easily become crowded out by work, screens and fatigue. Literacy rates in the UK are stagnating: in 2024, around50% of UK adults read regularly for pleasure, down from 58% in 2015.As the UK launches itsNational Year of Reading, a steady drumbeat of commentary has framed the decline of book culture as a civilisational crisis. Columnists have painted lurid pictures of a post-literate society, in which the shrinking cultural centrality of books represents a slow unravelling of the habits that once underpinned modern public life. In this context, reading targets promise discipline and a sense of progress.But do yearly reading goals actually help us read better, or do they risk hollowing out the very activity they claim to protect? As reading is increasingly tracked and performed online, there is a growing sense that a solitary pleasure is being reshaped by the logic of metrics and visibility. In a culture that counts steps, optimises sleep and gamifies meditation, the pressure to quantify reading may say less about books than about a wider urge to turn even our leisure into something measurable and, ultimately, competitive.double quotation markI used to set huge targets – 70 or 100 books a year, then I’d get to December and feel guiltyFor Ayesha Chaudhry, who co-runs the Instagram account@between2books, this online book culture has become alienating. “The numbers I see online are wildly unsustainable,” she says. “I used to set huge targets – 70 or 100 books a year, written out in my diary. Then I’d get to December, feel guilty, and stare at all these empty spaces on the page.”Last year, Chaudhry decided to purposely slow down, reading just 10 books – the fewest since childhood – and considers it one of her most satisfying reading years. “I actually sat with what I was reading, and also turned it into something more interactive,” she says. “Most of those books came into my life through conversations, recommendations from people I met on holiday, or listening to an author at an event. They became social experiences rather than items to tick off.”The shift, she says, has eased both pressure and overconsumption. “I was buying books to meet goals, then feeling anxious because they weren’t read. It became a loop.” Now, her aims are non-numerical: exploring authors’ backlist titles, genres outside her comfort zone, and more time spent thinking rather than counting.According to philosopherC Thi Nguyen, author of The Score, the phenomenon Chaudhry describes sits within a much wider cultural shift. In his book, Nguyen explores how modern life increasingly gamifies ordinary activities, showing how metrics and scoring systems can distort our experience of what we value.“Gamification is when you take a natural activity, such as reading or communication, and explicitly apply game-like design features – scores, levels, streaks – to motivate people,” he says. The danger, Nguyen argues, is “value capture”: the moment when rich, complex experiences are flattened into numbers that begin to stand in for meaning.“It’s very hard to share something like ‘this book changed me’ in a way that’s publicly accountable,” he says. “But it’s extremely easy to share that you’ve read 100 books. So the number becomes a kind of social currency – even though it doesn’t track what mattered.”From step counts and calorie trackers to follower numbers and productivity dashboards, modern life increasingly rewards what can be measured and compared. “Large-scale data systems are built around what’s easy to count, not what’s genuinely important,” Nguyen says. “Curiosity, delight and genuine meaning cannot survive translation into a spreadsheet.”That is not to say that voracious reading is always fuelled by an unhealthy desire for self-optimisation. Ella Risbridger, author ofIn Love With Love, represents the opposite extreme. Last year, she read more than 1,000 romance novels while researching her book, but deliberately refuses to track them. “I try to avoid anything that makes reading feel like maths,” she says. “Reading is where I go to escape targets.”Journalist and author Afua Hirsch’s experience also illustrates this tension. As a judge for major literary prizes, she has spent years reading under intense deadlines. “When I was judging the Booker, I had to read about 150 books in five months,” she says. “It was literally a book a day.”Hirsch describes this kind of reading as both a privilege and a strain. “Your brain becomes like a computer. You’re processing, and that’s stressful, especially when something is beautifully written and you want to linger.” After such intense periods, she often needs time to relearn how to read for pleasure.double quotation markMetrics can help people get started, but ideally they’re temporary scaffoldingNguyen is careful not to dismiss metrics altogether. Used lightly, he says in his book, scoring systems can be useful, giving people a clear goal and immediate feedback. After all, we are in a moment of genuine concern about literacy. Withreading levels falling among childrenand attention spans fraying across all ages, numerical goals can be the first step on the ladder. “Metrics can help people get started,” he says. “But ideally, they’re temporary scaffolding. You need to develop your own reasons to read.”Reader tracking platformStoryGraph, the fastest-growing rival to Amazon-owned Goodreads, was built in conscious opposition to the competitive reading culture increasingly fostered online. Founded by Nadia Odunayo, the platform positions itself as reader-first, data-light and deliberately flexible.“Before I built the product, I spent months just watching Bookstagram,” Odunayo says. “A lot of people were stressed by social media and the sense that reading was a competition. I didn’t want to build something people would burn out from.”Instead of focusing solely on the number of books completed, StoryGraph allows users to set page goals, time goals, or habit-based challenges. Page goals avoid incentivising short books, Odunayo says, and allow for books abandoned partway through. “If you read 50 pages, that effort matters,” she says. “You’re not punished for curiosity, or for reading War and Peace.”The platform also foregrounds non-numerical challenges: reading across cultures, genres or identities; working through prize shortlists; only reading books already owned. Many are open-ended, deliberately resisting the pressure of annual completion. “You could be doing these challenges for the rest of your reading life,” Odunayo says.The tension is clear: reading goals promise incentives in an era of distraction, but they also risk importing the logic of productivity into one of the few remaining spaces of offline pleasure. As Nguyen puts it: “Reading goals can be good starters, but if the number remains the reason you read, something has gone wrong.”Running the numbersAuthors, a bookseller, an influencer and a librarian tally their 2025 readsDerek Owusuauthor: 38 booksI didn’t read a book until I was 24. When I discovered reading, it was for pure pleasure. I read at my own pace and reread freely. I don’t usually track the number of books I’ve read, and even worrying about whether I’ve read “enough” irritates me. If I’ve read five books, who cares? I’m baffled by people being impressed or unimpressed by reading totals.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Kate PetersThe only goal I set is if I really like an author, I’ll read their back catalogue. I don’t count how many books there are, I just keep going until I get tired. I want to improve as a writer, so I read with that in mind too. But when I’m writing it’s also paradoxically harder to read at all, because I become tunnel-visioned and I don’t want to accidentally plagiarise anything.Rereading is a big part of how I read too. People say you can’t judge an album after one listen, but a book gets one read and a definitive verdict. Nabokov said: “One cannot read a book: one can only reread it.” The first time, you learn the texture; the second time, you see the craft.My opinions change with every reread. Last year, I reread The Fall by Albert Camus and thought, “Why did I love this so much the first time?” It’s probably because I was in my early 20s and very angsty. I reread F Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby every year: last year I didn’t like it much; this year I thought it was amazing.Chrissy Ryanbookseller atBookBar: 145 booksLast year was the first time I set a reading goal: 100 books. I thought it was achievable and would keep me focused, especially if I hit a reading rut. When you work in books, a rut can spiral into, “Do I not love books any more? What if I can never read again and this is my whole career?” The goal helped, but only because I made a rule: if I started stressing about numbers, I’d stop.Owning BookBar has changed how I read. I’m usually buying three to six months ahead, and I try to read as much as possible in that window to know what I’m stocking. If a book is pitched as “big and buzzy” and I’ve read it and didn’t enjoy it, I might not buy it. Conversely, sometimes I miss a book and read it later, such asThe Correspondent by Virginia Evans– I wish I’d caught it earlier because I loved it and it sold really well.Some of my favourite books I read last year (which are actually coming out this year) areI Want You to Be Happy by Jem CalderandFrida Slattery As Herself by Ana Kinsella.Reading is pleasure and work for me. As a bookshop, you’re taste-making: you’re saying, “We endorse this.” That creates pressure, which can become suffocating. So, in December I stopped reading ahead and read purely for pleasure, and it reminded me why I love it. I’m trying to return to classics and older books more this year too, because having a greater understanding of literary context makes me a better bookseller.Jack Edwardsbook influencer with1.5 millionfollowers acrossInstagramandTikTok: 137 booksI set reading goals that feel achievable. Last year, my goal was 100 books and I read 137. The point isn’t competition; it’s noticing how I spend my time. How much did I read last week versus how much time did I spend on my phone? The latter becomes about how you’re perceived; it turns toxic.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Kate PetersOne of the ways I’ve managed to build a career out of this is by gamifying it – I realised that numbers make things more clickable: it’s the reason people love listicles, that number is satisfying to us. But, for me, reading has always been something I really enjoy, and you have to make sure you’re only competing with yourself rather than doing it for other people.I think of reading like going to the gym: you train endurance and strength. It’s not just how long you read, but how long you can sustain focus and critical thought. The brain is a muscle, you build it over time.I’m naturally a slow reader and I like lingering over books. I read with a pen in hand, underlining and marking passages. If someone pulls a book off my shelf, the markings show my path through it. The book tells the author’s story, but it also tells the story of me reading it.Two of my favourite books I read last year wereRejection by Tony Tulathimutte, which I thought was such a fun exploration of internet culture and the loneliness epidemic, andGunk by Saba Sams, an amazing novel set in a nightclub in Brighton about an unconventional family dynamic.My goals now are mostly non-numerical. After studying English literature, I realised how narrow the canon can be, so I prioritised literature in translation, and I fell in love with Argentinian horror and Japanese and Korean micro-studies of character. This year, I’m reading more African writers and exploring the continent’s literary heritage.Olivia Young-Thompsonlibrarian: 45 booksLast year, I read about two or three books a month, but I didn’t set a target. I also started writing my own book, and when I’m writing I find it hard to read much. One hobby replaced another for a while, and that’s fine.My reading was a mix: tiny charity-shop paperbacks, big novels, classics and “fluff”. My favourite books from last year includedKatherine Arden’s Winternight trilogy, which I loved because it felt cold and wintry during a hot summer, and also some nonfiction, particularlySharon Blackie’s If Women Rose Rooted.Working as a librarian, I actually don’t feel huge pressure to read hundreds of books, though it helps to know about the prize winners, as that’s what people often come in looking for your thoughts about.Some people read 100 books a year, and if you can do that, wonderful. But if you can’t, you shouldn’t be seen as any less of a reader. I think the competitive side of reading mostly exists online.There’s also a difference between racing through novellas and spending weeks with War and Peace. I hate fast fashion and fast anything, and I’m scared books are starting to fall into that category too. I’ve gone back to rereading books I loved as a child – it’s like re-listening to a favourite album. Forgoing that pleasure just to add another number to a tally feels pointless.Jan Carsonauthor: 300 booksI read for about four hours a day. It can sound shocking, but reading is my job. That time includes reading for pleasure, for content that I’m teaching my students, articles I’m writing and proofs I’ve been sent.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Polly GarnettI don’t read in four-hour chunks. I break it into an hour in the morning, an hour in bed, and I read on the treadmill or exercise bike. I keep a book in my bag, so if someone’s late for coffee or I’m stuck on a bus, I read, which pulls me away from doomscrolling. Short stories are perfect for those small windows of time.I keep a semi-privateInstagramto track what I’ve read, but it’s just for me really. A lot of my goals are non‑numerical – for example, this will be my seventh year of reading an author’s entire canon in chronological order. That doesn’t have to be an overwhelming goal: in 2020, I did Agatha Christie, which was a lot of books, but for Toni Morrison it was only 11. You see writers grow into their voice, which is heartening in a publishing culture that venerates the perfect debut.My favourite books last year wereSarah Perry’s Death of an Ordinary ManandVincenzo Latronico’s Perfection. I try to read across genres and I’m not a snob about what I read, either. Some authors slow you down and reward attention, such as Marilynne Robinson and Hilary Mantel. I’m also drawn to older writers such asIris MurdochandMargaret Drabble; the sentences move at a different rhythm. I spend a lot of time talking about books with friends – I love that communal argument and exchange.Explore more on these topicsBooksSociety booksFictionSocial mediaLiteracyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They include an Asante gold mask that was taken by the British army when it destroyed the Asante empire’s capital, Kumasi, and is now in the Wallace Collection in London. Another object is the skull of the Tanzanian king Mangi Meli, which was taken to Germany after its colonial regime executed him in 1900.The Asante mask in Relooted.Illustration: NyamakopHundreds of thousands of culturally and spiritually significant items were looted from Africa during the 19th and 20th centuries, when European countries carved up the continent into colonies. A2018 reportcommissioned by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, estimated that more than 90% of Africa’s material cultural heritage was held outside the continent.In this South African-made game the job is to liberate African artefacts from Western museumsBerlin’s Ethnologisches Museum and Cambridge University are among the institutions to havereturned Benin bronzes to Nigeria, for example. Others, including the British Museum, have resisted calls to return bronzes and other looted objects.Ben Myres, chief executive ofNyamakop, which developed Relooted, said: “Real-life repatriation is enormously complicated and it’s been ongoing for decades, in some cases even a century or more … We’re giving people this hopeful, utopian feeling … of what it’s going to feel like when all these artefacts finally come home.”View image in fullscreenThe Ngadji drum, which is currently in the British Museum.Illustration: NyamakopMyres started creating the game in 2018 after his mother returned from the British Museum outraged at seeing the Nereid Monument, a Lycian tomb from Turkey.

The skull, also known as Broken Hill Man, isin London’s Natural History Museum.She said: “Even before I started working at Nyamakop … I just felt like … someone should get it back and it would be cool for someone to do this in some form of media, in a game.”Creating Relooted was an eye-opening experience, Ncube said. “Learning about the scale of artefact looting in Africa, up to now I still can’t wrap my head around the numbers. It seems quite ridiculous and probably underestimated as well.”Explore more on these topicsGamesSouth AfricaColonialismAfricaBritish MuseumfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was probably a boarding school thing. Very stiff upper lip. My parents are not the most emotionally available human beings, either. I like to tease them by saying: “I love you.” You can see the panic in their eyes. They will normally say: “All right then, bye.”My gran died when I was about 18, and I was sad, of course, but in terms of tears there was nothing, no water. I never cried at movies. I didn’t cry on my wedding day, nor at the birth of either of my daughters. It never alarmed me. I actually thought I might have underactive tear glands. Looking back, it was probably all about control.My cultural awakening: Bach helped me survive sexual abuse as a childRead moreIn 2023 I went to see the musicalOperation Mincemeatfor the first time in the West End. What struck me was the humour – a lot of it was taking aim at the public school culture I grew up with. I didn’t cry then but I did have the urge to see it again. I think it was maybe the third or fourth time of going when the song Dear Bill got me. It appears halfway through the musical and the lyrics take the form of a letter from a woman to her husband, who is away fighting in the second world war. I was shocked to find myself crying. I had to go back to see it with my wife, Yael, to prove to her that I could now cry. She definitely thought I was a bit emotionally repressed. When the song came on I took her hand and dabbed it on the side of my eye. Her face was one of utter shock.I’ve thought about why it unlocked something in me and I think it’s because the song itself has so many layers of repression to it. The character who sings it, Hester Leggatt, rarely shows any emotion. And the lyrics themselves only talk about the heartache of separation through the metaphor of tending to roses. There’s a line about how the flowers are dull and not thriving. I thought: is that how my wife and children see me?double quotation markNow every time I see the show I'm almost crying when I get there. It's like a Pavlovian response to hearing the intro musicAs the song continues, we witness the gradual release of Hester’s true feelings: anger, guilt, all sorts of emotions pour out. One line – “Why did we meet in the middle of a war, what a silly thing for anyone to do” – was written in the real-life letter the song is based on. That added another layer to it.One thing you notice on maybe the third time you go is that, halfway through the song, Hester accidentally says the name of her former love, Tom, rather than Bill, the pretend character she is writing the letter to. That moment is especially poignant. I’ve now been to see Operation Mincemeat 29 times, with trip number 30 already booked. I often cried at Dear Bill, but then it moved on to other songs, such as Useful, which is about the women whose important wartime work went largely unrewarded. Now when I see the show I’m almost crying when I get there. It’s like a Pavlovian response as soon as I hear the intro music.I’ve been to see the musical on Broadway too with my family, and I have met the cast at the stage door. I’m a teacher and I have taken my year 6 kids to see it. I think I heard some sniffles during that, and it wasn’t just me.‘We wrote it living on Tesco sandwiches and anxiety attacks!’ How Operation Mincemeat conquered the worldRead moreI have since found myself crying in lots of situations outside Operation Mincemeat. It has been like learning a new skill. I always cry now when I watch the film Interstellar. When my class watched Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom, one of my pupils said: “Look, Mr Allen’s crying!” I even cried at a bloody Brandi Carlile concert and that’s not my type of music. She sang a song that was basically a farewell to her children’s innocence, and I had tears streaming down my face. Even Yael thought that was a bit much – and she will cry at a Dove advert.I have definitely become a more rounded person. When a good friend of mine, Josh, died of stomach cancer at 34, completely out of the blue, I went to the funeral and was an absolute mess. Josh knew what I had been like before, so I liked to imagine him looking down at me sobbing and finding it hilarious. But in a strange way it felt good. To sit there and repress it would have been terrible. Instead, this was cathartic. We went for drinks afterwards and it felt as if I had really got it all out. Without Operation Mincemeat, I’m honestly not sure I would have been able to.Share your cultural awakeningsShare your experiencesYou can tell us how a cultural moment has prompted you to make a major life change by filling in the form below or emailing us on cultural.awakening@theguardian.com.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Its title comes from the colour of the official dismissal notices.Wim Wenders, the veteran German film-maker and jury president of the 76th Berlinale, said the feature gave the jury “chills” with its warning of “signs of despotism” and a threat of repression “that could possibly happen in our countries”.“This film will be understood worldwide, I promise you,” said Wenders, who faced a storm of criticism as the festival opened over his comments on movies and activism.Çatak, whose 2023 dramaThe Teachers’ Loungewas nominated for an Oscar, thanked Wenders, saying: “You are one of my teachers so it’s such an incredible thing to accept this from you.”Yellow Letters was shot in Germany, with Berlin standing in for Ankara and Hamburg for Istanbul. The producers said this was not due to fear of reprisal from Turkish authorities but to stress the film’s “universal” themes.View image in fullscreenThe runner-up Grand Jury award went to Emin Alper for Salvation, which is about a decades-old land feud in the Turkish mountains.Photograph: Fabian Sommer/EPAThe runner-up Grand Jury award went to Emin Alper’s Salvation, which is about a decades-old land feud in the Turkish mountains.The third-place jury prize was awarded to the US director Lance Hammer forhis wrenching London-based dementia drama Queen at Sea. It stars the French actor Juliette Binoche as a professor struggling with her ailing mother’s final phase of life.The Silver Bear prize for best director went to Britain’s Grant Gee forEverybody Digs Bill Evans, a stylish black-and-white feature about the legendary jazz pianist’s struggles with addiction.“The wonderful cast – honestly, I directed them so little,” Gee said of the ensemble including Anders Danielsen Lie, Bill Pullman and Laurie Metcalf.The award for the best performance went to the German starSandra Hüller in Rose, about a woman soldier in the 17th century who passes herself off as a man to get the better of a patriarchal society.The drama, also filmed in black-and-white with touches of wry humour, is based on extensive research by the film’s Austrian director, Markus Schleinzer, into similar historical cases.The award cements the reputation of Hüller, best known internationally for The Zone of Interest and Anatomy of a Fall, as one of Europe’s most sought-after talents.“I find this really remarkable that I can be in a room full of people who can speak truth,” said Hüller, who first won an acting prize at the festival two decades ago for her turn in Hans-Christian Schmid’s Requiem.Best supporting performance was shared by Britain’s Anna Calder-Marshall and Tom Courtenay in Queen at Sea for their searing, nuanced portrayal of an elderly couple navigating sexuality and self-determination as the wife’s faculties fail.Queen at Sea review – crushingly sad dementia drama offers a startling portrait of intimacyRead moreCourtenay said it was “wonderful when America seems to be turning its back on Europe” to have Hammer bring together a multinational cast and crew.The Canadian film-maker Geneviève Dulude-De Celles, who accepted best screenplay for the immigration drama Nina Roza, said she was “resisting to keep our identity alive” against a “very invasive American culture”.The Silver Bear for outstanding artistic contribution was awarded to the innovative documentary Yo (Love is a Rebellious Bird) by Anna Fitch and Banker White, which uses puppetry, dioramas and even insect “actors” to pay tribute to Fitch’s elderly best friend after her death.The Berlinale is considered the most politically minded of Europe’s big film festivals next to Cannes and Venice, with programming that often champions embattled artists from repressive countries.However, controversy erupted when a reporter asked Wenders about support for Israel by the German government, which provides about 40% of the festival’s funding, and the civic responsibilities of cinema.Rose review – Sandra Hüller is outstanding in grimy examination of gender stereotypesRead moreWenders said film-makers “have to stay out of politicsbecause if we make movies that are dedicatedly political, we enter the field of politics”. He insisted “movies can change the world” but not by shaping policy.The remarks sparked outrage online and prompted Indian author Arundhati Roy, who had been invited to present a restored copy of a 1989 film she wrote,to pull out of the festival, calling Wenders’s comments “jaw-dropping” and “unconscionable”.Days later, dozens of film industry heavyweights including Javier Bardem, Tilda Swinton and Adam McKay signed an open lettercondemning the festival’s “silence” on Gazaand accusing it of censoring opponents of Israel’s “ongoing genocide”.Stars including Michelle Yeoh, Ethan Hawke, Neil Patrick Harris and Channing Tatum largely sidestepped pointed questions about Gaza and rising “fascism” in western countries at news conferences about their new films.But other film-makers, including several of Saturday’s prize winners, used the festival’s platform tocriticise Israel and the far right, garnering loud applause.Wenders addressed the controversy during the ceremony, calling the dispute a social-media-driven “artificial discrepancy” between art and activism. He quoted Swinton as saying at the festival last year that “being for something does not ever imply being anti-anyone else”.“Activists are fighting mainly on the internet for humanitarian causes, namely the dignity and protection of human life,” Wenders said. “These are our causes as well, as the Berlinale films clearly show.”The US-bornBerlinale chief Tricia Tuttle, who previously ran the London film festival, had earlier strongly rejected the allegations of censorship, calling them “incredibly damaging” and based on targeted “misinformation”.At the awards ceremony, she expressed understanding for people who “arrived carrying a lot of grief and anger and some urgency about the world”.“And if this Berlinale has been emotionally charged, that’s not a failure of the Berlinale, and it’s not a failure of cinema,” she said. “That is the Berlinale doing its job, and it’s cinema doing its job.”Explore more on these topicsBerlin film festivalFestivalsWim WendersnewsShareReuse this content"

Not only is this present among artists themselves, but among people working in galleries, museums and other cultural institutions.According to the latest UK governmentstatistics, the creative industries employ 2.42 million people, of which 78% identify as being from a “more advantaged socio-economic background”.Last year,Guardian analysisfound that almost 30% of artistic directors and other creative leaders were privately educated, compared with a national average of just 7%. More than a third (36%) of the organisations’ chief executives or other executive directors went to private schools.Molloy works as a consultant for artists and galleries, and her career in the arts spans more than a decade. She describes the experience as being “surrounded by people who’d gone to private school and studied art history – a subject barely even available in state education”.“There’s no diversity of voice or thought in that, and it’s creating a bubble. It’s exclusionary, unfair and ultimately makes the art world less vibrant and harder for working-class people to infiltrate,” says Molloy.Working Arts Club has created a network of creative job-seekers and professionals through its newsletter and Whatsapp group, where job vacancies and events are shared.View image in fullscreenA Working Arts Club performance.Photograph: David Owens“Those who are just starting out in the sector can immediately be chatting with experienced people from large organisations,” says Kirsty Jukes, a communications officer at the Manchester Art Gallery, who will lead the northern wing of the club. “Having seen the benefits of the London iteration myself, I know it would be a great network to have up here as well.”Amy Gilles, 31, a club member and operations manager at the Quentin Blake Centre for Illustration, said it had made networking “much more accessible”.“I received a free ticket to attend Frieze Art Fair, which is incredibly expensive and a huge financial barrier. Being able to go and see how the industry works was hugely impactful,” said Gilles.Other members highlight the need for class-based initiatives within the sector. “Networks, clubs and collectives focused on working-class people are so important because they create spaces where shared realities don’t need explanation,” says Jennifer Jones, 26, a club member who also founded a working-class artist group calledGrafters Collective.“I’d been feeling like no one around me understood how much harder it is to be in these spaces and to balance everything when you don’t have financial support, don’t have industry connections and don’t understand the social codes or how the industry works because you come from outside of these circles,” she says.As well as the launch party in Manchester, there will be a social event in Liverpool in April. As part of the club’s expansion, Molloy and Jukes hope to partner with galleries, museums and art fairs in the north of England to set up panel talks and tours for its members.Molloy says the club is looking for funding “to make the network sustainable and allow it to grow”.Explore more on these topicsArtClass issuesInequalityNorth of EnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For hundreds of thousands of self-employed people and property owners, those words are ringing true – and have never felt more daunting.This spring, HM Revenue and Customs is introducing the biggest shake-up of the self-assessment tax system in decades.Known as MakingTaxDigital, it will transform the way tax returns are submitted, adding a new “quarterly updates” requirement.HMRC recently issued an “act now” warning, saying that more than 860,000 sole traders and landlords need to start preparing for the change if they haven’t done so already.But they are just the first wave of people affected – the number is poised to rise to almost 3 million by spring 2028 as lower-income individuals are brought into the system.View image in fullscreenHMRC recently issued an ‘act now’ warning for Making Tax Digital.Photograph: True Images/AlamyWhat is Making Tax Digital?It’s a new system for recording and reporting your tax information to HMRC. It affects self-employed people and people who have property income above HMRC’s income thresholds.,” says Claire Thackaberry, a technical officer at the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group.From this April, the starting threshold is £50,000. On 6 April 2027, the MTD threshold will fall to £30,000. The figure is for self-employment and property income earned in the 2025-26 tax year (the one we are in now).And from 6 April 2028, the threshold will fall further: to £20,000 for property and self-employment income earned in the 2026-27 tax year.People earning over those thresholds will have to use commercial software to send HMRC an annual tax return, as well as quarterly digital records showing their income and expenses from property and self-employment.The digital records must show the value and date of each transaction and, where appropriate, detail whichHMRC category of “allowable expenses” each expense falls into, Thackaberry says.How do I know if I’m affected?Check your 2024-25 tax return. If you were registered for self-assessment and your combined turnover from property and self-employment exceeded £50,000, you are legally required to move to the new system, unless you qualify for an exemption. If your combined turnover from self-employment and property exceeds the relevant threshold, you must move to the new system unless you qualify for an exemption this year.View image in fullscreenLandlords will need to comply with the new digital tax system if their income is over a specified threshold.Photograph: courtneyk/Getty ImagesThe £50,000 threshold applies to turnover (ie your gross income, before your tax and expenses have been taken into account), not profits.You must combine your turnover from property and self-employment to assess whether you exceed the threshold. Expect your turnover to be ‘annualised’ – proportionally adjusted – by HMRC if you started your business mid-year.Other sources of income, including employment or PAYE income, do not count.Even though they are self-employed, foster carers, kinship carers and shared-life carers who receive “qualifying care relief” on income from their care activities will find this income is exempt from MTD and does not count towards the threshold.Bear in mind you can also earn up to £1,000 fromrenting out property or tradingeach year, or up to £7,500 a year under therent-a-room scheme, without needing to report this on your tax return – which means HMRC will not take this income into consideration.View image in fullscreenYou can still earn up to £1,000 from renting out property, or up to £7,500 under the ‘rent a room’ scheme, without declaring it on your tax return.Photograph: Paula  Solloway/AlamyHMRC is writing to affected taxpayers in February and March, but even if you don’t receive a letter, it is your legal responsibility to comply with MTD.“If your letter gets lost in the post, you must still sign up, unless you’re exempt,” says Thackaberry.You can useHMRC’s step-by-step online guideto sign up.Who is automatically exempt?There are some groups of people who do not have to use this system, no matter how much they earn. They include:People who don’t have a national insurance number.Until at least April 2029: disabled people who receive the blind person’s allowance.Until at least April 2027: recipients of qualifying care relief who also earn income from property or self-employment.Limited companies. MTD only applies to individuals. If you are a company director whose only income is your salary and dividends, even if you perceive yourself to be self-employed, your income does not qualify.A full list of people who qualify for exemptions can be found in theMTD guidance on Gov.uk.Can I get an exemption?You can apply to HMRC for an exemption if it is not reasonably practical for you to use digital software (for example because of your age, disability, or because the remoteness of your location means you cannot get internet access at your home or business) or if you are a practising member of a religious order “which forbids you using a computer”, says Andy Levett of the accountancy firm HW Fisher.Applications are assessed on a case-by-case basis. You should continue preparing for MTD while awaiting a decision.It won’t be enough simply to say you need an exemption because of your age, Thackaberry warns. “You’d have to explain how your age affects your ability to comply,” she says.How do I comply?You (or your accountant or bookkeeper) need to use MTD-compliant software to send quarterly digital updates, due just over one month after the quarter ends.For example, records for the first quarter, 6 April 2026 to 5 July 2026, must be submitted by 7 August 2026. Records for the second quarter must be submitted by 7 November 2026. Late submissions will incur penalties.You can pay for the software or use a free version. HMRC has created anonline quizto help you assess which is best for you.Expect to pay about £5 to £8 a month for all-singing, all-dancing access to premium software, such as Xero, Sage, QuickBooks, Clear Books or FreeAgent. This cost can be included in your quarterly updates and offset against your income as a business expense.Which software should I use?View image in fullscreenSoftware linked to your current account will need to be used to categorise all transactions as ‘sales’, ‘expenses’ or ‘drawings’.Photograph: Ascannio/AlamyThere are two main types:Bridging software. You can link this to a simple spreadsheet which details all your transactions. You or your agent can manually fill in this spreadsheet once a quarter.Software that allows you to create digital records of your transactions as they occur. You can link this software to your current account and import your transactions automatically. This is likely to be the least time-consuming option if you are filing the returns yourself.If you opt for software linked to your current account, you will need to use it to categorise all the transactions in that account as either “sales” (income from property or self-employment), “expenses” (costs incurred for business purposes) or “drawings” (personal spending, such as on a birthday card for a friend). Any transactions you categorise as “drawings” will be excluded from the digital updates sent to HMRC. Any transactions you categorise as “expenses” should beallowable expensesunder HMRC rules.Even though the software is tracking only the transactions in your linked account, you should be able to manually create digital records for any that accidentally took place from another, unlinked account or were made using good old-fashioned cash.View image in fullscreenPremium software such as Xero will cost about £5 to £8 a month.Photograph: tofino/AlamyThis means, for example, that if you work from home and pay your rent or utility bills from an unlinked joint account you contribute to, the software will allow you to manually create digital records of these transactions, and show that a relevant proportion of these costs were actually business expenses.It should also allow you to make manual adjustments to your records so you can allocate the correct portion of some mixed-use transactions (such as your mobile phone bill or petrol costs) to personal use.Do my updates have to be accurate?Although you have to send HMRC quarterly updates, the information you record in them does not have to be 100% accurate and can be corrected later.You can make manual additions and adjustments to the data you recorded before you send your final end-of-year return to HMRC.Your end-of-year tax return can also show extra transactions which were not included (for any reason, including that you forgot about them) in the quarterly updates.What’s the biggest challenge?View image in fullscreenThe addition of quarterly updates to the current tax regime will be a shock, say experts.Photograph: Isabelle Plasschaert/Alamy“It’s going to be a shock to the system,” says Levett.However, he thinks people may eventually come to see MTD in a positive light. “It will mean you don’t have to keep paper receipts and tot them up, because the digital system can read your bank account.”This will cut down the amount of work you do, he says, especially at the end of the tax year. “You could eventually get into a situation where you’re having a quick review of your account while you’re sitting on the train or having a cup of coffee, going through your transactions and saying ‘That was a business expense for some books I bought,’ and ‘That was my income,’ and then pressing a button.”But, he admits, not everyone will enjoy having to categorise all their transactions all the time. “There’s a lot of people who will absolutely detest the idea.”How can I prepare?Using a separate account for income and spending related to your business will significantly reduce the number of transactions you need to categorise for HMRC. So one of the best ways to prepare for MTD is to open a current account you use solely for your business, says Levett.This does not have to be a paid business bank account. It could simply be a free personal current account at your existing bank.Mettle, a digital banking brand owned by NatWest, offers a free business account for sole traders and landlords. It comes with a complimentary premium version of FreeAgent accounting software, which is MTD-compliant and allows you to create and track invoices.When Guardian Money tested opening a Mettle account late last year, it took 11 days – longer than expected, apparently owing to “a high number of account applications”. Otherwise, it was seamless.The customer service provided by FreeAgent was excellent: an expert spent nearly 90 minutes over the phone explaining, step by step, how to use the software to categorise digital transactions, create manual digital records for cash transactions, generate invoices and send digital updates to HMRC. There is also a free webinar you can attend.View image in fullscreenHMRC is waiving penalties for late quarterly updates for the first year of Making Tax Digital.Photograph: Rosemary Roberts/AlamyWhat if I don’t do it?Each late submission incurs one penalty point. You will get a £200 fine when you reach four points. The points expire after two years if you stay below the four-point threshold during that period.The good news is that for the first year of MTD, HMRC is waiving penalties for late quarterly updates.There are also no penalties for filing inaccurate quarterly updates, as long as your final tax return is correct.Levett thinks the first year is going to be “a learning experience” for everyone.“Even HMRC will probably be aware that this first year is going to be a festival of non-compliance and a learning experience,” he says. “This is why people shouldn’t panic.”Explore more on these topicsSelf-assessment taxConsumer affairsTaxHMRCIncome taxRenting propertyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This creates dozens of thin layers of fat between each layer of pastry. It’s skilled, arduous work, but that’s where ready-rolled puff pastry comes in.

I noted the height of the rise as well as the lamination (the separation of layers), texture, flavour, ingredients and value relative to quality.The flavour profile of most of the pastries was pretty neutral (a sign of ultra processing), but a couple of standouts had a natural sweetness and nutty flavour. The texture varied wildly. All you need to make puff pastry is flour, butter, milk and salt, with optional egg and yeast, but many of these products are made withpalm oil(instead of butter), additives,preservatives,emulsifiers, flavourings and colourings.The best supermarket puff pastryBest overall:M&S handcrafted all butter puff pastryView image in fullscreen£3 for 320g at Ocado (94p/100g)★★★★☆A uniform, golden-brown pillow, 16mm deep, with good lamination.

You could flip the sweet in your mouth and rub the flavour you wanted with your tongue. Too tart? Flip to the custard side. Too creamy? Flip again. It was one of the best ways to spend 10 minutes as a seven-year-old in the early 1990s. A few decades on, a lot has changed. Mum no longer has a corner shop, I don’t love boiled sweets any more, but eating rhubarb and custard is still a fantastic way to spend 10 minutes (at the very least).Rhubarb and custard trifleYou’ll need two large, roughly 30cm x 40cm oven trays and a 20cm trifle bowl. You can make the custard ahead of time, even the day before, up to the point when you add the whipped cream.Prep10 minCook1 hrCool30 min+Serves81.2kg forced pink rhubarb, topped, tailed and cut on an angle into 4cm pieces200g caster sugar3 oranges, zest of 1 finely grated, then all 3 juiced, to get 150ml3 large egg yolks1 tbsp vanilla paste10g cornflour(1⅓ tbsp)1 big pinch fine sea salt120ml whole milk600ml double cream30 trifle sponge fingers30g flaked almonds, toastedHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Put the rhubarb in an oven tray, add 150g sugar and all the orange zest and juice, then toss. Arrange the rhubarb into a single layer (you may need a second tray), cover tightly with foil and bake for 20 minutes. Carefully lift off the foil and check the rhubarb with the tip of a sharp knife: the rhubarb shouldn’t resist the knife at all, but it should keep its shape. If not, cover and bake again, checking for doneness every five minutes.Once the rhubarb is cooked, take the tray out of the oven and leave to cool. After about half an hour, once it has cooled, drain off the liquid into a jug and set aside. Store both the rhubarb and juice separately, covered, in the fridge.In the meantime, make the custard. Mix the egg yolks, vanilla paste, cornflour, the remaining 50g sugar and salt in a medium to large heatproof bowl. In a saucepan, heat the milk and 240ml of the cream, stirring regularly until small bubbles start to appear. Very slowly, pour this into the egg yolk mix in the heatproof bowl, whisking all the time. When properly mixed in, pour the lot back into the pan, and heat on a low to medium heat, whisking all the while, until the custard thickens. Take off the heat and pour into a heatproof bowl; cover the surface of the custard with a circle of nonstick baking paper, to prevent a skin from forming, and leave to cool completely.Whisk the remaining 360ml cream to soft peaks, fold 120g of it into the cooled custard, then transfer to a container, cover and chill until needed.To assemble, pack 15 sponges tightly in a single layer on their sides (rather than on their backs) in the base of the trifle dish. Drizzle over around 150ml of the rhubarb juice, then add half the rhubarb, followed by half the custard. Repeat the layers again (sponge, juice, rhubarb, custard), then finish with the remaining whipped cream. Sprinkle the toasted almonds on top and keep in the fridge until ready to serve.Explore more on these topicsVegetablesMeera Sodha recipesFoodDessertFruitBiscuitsBritish food and drinkEggsrecipesShareReuse this content"

Her husband, Malcolm Baker, died when the property exploded.She discovered that Baker had cancelled the couple’s insurance policies and emptied their business bank accounts after she began divorce proceedings following years of abuse. She was not named in his will and faced repossession by their mortgage lender. The repossession order was halted after the Guardian intervened.Lucy Rigby, the City minister and economic secretary to the Treasury, contacted Onody after reading about her ordeal.“I was moved to tears,” Rigby said. “Francesca’s case is a truly shocking example of economic abuse and demonstrates just how devastating the impact can be.”View image in fullscreenLucy Rigby described Francesca Onody’s case as a ‘truly shocking example of economic abuse’.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianThe minister has asked to meet Onody to hear first-hand about her experiences and discuss measures that might help save other survivors from destitution. The charity Surviving Economic Abuse will also attend.“The government’s determination to tackle economic abuse is why we made this a cross-cutting theme in our recently published financial inclusion strategy,” says Rigby. “I’m absolutely determined that as a government we do everything we can to prevent victim-survivors like Francesca having to go through what she did.”Onody said she was failed by the authorities and financial providers when she sought help for Baker’s abuse.“Abusers are manipulative and calculating, using the terms and conditions of financial institutions to their advantage,” she said. “If speaking up can help in any small way to stop someone else from going through what my children and I went through, then I’m happy to meet with anyone.”According to Surviving Economic Abuse, abusers can weaponise financial products and services to maintain control and continue to cause harm long after a divorce.“Financial services professionals, from banks to insurers, must be better equipped to spot the signs of economic abuse and support customers,” said the charity’s chief executive, Sam Smethers.“We welcome the economic secretary to the Treasury’s commitment to tackling economic abuse, but urgent legislative reform is now needed to close the gaps in our systems that abusers continue to exploit. The Financial Conduct Authority should urgently issue guidance to help firms support survivors under existing rules. It’s the only way to help survivors like Francesca and their children to safely rebuild their lives.”In the UK, call the national domestic abuse helpline on 0808 2000 247, or visitWomen’s Aid.

A gentler take on a traditional mullet, the new salad style consists of more subtle differences in the length between the back, sides and top of the hair. Lettuce hair features a loose and often wavy top, softly tapered sides and a feathery tail that skims the back of the neck, resembling leafy greens.For the Wuthering Heights press tour, Jacob Elordi toned down his on-screen regency cut, tapering the sides but keeping the windswept top and tail, bringing to mind a head of romaine lettuce. The wavy locks of Heated Rivalry’s Connor Storrie could be mistaken for a curled endive, while the figure skater Ilia Malinin’s butter-lettuce locks add extra drama to the Quad God’s dizzying axels.View image in fullscreenSportspeople such as the US skater Ilia Malinin have leaned hard into the lettuce.Photograph: Andy Cheung/Getty ImagesThe salad style stems from the world of ice hockey, where players widely embraced the mullet during the 70s and 80s. Despite the mullet’s demise in the 90s, hockey players were slow to ditch “the party at the back” and instead toned it down, resulting in more modern lettuce locks.“The classic sign of proper hockey hair is that you can clearly see it flowing out at the back while wearing a helmet,” says Markus Ekroth, who is a right-winger for Sweden’s Nackarockers. The team have amassed hundreds of thousands of views of theirTikTok videosthat showcase the team’s best lettuce hair.“I have naturally wavy hair, so I usually ask my hairdresser to keep some length at the back, especially around the neck, and enough length on top so I can tuck it behind my ears,” Ekroth says. “If you have good lettuce, people will definitely notice. It’s seen as a bonus and part of the hockey identity.”View image in fullscreenThe Heated Rivalry star Connor Storrie’s wavy locks.Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty ImagesHockey players refer to the longer tufts of hair fluttering out from under their helmets as they skate as “flow” or “flow state”.During the men’s gold-medal ice hockey game at the Winter Olympics on Sunday, some of the finest examples of flow will be on display. Ekroth describes the US player William Nylander, Sweden’s Mika Zibanejad and Germany’s Moritz Seider as having “great lettuce” and representing “the classic modern hockey look”.However, the look is not limited to hockey. John King, the editor-in-chief of Pulltab Sports, compares Malinin’s pirouetting mane to the US ice hockey star Jake Guentzel’s whirling hair, and points to the US freestyle skier Mac Forehand’s “awesome hair” as a strong example of the style. “A mullet is hockey hair, but not all hockey hair is a mullet,” King says.Since 2011, King has been compiling an annual “All Hockey Hair Team”YouTube videowhere he ranks the lettuce of the Minnesota high school hockey team in his home town. It has subscribers from all over the world, many of whom have never watched a hockey game.View image in fullscreenThe Swedish ice hockey player Mika Zibanejad represents ‘the classic modern hockey look’.Photograph: Amber Searls/Imagn Images/ReutersNow the trend is whizzing its way from the rink to the red carpet. Barry Keoghan’snew hair, as he prepares to play Ringo Starr, is heavily lettuce coded. As are Harry Styles’s tufty tresses in promotional photos for his new album, Aperture. Glen Powell, Brad Pitt, Paul Mescal and Austin Butler have also recently succumbed to the salad.Ekroth says part of the appeal is that the style can boost confidence. “It doesn’t physically add anything to your performance, but the saying ‘look good, play good’ definitely applies.”King says some players have recently begun to get perms to ensure a consistent curly lettuce look, while others bleach it for extra impact. Only time will tell if Hollywood will follow suit and go with the flow.Explore more on these topicsMen's hairBeautyIce hockeynewsShareReuse this content"

It’s the tail end of winter, 2021. Kensal Green Cemetery in west London: the imperial mausolea canted and crumbling, low clouds dissolving into rain. We are still  in that  strange phase of the pandemic when we are masked, newly aware of our bodies and the space around them. We are here to bury Nikos, a man who for me, for many, was the incarnation of Corfu.I had spent my 20s trying to find the perfect Greek island, hopping from the well-trodden (Mykonos, Santorini, Cephalonia) to the more obscure (Kythira, Symi, Meganisi). None quite matched the vision I had dreamed into being as a child, when I segued from Robert Graves to Mary Renault, then to Lawrence Durrell and John Fowles. Greece was an idea before it was a place: freedom and deep thought, a constellation of sand, salt and thyme.View image in fullscreenThen, on a whim, I accepted an invitation to play cricket in Corfu.I knew little about the island at the time – not about its strategic history, nor how that position had shaped a culture that is at once Greek, Venetian and British. I hadn’t yet walked the Liston, the elegant colonnaded arcade that might be Venice or Trieste, Bologna or Perugia were it not for the cricket pitch laid out in front of it. The pitch is surrounded by a car park; its groundsmen battle heat, salt spray, digging children and fouling dogs. Yet it remains the only cricket pitch in the world I know that’s set within aUnesco world heritage site. Taking guard there, you look up to the Old Fortress for solidity, and to the Palace of St Michael and St George for elegance and flair.View image in fullscreenThe cricket pitch next to the elegant arcade in Corfu Town.Photograph: Ernestos Vitouladitis/AlamyI went out with the Lord’s Taverners, a UK sports charity team. We were a motley bunch: a couple of former internationals – Andy Caddick and Chris Cowdrey – some actors, entertainers and a handful of writers, including me. The Corfiots, it turned out, were very good at cricket. The Greek national team is drawn almost entirely from the island. We were soundly beaten, then consoled by warmth, generosity and a run of excellent dinners in the Old Town.It was over one of those dinners – at thePergola– that I met Nikos Louvros and his wife, Annabelle, our hosts and the founders of Cricket Corfu. Nikos was rambunctiously Greek, full of wild energy; Annabelle was English in that particular way that falls deeply for Greece and builds a life around it. I recognised the impulse. By the end of the meal of lamb, ouzo and excellent local wine, we had planned our future together: we would launch a literary festival.View image in fullscreenFestival co-founders Annabelle and Nikos LouvrosOver the subsequent years, that vision has taken glorious shape.Corfu literary festivalbegan modestly: at our first, in 2017, there were as many speakers on stage as there were people in the audience. I remember Nikos’s hope, irritation and finally, characteristically, laughter as invited guests failed to show up. But there was never any sense it would stop. With Nikos beside you, everything seemed possible.Slowly, buoyed by local support, the festival grew into something far larger than we had imagined. We’ve had Stephen Fry and Sebastian Faulks, Bettany Hughes and Natalie Haynes, Matt Haig and Tom Holland. They came and spoke, they stayed at the heavenlyKontokali Bay hotel, or in the villas and apartments ofIonian Estates, and they fell in love with Corfu as I had. Many have come back to speak several times.double quotation markMyrtiotissa remains the beach that feels closest to a private miracle. Lawrence Durrell called it ‘perhaps the most beautiful beach in the world’Nikos lived for this – for showing others the beauty and drama of the island on which he was born, then left and returned to. He is gone now, but the festival endures. This September, it will return, larger and more magical than ever, with Homer’s Odyssey at its heart – a fitting subject for an island where the mythic and the everyday still fold into each other with ease.This is what I learned from Nikos, and from Corfu, over the years: swim early, before the day warms and when the water still has a faint bite. Swim after lunch, when the sea feels silky. Swim at dusk, when the surface holds the day’s heat and the light becomes thick and slow. Corfu is large enough and varied enough that you can build an entire itinerary around water and never feel you are repeating yourself.On the west coast, Myrtiotissa remains the beach that feels closest to a private miracle. Set in a steep green cradle, it is an initiation to reach it. Not unreasonably, Durrell called it “perhaps the most beautiful beach in the world”.View image in fullscreenPaleokastritsa beach.Photograph: Carmen Gabriela Filip/AlamyPaleokastritsa possesses a different kind of beauty. The monastery above the bay looks down over a scatter of coves where the water is so clear you can see the rocks far below, like a second landscape suspended in blue.Then there is the north-east, which has calmer waters, protected coves, a more intimate coastline. Agni Bay is a gentle curve of shoreline made for long lunches.Agni Tavernasits close enough to the water that you can leave your table, swim and return still tasting salt. Eat fish, eat simply, let time loosen its grip. If you can, arrive by boat: the north-east coast has a tradition of taking water taxis between bays, and there is something unmistakably Corfiot about stepping straight from deck to lunch.A surprise – especially if your image of Greek islands is Cycladic sparseness – is how green Corfu is. The interior rises and folds like a small country. Olive groves run for miles; cypresses spike the skyline. Drive up into the villages above Paleokastritsa and you reach Lakones, perched high enough to make the island feel suddenly vast. AtBoulis, the food is good, but it’s the terrace view you come for, the sense of stepping straight into the blue horizon.double quotation markMy novel is a love letter: an attempt to pay proper attention to a place that has given me more than I can easily nameCorfu’s cuisine is not what you usually think of as Greek: shaped by Venetian influence, by centuries of contact with Italy and by produce from the island’s land and sea.Pastitsadais a beef stew with pasta;sofritoisbeef or veal slices braised in a sauce of white wine, vinegar, garlic and parsley;bourdetois fish stew.In Corfu Town, make time for a night atSalto– contemporary but grounded, with excellent ingredients and a superb wine list. Then go for ice-cream atPapagiorgios. Walk the Old Town with a cone in hand, the stone still warm, and you feel part of a long tradition of summer nights.In 2020, in a brief, improbable lull between Covid lockdowns, we held the festival as if it were an act of defiance against the gods. The world was half closed; plans changed by the hour. Yet, for a few days, the island opened its arms and let us in. Chairs were spaced out, masks slipped on and off, hand sanitisers were perched on every table – and still there was laughter, ideas, beauty. Things that made us feel human.View image in fullscreenMyrtiotissa beach.Photograph: Hemis/AlamyOne morning, Nikos appeared with a boat. He had a gift for that – arriving as if from nowhere, already halfway into the next idea. “Come,” he said. A dozen of us climbed aboard and pulled away from the town, leaving behind the anxious news cycle and the low-level fear of that year. We ran along the north-east coast, cutting the engine in inlets you would never find from land: slivers of shingle, limestone shelves, beaches no bigger than sofas. Each time we stopped, we swam as if trying to slough the year off our skin. I felt like freedom, something snatched from darkness.That was the last festival Nikos attended. He died of Covid the following January – on my birthday.Hot springs, empty beaches, forests and wine: exploring the unspoilt Greek island of IkariaRead moreWhen I think of Nikos now, I think of that day on the water: of joy under pressure, of how precious it becomes. When he died, the island felt altered – not less beautiful, but more charged, as if the light carried grief in waves. Yet, Corfu also teaches something: that love for a place can outlive the person who brought you there, and become a way of honouring them.I have tried to do that in my own way, too. My novel A Stranger in Corfu is dedicated to Nikos. It grew out of this island – its layered past, its atmosphere of secrecy and hospitality, the sense that stories cling to the land. The novel is, at heart, a love letter: an attempt to pay proper attention to a place that has given me more than I can easily name.Go to Corfu and do not hurry. Swim often. Drive into the hills. Eat as if time were a gift.

Protesters had hauled them across the entrance to stop developers building on the slice of north Somerset green belt. The threat was not housing or industry, but a company building vegetable patches.Roots builds privatised allotments to give city dwelling customers a place to grow food. It was co-founded in 2021 by Christian Samuel, Ed Morrison and William Gay, who were frustrated by a 28-year waiting list for a plot in their area of Streatham, south London. “We thought: ‘This is crazy’,” says Samuel, 32. “‘Why don’t we just build our own?’”The idea was a runaway success.Rootsnow has 20 sites from London to Leeds, and nearly 5,000 customers. Last October the founders announced a £6m fundraise. Backers included Terry Leahy, the former Tesco chief executive and Mark Selby, co-founder of Wahaca restaurants. There are early plans for a site in Austin, Texas – Roots’ first abroad.View image in fullscreenRoots co-founder Christian Samuel at the Meadow Hill Fields site in Croydon.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianThe startup leases farmland and turns it into plots that it rents out on subscription. Prices range from £9.99 to £49.99 a month for a patch of up to 108 sq metres. One adviser describes it as “WeWork for allotments”, a fresh air and wellies version of thecoworking office space trend.The appeal is obvious. More than 170,000 people are thought to be sitting oncouncil allotment waiting listsacross the country. “For many people it is not about growing the food, it’s the mental health and the wellbeing side of being outside,” says Samuel. “They see it as a place to escape. And there’s clearly a supply and demand gap here.”Not everybody sees it that way. What started as alocal protest in Bristolhas turned into a nationwide opposition campaign. A Facebook group, Roots Allotments uncovered, has attracted more than 1,700 members. Opponents accuse the company of an aggressive expansion strategy, developing land first and applying for planning permission later – and only when councils force them to.View image in fullscreenWhat started as a local protest in Bristol has turned into a nationwide opposition campaign.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianSimon Talbot-Ponsonby, 73, lives next to the Bristol site – a rented farmers’ field bordering Leigh Woods nature reserve– and was at the October 2023 standoff. He is chair of the nearby Abbots Leigh parish council, has been a regular presence at protests and accuses the founders of “trashing” the countryside.Truckloads of compost were dumped across formerly grazed meadows, he says, with much of the remaining grass churned up and a shipping container dropped in the middle as a tool shed. An 80-space compacted stone car park was built to serve the 700 plots. “They have a total disregard for the feelings of local people,” he says.Resistance has also sprung up elsewhere. In Ecclesfield, near Sheffield, the council denied planning permission in December, seven months after diggers rolled in and began removing hedgerows (the company has appealed against the decision). In West Sussex, there was outcry when Roots started work on protected land within the South Downs national park.Nor are some opponents averse to some old-fashioned sabotage. In Bristol, protesters poured cement into the locks so the gates couldn’t be opened. One night in early 2024, someone deflated the tyres on the Roots diggers – then filled the valves with superglue for good measure.View image in fullscreenLeigh Woods Meadows. Left, before (2023), right, after (2025).Photograph: Google EarthThe old cars from the October blockade kept reappearing, too. Roots installed lockable bollards in the road to keep them out, but when staff returned a week later, the vehicles had mysteriously appeared on the other side. On another occasion someone sowed grass seed on a fresh delivery of compost. “It’s amazing how quickly it turns green,” says Talbot-Ponsonby.“Residents were so frustrated by the fact that they were going ahead without permission,” Talbot-Ponsonby says, clarifying that he did not take part in the acts of “minor vandalism”. He adds: “We’re all law-abiding citizens, but when people are frustrated they do things.”‘I joined every list’: the gruelling search for a Glasgow allotmentRead moreThe founders see themselves as victims of a zealous nimby campaign. Samuel calls them “haters” and recounts an incident when somebody recognised him at Bath Spa railway station and slapped him on the back of the head. He points tofootageof people obstructing Roots’ Bristol site during a volunteer tree-planting day. “Even when we were planting trees we had to call the police,” he says “They’re relentless.”He insists that allotments are agriculture and do not need planning permission on greenbelt land, citing permitted development rules. Opponents say the scale – with shipping containers, irrigation systems and hundreds of plots – makes them commercial developments that need approval.Charlotte Bovill, a Roots customer in south Croydon, says there are “bigger problems in the world” than allotments being built on the green belt. The 34-year-old probation officer, who works with people convicted of violent crimes daily, says her patch is a source of “bliss and escapism”.View image in fullscreenThe Roots Meadow Hill Fields site in Croydon.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianCouncil waiting lists are an “absolute nightmare”, Bovill continues, and many people living in cities do not have gardens to store tools or space for composting, both of which Roots provides. “The satisfaction of being able to nurture and grow something is a lot more rewarding than most things in everyday life.”Nonetheless, trouble seems to follow the startup around. Its name on Companies House, Allotta Futureland, has raised suspicions among opponents that it could be a front to eventually develop houses, which Samuel strongly denies. His case was not helped when a shipping container at a Roots site in Bath was converted into a holiday let in 2024, complete with outdoor decking and a hot tub. It was later removed.The environmental campaigner Chris Packham has even gone after them. “Increasing access to green spaces is a must – and allotments are a great way to do that,”he wroteof the Bristol site in 2024. “But when you’re a venture capital-backed firm developing on species rich grassland, with breeding skylarks … you’re in the wrong Roots Allotments.”Packham’s criticism hints at the fundamental tension around Roots’ model.Allotmentshave long been viewed as a public good, run by councils, rather than as a commercial opportunity for fast-growing startups.View image in fullscreenChris Packham: ‘You’re in the wrong Roots Allotments.’Photograph: Jordan Pettitt/PAWhen Roots tried to lease council-owned land in Brighton three years ago, Mark Carroll, chair the city’s allotment federation,told a local newspaper: “Sadly, this follows a pattern of public services with huge waiting lists becoming run down and the private sector stepping in to offer an alternative to those who can afford it.”Roots’ prices reinforce those claims. A full size plot of 108 sq metres will set you back just under £550 a year, where many councils charge less than £100 for a similar sized patch.While not yet profitable, Allota Futureland had assets of £1.7m in 2024, when it last filed accounts, more than treble the previous year. JamJar Investments, the venture capital firm founded by the creators of Innocent smoothies, holds a 13% stake, alongside Redbus Ventures, a tech investment firm, and Leahy and Selby’s smaller holdings.Samuel admits he can “see the argument on both sides” but that ideas cost money. “It’s not cheap to do this and I don’t think the fact that we’ve had investment should really matter. We are doing something good with the money.”Crucially, however, Roots sites are available, while land set aside for council allotmentshas fallenby about 65% since the 1950s across England. Since Labour took office in 2024, the government hasapproved the saleof eight more allotment sites to help fund new housing. “We are adding to supply,” says Samuel.View image in fullscreenCrucially, Roots sites are available, while land set aside for council allotments has fallen by about 65% since the 1950s across England.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianAnd the company shows no sign of slowing down. Another fundraise is planned in the coming months, which will help pay for more dramatic expansion.As many as 20 more sites are due to open this year, and by 2033, Roots hopes to have 1,000 sites worldwide and 250,000 customers.Meanwhile, back in Bristol, Roots was finally granted planning permission in summer 2025, but now faces another problem: the water has been shut off. Bristol Water cut the supply last autumn after finding Roots had simply tapped into the farmer’s cattle trough pipe. The company is now applying for a commercial connection.“It’s just another example of them not following the rules,” says Talbot-Ponsonby. “That’s the way they work.”Despite the sabotage, planning battles and now the water shutoff, Samuel remains unbowed. “We hear every day that thousands of people want these things, and we’re not planning on stopping,” he says. “All this over growing a bunch of aubergines.”Explore more on these topicsAllotmentsPrivatisationLocal governmentGardensfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s not in the way exactly, but it’s still a strangely oppressive use of space. Anyway, in a few days it will be gone.The oldest one is leaving home for the third time – or the fourth, if you count going to university, which I do, because I cried that time, my vision blurring as I tried to punch my registration number into a car park ticket machine.The other times were less fraught. In 2018 he left in a taxi on a snowy night; in 2019 he returned and stayed through the pandemic.The last time he moved out I drove him and his stuff across London in a hired van; two years later I picked him up in the car, his possessions having dwindled to a point where only one trip was necessary. I allowed myself to get used to the idea that he would always, eventually, return.double quotation markI cried when I took him to uni, my vision blurring as I tried to punch my registration into a ticket machineThis time seems more permanent – he’s moving in with his girlfriend, and they have purchased, among other things, a dining room table. Boxes keep getting delivered but never opened, because they’re not staying. Some of them contain new pots and pans, others plates and bowls. One of them, I think, is an air fryer.Suddenly, in conjunction with the oldest one’s imminent departure, a lot of stalled stuff is getting under way. The restoration of the partially caved-in ceiling in his bedroom – the result of a roof leak that got fixed back in September – has been on hold until he vacated the premises.“I texted Mark,” my wife says, referring to the builder she sometimes calls Mark No Problem, the better to contrast his straightforward, can-do approach to home improvement with mine. “Just to see if he could make a start on the ceiling.”“What did he say?” I say.“He said, ‘No problem.’”“I myself foresee many problems,” I say.“Of course you do,” my wife says.What I mean is: we’ve built up a considerable backlog of problems for Mark to solve. There is, for example, the collapsing garden structure out back, whose overdue repair has been complicated in large part because I refuse to speak its name.“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” my wife says.“Yes you do,” I say. “The outdoor skeleton room. The climbing frame for plants.”“Oh my God,” she says. “Just say pergola.”“I’d rather die,” I say. “But whatever you call it, it’s about to fall over.”“The pergola,” she says.“The wood around the bolts has rotted through,” I say. “It’s not safe.”“Mark’s coming by on Friday, so you can tell him about it yourself,” she says.“How am I gonna do that?” I say.double quotation markWe watch in silence for a while, occasionally checking our phones, as is our habit. ‘What are we gonna do about Deadwood?’ he says.That evening, after my wife has gone to bed, the oldest one and I sit down to watch television, as is our habit.“When do you get the keys?” I say.“I can pick them up tomorrow after five,” he says. “Then a van is coming here the next day.” I realise that for the first time I have played no part in him moving.Tim Dowling: I’ve already used up all my optimism for the year. What now?Read moreWe watch in silence for a while, occasionally checking our phones, as is our habit.“What are we gonna do about Deadwood?” he says.We have been steadily working our way through the classic western epic for the last few weeks, but we’re still on series one, and there are two others to follow.“I don’t know,” I say. “We could try watching the whole thing in the next two days.”“There’s, like, 30 more hours of it,” he says.“We could at least finish series one,” I say.“I’m not in tomorrow night,” he says.“Or we could watch it separately, while video calling,” I say.“Are you gonna be able to manage that?” he says.“I suppose our screenings might get out of sync,” I say.“Yeah,” he says.I don’t say what I’m thinking, which is: we could just watch it alone, in our own time, and then have a chat about it at Christmas.And I don’t say what occurs to me next, which is: without him here, under this roof, I will never watch another episode of Deadwood again.Explore more on these topicsFamilyThe Tim Dowling columnfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They were forced back to Roj, in Syria’s far north-east, near to the Turkish and Iraqi borders.Sources on the ground in Syria say the camp is increasingly unstable and violent. It is expected to be transferred from Kurdish control into the hands of the Syrian government soon.There are fears, too, for renewed violence amid the uncertainty of afragile ceasefirebetween the Syrian government and the Kurdish forces, still in control of Roj camp for now, but who have ceded most of their territory.‘We just want her home’“It’s getting more dangerous, more uncertain,” a Syrian source said.“Other countries are undertaking these repatriations.

When it was pointed out most of the group were children, and that some had been born in the camps, he said: “I think it’s unfortunate that children are caught up in this, that’s not their decision, but it’s the decision of their parents or their mother.”The chief executive of Save the Children Australia, which has advocated on behalf of the group over years, said all political parties should dial down the political rhetoric and put the wellbeing of vulnerable Australian children first.“This is a group of innocent Australian children who deserve safety and protection, as every child does. That has largely been lost from the debate in recent days,” Mat Tinkler said.“Every parent knows that babies and toddlers don’t make beds. The reality is that some of these children were born in the displacement camps, and many were toddlers when they were first taken there.“These children would be sleeping in warm, comfortable beds at home in Australia by now if the government had repatriated them when it should have. They have lost years of their childhoods languishing in tents, in conditions that would shock most Australians.”Tinkler said the government had always had the power to repatriate its citizens, as the Morrison and Albanese governments had done in 2019 and 2022, but that now, “politics is getting in the way of real solutions for these children”.“Children are not responsible for the actions of their parents, and their rights must not be swept aside because it is politically convenient to do so.“Leaving them in limbo will not make the Australian community any safer. In fact, national security experts say it may present a greater long-term risk.”‘The conditions in the camps are dire’Human Rights Watch said that Roj camp, while it remains in the hands of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, is expected to be handed over to the Syrian government soon.“Conditions there seem to have deteriorated in the last weeks, with women we are in touch with reporting near nightly raids and beatings of a scale and severity not previously felt.”The Australia director of Human Rights Watch, Daniela Gavshon, said the organisation had repeatedly pressed the Australian and other governments to repatriate their citizens who had been unlawfully and indefinitely detained in north-east Syria for almost seven years.“The conditions in the camps are dire. The situation is untenable and the government needs to find a solution. These Australians should be brought back to Australia for rehabilitation, reintegration, and prosecution of adults where warranted.”Gavshon said Australia was well equipped to reintegrate the women and children from the camps, with services to support those who had experienced displacement, violence, family separation and interrupted schooling.“For years now, experts have been saying, the greatest danger for Australia is not accepting the return of children from the camps in north-east Syria. It’s leaving them there.”The Australian government has said it will seek to impose atemporary exclusion orderon one of the women understood to be seeking to return to Australia.The Australian government undertook two successful repatriation missions – of eight orphaned children in 2019, and of four women and 13 children in 2022 – but said consistently it had no plan to repatriate the final group. One returned woman was charged with entering a proscribed area, Raqqah province. Mariam Raad pleaded guilty and was discharged conditionally in a NSW court.Last October, two women and four childrenescaped nearby al-Hawl detention camp, making their way across Syria to Lebanon, where they were given passports at the Australian embassy. They returned to Australia on a commercial flight.In 2024, Clare O’Neil, then home affairs minister, was preparing to bring a plan to repatriate the remaining Australians to cabinet for approval. But there were concerns within government overbacklash to any repatriationfrom community groups in electorally critical marginal seats in western Sydney, and the plan was abandoned.The US funds the bulk of security operations across north-east Syria through the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. It wants the camp closed and has withdrawn funding and pushed allies to repatriate their citizens.Islamic State “continues to seek to indoctrinate residents and toinfiltrate the detention facilities” at Roj, the US says.The commander of US Central Command, Adm Brad Cooper,told a UN conferencein September “as time goes on, these camps are incubators for radicalisation”.Explore more on these topicsAustralian immigration and asylumSyrianewsShareReuse this content"

Combined with strong winds and weak snowpack below, the conditions were especially susceptible to avalanches, it said.Tirol police said five off-piste skiers were caught up in a nearly 450-metre-wide avalanche on Friday afternoon in the St Anton am Arlberg area at an altitude of about 2,000 metres.An American and a Pole were among the five dead whose bodies were recovered after the avalanche, and a 21-year-old Austrian died of injuries after being taken to hospital, police said.Dozens of mountain-rescue team members, ambulance and fire department staffers, as well as several dog squads, were deployed for the operation.Late on Friday morning in the Nauders-Bergkastel resort to the south-east, a 42-year-old German man and his 16-year-old son were caught in an avalanche. The teen survived with injuries and called for help, but his father was killed.In Klösterle in the neighbouring Vorarlberg region, a 39-year-old Swiss snowboarder was caught and killed by an avalanche in an off-piste area, regional police said.“The recent snowfall is currently drawing many people to the mountains – even off-piste,” Tirol’s governor, Anton Mattle, said in a statement. “It is painful that we have already had to record several avalanches with injuries and fatalities.”His office said nearly three dozen avalanche incidents were reported on Friday, among more than 200 over the past week. So far, 11 people have died in avalanches this month, the governor’s office said.“No relief is in sight for Sunday either,” the region office said. “The weather remains turbulent.”Explore more on these topicsAustriaAvalanchesEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But as the pair drove back to Alhaurín el Grande that night, heavy rains turned the usually tranquil Fahala River into what the mayor would later call an “uncontrollable torrent”. Police found their van overturned the next day. Their bodies followed after an agonising search.“We are used to some floods. Not many,” said Conchi Navarro, the headteacher of Los Montecillos secondary school, whom Zea Bravo was supposed to succeed upon her retirement at the end of the school year. “But since December, theseborrasca[low-pressure storms] have come one after the other.”The quiet fallout of a broken climate – a book club short of one member, a rock band without a bassist, a cafe that lacks a pastry chef – has been echoing around western Europe for weeks. The back-to-back storms that batteredSpainhave killed at least 16 people in neighbouringPortugal. Soils acrossFrancehave reached unprecedented levels of saturation, with weather forecasters issuing flood alerts that demand “absolute vigilance”. Parts of theUKhave broken records for the number of days without a break in the rain.Portugal flood drone loopThis is Europe’s new reality:under waterin winter,witheredin summer. Yet even as the weather extremes worsen, the voices of denial have grown louder and more influential.“We’re moving toward self-destruction of the planet,” said Navarro, adding that at the age of 60 she had witnessed the effects of climate change first-hand. “It’s not something ‘they’ told me, it’s something I’ve seen. How can anybody say this is an invention?”View image in fullscreenDonald Trump at the White House in Washington earlier this month as rules that regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles were repealed in the US.Photograph: Will Oliver/UPI/ShutterstockThe answer, particularly in the US, is with breathtaking ease. The president, Donald Trump, has ramped up his attacks on climate policy in recent weeks –quittingthe Paris agreement again andrepealinga finding that underpins pollution controls – while going global with his “drill, baby, drill” policy. Chris Wright, the US energy secretary and former fracking executive, has pressured Europe to roll back methane standards and sustainability rules that could threaten American exports of liquefied natural gas. On Wednesday, he urged spreadsheet-wranglers at the International Energy Agency to “drop the climate” from its models.Even inEurope, where polls show citizens overwhelmingly accept climate science and support stopping planet-heating pollution, a quiet but deadly form of denial has emerged.Far-right parties have gained ground across the continent, even as they make fighting climate policy –aided by the Heartland Institute, a US thinktank funded by fossil fuels – their second priority after immigration. Centrist leaders, alarmed by their success and anxious to placate polluting industries, are rolling back green rules with a vigour that has surprised even some lobbyists. This month, ahead of a meeting in Antwerp between the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and business leaders, the EU’s carbon price – the cornerstone of its pollution-cutting efforts – found itself in the crosshairs of the powerful chemical industry.All the while, evacuation alerts are lighting up phones and rivers are bursting their banks as new storms form before the waters from the last have receded. Alice, Benjamin and Claudia were the storms named by meteorologists that started the season in southern Europe in October and November. David, Emilia and Francis led to a wet December. In January, five storms struck in quick succession – Goretti, Harry, Ingrid, Joseph and Kristin – while in February there were just as many – Leonardo, Martha, Nils, Oriana and Pedro – in the first two weeks. The season is one storm shy of the record 17 that hit in the 2023-24 season, with forecasters having reached the second half of the alphabet in far less time.View image in fullscreenCars partly submerged in flood waters on 15 November in Monmouth, Wales.Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesThe storms lashing the Iberian peninsula and the relentless rains in the UK are the result of a southward shift in the jet stream, a conveyor belt of fast-moving air, which has coincided with high pressure over northern Europe and blocked weather systems in place. Global heating amplifies the damage as warm air can hold more moisture. As water pounds sodden soils that have not had time to dry out, the risk of floods increases exponentially.Scientists complain that European governments are in denial about the scale of the threat. Christophe Cassou, a climate scientist and research director at the French National Centre for Scientific Research, said the flooding in France was unprecedented in terms of area and the result of record cumulative rainfall since the start of the year.“What is surprising is that the authorities are surprised by such an outcome,” he said. “We are not experiencing the worst possible scenario, but simply a probable one, entirely within the range of what can be expected from climate simulations.”View image in fullscreenResidents clean the street next to cars piled up after being swept away by floods in Valencia, Spain in October 2024.Photograph: Alberto Saiz/APIn Spain, the consequences of such negligence are fresh in people’s minds. On 29 October 2024, Empar Puchades listened to a lunchtime press conference in which the president of Valencia said the storm sitting over the region would soon move on. Puchades still felt troubled. The 70-year-old former healthcare worker looked up the rainfall on official meteorological platforms. Worried about the volume of water and conscious that she lived on flat farmland in a highly urbanised region, she spoke to a friend in a higher-up village who told her an “unimaginable flood” was coming.Spain flood evacuation - loopPuchades dutifully warned her neighbours and asked her middle son not to work the night shift, but he told her he had to relieve a colleague, and set out early instead. “If my son had left at his usual time, he would have been caught in the full force of the water,” she said.The floods that evening killed 229 people in Valencia. The disaster sparked public fury at authorities, who delayed sending alerts, and hammered home the harm that fossil fuel pollution is causing rich countries. Global heating increased rain intensity by 21%, astudyin Nature Communications found on Tuesday, and expanded the area under 180mm of rain by 55%.The night the floods struck, Puchades grabbed the dog, went upstairs, and opened the shutters to see a tongue of water – “not very high, with a lot of debris, making a very strange noise and with an unrecognisable smell” – approaching her home. It came slowly at first, and then quickly. “I will always say that what struck me was how fast it was.”Spain’s lack of preparedness echoes Germany’s three years earlier, when rains made worse by climate breakdown killed 134 people in the Ahr valley after botched warnings. The disasters are among many examples that have led the EU’s scientific advisers todecryEurope’s efforts to adapt to a hotter planet as “insufficient, largely incremental [and] often coming too late”. In a report on Tuesday, they told officials to prepare for a world 2.8-3.3C hotter than preindustrial levels by 2100 – double the level of global heating that world leaders promised to aim for when they signed the Paris agreement in 2015 – and to stress-test hotter scenarios.Maarten van Aalst, a member of the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change and head of the Dutch meteorological agency, said climate risks would rise rapidly in such a scenario but that Europe still had a choice about how to navigate those risks.View image in fullscreenA train passes a railroad crossing between flooded fields in Nidderau-Eichen, near Frankfurt, Germany, on Wednesday.Photograph: Michael Probst/AP“Even with the much milder but quite significant warming that we’ve seen so far, we’re already seeing extreme events that surprise us and that kill people when they possibly shouldn’t have if we had anticipated better,” he said. “I hope we will not get to 3C … but there’s a significant chance that the world at large will not meet its targets.”Temperatures are creeping closer to the 1.5C threshold. The world has warmed by about 1.4C since preindustrial levels and few experts see the goal as still being within reach. As losses mount, climate scientists warn that “every fraction of a degree” of warming still matters.Navarro, who used to turn to Zea Bravo for reassurance when the busy school became too demanding, said she would remember his chatty character and calming presence. The school held a memorial for him in early January once term restarted, which she said left students silent and motionless. After the “terrible” first two weeks since the floods, they had begun to recover, she added.“Now we will wait for the fires in summer.”"

The focus is instead on the purity of the enrichment and the number of centrifuges to be permitted.There had been discussion of the stockpile being sent to Russia, and for Iran’s domestic enrichment programme to be linked in with an overseas consortium, but Iranian sources are insisting the concept of a consortium has not been raised.Iranian media close to the government quoted an Iranian diplomat as saying: “We emphasised this position during the negotiations that nuclear materials will not leave the country.”The Iranian account of its relatively uncompromising position means a great deal of weight will have to be placed on the degree of access the IAEA would be given to inspect nuclear sites.The Iranian offer is likely to determine whether Trump feels compelled to launch military action against Iran.In an interview in the US, aired on Friday, Araghchi said: “Washington has not asked Tehran to permanently suspend uranium enrichment,” adding that Tehran had not offered Washington a temporary suspension of its uranium enrichment.He rejected reports that Iran had proposed suspending uranium enrichment for two to three years, saying: “It is not true that the United States has called for a complete cessation of enrichment.”His remarks were contradicted by the US ambassador to the UN, Mike Waltz, who, prompted by his interviewer, said the US was seeking “zero enrichment” by Iran.Reza Nasri, an Iranian lawyer with contacts inside the foreign ministry, warned: “If Iran is attacked while nuclear disagreements can still be settled diplomatically in a fair and equitable manner, other regional states will inevitably draw one conclusion: nuclear weapons are the only real deterrent against the US and Israel.”The news came as protests erupted at some universities, prompting fresh clashes in the street, at Mashhad University of Medical Sciences and at least two Tehran universities.The universities were reopening after being closed due to fear of protests. At Sharif University, the students chanted “Javed Shah”, “Until the mullah is shrouded, this homeland will not become a homeland” and “Death to the dictator.” The Sharif University president urged the students to stop, warning that the authorities would force classes back online.View image in fullscreenDemonstrators marched from Whitehall to the Iranian embassy in London calling for regime change in Iran.Photograph: Jeff Moore/PAIn London, about 1,500 protesters marched on Saturday to call on the UK government to close the Iranian embassy.Some people held pictures of Iran’s exiled crown prince, Reza Pahlavi, who one demonstrator said was “standing with the people of Iran”.One participant, an Iranian national who did not want to be named, said Pahlavi was the “only alternative” leader.He added: “We are not a dictatorship, we don’t want a dictatorship, we just want a democracy.”Protests are also expected at a meeting of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva on Tuesday when an Iranian official, Afsaneh Nadipour, takes her seat for the first time as a full member of the advisory council. Nadipour, a former Iranian ambassador to Denmark, is due to provide input on women’s rights.The UN Human Rights Council Advisory Committee is comprised of 18 independent experts from five UN regional groups and serves as the intellectual arm of the Human Rights Council.

On one side is a Christian nationalist stream of the Maga movement, which views the United States’s close relationship with Israel with increasing suspicion. On the other is an older Christian conservative establishment that views that alliance as a totem of US foreign policy – and in some cases believes that Israeli Jews possess adivine rightto a large swathe of the Middle East, US public opinion be damned.Call it the Brawl at Ben Gurion. During their more than two-hourdialogue, Carlson, the rightwing commentator, repeatedly insinuated that Huckabee was more invested in defending the interests of Israel than those of the country he represents as a US official. For his part, Huckabee – a prominent Christian Zionist who believes that Israel has abiblical rightto the territory thatits government and settlers claim – sharply disputed Carlson’s suggestions that Israel does not deserve the military and monetary aid it receives from the US.The testy interview highlights just how unresponsive the Trump administration is to rising American discontent with Israel, as measured bypollingof Americansacrossa variety of demographics – including a modest drop in pro-Israel sentiment among Republicans.In one extraordinary moment during the interview, Carlson asked Huckabee if Israel was entitled, according to a literal interpretation of biblical scripture, to claim much of the modern Middle East. Huckabeeresponded: “It would be fine if they took it all.” (He backtracked a moment later, arguing that Carlson’s question was irrelevant because Israel had no such intentions.)The interview occurs against the backdrop of the Israel-Gaza war, which continues to claim Palestinian lives despite a fragile truce, and as Israel has recently moved to tighten control over Palestinian areas of the West Bank, in what an Israeli minister hasdescribedas a measure to “kill the idea of a Palestinian state”.The interview also comes as Trump threatens US strikes on Iran – a prospect that Carlson ardently opposes, but which Huckabee hashintedhe believes may be necessary.Carlson noted that onlyaround20% of Americans, according to polling, support a war with Iran.“We don’t live in a world where you have a poll taken to find out if our policy should be a particular direction,” Huckabee said, arguing that there are threats to the US whose magnitude the American people might not understand. (He did not articulate any direct threat Iran poses to the US.)Carlson also hammered Huckabee about his decision tomeet, late last year, with Jonathan Pollard, who was convicted of spying on the US for Israel; about why an Israeli official was able to return to Israel after policearrestedhim in Nevada last August for allegedly soliciting a minor for sex; about why the US might send money to a country that provides state-funded abortions to its citizens; and aboutlinksbetween Jeffrey Epstein and Ehud Barak, a former prime minister of Israel. (The official accused of a sex crime in Nevada pleaded not guilty. Barak has not been implicated in wrongdoing, and has said heregretsever knowing Epstein.)Israel “looks a lot nicer than our country. It has nicer roads than the United States,” Carlson said. “It’s like, OK, why are we sending all this money to a country that has a higher standard of living than ours?”Carlson and Huckabee remained mostly civil, but argued fiercely – often interrupting each other to question the premises of each other’s assertions. In fact, controversy and mutual antagonism doggedthe interview sincebefore it even aired: earlier this week, Carlsonallegedthat shortly after he interviewed Huckabee he and his staff were subjected to a “bizarre” temporary detainment at Ben Gurion airport by security agents. In response, Huckabee on social mediaridiculedCarlson’s characterization, describing his treatment as a normal security process at the famously strict border. Carlson never left the vicinity of the airport.A one-time supporter of the Iraq war, Carlson has over time come to embody the populist-nationalist wing of the Maga movement. Since leaving Fox News in 2023, he has criticized Israel and its American supporters with a particular vehemence. Some critics haveaccusedhim ofmainstreamingconspiracy theories and antisemitic tropes.Although Republican voters as a wholeremainpro-Israel, younger conservatives are increasinglyskepticalof the US’s support for the country and sympathetic to Carlson’s point of view.“I think that we are reaching the end of a period, [which] reached its peak under George W Bush, when it could be taken for granted that national spokesmen for the Republican Party, or conservatism, would be favorable to Israel,” said Samuel Goldman, an associate professor of humanities at the University of Florida and the author of God’s Country: Christian Zionism in America.There is a “clear generational element” to the Carlson-Huckabee debate, Goldman noted. Huckabee, 70, is part of a generation of American Christians who tended to view Israel as a pillar of a shared Judeo-Christian civilization. In addition, many evangelical Protestants believed that there was a biblical imperative that American Christians support the Jewish state. In contrast, Carlson, 56, has tracked with the rise of a stream of the Maga movement that is isolationist and Christian nationalist.“I think he both reflects and appeals to doubts among younger Christians and conservatives about whether the enthusiasm for Israel that was displayed by their parents – and, at this point, sometimes grandparents – makes political or theological sense,” Goldman said.In recent decades, the Israeli right cultivated close ties with the Republican party and conservative Christian groups in the US. Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahubelievedthat Christian Zionists would prove a more useful longterm ally to Israel than liberal-leaning Jewish Americans, and that allying with the right was worth the risk of alienating other segments of American support.But “I don’t think that a lot of Jewish groups, especially Jewish allies of the right, have understood that Protestant Christianity is … highly fluid,” said Eliyahu Stern, a professor of religious studies at Yale and the author of a forthcoming book entitled Nowhere Left to Go: Jews and the Global Right 1977-10/7. Protestantism is a protean movement, he said, that is constantly changing with larger political and social forces.As long as Trump is in power, however, Maga critics of Israel will probably remain on the margins of deciding actual US policy in Israel and the Middle East. Yet once Trump leaves office, the right’s internal divide about Israel might pose serious problems to the coherence of the conservative movement.What happens then is anyone’s guess. “We’re at the beginning of something, not at the end,” Stern said. “We do not know where, at this point, this goes.”Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyMike HuckabeeIsraelTucker CarlsonMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

But it is not clear if the military movements are intended as an intimidation tactic to put pressure on Iran to make concessions on its nuclear programme.Two US officials told Reuters thatUS militaryplanning had reached an advanced stage, with options including targeting individuals as part of an attack and even pursuing leadership change in Tehran.On Thursday, Trump gave Tehran adeadline of 10 to 15 daysto make a deal to resolve their longstanding nuclear dispute or face “really bad things”.Asked on Friday if he was considering a limited strike to pressureIraninto a deal, Trump told reporters at the White House: “I guess I can say I am considering” it. Asked later about Iran, Trump added: “They better negotiate a fair deal.”Tehran began stepping up its nuclear programme​ after Trump – during his first term as president​ –exited an internationally backed deal that had restricted Iran’s programme. He disliked the pact, signed by one of his predecessors, Barack Obama, and was encouraged to abandon diplomacy by Iran’s arch-enemy, Israel.Emboldened by Trump’s support for aggressive action, Israel then led a12-day war against Iran in June 2025, which the US joined – although the campaign had a questionable impact on Tehran’s long-term nuclear ambitions.Forget the Board of Peace, Trump may be closer than thought to attacking IranRead moreSpeaking toUS cable news network MS Now, Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said there was no “military solution” for Iran’s nuclear programme. “That has been tested last year. There were huge attacks on our facilities – they killed and assassinated our scientists – but they couldn’t kill our nuclear programme,” he said.Araghchi heldindirect discussions in Geneva this week with Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner, and said that the sides had reached anunderstanding on main “guiding principles”, but that did not mean a deal was imminent.Araghchi added he had a draft counterproposal that could be ready “in the next two or three days” for top Iranian officials to review, with more US-Iran talks possible in a week or so.Trump began threatening strikes again in January as Tehran crushed widespread protests with deadly force.Referring to the crackdown on Friday, Trump said that “32,000 people were killed over a relatively short period of time”, figures that could not be verified.“It’s a very, very, very sad situation,” Trump said, adding that his threats to strike Iran had led the leadership to abandon plans for mass hangings two weeks ago.“They were going to hang 837 people. And I gave them the word, if you hang one person, even one person, that you’re going to be hit right then and there,” he said.The US-based group Hrana, which monitors the human rights situation in Iran, says it has verified 7,114 deaths and has another 11,700 under review.Hours after Trump’s statements on the death toll, Araghchi said the Iranian government had already published a “comprehensive list of all 3,117” killed in the unrest, which he referred to as a “recent terrorist operation”.“If anyone disputes accuracy of our data, please share any evidence,” heposted on X.The splinternet: how online shutdowns are getting cheaper and easier to imposeRead moreUN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric reiterated concerns about heightened rhetoric and increased military activities in the region.During the Geneva talks, the US did not seek zero uranium enrichment and Iran did not offer to suspend enrichment, Araghchi told MS Now.“What we are now talking about is how to make sure that Iran’s nuclear programme, including enrichment, is peaceful and would remain peaceful forever,” he said.Asked about Araghchi’s comments, a White House official said: “The president has been clear that Iran cannot have nuclear weapons or the capacity to build them, and that they cannot enrich uranium.”Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsIranTrump administrationNuclear weaponsUS militaryMiddle East and north AfricaDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Some news reports have noted this provision appears to authorize the President to impose across-the-board tariffs on imports in some circumstances.The law does, however, place limits on such tariffs which may be imposed by the president for “a period not exceeding 150 days,” and are “not to exceed 15 percent”.ShareUpdated at19.12 EST"

There was no immediate comment from Kabul, and reports on social media suggested the strikes were carried out inside Afghanistan.Pakistan’s information minister, Attaullah Tarar, wrote on X that the military conducted “intelligence-based, selective operations” against seven camps belonging to the Pakistani Taliban, known as Tehreek-e-TalibanPakistan(TTP), and its affiliates. He said an affiliate of Islamic State was also targeted in the border region.In October, Pakistan also conducted strikes deep inside Afghanistan to target militant hideouts.Tarar said Pakistan “has always strived to maintain peace and stability in the region”, but added that the safety and security of Pakistani citizens remained a top priority.The latest development came days after a suicide bomber, backed by gunmen, rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into the wall of a security post in Bajaur district in north-western Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan. The blast caused part of the compound to collapse, killing 11 soldiers and a child, and authorities later said the attacker was an Afghan national.Hours before the latest border strikes, another suicide bomber targeted a security convoy in the nearby Bannu district in the north-west, killing two soldiers, including a lieutenant colonel.After Saturday’s violence, Pakistan’s military warned it would not “exercise any restraint” and operations against those responsible would continue “irrespective of their location”, language that suggested rising tensions between Islamabad and Kabul.Tarar said Pakistan had “conclusive evidence” that the recent attacks, includinga suicide bombing that targeted a Shiite mosque in Islamabadand killed 31 worshippers earlier this month, were carried out by militants acting at the “behest of their Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers”.He said Pakistan had repeatedly urged Afghanistan’sTalibanrulers to take verifiable steps to prevent militant groups from using Afghan territory to launch attacks in Pakistan, but alleged that no substantive action had been taken.He said Pakistan urged the international community to press Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities to uphold their commitments under the Doha agreement not to allow their soil to be used against other countries.Pakistan has seen a rise in militant violence in recent years, much of it blamed on the TTP andoutlawed Baloch separatist groups. The TTP is separate from but closely allied with Afghanistan’s Taliban, who returned to power in 2021. Islamabad accuses the TTP of operating from inside Afghanistan, a charge the group and Kabul deny.Relations between the neighbouring countries have remained tense since October, when deadly border clashes killed dozens of soldiers, civilians and suspected militants. The violence followed explosions in Kabul that Afghan officials blamed on Pakistan.A Qatar-mediated ceasefire has largely held, but talks in Istanbul failed to produce a formal agreement, and relations remain strained.Explore more on these topicsPakistanAfghanistanSouth and central AsiaTalibannewsShareReuse this content"

This compares with 70% of children who do not qualify for free school meals, the party added.Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, said: “These reforms are a golden opportunity to cut the link between background and success – one that we must seize.“Our schools have made great strides in recent decades. Yet for too long, many children in our country have been let down by a one-size-fits-all system, denied opportunity because they’re poor or because they have additional needs.“Our schools white paper presents the blueprint for opportunity for the next generation, with an education system that truly serves every child, whatever their needs and wherever in the country they grow up.”At present, disadvantage funding for schools costs about £8bn a year. There is no guarantee the pot would be increased to reflect the proposed changes, with government sources saying this would be determined at the next spending review.Some MPs and campaigners have questioned how effective these proposed reforms will be without more guaranteed funding.Munira Wilson, the Liberal Democrat education spokesperson, said: “Basing funding on income alone risks hard-wiring regional inequalities into the system.“Instead of reshuffling a fixed pot of money – risking new cliff edges that will leave struggling families even worse off – ministers must restore the pupil premium to its 2015 real-terms value.“Starmer must also guarantee that any investment will rise with inflation, so no child is left without the support they need.”Pepe Di’Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “We very much agree with the provision of more targeted funding for schools supporting the most disadvantaged children and have advocated for such a measure for several years.“However, it is vital that this is done through additional investment into the education system, rather than distributing the same pot of money in a different way, with the risk of creating winners and losers.”The white paper will also outline plans for two new programmes – Mission North East and Mission Coastal – to tackle the performances of deprived pupils in certain parts of the country. The Guardian understands the precise locations for these initiatives have yet to be decided.They will be based on the London Challenge, a New Labour project aimed at driving up attainment in secondary schools in the capital that focused on schools working together to share learning and ideas. It was praised by Ofsted for helping to improve educational standards.The government is also planning a radical overhaul of the special educational needs (Send) system as part of its plans. It plans to give every child with Send an individual support plan.However, some Labour MPs are thought to be nervous about some of the plans, particularly whether parents will retain the right to appeal if they are unhappy with the level of support their child is receiving.The white paper was originally due to be published last autumn, but was delayed to allow for further consideration of the Send proposals.Ministers are also expected to announce new attendance targets in an effort to recover 20m lost school days a year.It will propose pay rises for newly appointed headteachers to incentivise them to work in parts of the country where the need is greatest. This could be worth up to £15,000 to individual teachers.Explore more on these topicsSchool fundingSchoolsPublic services policyLabourInequalitynewsShareReuse this content"

Lots of mobile type homes? Lots of ‘Dags’”. He then added: “You are the MSOC pikey liaison.”The misconduct panel during a tribunal concluded that these were “deliberate messages that clearly link the Irish Traveller community to acts of theft”.The word “dags” is believed to be a reference to a scene in the Guy Ritchie film Snatch in which Brad Pitt plays a Gypsy. During the scene, the character played by Stephen Graham struggles to understand Pitt’s accent when he says “dogs”. The panel found that the word was “derogatory” because it refers to an instance when a Gypsy character’s accent is “mocked”.Luker was a member of a WhatsApp group called “Selbie Gumshoes” with other members of the Major Serious and Organised Crime (MSOC) team.During another WhatsApp conversation on 17 March 2025, Luker wrote: “Off to find some scrap metal, lead roofing and cable”, in response to a video sent by another group member of “Paddy Day parade on Inishbofin” alongside the message “Just like a Disney World Parade. They know how to put on a show”.The panel said that Luker’s message was “deliberate and discriminatory” because it linked the Gypsy, Roma and Traveller community to theft.He also used the word “pikey” again in messages that were sent on 27 March 2025.During the tribunal, the panel heard that Luker accepted that “scrap metal, lead roofing and cable” was a joke to associate theft with the Irish Traveller community but said he did not intend for the word “pikey” in the messages to be offensive.Luker was one of the first responders to the terror attack on London Bridge which took place on 3 June 2017. He said that one of his coping mechanisms for dealing with the day was the use of humour, the panel heard.The panel concluded that DC Luker is not “inherently racist”.“As an experienced BTP police officer used to dealing with a whole range of people, the panel found that, on the balance of probabilities, he probably would have known that this was an especially offensive use of language directed towards members of a minority community,” the panel wrote.Explore more on these topicsPoliceRacenewsShareReuse this content"

In September, shecancelled a trip to the UKto receive an award for fear of arrest.In an exclusive interview with the Guardian, Rooney said: “I am of course immensely pleased and heartened that the high court has found the proscription of Palestine Action unlawful. This is a victory not only for the Palestine solidarity movement but also for civil liberties in Britain.“The proscription of a political protest group under the Terrorism Act represents a truly extreme assault on ordinary rights and freedoms, and the high court acknowledged as much.”The “very significant interference” with the rights to freedom of speech and freedom of assembly was one of two grounds on which Ammori’s claim was successful. Rooney said the issue was fundamental to the ban, as the legal question was “not whether Palestine Action is justified in carrying out its activities, but whether it ought to be a criminal offence even to have that debate”.She added: “It’s important to bear in mind that the primary purpose of the Terrorism Act is not to criminalise acts of violence, which are already illegal, but to criminalise otherwise lawful acts of speech, association, financial dealings, and so on.“These measures, which represent a significant infringement on free speech and other rights, were intended for use against armed groups that pose a serious threat to the public. The parliamentary debate on the Terrorism Act at the time of its passing testified clearly to this intention.“The use of such measures against a protest group that poses no threat whatsoever to the public is totally unprecedented and, we now know, unlawful,” she added.While the judges’ found in favour of Ammori, they rejected the idea that Palestine Action was non-violent or that it was engaged in civil disobedience, describing it as an organisation that “promotes its political cause through criminality and encouragement of criminality”.Responding to the judgment, the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, cited those findings while expressing disappointment at the result. “The proscription of Palestine Action followed a rigorous and evidence-based decision-making process, endorsed by parliament,” she said.“As a former lord chancellor, I have the deepest respect for our judiciary. Home secretaries must, however, retain the ability to take action to protect our national security and keep the public safe. I intend to fight this judgment in the court of appeal.”The high courtsaidthe proposition that Palestine Action was non-violent “rests on the premise that damage to property, regardless of extent, does not involve the use of violence. That is a view that many would struggle to comprehend, and we for our part are unable to accept.”Rooney disagreed. “To me, and I think to many other people, the word ‘violence’ implies harm to a living being,” she said. “Inanimate objects cannot suffer. And damaging one’s own property – for instance, breaking up old belongings in order to dispose of them – clearly is not a form of violence. Does the same act become violence if the property belongs to someone else? That’s a philosophical question as much as it is a legal one.“Of course, Palestine Action does intentionally use property damage in service of a campaign against genocide and apartheid. This is absolutely consistent with the tradition of civil disobedience, from the suffragettes to the environmental movement. I must admit that I am baffled by the judges’ claim that civil disobedience must be ‘characterised by restraint’. We have obviously been reading very different history books.“So yes, I disagree with some sections of the judgment – though, unlike the home secretary, I do agree with its conclusions.”In her second witness statement in the case, Rooney said it was “almost certain” that she wouldno longer be able to publish new workin the UK while the ban on Palestine Action remained in effect and that her existing books might have to be withdrawn from sale, describing such a scenario as “a truly extreme incursion by the state into the realm of artistic expression”.While the judges said they proposed quashing the proscription decision, for the time being Palestine Action remains banned as the court said it would await arguments from the Home Office on why it should remain in place pending an appeal.“If an order is found to be unlawful or unconstitutional, then it seems to me that it ought to be quashed there and then,” said Rooney. “But I am now feeling confident that the order will soon be quashed altogether, and that my work will remain in print in the UK as a result. I will look forward to visiting Britain again when that time comes.”Explore more on these topicsPalestine ActionSally RooneyCounter-terrorism policynewsShareReuse this content"

Their next opportunity to demand more cash arrives when Rachel Reeves delivers her spring statement on 3 March.All the signs are that the chancellor will try to marry caution about the public finances – directed at backbench MPs – with an optimistic message about the economic recovery to cheer the public.Whatever she says, there will be many on her own side who will demand that economic orthodoxy be ditched in favour of a bolder outlook delivered with a Liz Truss-like energy. Where the former prime minister extolled the virtues of tax cuts as economic rocket boosters, Labour MPs will instead trumpet public spending as the engine of growth.Last week’s figures showinga record haul of tax receipts in Januarywill have fuelled this desire, revealing, supposedly, that the Treasury is in good shape and able to accommodate their many and varied spending demands.A drop in inflation from3.4% in December to 3% in Januarywas also good news, as was the increased likelihood of a cut in interest rates by the Bank of England for struggling businesses and the mainly younger half of the population up to their ears in mortgage debt.UK manufacturing still beset by low orders and price pressure, says CBIRead moreLower inflation and lower interest rates, possibly cut from 3.75% to as low as 3% by the end of the year, will not only ease the cost of living crisis – which is still a crisis – it will also help the public finances.Record tax receipts in January were joined by lower interest bills on government borrowing. Lower inflation will give public sector bodies more spending power and quell demands from unions for mega pay rises.City economists estimate that there could be £10bn to £11bn more headroom when the chancellor gives her update on the public finances next month. That would push the Treasury’s financial buffer up to more than £30bn.More broadly, surveys of the private sector show businesses are feeling more confident about the coming year, and company directors say that after a long hiatus, they are considering making investments again.A major injection of private sector investment is what has been missing from the UK economy since the 2008 financial crash, so a rebound would be exactly the kind of lift Reeves and the government would cherish.Retail sales improved in January beyond City economists’ expectations. Shoppers bought electronic goods by the bag load, trading in their barely out-of-the-box TVs and mobile phones for new models.Yet the improved economic news cannot disguise the weaknesses at the heart of the UK economy and the excess demands on the public finances, which should put Labour MPs who agitate for more spending on the back foot.Looking again at January’s tax receipts, it’s clear that much of the extra money came from capital gains tax (CGT) payments, and these were generated by individuals offloading assets to avoid tax hikes in the future.That means the jump in CGT revenue was likely to have been based on one-off property and financial asset sales, and so gives little indication of the longer-term prospects for tax receipts.Whatever happens between now and the end of the financial year, UK borrowing is likely to total about £130bn and be just short of 4.5% of annual national income – a figure the financial markets believe indicates the government is financially incontinent.Baked into the forecasts of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) are deep budget cuts for most Whitehall departments to preserve more generous funding for the NHS, schools and defence. It’s only when the stringent spending limits imposed on most civil servants are kept in place that the annual deficit begins to fall.Where are the pressure points on the public finances? One example is the £6bn in funding unaccounted for in 2029 from the additional cost of supporting children with special educational needs.A report last week from the County Councils Network said spending on transport for Send children alone could be as much as £3.5bn in 2030. This is another bill that lies outside the current budget forecasts.The prime minister has his own pet projects. Defence is currently his main focus and the budget for it may need to rise by as much as £10bn to meet a commitment to boost defence spending to 3% of national income by the end of the parliament.Quite how he plans to carve out the funds to reach the 5% of national income in 2034 demanded by Donald Trump is not clear, but assuredly for a future prime minister to consider.It is an illustration of how spare money is largely illusory at the moment. The public finances are in a precarious position and can still be blown off course by a rise in borrowing costs or the rising cost of youth unemployment, which will continue unless more investment can be deployed to boost growth.Labour’s leftist MPs are in the same camp as the Green party leader, Zack Polanski, and the many Tory and Reform UK MPs who wish for things they cannot afford. There is no magic money tree. Liz Truss gave us an object lesson in chutzpah that no one wants to relive.Explore more on these topicsEconomic policyViewpoint columnEconomicsLabourTax and spendingInflationInterest ratesnewsShareReuse this content"

He passed away peacefully this morning surrounded by his beloved family.“While we grieve his absence, we also rejoice in the timeless gift of his music and the cherished memories he created that will live on forever.“Our family is deeply grateful for your prayers and support during this time of mourning. We kindly ask for privacy as we navigate our grief.”Born in the Bronx to Puerto Rican parents, Colón recorded dozens of albums, including La Gran Fuga (The Big Break) in 1970 and El Juicio in 1972.He signed with Fania Records, a label that promoted salsa music, aged 15. Two years later, in 1967, he released his first album, El Malo, which has sold more than 300,000 copies, according to his biography on the LA Philharmonic website.Colón’s music combined elements of jazz, rock and salsa, incorporating the rhythms of traditional music from Cuba,Puerto Rico, Brazil and Africa.Pietro Carlos, his longtime manager, wrote on Facebook: “Willie didn’t just change salsa.“He expanded it, politicized it, clothed it in urban chronicles and took it to stages where it hadn’t been before. His trombone was the voice of the people.”The performer’s list of genre-defining songs includes Ché Ché Colé and Aguanile, recorded with Héctor Lavoe on vocals.His 1978 album Siembra, recorded with Rubén Blades, includes the hit Pedro Navaja and remains the biggest-selling salsa album of all time.Fania Records said in a statement: “Today we bow our heads as the world mourns the loss of one of the greatest artists of our time – the incomparable Willie Colón: legendary trombonist, visionary composer, master arranger, emotive singer, bold producer, fearless director and tireless innovator.“We are heartbroken by the passing of an icon whose sound transcended the dancefloor and defined an era. A pillar of Fania Records, Willie helped bring Latin music from the streets of New York to audiences around the world.“His music declared identity, pride, resistance and joy. His music was not just heard; it was lived.”Bruce McIntosh, VP of Craft Recordings’ Latin catalogue, said: “Willie was much more than an iconic artist; he was a true visionary that forged a new genre of Latin music that we all love today called salsa.“His legacy is etched into the very soul of Latin culture. He will forever be ‘El Maestro’.”In 2004, Colón received a lifetime achievement award from the Latin Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.Billboard magazine named the musician as one of the 30 most influential Latin artists of all time in 2015.He was inducted into the International Latin Music Hall of Fame in 2000 and the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2019.Explore more on these topicsUS newsPuerto RiconewsShareReuse this content"

Flooding was also possible in parts of New York and New Jersey, the weather service said.“While we do get plenty of these nor’easters that produce heavy snow and strong impacts, it’s been several years since we saw one of this magnitude across this large of a region in this very populated part of the country,” said Cody Snell, a meteorologist at the service’s Weather Prediction Center.New York City mayorZohran Mamdanisaid at a news conference Saturday the city could get up to 20in. The blizzard warning takes effect at 6am Sunday and lasts through 6pm Monday.“We are now expecting between 13 to 17 inches of snow, but there is a slight chance we may see up to 20 inches, if not more,” Mamdani said, adding that efforts to get unhoused New Yorkers off the streets and into shelters would begin Saturday afternoon.At least 19 people were found dead outdoors in the city after temperatures plunged on 19 January and remained below freezing for 10 consecutive days. At least 15 of the victims are believed to have died due to hypothermia.The NWS’s Snell said the storm will arrive Sunday morning in areas around Washington DC, before stretching toward Philadelphia and New York City and reaching Boston late Monday evening.The weather service warned that the storm will “make travel dangerous, if not impossible. Scattered downed tree limbs and power outages possible due to snow load and strong winds.”With the arrival of the blizzard coinciding with the start of thew work week, Mamdani said he was asking New Yorkers “to stay inside and stay off the roads for your safety. These have the potential to be even more hazardous conditions than we faced the last time around.”On Saturday, officials in Atlantic City, New Jersey, urged residents and casino visitors to stay off streets during the storm, especially in low-lying neighborhoods prone to flooding.“I could go on and on probably with a good two dozen streets where we know we will get water and there will be snow on top of that,” said Scott Evans, the city’s fire chief and emergency management coordinator. “So you won’t be able to see it until it’s too late, so therefore please stay at home.”Explore more on these topicsNew YorkUS weatherNew JerseynewsShareReuse this content"

After that, the administration has to seek congressional approval. During that 150-day period, his administration will work on issuing new and “legally permissible” tariffs, Trump said.While Trump’s announcement claimed that the new tariffs would take effect “immediately”, it was unclear whether any official documents had been signed confirming the timing. A White Housefact sheetissued on Friday regarding the original 10% tariffs said the levies would go into effect at 12.01am ET on Tuesday, 24 February.German chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Saturday that he would travel to Washington with a coordinated European position after the US supreme court’s blow to Trump’s tariff agenda, and warned of the “poison” of more uncertainty.He said that he expected the burden on German companies to ease after the supreme court’s ruling but added: “I want to try to make it clear to the American government that tariffs harm everyone.”“The biggest poison for the economies of Europe and the US is this constant uncertainty about tariffs. And this uncertainty must end,” Merz said.French president Emmanuel Macron told journalists in Paris: “It is not bad to have a supreme court and, therefore, the rule of law. It is good to have power and counterweights to power in democracies.”He said France would consider the consequences of Trump’s new global tariff and that the fairest rule was “reciprocity” and not to “be subjected to unilateral decisions”.The new 15% tax rate also raises fresh questions for countries such as the UK, which had previously agreed to a 10% tariff with the US.William Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chamber of Commerce, said of the latest hike: “This will be bad for trade, bad for US consumers and businesses, and weaken global economic growth. Businesses on both sides of the Atlantic need a period of clarity and certainty. Higher tariffs are not the way to achieve that.”Some products will be exempted from the temporary tariffs including critical minerals, metals and pharmaceuticals. Other exemptions include USMCA-compliant goods from Canada and Mexico.Meanwhile, the supreme court’s ruling doesn’t affect separate, industry-specific tariffs that Trump slapped on steel, aluminum, lumber and autos under a different US law, which remain in place.Trump has pursued his aggressive tariff policies in a bid to revitalize US manufacturing. The US has already collected at least $130bn in tariffs using the IEEPA, according to themost recent government data.However, studies show that the vast majority of that sum – 90% – has beenpaid by US businesses and consumers. Top associations of US businesses have already begunclamoring for refundsfrom the federal government, but Trump indicated on Friday that reimbursements would not come without a lengthy legal battle.Also on Saturday, Trump continued to lambast the supreme court’s 6-3 ruling as “ridiculous, poorly written, and extraordinarily anti-American” in his Truth Social post, following unusually personal attacks directed at justices the day before.At the White House on Friday, Trump told reporters: “I’m ashamed of certain members of the court. Absolutely ashamed for not having the courage to do what’s right for our country.”He praised the three justices who dissented in the opinion: Brett Kavanaugh, who wrote the main dissent, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. He was scathing in his remarks about the others – including two of his appointees, Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch.“They’re just being fools and lapdogs for the Rinos [“Republicans in name only”] and the radical-left Democrats, and not that they should have anything at all to do with it,” Trump said. “They’re very unpatriotic and disloyal to our constitution.”He called Barrett and Gorsuch “an embarrassment to their families” and said they were “barely” invited to the State of the Union address next week.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTrump administrationTariffsEconomicsEconomic policyUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Helium flow is required for launch.Nasa had said on Friday it was targeting 6 March for the launch of four astronauts around the moon and back as part of its Artemis II mission after successfully completing a fueling test that had caused it to stand down earlier this month.The Artemis II mission’s four astronauts, three Americans – Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover and Christina Koch – and one Canadian, Jeremy Hansen, were entering a second period of quarantine on Friday in anticipation of the new target launch date, whichNasaannounced “with caveats” because it said there was still much preparatory work to do after Thursday’s fueling test.Nasa has several dates available in early March to launch Artemis, which will conduct a 10-day trip around the moon, but not land. The flight will take humans further into space then ever before and, according to Nasa, the mission will fly about 4,700 miles (7,600km) beyond the far side of the moon, surpassing the distance record set by Apollo 13 in 1970. The mission will test systems for future deep-space exploration.The mission is in preparation for Artemis III, scheduled for 2028, which will be the first human landing on the moon since the final Apollo program flight in December 1972.Richard Luscombe contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS newsNasaSpacenewsShareReuse this content"

Its chief policy officer, Neil Bradley, said: “Swift refunds of the impermissible tariffs will be meaningful for the more than 200,000 small business importers in this country and will help support stronger economic growth this year.“We encourage the administration to use this opportunity to reset overall tariff policy in a manner that will lead to greater economic growth, larger wage gains for workers and lower costs for families,” he added.The supreme court did not address the issue of whether theTrump administrationwould have to repay the tariffs it has collected since the US president upended the global economic order by slapping wildly varying levies on different countries apparently at a whim.The court said Trump had exceeded his authority, but it also left lower courts to sort out the issue of repayments, which many observers say could be a mess, particularly given that Trump immediately attempted to reintroduce 10% tariffs on all countries via a different law after the ruling on Friday.Dan Anthony, director of the business coalition We Pay theTariffs, noted that the impact of the tariffs has been particularly hard on small businesses, which have taken out loans, delayed hiring and canceled expansion plans to accommodate import tariffs.Refunds, he predicted, would allow businesses to reverse those trends.The body publisheda national sign-on letterthat said it was “imperative that that money is then given back without some of these onerous processes”.“Full, fast automatic refunds is really where our focus is going to be,” it added.“They’ve taken out loans just to keep their doors open. They’ve frozen hiring, canceled expansion plans, and watched their life savings drain away to pay tariff bills that weren’t in any budget or business plan,” the statement said. “But a legal victory is meaningless without actual relief for the businesses that paid these tariffs.”The American Apparel and Footwear Association called on the Customs and Border Protection agency, which levies import duties, to “move quickly and provide clear guidance to American businesses on how to obtain refunds for tariffs that were unlawfully collected”.But without a framework, and Trump’s apparently intention to impose tariffs by other legal means, refunds are likely not an immediate prospect.At a testy news conference on Friday, Trump said it was “crazy” that the court justices had not addressed the issue of refunds. “It’s not discussed,” he said. “We’ll end up being in court for the next five years.”The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, had a similar message. “My sense is that could be dragged out over weeks, months, years,” he said at conference in Dallas, Texas. “I’ve got a feeling the American people won’t see it.”Greg Husisian, trade attorney at Foley & Lardner, said the court of international trade (CIT) will need to deal with the issue of refunds.It would need to determine whether it can issue blanket relief to every importer who paid tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the first Trump method for imposing tariffs and which the supreme court rejected.US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Husisian said, “likely will continue to collect all IEEPA tariffs, until they are replaced by new tariffs as announced by President Trump”.He warned that while the ruling was a major development, the issue of refunds has rounds of litigation to go.“CBP likely will hold on to all previously collected tariffs, while the court of international trade decides what should happen on the topic of refunds,” he said.“There likely will only be a refund of the previously collected IEEPA tariffs when there is a final, unappealable ruling, which could involve further rounds of briefing and oral arguments at the CIT, an appeal to the US court of appeals for the federal circuit, and then a potential appeal (again) to the supreme court.”Furthermore, he said, the Trump administration is “likely will take all available steps not to upset the tariffs for countries that have struck framework agreements with the United States on tariff issues, such as the UK and Japan”.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsUS supreme courtRetail industryDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS economyEconomic policynewsShareReuse this content"

Finding out any more would require signing a non-disclosure agreement.More than a dozen of her neighbors received the same knock. Searching public records for answers, they discovered thata new customerhad applied for a 2.2 gigawatt project from the local power plant, nearly double its annual generation capacity.The unknown company was building a datacenter.“You don’t have enough to buy me out. I’m not for sale. Leave me alone, I’m satisfied,” Huddleston, 82, later told the men.As tech companies race to build the massive datacenters needed to power artificial intelligence across the US and the world, bids like the one for Huddleston’s land are appearing on rural doorsteps nationwide. Globally, 40,000 acres of powered land – real estate prepped for datacenter development – areprojectedto be needed for new projects over the next five years, double the amount currently in use.Yet despite sums that often dwarf the land’s recent value, farmers are increasingly shutting the door. At least five of Huddleston’s neighbors gave similar categorical rejections, including one who was told he could name any price.In Pennsylvania, a farmerrejected$15m in January for land he’d worked for 50 years. A Wisconsin farmerturneddown $80m the same month. Other landowners have declinedoffersexceeding $120,000 per acre – prices unimaginable just a few years ago.The rebuffs are a jarring reminder of AI’s physical bounds, and limits of the dollars behind the technology.The new Gold RushFour generations of the Huddleston family have watched the world change from the same fields.Ida’s grandfather was growing tobacco when the civil war erupted. Her father ploughed wheat through the first world war and the long attrition of the Great Depression. She and her five siblings grew up on beans, broccoli and potatoes pulled from soil once seared by dust bowl winds. No one in her family went to college – but by age 10, her children could already herd cattle across the same ground as their forebears.View image in fullscreenIda Huddleston (left) and her daughter Delsia Bare.Photograph: Janet Garrison“My whole entire life is nothing but the land. It’s provided me with anything and everything that I’ve needed for 82 years,” she says, speaking from the cabin her late husband built using local wood and rocks many decades ago.Today, where residents see meandering creeks and open pastures, Silicon Valley executives see weak zoning protections, cheap power and abundant water.Developers keep knocking because there are billions to be made. In northern Virginia last November, an investorpaid$615m for less than 100 acres – property thesellerhad bought for just $57m four years prior. Days later, Amazonspent$700m on nearby farmland that had sold for a fraction of that price the year before. In Georgia, a local developerflippedland to Amazon for $270m after paying $4m for it 12 months earlier. For the middlemen scouting these deals, potential returns exceed 1,000%.‘Name your price’About 20 Mason county residents havereportedlybeen offered deals, with the datacenter projectestimatedto cover 2,000 acres.After Dr Timothy Grosser, 75, rejected an $8m offer for his 250-acre farm – 3,500% more than he’d paid nearly four decades earlier – the developers came back with a new proposition: “Name your price.”His answer: “There is none.”Grosser lives, hunts and raises cattle on his land. Each Christmas, his family eats a turkey his grandson catches there. Alongside Huddleston and himself, Grosser estimates four landowners have refused to sell.“All they’ve done all their life is farm grain, cattle, tobacco,” Grosser says. “To them, same as me, the money’s not worth giving up your lifestyle.”For Huddleston’s daughter, Delsia Bare, 56, the connection runs deeper than skill sets. She remembers hoeing weeds from tobacco fields alongside her mother and grandmother, putting up hay through Kentucky summers. “There’s a bond with the land,” she says. “There’s no way to undo it. That’s family, that’s history.”Beyond personal attachment, some farmers worry about broader consequences. Thenumberof US farms has dropped more than 70% since 1935. Datacenters can strainpower grids,drain local water supplies, contaminate soil and fragment wildlife habitat.Bare puts it more bluntly: “You’re not going to grow a loaf of bread off of a datacenter.”Not everyone is holding out; some Mason county farmers have agreed to sell if the project proceeds. “You can’t blame them,” Grosser acknowledges. “Giving them 10 million bucks for a farm?”Those who refuse to sell say the utility company has warned it may invoke eminent domain – the government power to seize private property for public use. The threat isn’t empty:Dominion Energyused it against a Virginia farmer last April.‘Sometimes-self-sacrificial stewardship’The resistance reflects something economists struggle to quantify: the cultural weight of land stewardship. In his book Love for the Land, author Brooks Lamb describes how family farmers’ “sometimes-self-sacrificial stewardship” can lead to choices that defy financial logic, like refusing to consolidate into industrial operations.“When told to ‘get big or get out’, these farmers choose neither,” he writes.View image in fullscreenThe Huddleston farm, in Mason county, Kentucky.Photograph: Janet GarrisonMaintaining the farm is viewed as a “birthright”, by many, says Mary Hendrickson, a professor of rural sociology at the University of Missouri. The responsibility to previous generations runs deep, sometimes dangerously so. During the 1980s’ farm crisis, when heavily indebted farmers faced bankruptcy and land loss,more than900 male farmers in the midwest committed suicide.“They’re somewhat irreversible,” Hendrickson says. “If you give the land over to them, it destroys what that land could be for agriculture.”‘Keeping our people here’Local officials in Mason county insist the datacenter would sustain future generations by bringing much-needed tax revenue and jobs, an argument being made in town halls across the country.Mason’s population has shrunk by around 10% since 1980, largely due to the loss of manufacturing. Developerssaythe datacenter project would bring 1,000 construction jobs, although it may only create 50 full-time operational jobs.In places like Loudoun county, Virginia – home to “Data Center Alley”, where about afifthof the world’s internet traffic goes through – datacenter tax revenue nearlyequalsthe county’s entire operating budget.“We can continue to shrink – losing population, losing jobs and watching our young people leave for opportunities elsewhere – or we can chart a new course,” Tyler McHugh, Mason county’s industrial development director, said at a public hearing in December. “It’s about keeping our people here.”What money can’t buyAs they offer multimillion-dollar deals, datacenter developers are not stealing Mason county land, yet some farmers feel a spiritual dispossession nonetheless.A few months before the knock on her door last May, Delsia Bare lost most of her vision. Now she relies on sound to connect with the land: singing birds, the running creek. She fears a datacenter’s hum will drown out those connections, pushing the farm from physical reality into memory.For now, she returns to what her family has relied on for generations. “The land, the land, the land,” as her mother puts it.As AI promises to transcend corporeal fallibility, these standoffs reveal its very physical constraints – and Wall Street’s miscalculation of what some people value most. In the rolling hills of Mason county and farmland across America, that gap is measured not in dollars but in something harder to price: identity.Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)FarmingnewsShareReuse this content"

For the neutral the final 11 matches for City and the Gunners promise to be a cannot-miss spectacle.By early Sunday evening Mikel Arteta’s side will be down to 10 games and 30 points left to play for, after theytravel to Tottenham. Emerge as victors from the north London derby andtheir advantage will be five points, with one match fewer to play, but after this City victory over Newcastle it is a mere two so a severe test of nerve awaits at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.‘Caipirinhas, daiquiris’: Guardiola tells City players to chill and ignore title pressureRead moreCity moved to 56 points with a goal difference of 31 (one fewer than the Gunners) courtesy of Nico O’Reilly’s first-half double. Towards the end Rayan Aït-Nouri could have calmed home tension when scampering free but a miskick in front of Nick Pope’s goal enabled Newcastle’s keeper to collect the ball.So the game finished 2-1 as City reeled off a 17th consecutive home league victory over the visitors, Eddie Howe’s men managing only Lewis Hall’s 22nd-minute equaliser.Despite the 5,058 miles round trip, Howe stood down only Harvey Barnes fromWednesday’s 6-1 hammering of Qarabag, with Jacob Ramsey the replacement. Fourteen minutes in and he was part of a midfield that went awol when O’Reilly scored the opener.Dan Burn ceded possession to Omar Marmoush clumsily. The Egyptian ran forward and squeezed the ball left; O’Reilly took a look, then fired beyond Pope, the goalkeeper’s right fingertips merely brushing the finish on its way past.Delight for those of a sky blue stripe and reward for a fast, physical mode. But there was an instant warning. The lightning fast Anthony Gordon broke along the left, turned Marc Guéhi in the area and shot low, with Gianluigi Donnarumma saving.Next, a similar counterattack forced two corners, and Newcastle equalised. Sandro Tonali dropped the second in, the ball came to Hall and his effort ricocheted off Aït-Nouri, defeating Donnarumma to his left.City’s lead lasted eight minutes, Newcastle’s parity five. O’Reilly’s second was a leaping header that went in to Pope’s left after a smart Antoine Semenyo feed to Erling Haaland was complemented by a deft right-foot cross. The Norwegian raised his fists to salute the goal – and his seventh assist – and an invigorating contest had its third goal in its 27th minute.View image in fullscreenNico O’Reilly heads home the winner for Manchester City.Photograph: Jon Super/APO’Reilly, part of the second bank of two with Semenyo in Guardiola’s 4-2-2-2, ahead of Bernardo Silva and Rodri, constantly pierced Newcastle and cast Howe’s 4-2-3-1 a tactical miscalculation, as Ramsey and Tonali were swamped by City’s central four.Newcastle’s gameplan depended on profiting from a moment to score. An example came when a Tonali free-kick was headed in by Burn but the centre-back was offside – pushed into the position by Rúben Dias, though afterwards Howe said he had not seen this. Dias’s sluggish pace had forced him to haul down Gordon for Tonali’s set piece, and he was booked, then substituted for the second period – tactically, Guardiola confirmed – the far quicker Abdukodir Khusanov coming on.Soon after the break Hall curved a free-kick wide, then moments later Semenyo was off target, too, after a rapid central burst through wide-open opponents.Quick GuideManchester City 2-1 Newcastle key factsShow• Nico O’Reilly’s opener was Manchester City’s 500th Premier League goal at the Etihad Stadium under Pep Guardiola. They have netted 68 more home goals than any other team in the competition since 2016-17, while only Manchester United at Old Trafford under Sir Alex Ferguson (910 goals) have scored more goals for one manager at one stadium in Premier League history.• Lewis Hall’s equaliser (pictured) was Newcastle United’s first Premier League goal at the Etihad Stadium in 2,730 days, since September 2018 (DeAndre Yedlin), having failed to score in any of their six away league games against the Citizens in between.OptaPhotograph: Carl Recine/Getty Images EuropeWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Before the hour Rayan Cherki replaced Marmoush and Barnes and Joelinton took over from Nick Woltemade and Joe Willock.More chances followed. Anthony Elanga’s foray down the right ended with him crashing into the boardings before Semenyo, teed up at the other end, fluffed an attempt, Guardiola visibly disappointed.At 2-1 Newcastle retained hope – and Arsenal, too – of a second equaliser at least. For a prolonged passage they pinned City back, the hosts unable to get up the field – a rarity.As the four minutes of added time began, the substitute Phil Foden blazed at goal and Pope saved. Just before the close, City defended a corner at which Pope joined his outfield colleagues but still Guardiola’s men ended in the ascendancy.You might not bet against them ending there, too, when the title is handed out in May.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester CityNewcastle Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Luke Donald, who is expected to remain in office for a third stint as Europe’s Ryder Cup captain, wanted the situation with Hatton and Rahm resolved. Donald has only partly got his wish, with Adare Manor in 2027 looming ever closer.‘Pay up’: Rory McIlroy delivers Ryder Cup warning to LIV pair Hatton and RahmRead moreHatton joined Laurie Canter, Tom McKibbin, Thomas Detry, Adrian Meronk, Victor Perez, Elvis Smylie and David Puig in reaching agreement with the European Tour Group. Until now members of the DP World, formerly European, Tour were punished each time they played in the Saudi-backed LIV.“The conditions these members have accepted will provide additional value to the DP World Tour and benefit to the entire membership,” said the European Tour Group . “Provided each member satisfies the conditions of their individual releases, no disciplinary action under the regulations will be taken against them for playing in conflicting tournaments on LIVGolfin 2026 and they will retain their membership status.“The releases apply for the 2026 season only and they are not precedent-setting. Requests for releases will continue to be considered on their individual merits in accordance with the regulations that all members agree to abide by.”Notable by his absence is Rahm, who remains in conflict with the European Tour Group. The two-time major winner has been adamant he will not pay fines in Europe, which is due to lead him towards an appeal hearing.Should Rahm lose – and precedent suggests he will – he would be in default and facing suspensionfrom the Ryder Cup. Other Ryder Cup regulars placed in this position – Lee Westwood, Sergio García and Ian Poulter – resigned from the DP World Tour after losing appeals over fines. Rahm, a key part of Europe’s past four Ryder Cup teams, has yet to comment on the situation.In Dubai last month, Rory McIlroy called on Hatton and Rahm to step forward for Europe. “We went really hard on the Americans about being paid to play the Ryder Cup,” he said of events at the 2025 event. “We also said we would pay to play in Ryder Cups. There’s two guys that can prove it.”Explore more on these topicsRyder CupLIV Golf SeriesGolfnewsShareReuse this content"

His name will always be tied to the biggest home run in baseball history and the 1960 World Series championship, but I will remember him most for the person he was: humble, gracious and proud to be a Pirate.”Mazeroski died on Friday in Lansdale, Pennsylvania, the Pirates said. No cause of death was given.Elected to the Hall by the Veterans Committee in 2001, he was, by some measures, no superstar. Mazeroski had the lowest batting average, on-base percentage and stolen base total of any second baseman in Cooperstown. He hit just .260 lifetime, with 138 homers and 27 stolen bases in 17 years, and had an on-base percentage of .299. He never batted .300, never approached 100 runs batted or 100 runs scored and only once finished in the top 10 for Most Valuable Player.His best qualities were both tangible and beyond the box score. His Hall of Fame plaque praises him as a “defensive wizard” with “hard-nosed hustle” and a “quiet work ethic.” A 10-time All-Star, he turned a major league record 1,706 double plays, earning the nickname “No Hands” for how quickly he fielded grounders and relayed them. He led the National League nine times in assists for second basemen and has been cited by statistician Bill James as the game’s greatest defensive player at his position.“I think defense belongs in the Hall of Fame,” Mazeroski said, defensively, during his Hall of Fame induction speech. “Defense deserves as much credit as pitching and I’m proud to be going in as a defensive player.”But Mazeroski’s signature moment took place in the batter’s box. On 13 October 1960, Mazeroskilaunched a home run over the fence in left fieldin the bottom of the ninth at old Forbes Field in Pittsburgh, giving the Pirates a 10-9 win in Game 7 of the World Series against the New York Yankees. The fans mobbed him on the field as he crossed home plate.View image in fullscreenPittsburgh Pirates fans rush the field to congratulate Bill Mazeroski after his title-clinching shot.Photograph: Harry Harris/AP“I don’t know it’s out. I don’t know it’s a home run. But I know I’m going to end up on third if he misplays that ball off the wall,” Mazeroski recalled in 2015. “So I’m busting my tail getting around there, and by the time I hit second base, I looked down the line and the fans went crazy. From second base, I didn’t touch the ground all the way in.”It was the first time a World Series had ended on a homer, leading to enduring waves of celebration and despair. Forbes Field was torn down in the 1970s, but a decade later fans began gathering every 13 October at the park’s lone remnant, the center field wall, and listened to the original broadcast.The late singer Bing Crosby, a former co-owner of the Pirates, was so afraid he’d jinx his team that he listened to the game with friends across the Atlantic Ocean, in Paris.“We were in this beautiful apartment, listening on shortwave, and when it got close Bing opened a bottle of Scotch and was tapping it against the mantel,” his widow, Kathryn Crosby, told the New York Times in 2010. “When Mazeroski hit the home run, he tapped it hard; the Scotch flew into the fireplace and started a conflagration.”Mazeroski was a Pirate for his entire time in the majors and was a team man off the field. His wife, Milene Nicholson, was a front office employee whom he met through Pittsburgh manager Danny Murtaugh. They were married in 1958, had two sons and remained together until her death in 2024.Mazeroski was born in Wheeling, West Virginia, during the Great Depression, grew up in eastern Ohio, and lived for a time in a one-room house without electricity or indoor plumbing. Although a star in basketball and football, he favored baseball and was good enough to be drafted by the Pirates at age 17 in 1954. Mazeroski was a shortstop for a team with numerous prospects at that position, and had switched to second by his rookie year, 1956. Even as a part-time player at the end of his career, he was a leader and steady presence on the 1971 team that featured Roberto Clemente and Willie Stargell and defeated the Baltimore Orioles in the World Series.After his final season, 1972, Mazeroski coached briefly for the Pirates and the Seattle Mariners and was an infield instructor for Pittsburgh during spring training. In 1987, the Pirates retired his uniform, No 9. The 50th anniversary of his Game 7 heroics was marked in 2010 by the unveiling – on Bill Mazeroski Way – of a statue of one of Pittsburgh’s greats, rounding the bases, on top of the world.Explore more on these topicsPittsburgh PiratesMLBBaseballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

And a dog. Hadzic briefly wondered if she was hallucinating before officials escorted the crowd favourite off the snow. “He was cute but not aggressive,” Greece’s Konstantina Charalampidou observed.

Tempers flared as Brad Jacobs’ Canada beat Sweden ina spicy round-robin tie, with Niklas Edin’s team alleging the Canadians were double-touching the stone after release. After a passive-aggressive back-and-forth in which each side asked the officials to monitor the other’s deliveries, tensions boiled over in the penultimate end when Marc Kennedy responded to Oskar Eriksson’s accusations of impropriety by telling him to “fuck off”.

World Anti-Doping Agency officials were asked, for perhaps the first time, to comment on penile enhancement as performance aid.

Simon had denied the fraud for three years before admitting guilt after photos of the cards were found on her phone, saying in a court hearing in Albertville: “I can’t explain it.

He had gone nearly three years unbeaten in competition, owing to a stunning array of quadruple jumps including the quad axel, the heart-stopping four-and-a-half-revolution jump that had never been landed in competition until he came along. The Olympic debutant had shown traces of fragility in helping the US to team gold but, after falling twice during a catastrophic free skate thatdropped him out of the medalsinto eighth place – one of the biggest shocks in Olympic figure skating history – the 21-year-old from the northern Virginia suburbs described in effect having a panic attack on the ice.

Seeded 13th out of 16 teams entering the final rounds, having both turned inforgettable performances in their individual events, Bankes and Nightingale both held their nerve in the four-team final, with the former overtaking France’s Léa Casta with a decisive move during the second leg that flipped silver into gold. “It’s hard to describe in words,” Nightingale said. “We both put in so much hard work. The singles were tough but now there are tears of joy.”View image in fullscreenCharlotte Bankes (right) takes the final jump in the lead ahead of Italian (left) and French rivals to win gold with her teammate Huw Nightingale in the mixed snowboard cross.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian9) Golden oldiesThe Winter Games can seem like a purpose-built showcase for gen Z prodigies and teenagers, but Milano Cortina often felt like a millennials’ playhouse. Nick Baumgartner wasback for snowboard crossat 44. Canada’s Deanna Stellato-Dudek made headlines competing in the figure skating aged 42. Lindsey Vonn returned at 41 and was the biggest star of the whole Olympicsfor about 13 seconds. But the highest honours go toAustria’s Benjamin Karl, 40, who won the men’s alpine snowboarding parallel giant slalom in Livigno to become the oldest individual gold medallist in Winter Olympic history, a record that stood for exactly eight days, when it was lowered (raised?)by the American bobsledder Elana Meyers Taylor.View image in fullscreenBenjamin Karl shows off his muscles after winning the men’s parallel giant slalom, and setting a record as the oldest gold medallist at 40.Photograph: David Ramos/Getty Images10) Vance booedJD Vance was seemingly everywhere all at once in Milan during the first week of the Games.

If the Olympics are usually a sanctuary from politics, Vance treated them more like a campaign stop with better lighting and tighter security.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While Canada are the betting favourites – and have won the most ice hockey golds in Olympic history – the US players say they have motivation to upset their northern neighbours.USA and Canada to meet in Olympic men’s ice hockey gold medal gameRead more“There’s hatred there,” USA’s Brady Tkachuktold ESPN on Saturday. “I mean, they’ve been the top dog. They’ve been the best for the last bunch of years, and for us, we want to be in that position, be the best. So it’s going to be a game where I think a lot of guys could say, this is the biggest game that they’ve ever played in.”The rivalry between the teams has sharpened recently, particularly as political tensions have risen between Canada and the United States. At last year’s 4 Nations Face-Off tournament,Canadian fans booed the US anthemand there were a number of on-ice fights.Canada’s Connor McDavid acknowledged there is extra spice when his team play the US.“It is the game everybody wanted and hoped for, and it will be a great game,” he said. “It now comes down to one game between two teams. It is a hockey game, and we are excited about that. Team Canada playing Team USA in a hockey game – that is what it is.On Thursday,the US beat Canadato claim gold in the women’s tournament. USA’s Vincent Trocheck said the win had added a little extra motivation for the men.“I mean, we saw the girls win,” Trocheck told ESPN. “Obviously win gold for USA and if we can beat Canada on Sunday, it’s just a clean sweep and I mean, that’s what everyone’s here for.”The status of Canada’s captain, Sidney Crosby, is still uncertain. The 38-year-old has won two Olympics golds and three Stanley Cups, but did not play in his team’s semi-final win over Finland due to a knee injury. Canada coach Jan Cooper said he would wait until the last minute before making a decision on Crosby’s participation.“We will see. I watched him skate today and we will meet tonight,” said Cooper. “He won’t put himself in harm’s way, and he will not put the team in harm’s way.”The US’s last gold in Olympic men’s ice hockeycame in 1980. Canada’s last gold was in 2014, when they retained the title they won in 2010.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Ice hockeyUSA ice hockey teamCanada ice hockey teamWinter OlympicsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

But Malininstruggled so mightilyin his free skate last Friday that he failed to make the podium at all, and he later acknowledged that the weighty expectations had caused him to buckle.Fear is a raw song about mental health struggles and the feeling of losing control. During Saturday’s routine Malinin, dressed in a grey hoodie and frayed jeans, pretended to scroll through his phone. He flinched under imaginary flashbulbs, crouched down and pulled his hood over his head and batted away jarring noises meant to represent social media criticism.He also showcased his undoubted talent. He did one quadruple jump and then unleashed his trademark backflip with a one-footed landing that had the crowd on its feet roaring with what felt like both an appreciation of his skill and an acknowledgement of the weight he had carried.

The lyrics could hardly have been more fitting for the three-time and reigning national champion, who bounced back from a major mistake in her short program that cost her a shot at an individual medal by laying down one of the best free skates of her career.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsIlia MalininAlysa LiuFigure skatingUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Nobody wanted to get the gold,” said Stolz, the 21-year-old from Wisconsin who captured a pair of golds with Olympic-record times in the 500m and 1000m before Thursday’s silver in the 1500m.USA’s Elana Meyers Taylor storms monobob to win first Olympic gold at age 41Read moreBergsma, who claimed bronze in the 10,000m eight days ago, becomes the third athlete in his 40s to win an individual gold at the Milano Cortina Games, joiningUS bobsledder Elana Meyers TaylorandAustrian snowboarder Benjamin Karl. Before these Olympics, the only athlete aged 40 or older to win an individual Winter Games gold was Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Bjørndalen in 2014.Bergsma did not panic when he started near the back of the pack, sitting 15th after the opening lap. He steadily worked his way forward alongside Thorup and spent much of the middle of the 16-lap race out in front, conserving energy and staying out of trouble. With five laps to go, Thorup and Bergsma led by nearly 300m and were close to lapping the field. Bergsma made his final push on the second-to-last circuit, taking control of the lead and powering through the closing stretch with barely a fight.“That was crazy, mind-blowing,” Bergsma said. “I was expecting a really hard final, but nobody wanted to do the first attack. I did it. I had a gap together with Viktor and that was it.“We had a gap in no time, and then I knew, ‘OK, I have a big, big chance right now’. I just wanted to keep the gap with the peloton and keep the speed in it a bit. I had to keep my cool and finish it.”Stolz went out in front immediately before slipping back into the middle of the peloton after two laps but staying in the mix throughout. He was still right there entering the final trips around the oval and even produced one of the fastest closing bursts in the field, but could not overtake Giovannini down the stretch to the rapture of the Italian fans.Milano Cortina Winter Olympics 2026 day 15 – in picturesRead more“I thought maybe the other guys would pull, but they all decided to follow me,” Stolz said. “If I pull back the two leading guys, I’ll have no chance of getting a medal. So even in the last four laps, I was still in front pulling them. I was close to getting a bronze, but there was no chance we would have caught the two guys up in front.”Stolz entered the Olympicswith immense expectations, already a seven-time world champion and the favorite here across three individual distances. While he fell short of sweeping his program, he departs Italy as only the second man to complete the 500m-1000m double in speed skating at a single Olympics.“I would say it was pretty successful,” Stolz said of his medal haul. “There are things that could have gone better, but two golds and a silver, I have got to be pretty happy with that.”Bergsma will be 44 at the nextWinter Olympics, but he did not rule out a title defense in the French Alps in 2030.“Four years is going to be really tough, especially with the young guys coming up on the single distances,” he said. “I will see by year by year, but I am not done yet.”USA’s Mia Manganello, competing in her final Winter Games at 36, took bronze in the women’s mass start. The gold went to reigning world champion Marijke Groenewoud of the Netherlands while Ivanie Blondin of Canada took the silver for the second Games in a row.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsSpeed skatingUS sportsJordan StolznewsShareReuse this content"

They were crap,” a frustrated Samuelsson told Swedish TV. “Today the glide from the skis was very bad ... I’m here to fight for medals, but today I go without.“Ski waxing is one of the most important elements of race preparation for biathletes and cross-country skiers, and getting the blend right for the combination of snow, temperature and altitude helps the athletes fly around the course. Getting it wrong makes it akin to skiing through treacle.Different waxes are used depending on whether the snow is wet or dry, and while many work optimally at temperatures well below freezing, they can get soft and sticky if the temperature rises sharply just before or during a race, ultimately slowing the skiers down.View image in fullscreenJohannes Dale-Skjevdal crosses the finish line to win gold for Norway.Photograph: Kevin Voigt/Getty ImagesIn contrast to Sweden, Norway’s team got their wax spot on as Johannes Dale-Skjevdal, who hit all 20 of his shots for the first time in his career, won gold and compatriot Sturla Holm Lægreid silver. France kept up their habit of providing slick skis to their biathletes at the Games as Quentin Fillon Maillet bagged bronze.There were to be no such celebrations for the Swedes, and their team of wax technicians met the racers at the finish line to immediately apologise for their misjudgement.Though the trio of biathletes were frustrated, they were relatively quick to forgive. “You just have to laugh at it,” Ponsiluoma said. “When you feel like you don’t have the materials, you feel it would have taken 25 hits to beat Dale-Skjevdal today.”Unfortunately for Ponsiluoma – the silver medallist in Beijing – there were only 20 targets to shoot at. Alhough Nelin’s 26th place was hardly what he envisioned at the start, at least he missed out on taking part in a bizarre sprint finish to avoid last place.“This kind of thing [with waxing] happens to all nations at some point and we have a very good waxing team, it’s just not going well right now,” Nelin said.Ponsiluoma’s gold in the men’s pursuit is Sweden’s only biathlon victory at Milano Cortina, and one of just three medals won in the event at the 2026 Games.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsnewsShareReuse this content"

After a little over two hours of racing Johannes Høsflot Klæbo won his sixth gold medal of these Games when he beat his Norwegian teammate Martin Løwstrøm Nyenget by 17.4 seconds to win the men’s 50km classic.The triumph meant the 29-year-old set the record for the most gold medals in a single Winter Games, set by the US speed skater Eric Heiden when he won five at Lake Placid in 1980. In an age of exaggeration and in an industry that loves overstatement, it is entirely true to say that there has never been anything quite like it.Winter Olympics 2026: Klæbo wins historic sixth gold, ski cross joy for Italy – liveRead moreKlæbo now has 11 Olympic gold medals, which puts him one ahead of the entire country of India on the all-time table. Were he a nation, he would be ninth in the 2026 medal standings. In this past fortnight he has competed in 10 races across 115km, in six different events, in the space of just 14 days, and won every single one of them.Nobody has ever swept all the cross-country events in a single Olympics before; truth is nobody has ever imagined it was possible in such a gruelling sport.Only the American swimmer Michael Phelps, with 23, has ever won more Olympic gold medals than Klæbo. In this past week he has overtaken Laris Latynina, Carl Lewis, Katie Ledecky, Paavo Nurmi and everyone else in the Olympic pantheon. “Is it 14 left or something?” Klæbo said after he had won his fifth gold on Wednesday. “It’s going to be way too many.” Only 13 now.View image in fullscreenJohannes Høsflot Klæbo savours the greatest of his 11 gold medals as he crosses the line in the 50km mass start final.Photograph: Javier Soriano/AFP/Getty ImagesBut he had to earn it. The 50km is the hardest event in the Olympics. For the majority of the race, Klæbo was out alone with Nyenget and Emil Iversen, all tucked one behind the other like three geese flying south for the winter. They moved in lockstep as they looped in, out and around the trails, between larch trees and up and down the hills. There were only tenths of seconds between the three of them. By 30km the man racing in fourth place, the Russian Savelii Korostelev, was almost two minutes off, and he was another half-minute on from everyone else.Milano Cortina Winter Olympics 2026 day 15 – in picturesRead moreIversen finally broke and slipped back halfway through the last lap, but Nyenget kept on. He attacked twice in the final two kilometres but couldn’t shake off Klæbo and by the time they came into sight of the finish line they were dead level. Then, on the final uphill, Klæbo finally made the move everyone had been waiting to see, wondering, all the while, whether he still had it in him after all this racing. He did. As he entered the bend into the home stretch he was a tenth of a second ahead, and was cheered into history by thousands of raucous fans.It was Klæbo’s greatest victory. He began this sport as a sprinter, competing in the 1,500m, but over time has moved up into marathon racing too, with the ultimate aim of winning this, the most prestigious event in the sport. To do it, he has had to master two entirely different techniques: classical, in which the skis have to run parallel on groomed tracks, and freestyle, in which they move in a V-shape. The two are as different as breaststroke is from butterfly.Not satisfied with that, Klæbo invented one all of his own, an uphill running technique, a sort of high-tempo diagonal stride that he used to devastating effect in the cross-country classic sprint. Theclip of him storming upa 240m hill, in skis, at six-minute-mile pace, is one of the most startling sights of these Olympics. It is, his childhood coach has explained, something he first learned by accident, “because he didn’t have enough wax on his skis, and it was a bit slippy, and he just found out ‘OK, if I run I can make it.’” It sounds like it was born out of the same sheer bloody stubbornness which has driven him to these six victories.View image in fullscreenMartin Løwstrøm Nyenget, Johannes Høsflot Klæbo and Emil Iversen were locked together for a large part of the race.Photograph: Michel Cottin/Agence Zoom/Getty Images‘Worst skis I ever had’: Swedish biathletes blame poor Olympic form on waxing teamRead moreIf you still don’t get it, measure him by the opinions of his rivals, even if it it means they end up like little sketches drawn on the foot of the page to give everything a sense of true scale.“He’s the GOAT in the whole sport, the greatest skier we will ever see,” said France’s Theo Schley. “I like to go to every race thinking that it’s a race for the win, but these days, a lot of the time it’s a race for second,” said the USA’s Ben Ogden. “He is just at a different level here, he is the greatest of all time,” said his teammate Einar Hedegart. “He’s the best skier of all time,” said another Norwegian, Oskar Opstad Vike, “and it’s an honour to share a podium with him.”And these are just the athletes who are at least competing for the other medals, let alone the people making up the field. “I think,” said Great Britain’s Andrew Musgrave, who finished sixth, “that Johannes could probably have gone backwards faster than me up the last hill.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsSkiingnewsShareReuse this content"

For me, anyone who knows me, the most important thing has always been the team,” Milner told BBC Radio 5 Live. “I’m delighted I was able to play a few more minutes today and at Villa and hopefully people can see I can still contribute to the team.“It’s a big number and it’s nice to get to the record, but it’s an opportunity to give a nod to so many people who have helped me, the family and friends who have been there from the start, the sacrifice they’ve made.Quick GuideBrentford 0-2 Brighton key statsShow• James Milner made his 654th Premier League appearance in this game, overtaking Gareth Barry (653) to become the outright leading appearance maker in the competition’s history.• Milner has faced 43 different sides in the Premier League remaining unbeaten against seven teams, with one of those being Brentford, ending on the winning side in all four of his appearances against the Bees.• Brighton secured just their second Premier League win since the start of December (P14 W2 D6 L6), with this their first victory in seven (D3 L3) since beating Burnley 2-0 last month.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“The physios, sports scientists that have supported me, Sean Duggan the physio at Brighton who when I couldn’t lift my foot for six months last year helped get me back on the field.

Perhaps it was towards the end of the first half ofWest Ham’s game at Chelseaat the end of January with the away side leading 2-0. Or perhaps it was when West Ham took the lead against Manchester United 10 days later. As it turned out, West Ham won neither fixture; had they done so they would have had five points more and so been level with Tottenham going into this weekend. And then Tottenham’s proximity to relegation could not have been denied.West Ham’s revival means this isn’t like last season, when a win at Ipswich at the end of February took Tottenham to 33 points and as good as confirmed their continued presence in the Premier League, allowing Ange Postecoglou to focus on Europe. Were Spurs to pull off something extremely unlikely and beat Arsenal on Sunday, they would move to 32 and, for all the glee their fans would feel, nobody would feel secure.Mauricio Pochettino’s odd jab at Tim Weah misread the player and the moment | Leander SchaerlaeckensRead moreIf Nottingham Forest’sperformance at Fenerbahceis indicative of what is to come under Vítor Pereira, this may be a season when it actually does take 40 points, the traditional mark seen as necessary for survival, to stay up. Which should make every club in the bottom half a little anxious. Quite apart from the fact that Spurs really shouldn’t be in a relegation battle, it wasn’t at all clear under Thomas Frank where the four wins they may need were going to come from.For Spurs, this season has been the Niles Crane to last season’s Frasier. The obvious thing to do when the sitcom was created as a spin-off from Cheers would have been to make Frasier’s brother his opposite; the genius lay in making him an even more extreme version. For Tottenham, the relegation fears became more acute, the injuries even worse, the potential European redemption sought not in the Europa League but the Champions League. Everything was amplified.How do you follow winning the Europa League while finishing fourth bottom of the Premier League? By winning the Champions League while finishing third bottom of the Premier League, of course. Sadly the decisionto sack him has prevented Frankfrom ruefully agreeing with Ange Postecoglou that the third seasonisalways better than the second.View image in fullscreenIgor Tudor makes at least superficial sense as interim head coach.Photograph: Eric Gaillard/ReutersBut it was probably a necessary call. Spurs had won just two of their previous 17 league games and only five home games since November 2024. They have 12 players out injured. Fans were in almost open revolt. Something had to change and when a club reaches that point, the thing that changes is usually the manager.Frank had withered in the Spurs job. The affable, engaging figure of Brentford became brittle. He seemed to lose faith in himself and his players in him. The cohort of fans who had doubted whether Spurs should be appointing a manager from Brentford had grown by the week. They may not be a club much used to success, but Spurs are a club who expect to fail stylishly. Joyless football that brought only record low expected goals are not part of the history of Tottenham.It’s what comes next that is vital. Everything that has happened until now could be blamed on the old regime, onDaniel Levy, who was ousted as club chairin September. Frank was his appointment. Every signing up to Xavi Simons was his. Since then, as the Lewis family took greater control, there’s been a sense of waiting to see which direction the club would take, the situation only confused by the sporting director Fabio Paratici’s return to Italy three monthsafter resuming his postfollowing the expiration of a ban imposed for accounting irregularities while at Juventus.View image in fullscreenIgor Tudor is a relegation firefighter, his experience at Udinese ideal preparation for Spurs’ survival drive.Photograph: Chloe Knott/Tottenham Hotspur FC/ShutterstockDecision-making now is in the hands of the chief executive, Vinai Venkatesham, and the technical director, Johan Lange. After the two January arrivals – Conor Gallagher from Atlético and Souza, a 19-year-old Brazilian left-back from Santos – replacing Frank is their first big decision, the first clear indication of what the future might look like.Igor Tudor as an interimmakes at least superficial sense. He had worked for Paratici at Juventus and been discussed as a potential short-term option to replace Frank even before the sporting director’s move to Fiorentina. In Italy he became almost a specialist firefighter and, while all such appointments are risks, that is probably less of a gamble than turning to one of Frank’s assistants, or putting out the call for Ryan Mason, recently sacked by West Brom, to return for a third interim stint.But still, that’s three seasons out of the past six under a short‑term appointment (and one of those, Mason’s second reign, wasreplacing another acting manager in Cristian Stellini). That’s eight changes of manager in five years, which suggests neither stability nor a club particularly good at making appointments.The summer itself could be chaotic. Manchester United and Real Madrid will be appointing new managers. It would surprise no one if Manchester City, Liverpool and Barcelona were also hiring. Would Mikel Arteta stay on if Arsenal do not win the Premier League or the Champions League? Luis Enrique may leave Paris Saint-Germain and Oliver Glasner is leaving Crystal Palace, while Andoni Iraola and Marco Silva will be out of contract. Xabi Alonso and Roberto De Zerbi are available. By the middle of July, the World Cup will have released a host of managers on to the market, including, enticingly for Tottenham, Mauricio Pochettino.But before Spurs can begin to consider that, they have to know what division they will be in. The problems have not all disappeared with Frank. The injury crisis remains deep. Without Dejan Kulusevski and James Maddison there is an obvious dearth of creativity. Confidence is low. Tudor has worked with Randal Kolo Muani before and it would be very helpful for Spurs if he could get him back to something like his best to relieve the goalscoring burden on Dominic Solanke.Tudor has come through crises before, notably saving Udinese in 2018 by winning their final two games of the season. But at Spurs he takes over an injury-ravaged squad that has no experience of relegation battles. And this, assuredly, even if the gap to West Ham in third bottom is five points, is a relegation battle.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurInside footballcommentShareReuse this content"

In keeping with those over recent weeks, much of the performance was befitting of another three points. But, thanks to a couple of smart Djordje Petrovic saves and some profligacy in front of goal, the hosts had to make do with a draw – an expected goals (xG) total of 2.87 from 20 shots yielding a blank in the only column that matters.West Ham v Bournemouth: Premier League – liveRead moreTheir side’s continued resurgence does provide some encouragement for the home fans, however. From a position of hopelessness in mid-January, West Ham have lost just one of their last six league games, and the gap to a safe position is down to two points, at least until Nottingham Forest host Liverpool on Sunday. That is something to take heart from despite the fact they largely overwhelmed aBournemouthside whose unbeaten run extends to seven league games.“We were really close,” said Nuno. “That is the feeling that stays with us – that we feel it is almost there for us to take and we didn’t take it.“At the same time, we played well, we competed well and we were solid. But, overall, it was us who were really close and that’s why we are sad. Unfortunately today it was not to be.”In a match devoid of life for the best part of the middle hour – all sense of urgency dissolving in the early evening drizzle – it was the start and end that provided the notable moments.In the opening six minutes alone, West Ham had four shots. They should have scored at least one of them, but that would become a recurring theme as the afternoon wore on.View image in fullscreenAxel Disasi competes for the ball in a goalmouth scramble.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersAxel Disasi had head in hands after Petrovic palmed away his initial header and he turned the rebound over the bar from a couple of yards out, all within 45 seconds of kick-off. A fabulous flowing move swiftly followed, culminating in Taty Castellanos delivering a peach of a cross for Crysencio Summerville, but the in-form winger could only prod into Petrovic’s hands.Summerville has waited a considerable time for his West Ham career to catch light, but played with the confidence of someone who has scored six goals in his last seven appearances – a tally that makes him his team’s second highest scorer this season, despite all of them coming since the turn of the year. As West Ham’s main attacking outlet, Summerville displayed an abundance of trickery and a permanent desire to take on his opposite number, but provided little in the way of cutting edge.Having earlier seen a shot deflected on to the roof of the net, he might have scored when presented with a prime opportunity inside the Bournemouth box in the closing stages, but could not get the ball out from under his feet.Substitute Callum Wilson had a first-time flick excellently beaten away by Petrovic, a Castellanos bicycle kick briefly threatened the spectacular, and, deep in injury time, Jarrod Bowen failed to hit the target from a few yards out. “I was praying,” said Nuno, of the moment Bowen was played through on goal. It rather summed up the home side’s afternoon.Having appeared motionless for the first few minutes of the match, Bournemouth did improve after half-time, but largely fed off scraps.Bidding to become the first teenager to register a goal involvement in each of his first fourPremier Leagueoutings, the precocious Rayan produced his side’s one notable moment. After picking the ball up deep inside his own half and nonchalantly flicking it over a slide tackle, he continued all the way to the edge of the West Ham 18-yard box and curled it against the outside of the post.“It’s a good point for us,” said Andoni Iraola. “I didn’t like our performance in the first half; second half was much better. [West Ham] are in a good run and in need of results, and you can feel that from the beginning. We knew they would start strong, but we couldn’t equal their intensity.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueWest Ham UnitedBournemouthmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Unai Emery’s side have won only once in their past fourPremier Leaguehome games and fell short again to leave them seven points behind leaders Arsenal. They were punished for a sloppy opening 45 minutes when they failed to get almost anything right against their more aggressive opponents.Anton Stach’s incredible free-kick looked like it would secure victory for Leeds until the 88th minute but it felt like another important step in their fight for survival.Flemming rescues last-gasp point for Burnley after Chelsea’s Fofana sees redRead moreThe Premier League is Villa’s priority, sitting above the Europa League in the pecking order, but they are stuttering. For the remaining 11 games, the focus will be on holding off any charge from the teams sitting below them. They cannot continue to not turn up for 45 minutes at a time and need to find a cutting edge.“It’s a good point,” Emery said. “We are setting our standards high, and sometimes we can become frustrated, because we are not achieving the same results with the same process, like today. But overall, our consistency is still there, and our demand is still there. And if we are third, it’s because we are being consistent and we are being demanding.”The opening exchanges passed without incident as the teams sought to find rhythm. Leeds were the first to show some creativity when Jayden Bogle clipped a fine pass over the Villa defence to release Dominic Calvert-Lewin but Emiliano Martínez was alert.Despite the 12 places separating the two sides, with one eyeing the title and the other a relegation scrap, Villa had scored only one more goal than Leeds. It was not a surprise to the witnesses inside Villa Park, as Emery’s team were heavily reliant on set pieces but the execution was abysmal, while Morgan Rogers struggled to get into the game in a packed midfield area, removing a key Villa weapon.View image in fullscreenAnton Stach fires in a stunning free-kick in the first half for Leeds.Photograph: Paul Marriott/ShutterstockLeeds looked more confident and dangerous, with the threat mainly coming from the overlapping wing-backs Bogle and Gabriel Gudmundsson. In the end, however, it was a free-kick that brought the opener. Ollie Watkins committed a needless foul 35 yards from his own goal and Stach shocked everyone, especially Martínez and the away end, by whipping it into the top corner for a goal of the season contender.Leeds were hostile and Villa wilting. Calvert-Lewin caused problems with his physicality and clever movement. If this was a battle to be England’s backup No 9 at the World Cup this summer,the Leeds man wasputting Watkins, who spurned a one-on-one, in his shadow.Karl Darlow produced a magnificent point-blank save from Amadou Onana and reacted to remove the danger to ensure Leeds were ahead at the break, which came with a smattering of Villa boos.Villa made the minimum adjustments and came back out with greater purpose and energy to increase the tempo. It did not have the desired effect immediately, forcing Emery to seek changes from the bench, sending on Ross Barkley and Jadon Sancho to revive Villa.View image in fullscreenTammy Abraham scores late on for Aston Villa to deny the visitors.Photograph: Ian Walton/ReutersLeeds backed off, giving Villa as much time and possession as they liked. It was understandable for a team who have won once away all season but it made the outcome inevitable. Sancho was dangerous down the right against a tiring defence, paying the price for their earlier exertions, but Villa still lacked quality in the key moments.The vociferous home support felt it had arrived when Emi Buendía smashed a shot against the post and Watkins tapped in the rebound but he was offside. Villa were in charge and Leeds in a vice but they almost found a second when Lukas Nmecha, within a minute of coming on, met a Bogle cross with a diving header, only for Martínez to save.The deserved leveller came from a rare corner that found its target as Ezri Konsa knocked it down to Abraham, who stabbed home, to provide his own personal reminder to Thomas Tuchel. There was only one potential winner at that stage but Leeds clung on for a point that felt more valuable to them than Villa.Daniel Farke said: “It’s crazy that you travel away as a newly promoted side here from one of the title contenders, one of the best teams in this country and also in Europe, and you are slightly disappointed with just one point.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueAston VillaLeeds Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The minnows kept themselves in this contest for far longer than 9.58 seconds, testing the second-tier side for just under an hour, before eventually the home side’s superiority told.Given they are paid only their travel expenses, while their opponents are chasing promotion to the top tier, that was an admirable effort from the lowest-ranked side in the Women’s FA Cup fifth round. They were powerless, though, to stop Birmingham charging into the quarter-finals with a hat-trick from Océane Hurtré.Selfies and juggling day jobs: Chatham Town land ‘amazing’ Women’s FA Cup tieRead moreThe hosts opened the floodgates in the later stages of a game they would have had wrapped up before half-time had it not been for an inspired performance from the Chatham goalkeeper, Simone Eligon, who represents Trinidad and Tobago. Boanas said afterwards that she was “an excellent keeper and probably deserves to be playing at a higher level”.She saved superbly from Hurtré and Lee Geum-min in the first half, before Hurtré’s cross-cum-shot opened the scoring. Eligon expertly tipped Veatriki Sarri’s strike on to the bar when the score was 2-0, before the hosts’ superiority became irresistible.The final score demonstrated the gulf in athleticism and fitness levels in the women’s pyramid and was not far off the standard set by the second-tier leaders, Charlton, in their 10-0 victory over fourth-tier Swindon in the fourth round. This competition is still waiting for its first shock since the top women’s sides turned professional. But Chatham’s Elle Jeffkins, who scored four times in their Cup run, said: “We’re proud to get this far, regardless of the score. We gave them a test in the first half. We came here today to enjoy it, regardless of the result, and we’re just proud.”Chatham will take away £127,000 in prize money for their run, which began in the third qualifying round at Beaconsfield and included eliminating two higher-league sides, AFC Wimbledon and Exeter, away from home. Boanas said: “They all did their best. They [Birmingham] are training every day and it was incredible to see the power and the pace. We couldn’t cope with that pace and power. I’ve said to them: ‘Hold your heads up high, no one can take away from you what you’ve done.’ It’s a special club and I’m glad we’ve been able to repay the chair to a point.”View image in fullscreenVeatriki Sarri scores Birmingham’s second goal with the Chatham keeper, Simone Eligon, is left on the ground.Photograph: Harriet Massey/The FA/Getty ImagesThis was their fourth away trip of their run and their first appearance in the fifth round. Their travelling supporters appeared to make up most of the crowd, outnumbering and outsinging the hosts. The club thought they could have brought several hundred more than the approximately 200 fans who did travel, if the game had not clashed with a home fixture for the men’s side. The Birmingham forward Lucy Quinn said: “We knew it was going to be difficult for us initially. When I heard their fans I was buzzing, that’s what you want to see, travelling fans, and it was a great atmosphere.”Chatham travelled to the Midlands on Saturday morning and enjoyed lunch together as a squad in Solihull, where Boanas showed the team a motivational montage of all 17 of the goals in their five victories to reach this stage.Birmingham’s head coach, Amy Merricks, is from Kent and began her coaching career at Gillingham, who rebranded as Chatham in 2023, so has something of a soft spot for the club. That certainly did not stop her side being ruthless in their pursuit of goals.Hurtré completed a classy treble while Sarri, Lee and Birmingham’s record signing, Wilma Leidhammar, were all on the scoresheet, with the lively substitute Batcheba Louis adding two goals. Quinn, who provided two assists, said: “We like to create and be fluid. It took a while for us to find that quality in the final third and then we did and it was really pleasing to see that training ground work come off.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's FA CupBirmingham City WomenWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

After four years of thinking about this Olympics, and 11 days of competing in this Olympics, there is no doubt about how Bruce Mouat and his three teammates will weigh their achievement here after they were beaten by Canada 9-6 in the final. It was an excruciatingly tense game, which twisted and turned on its way to the very final stone of the 10th end. And when it was over, two of the British players were left in tears. Great Britain’s fourth medal of these Olympics was more bitter than sweet.“I’m heartbroken,” said Grant Hardie. “We lost that final four years ago. It took us a long time to get over it and find the motivation to go again and we found it and we were so hungry to go and deliver this time, and unfortunately it just didn’t quite happen.” His cousin Hammy McMillan felt the same way. “It took me four years to get over the first silver,” he said, “so it will probably take a lot longer this time.”Winter Olympics 2026: Canada curlers beat GB to gold, bobsleigh, ice hockey and more – liveRead moreView image in fullscreenThe Canada team show their delight after the match.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThey were the better team for much of the match, but then they were the better team for much of the last four years, too. In that time they won two world championships, two European championships, and four grand slam events. Even the Canadians, led by Brad Jacobs, describe them as “the best team in the world”. Jacobs would. He and Mouat have played each other in 14 games now, and this was only the second time that Jacobs has ever won.Milano Cortina Winter Olympics 2026 day 15 – in picturesRead moreMouat, who many reckon the best shotmaker in the game, has now played in four Olympic medal matches across the mixed doubles and men’s events at two Games, and lost every one of them. “I’m trying to remind myself that I would have been extremely proud of this when I was five, six, seven years old, when all I wanted was to be an Olympian,” Mouat said. “That’s what I’m going to try and just keep on telling myself.”Mouat will carry on to the next Olympics in France. “100%” he said. “I love the sport, I love my teammates. And I’m not done yet.” But he isn’t sure whether his three friends – Bobby Lammie the third – will be with him. “I would love to play with the guys again. We’ve not actually had that conversation as four individuals, so we would need to go and have that discussion. I know personally that I want to continue and we’ll go from there.”Hardie spoke about wanting to retire after the last Olympic final, when they were beaten by Sweden. “The pain from four years ago was that much, we thought: ‘Let’s go and give it another go,’” Hardie said. “We wanted to win it for each other. We gave ourselves a chance, too, there was so much good work to redeem ourselves.”View image in fullscreenThe sides show contrasting emotions on the podium.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe British had the better start and were leading after the second end. But Jacobs is a gnarly competitor and he and his team worked their way into a 4-3 lead at halfway.By then, the crowd in the Cortina Ice Arena had fallen breathless, even the bands of mad keen Scottish curling fans who had flown over especially were too nervous to talk, except in the odd moments when their excitement at the shot just played compelled them to break out one or another of the chants they had written for the team, or else McMillan’s cousin struck up Loch Lomond on his bagpipes from his seat in the stadium eyrie.They sang loud after the sixth end, when Mouat put Great Britain back in front with a superb double take-out. But the decisive moment came in the ninth end. Canada had the hammer and Mouat’s team seemed to get stuck in two minds about how to play it.View image in fullscreenBritain’s skip Bruce Mouat (centre) will carry on to the next Olympics in France, he said “I love the sport, I love my teammates. And I’m not done yet.”Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“We were in the exact same spot in the semi-final and we said: ‘Look guys, same again,’” said Hardie. They tried to force a blank end, which would have put them one shot up with the hammer in the 10th. “We didn’t want to play it too aggressively. And unfortunately we missed four or five shots in a row, and after eight brilliant ends that flipped control of the game.”The Canadians managed to pick up three and all of a sudden they were sitting on an 8-6 lead. In such a tight game, it was too much for Mouat to claw back, even with the hammer in the 10th end. You can only you hope that one day they will look back on all they have achieved together and think very differently about it to the way they do now.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsTeam GBCurlingnewsShareReuse this content"

They could read state news and use a local navigation service.What they couldn’t do was check international headlines about thousands of people being killed by government forces during one of the bloodiest weeks in recent Iranian history. Nor, for the most part, could they get evidence out of Iran to the outside world – no pictures, no videos, no testimony of military vehicles being driven into protesters or family members being dragged from their homes and shot.What Iran has, a splinternet, is becoming reality for many millions of people. It is likely to get far worse.More than half of Russia’s regions are able to access only a limited, government-approved version of theinternetthrough their mobile phones. The “great firewall of China” blocks most of the global internet, including sites such as Google and the Guardian. The Myanmar junta hasexperimentedwith targeted internet shutdowns and so recently have authorities in Afghanistan andPakistan.For nearly two decades, the US backed a global effort to make it extremely difficult for governments to divide up the internet in this way. It hinged on funding tools built by groups worldwide to circumvent censorship. These made it very costly and very hard to shut down the internet entirely, and they ensured that governments that did seek to cut off their people often had to isolate themselves and their financial institutions as well.Like many US soft-power initiatives, the programme was imperfect, morally complex and at times at odds with the policies of other governments. Yet it is one foundation of what the internet is: a global commons. Today’s online world is dominated by large tech platforms and awash with illegal content and misinformation. But it is still a structure in which facts, ideas and information accessible from London are largely accessible from Delhi, Johannesburg and São Paulo as well.That could change rapidly. On the one hand is the matter of US funding, now cut or apparentlyredirectedtowards a Trumpian, politicised effort to undermine global attempts to regulate US big-tech platforms.On the other is the mounting export of censorship technologies, which are constantly improving and increasingly marketed overseas. These includedevicessold by companies in China that give their customers – governments in Pakistan, Myanmar and Ethiopia among others – extremely fine-tuned control over what comes in and out of a country. It is believed that similar technologies are the foundation of Iran’s current shutdown.US funding for global internet freedom ‘effectively gutted’Read moreCensorship technologies are growing more powerful at the same time as programmes designed to stymie them have been decimated.To those who work on the problem, the stakes are high. “When governments want to not be scrutinised for how many people they’re killing in their streets, they’ll shut the internet down,” said a former US official.It is not easy to build a splinternet. The internet is, by design, a decentralised and deeply inter-dependent network. But Iran’s recent example indicates that it is becoming far more plausible. Russia has beenattemptingto create a similar cut-off internet for some years, and other authoritarian regimes appear to share the ambition. It will become cheaper and easier to achieve.Governments worldwide, including in Europe, arepromotingnotions of sovereign data, sovereign AI and, in some cases, sovereign internet. Accompanying this is an ambition to nationalise infrastructure, for example to keep UK citizens’ health records stored in UK data centres. This is an understandable goal, given the increasingly authoritarian bent of US tech platforms that are the custodians of much of the world’s data.But if fascist or authoritarian regimes ascend, such an approach risks replacing one set of despots with another. Iran’s ability to cut off its internet was prefigured by a years-long push to nationalise its underlying infrastructure. Shutdowns such as Iran’s become far easier when a country’s data is entirely accessible to its domestic authorities.Those fighting for digital freedoms in harsh environments – in Iran and beyond – are approaching Europe, hoping the EU might pick up some of what the US has dropped and fund anticensorship technologies.It is doubtful that Europe has the money or the willpower to do much, given the other responsibilities it must shoulder. Next to defence, it seems a marginal concern. But the information environment as we know it – the ground of shared fact that allowed this piece to be written and you to read it – is at stake.Explore more on these topicsCensorshipInternetFreedom of speechIranRussiaChinaanalysisShareReuse this content"

Congress must act now | Bernie SandersRead moreKhanna and Sanders declined to specify which tech executives they met with during the senator’s visit to California, but the congressman said it was “senior leaders” at the “most prominent tech companies”.“I think it was important for both Senator Sanders to hear from tech leaders and tech leaders to hear from Senator Sanders, who represents and understands the concerns of so many working-class Americans,” Khanna said in an interview after the event.During his remarks, Sanders reissued hiscall for a moratoriumon the expansion of AI data centers to “slow down the revolution and protect workers” while policymakers catch up.Khannadoes not wanta moratorium, but has instead pushed to “steer” AI, advocating for the US to adopt a “Singapore model” for data center growth, with an emphasis on renewable energy and water efficiency. In his remarks before an auditorium of mostly students, Khanna outlined seven principles to guard against “oligarchic capture and dominance” of wealth generated by AI innovation.“We must ask not what America can do for Silicon Valley, but what Silicon Valley must do for America,” said the congressman, who is eyed as considering a 2028 presidential bid.The event capped a days-long visit to California, a state he won in the 2020 presidential primary and where he returned to rally thousands during his Fight Oligarchy tour last year. In Los Angeles on Wednesday, Sanders delivered ascathing denunciation of the “greed” of the billionaire class. There he helped formally launch a campaign for a ballot initiative that would impose a one-time 5% tax on residents worth more than $1bn – a proposal that has already prompted some ultra-wealthy tech leaders to flee, or threaten to do so.At Stanford, Sanders focused his remarks on his concerns over how AI would impact not only the labor force but personal wellbeing and people’s ability to interact with one another. He mentioned that a restaurant in DC offered a Valentine’s Day special for people and their “AI buddies”, which drew laughs from the students.It may seem funny, Sanders said, “but the truth is that a lot of people are becoming dependent upon AI for their emotional support. What is the long-term impact of that? What is the long-term impact if we lose work as an important part of our lives? What do we do with our lives?”Sanders read statements from industry leaders who have predicted widespread automation, and cited projections that AI and robotics could eliminate tens of millions of jobs in the coming decade – from truck drivers to fast‑food workers and many white‑collar roles.Polling has found Americans are deeply concerned, as federal regulators and states debate how to impose guardrails on the nascent but fast-developing technology. A2025 Pew surveyfound that 64% of the public thinks AI “will lead to fewer jobs over the next 20 years”. Just 17% of Americans say “AI will have a very or somewhat positive impact on the United States” over the same period.The tech CEOs leading the AI race have argued that AI will drive productivity, innovation and new kinds of employment as technological advancements have always done. But critics, like Sanders, say the “unprecedented” speed and scale of the changes threaten to enrich the “multibillionaires” while deepening inequality and leaving policymakers and the public ill-equipped to mount a response in time.Sander urged his colleagues in Washington – and the public – to begin a serious public debate about the future of work as AI disrupts the economy, democracy and people’s emotional lives.“AI and robotics are neither good nor bad,” he said. “The question is: will a handful of billionaires benefit from it, or will the general public benefit?”Explore more on these topicsUS newsBernie SandersAI (artificial intelligence)DemocratsUS politicsComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

Finding out any more would require signing a non-disclosure agreement.More than a dozen of her neighbors received the same knock. Searching public records for answers, they discovered thata new customerhad applied for a 2.2 gigawatt project from the local power plant, nearly double its annual generation capacity.The unknown company was building a datacenter.“You don’t have enough to buy me out. I’m not for sale. Leave me alone, I’m satisfied,” Huddleston, 82, later told the men.As tech companies race to build the massive datacenters needed to power artificial intelligence across the US and the world, bids like the one for Huddleston’s land are appearing on rural doorsteps nationwide. Globally, 40,000 acres of powered land – real estate prepped for datacenter development – areprojectedto be needed for new projects over the next five years, double the amount currently in use.Yet despite sums that often dwarf the land’s recent value, farmers are increasingly shutting the door. At least five of Huddleston’s neighbors gave similar categorical rejections, including one who was told he could name any price.In Pennsylvania, a farmerrejected$15m in January for land he’d worked for 50 years. A Wisconsin farmerturneddown $80m the same month. Other landowners have declinedoffersexceeding $120,000 per acre – prices unimaginable just a few years ago.The rebuffs are a jarring reminder of AI’s physical bounds, and limits of the dollars behind the technology.The new Gold RushFour generations of the Huddleston family have watched the world change from the same fields.Ida’s grandfather was growing tobacco when the civil war erupted. Her father ploughed wheat through the first world war and the long attrition of the Great Depression. She and her five siblings grew up on beans, broccoli and potatoes pulled from soil once seared by dust bowl winds. No one in her family went to college – but by age 10, her children could already herd cattle across the same ground as their forebears.View image in fullscreenIda Huddleston (left) and her daughter Delsia Bare.Photograph: Janet Garrison“My whole entire life is nothing but the land. It’s provided me with anything and everything that I’ve needed for 82 years,” she says, speaking from the cabin her late husband built using local wood and rocks many decades ago.Today, where residents see meandering creeks and open pastures, Silicon Valley executives see weak zoning protections, cheap power and abundant water.Developers keep knocking because there are billions to be made. In northern Virginia last November, an investorpaid$615m for less than 100 acres – property thesellerhad bought for just $57m four years prior. Days later, Amazonspent$700m on nearby farmland that had sold for a fraction of that price the year before. In Georgia, a local developerflippedland to Amazon for $270m after paying $4m for it 12 months earlier. For the middlemen scouting these deals, potential returns exceed 1,000%.‘Name your price’About 20 Mason county residents havereportedlybeen offered deals, with the datacenter projectestimatedto cover 2,000 acres.After Dr Timothy Grosser, 75, rejected an $8m offer for his 250-acre farm – 3,500% more than he’d paid nearly four decades earlier – the developers came back with a new proposition: “Name your price.”His answer: “There is none.”Grosser lives, hunts and raises cattle on his land. Each Christmas, his family eats a turkey his grandson catches there. Alongside Huddleston and himself, Grosser estimates four landowners have refused to sell.“All they’ve done all their life is farm grain, cattle, tobacco,” Grosser says. “To them, same as me, the money’s not worth giving up your lifestyle.”For Huddleston’s daughter, Delsia Bare, 56, the connection runs deeper than skill sets. She remembers hoeing weeds from tobacco fields alongside her mother and grandmother, putting up hay through Kentucky summers. “There’s a bond with the land,” she says. “There’s no way to undo it. That’s family, that’s history.”Beyond personal attachment, some farmers worry about broader consequences. Thenumberof US farms has dropped more than 70% since 1935. Datacenters can strainpower grids,drain local water supplies, contaminate soil and fragment wildlife habitat.Bare puts it more bluntly: “You’re not going to grow a loaf of bread off of a datacenter.”Not everyone is holding out; some Mason county farmers have agreed to sell if the project proceeds. “You can’t blame them,” Grosser acknowledges. “Giving them 10 million bucks for a farm?”Those who refuse to sell say the utility company has warned it may invoke eminent domain – the government power to seize private property for public use. The threat isn’t empty:Dominion Energyused it against a Virginia farmer last April.‘Sometimes-self-sacrificial stewardship’The resistance reflects something economists struggle to quantify: the cultural weight of land stewardship. In his book Love for the Land, author Brooks Lamb describes how family farmers’ “sometimes-self-sacrificial stewardship” can lead to choices that defy financial logic, like refusing to consolidate into industrial operations.“When told to ‘get big or get out’, these farmers choose neither,” he writes.View image in fullscreenThe Huddleston farm, in Mason county, Kentucky.Photograph: Janet GarrisonMaintaining the farm is viewed as a “birthright”, by many, says Mary Hendrickson, a professor of rural sociology at the University of Missouri. The responsibility to previous generations runs deep, sometimes dangerously so. During the 1980s’ farm crisis, when heavily indebted farmers faced bankruptcy and land loss,more than900 male farmers in the midwest committed suicide.“They’re somewhat irreversible,” Hendrickson says. “If you give the land over to them, it destroys what that land could be for agriculture.”‘Keeping our people here’Local officials in Mason county insist the datacenter would sustain future generations by bringing much-needed tax revenue and jobs, an argument being made in town halls across the country.Mason’s population has shrunk by around 10% since 1980, largely due to the loss of manufacturing. Developerssaythe datacenter project would bring 1,000 construction jobs, although it may only create 50 full-time operational jobs.In places like Loudoun county, Virginia – home to “Data Center Alley”, where about afifthof the world’s internet traffic goes through – datacenter tax revenue nearlyequalsthe county’s entire operating budget.“We can continue to shrink – losing population, losing jobs and watching our young people leave for opportunities elsewhere – or we can chart a new course,” Tyler McHugh, Mason county’s industrial development director, said at a public hearing in December. “It’s about keeping our people here.”What money can’t buyAs they offer multimillion-dollar deals, datacenter developers are not stealing Mason county land, yet some farmers feel a spiritual dispossession nonetheless.A few months before the knock on her door last May, Delsia Bare lost most of her vision. Now she relies on sound to connect with the land: singing birds, the running creek. She fears a datacenter’s hum will drown out those connections, pushing the farm from physical reality into memory.For now, she returns to what her family has relied on for generations. “The land, the land, the land,” as her mother puts it.As AI promises to transcend corporeal fallibility, these standoffs reveal its very physical constraints – and Wall Street’s miscalculation of what some people value most. In the rolling hills of Mason county and farmland across America, that gap is measured not in dollars but in something harder to price: identity.Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)FarmingnewsShareReuse this content"

They include an Asante gold mask that was taken by the British army when it destroyed the Asante empire’s capital, Kumasi, and is now in the Wallace Collection in London. Another object is the skull of the Tanzanian king Mangi Meli, which was taken to Germany after its colonial regime executed him in 1900.The Asante mask in Relooted.Illustration: NyamakopHundreds of thousands of culturally and spiritually significant items were looted from Africa during the 19th and 20th centuries, when European countries carved up the continent into colonies. A2018 reportcommissioned by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, estimated that more than 90% of Africa’s material cultural heritage was held outside the continent.In this South African-made game the job is to liberate African artefacts from Western museumsBerlin’s Ethnologisches Museum and Cambridge University are among the institutions to havereturned Benin bronzes to Nigeria, for example. Others, including the British Museum, have resisted calls to return bronzes and other looted objects.Ben Myres, chief executive ofNyamakop, which developed Relooted, said: “Real-life repatriation is enormously complicated and it’s been ongoing for decades, in some cases even a century or more … We’re giving people this hopeful, utopian feeling … of what it’s going to feel like when all these artefacts finally come home.”View image in fullscreenThe Ngadji drum, which is currently in the British Museum.Illustration: NyamakopMyres started creating the game in 2018 after his mother returned from the British Museum outraged at seeing the Nereid Monument, a Lycian tomb from Turkey.

What next?Steven GreenhouseThe US supreme court ruled against the president. Let’s hope the court removes its pro-Trump glasses on other issues and stands up for the rule of lawSat 21 Feb 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 21 Feb 2026 13.44 ESTShareThere’s no denying that the US supreme court’s long-awaitedruling that overturnedDonald Trump’s global tariffs is important, and if the ruling turns out to be a harbinger that the court is ready to abandon its startling sycophancy toward the US president, it could prove hugely important. The ruling this Friday is thefirst time during Trump’s second termthat the justices have struck down one of his policies. Not only that, the policy they struck down is Trump’s signature economic policy – he has used tariffs to bash, lord over and terrorize dozens of other countries and make himself the King of the Economic Jungle.In the court’s main opinion,joined bythree conservative justices and three liberals, chief justice John Roberts used some sharp language to slap down Trump’s tariffs, writing that the constitution specifically gives Congress, not the president, the power to impose taxes and tariffs. (Roberts notedthat tariffs are indeed taxes.)Roberts added that Trump had misinterpreted the law he invoked to impose tariffs against more than 80 countries, noting that the law – the International Emergency Emergency Powers Act –doesn’t mentionthe word tariffs even once as it lays out numerous ways presidents can regulate imports. Roberts added that if Congress had wanted to give presidents the power to impose tariffs under that law, it would have specifically said so.In the tariffs case,Learning Resources Inc v Trump,Roberts seemed appalled at the extraordinary powers Trump had seized to impose whatever tariffs he wanted at any amount he wanted against any country he wanted. Roberts wrote that “the President asserts the extraordinary power to unilaterally impose tariffs of unlimited amount, duration, and scope” and that under the administration’s reading of the law, “the President is unconstrained by the significant procedural limitations in other tariff statutes and free to issue a dizzying array of modifications at will.”Over the past year, the court’s six-person conservative supermajority has ruled in Trump’s favor in aremarkably high percentage of shadow docket cases– letting Trumpgut the Department of Education, letting Icestop people based on their ethnicity, letting Trumprefuse to spend appropriated USAID funds, letting the Pentagondischarge transgender service members.After all that water-carrying for Trump, it’s encouraging to see the court stand up to him and trumpet in the tariff case that Trump was interpreting laws in implausible, illogical ways in order to use his executive powers to the max. It would be good, for instance, if the court similarly rules that Trump is interpreting the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 in implausible, illogical ways when heseeks to deport Venezuelan immigrantswithout due process, even though that act applies only when the US isfacing an armed, organized attack.Soon after the tariff ruling was issued, Trump quickly slandered and savaged the justices who had ruled against him. “They’re just beingfools and lapdogs” for political opponents, including “the radical left Democrats”, he said. “They’re very unpatriotic and disloyal to our constitution. It’s my opinion that the court has been swayed by foreign interests.”Trump also said the justices who ruled against him were a “disgrace to our nation” and that he was “ashamed of” them “not having the courage to do what’s right for our country”. Trump beat up mercilessly on the six justices who ruled against him, including conservatives Roberts, Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch, even those three hadruled for Trump about 80%of the time in shadow docket cases, many of them highly controversial and contentious.After Trump insulted the justices and whipped up Maga loyalists against them, let’s hope the justices will be more motivated to put their Trump sycophancy behind him and be more emboldened to rule against him. When will the justices admit to themselves that they shouldn’t be so quick to defer to Trump and shouldn’t rush to give him more power under the “unitary executive theory”, considering that he is so autocratic and thuggish and often pays scant heed to the law and the truth.It’s high time that the high court realize that Trump’s elevator doesn’t go all the way to the top. Remember last December when he wrote that if the supreme court ruled against him in the tariffs case, that would be “the biggest threat in history” to US national security. In October, he said something even more ludicrous: that if the tariff ruling went against him, it “would literally destroy the United States of America.” (When I woke up this morning. the US was still standing,)The importance of the tariffs case will turn in part on which of two roads theUS supreme courtwill take: a limited, pro-corporate route or a broader, more robust course defending the constitution against the most authoritarian president in history.Many US supreme court watchers predict that the high court will rule against Trump in only two important cases this year – cases in which much of Corporate America has parted ways with the president. Roberts and the other conservative justices don’t like to part ways with Corporate America. Those two cases are the tariffs case and the case in which Trump sought to fire Federal Reserve member Lisa Cook, without giving her any due process, after a Trump ally alleged that Cookmade false statements on a mortgage application. She denied any wrongdoing.Corporate America detests Trump’s tariffs, convinced that they muck up trade relations and undermine economic growth. Corporate America also opposes Trump’s heavy-handed effort to eliminate the Federal Reserve’s independence and transform it into a group of Trumpian puppets who will, per Trump’s wishes, slash interest rates, which could cause inflation to spike in a few years, very possibly after Trump leaves office. At a minimum, let’s hope the court rules for Cook over Trump, but doesn’t stop there.Let’s hope the court removes its pro-Trump glasses and starts to see how he so often holds the truth and the law (and the justices) in contempt. We all need to stand up and defend the US constitution. And the US supreme court needs to do that more than anyone else.Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author, focusing on labour and the workplace, as well as economic and legal issuesExplore more on these topicsTrump tariffsOpinionUS supreme courtDonald TrumpTariffsUS CongressJohn RobertsAmy Coney BarrettcommentShareReuse this content"

Stephen Colbert takes his interview with a rising Democratic politician to YouTubeinstead of his own late-night show. The CBS Evening News anchorpresents a misleading versionof the network’s own exclusive reporting on Ice arrests. And a news producer writes a farewell note to her CBS News colleaguesblaming the loss of editorial independence.If you connect the dots, the picture of what’s happening at CBS becomes all too clear. That picture comes into even sharper focus once you recall an underlying factor: the network’s parent company istrying to get a big commercial deal doneand needs the help of the Trump administration to bring it over the finish line.“Media capture” is the name that University of Pennsylvania scholar Victor Pickard gives to what we’re seeing unfold before our eyes.What’s happening at CBS and elsewhere “isn’t a singular breakdown”, Pickardwritesin a new analysis.It’s a whole cascade of layers – media ownership, control and market structure – that “endanger our information and communication systems, our First Amendment freedoms, and our democracy”.In theCBSsituation, the immediate motivation is easy to understand. The network’s parent company, Paramount Skydance, wants to buy Warner Brothers Discovery, which also owns CNN – one of Donald Trump’s favorite punching bags and a news organization he would love to see take the same rightward turn as CBS.Paramount Skydance is run by David Ellison, son of Larry Ellison, the Trump pal and one of the richest people on earth. Their effort is somewhat against the odds, since Warner Brothers Discovery’s boardfavors a competing offerfrom Netflix.But the Ellisons haven’t given up, and they have some powerful friends in their corner, since any deal may need FCC approval. The Trump-appointed chairperson of the FCC, Brendan Carr, has shown himself to be a political animal, not the impartial and public-spirited leader that this crucial role calls for.So much of what’s happened at CBS – the back-of-the-hand treatment of Colbert and the rightward drift of the news division – are ways of signalling that the Ellisons are more than willing to serve Trump’s interests.If Paramount Skydance does end up controlling CNN, Cooper – one of the cable network’s most prominent faces – may find that trouble is following him. (Publicly, Cooper, who has had an unusual arrangement working for both CNN and 60 Minutes, says he wants to spend more time with his children; but he’s alsoreportedlyunhappy with the direction of the show under CBS News editor Bari Weiss, who reports directly to David Ellison.)As for Colbert, he has made no secret of where he stands, not just this last week when his interview with a Democratic Texas lawmaker ran into internal network roadblocks.Months ago, after CBS settled a frivolous lawsuit brought by Trump last year, Colbert – on air – labeled the settlement a “big, fat bribe”. Soon after, the network decidednot to offer him another contract.It’s all a vivid example of a worrisome problem in American media. As media companies become more consolidated, and ever more in the hands of the richest Americans, priorities change radically. Editorial independence weakens; self-censorship grows.The dominoes of capitulation seem to tumble voluntarily.“The government doesn’t have to formally censor anyone,”wroteParker Molloy on her newsletter, The Present Age. “It just has to make enough threats that corporations start censoring themselves.”No surprise then that, in presentingCBS News researchabout immigrants arrested by ICE, the network’s evening news anchor, Tony Dokoupil, earlier this month inverted the original reporting to emphasize the crimes – not that so few of the crimes are violent. After all, that would have been contrary to how Trump has portrayed ICE-arrested immigrants as rapists and murderers. (DUIs, or driving under the influence, the reporting showed, far outpaced homicides and sexual assaults.)And no surprise that, in leaving the network, journalist Alicia Hastey lamented that stories increasingly are “evaluated not just on their journalistic merits but on whether they conform to a shifting set of ideological expectations”.I’ve heard fascism described as the dangerous combination of state power and corporate power. And here we are.With a politicized FCC, a self-interested president surrounded by soulless lackeys, and corporate media bosses trying to protect commercial interests, we’re far down that road.To pull it back means serious policy reform. For starters, that would mean strict limits on media consolidation, support for independent local journalism, and a truly nonpartisan FCC.At the moment that’s highly unlikely, since such reform must be driven by those who understand that journalism is meant to serve the public – not to help the rich and powerful buy their next yachts.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsCBSOpinionAnderson CooperStephen ColbertUS television industryWarner BrosNetflixMergers and acquisitionscommentShareReuse this content"

It’s not just the sickening subservience shown to Vladimir Putin, an indicted war criminal and mass killer. It’s not only the victim-blaming and bullying of Kyiv into making concessions. It’s not even Donald Trump’s crass attempts tomonetise the warand milk the misery of millions forNobel glory, while undercutting Nato allies and trampling sovereign rights.What really shocks, and hurts, is the sheer bad faith shown by a country that Europeans always counted a friend. As the 18th-century English gothic novelist Ann Radcliffe noted, “few circumstances are more afflicting than a discovery of perfidy in those whom we have trusted”. To echo Trump’s dark warning after he was rebuffed over Greenland:Europe will remember.As the full-scale war Putin launched in 2022 stumbles into its fifth bloody year this Tuesday, Europe, like Russia, is in deep trouble. Yet so too is the US, though Trump and his mouthy muppets, Marco Rubio and JD Vance, don’t realise it yet. Most Europeansnow regardtheir foremost partner as unreliable, even a foe. US global influence and leadership is fading fast, to gleeful China’s huge advantage. Everywhere, autocrats rejoice, as do Europe’s advancing far-right parties.“The question of how this war is going to end is actually an existential question for Europe,” said Wolfgang Ischinger, chair of this month’s Munich Security Conference. “It will determine – in more ways than one – the future of this continent.” But the war is proving definitive, too, for Trump and his blinkered, bigoted Maga ideologues. Glossing over Russian depredations (and the illegal Venezuela coup), Rubio chose in Munich to target globalisation, “climate cults” and multiculturalism. The US secretary of state urged a return to ultranationalism, protectionism, closed borders andChristian culture. “Yesterday is over,” he declared.Little Marco (as Trump calls him) is confused. Trumpism is all about recreating yesterday, about fantasies of “the good old days”. Putin suffers similar delusions. The war is part of his revanchist project to make Russia great again, to rebuild the Soviet sphere. Likewise, Xi Jinping, China’s leader, isattemptinghis own great leap backwards, by accumulating dictatorial powers to an extent unseen since Mao Zedong.The open-minded, freedom-loving rainbow Europe of democracy and the rule of law is a living rebuke to these lumbering Frankenstein’s retro-monsters and their hard-right emulators. They revile and fear it. LikeUkraine, it stands in their way.10:37Does Trump really care about peace in Ukraine? - The LatestThe US betrayal of Ukraine, foreshadowing its broader treachery, did not start with Trump. Bill Clinton’s post-independence 1994 security assurances for Kyivprovedmeaningless. Barack Obama blinked when Putin seized Crimea in 2014. Joe Biden, haunted by cold war ghosts,reactedwith fatal overcaution to the 2022 invasion.What’s changed is that Trump’s betrayals are deliberate, and are happening now. Each dawn brings another day of infamy. Last year, Ukraine’s civilian casualties hit their highest annual levelsince the war beganas Putin expanded a war that Trump pledged to end in 24 hours. Direct US weapons supplies have been cut to almost zero. Trump’s risible “peace process”, overseen by a business crony and his simpering son-in-law,indulges Putin’s maximalist demandswhile excluding Europe.Trump’s 28-point “peace plan” – a lopsided roadmap to Russian victory – was swiftly discredited. Yet he is still insisting Kyiv surrender sovereign territory, setting a catastrophic precedent, and withholding security guarantees. He still aims to make a quick buck out of Ukraine’s mineral resources and postwar deals with Russia. He still habitually bullies Ukraine’s admirable president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy. And still he belittles European allies while courting Putin and authoritarians such as Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, Argentina’s Javier Milei and Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu.For shameless treachery, Trump has no modern equal. Yet the belief is growing that it cannot and will not continue. How much longer can willing dupes such as the Nato chief,Mark Rutte, prate about vital transatlantic ties when Trump is daily dissolving them in acid and vitriol? How dare Rubio lecture Europeans on Christian civilisation while he and other New World barbarians wink at Israeli atrocities in Gaza? Now they plan to attack Iran, again, and maybe Cuba, too. By what right?A war foretold: how the CIA and MI6 got hold of Putin’s Ukraine plans and why nobody believed themRead moreTrump’s perfidious tyranny, equally toxic at home and abroad, will only worsen the longer it’s tolerated. Despite all the obvious obstacles and difficulties, it’s imperative that Europeans, and the pre-midterms, anti-Trump American majority, begin to speak with one voice – and match words with actions. And where better to start than in Ukraine, the actual and symbolic frontline in the battle between liberal democracy and the Trump-Putin axis?Here’s what must be done: deploy troops from a European “coalition of the willing” to secure and defend Kyiv and other unoccupied cities; Russia cannot be allowed a veto. Enforce a no-fly exclusion zone, as I haverepeatedly urged. Surge defensive missiles and drones. Beach Russia’s shadow fleet. Step up covert “active measures”, including cyber and sabotage, to counter Kremlin hybrid warfare. Seize assets, expel spies, expose lies, change the narrative. Europe must demand an immediate ceasefire, followed by phased Russian withdrawals, and assume a lead role in any final settlement talks.If not, why not? For consider the alternatives: endless war, endless killing, or an unsustainable, unjust peace on Trump-Putin terms. Europe is on notice: the US cannot be trusted. The challenge is indeed existential. All that it stands for and holds dear is potentially at stake. No matter how it’s done, for the sake of Ukraine’s exhausted, undefeated people and their own future peace and security, Europeans (including Britain) must finally find the unity, courage and wherewithal to take the military, economic, diplomatic and moral offensive.Europe musttake the fightdirectly to Putin’s door. And tell Trump to get lost.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorExplore more on these topicsUkraineOpinionDonald TrumpVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyyUS foreign policyRussiaNatocommentShareReuse this content"

Suzy greeted me with the warmth of someone who had known me for years. She didn’t just offer advice; she guided and helped me understand how to build a career and a life in a country that can feel overwhelming even to those born into it.This summer Suzy finally managed to visit for lunch in Dandenong, at the food street in the Afghan bazaar. It felt symbolic that our long-awaited reunion would take place there, in a suburb that mirrors so many migrant journeys: once overlooked, now pulsing with life, colour and ambition.Racist rhetoric is warping the Liberal party’s moral compass. We are destined to fail unless we govern for all | Andrew McLachlanRead moreWe settled on the Day Light restaurant, run by an Afghan owner from the central highlands. The food arrived fragrant and generous – mantu (Afghan dumplings), shorwa (slow-cooked lamb stew with herbs and chickpeas), tender kebabs and warm naan. We laughed at the owner’s cheerful admission that he wasn’t quite sure whether the place was called Day Light or Delight. English synonyms had confused him. But it looked good, smelled good and tasted even better – and that, we all agreed, was what mattered.As we walked along the strip, weaving between Afghan groceries and Indian sweet shops, Suzy kept stopping in surprise. The last time she had visited Dandenong, nearly a decade ago, it had felt flat and tired – a place people passed through rather than arrived at.Now it’s alive. The streets hum with languages, families, commerce and possibility. No longer a forgotten town, it’s a living map of Australia’s changing face.She missed the Afghan cultural day in the local park – the timing didn’t work – but that festival captured something rare and precious. Melbourne’s southern suburbs, already among the most diverse in the country, were hosting a celebration organised by a vibrant Afghan community that has grown rapidly.The organisers had come up with an audacious idea: free camel rides. Children squealed, adults laughed nervously and politicians – helmets firmly in place – climbed onboard the towering animals. It was joyful, slightly chaotic and deeply symbolic.The camels were not a gimmick. They were a reminder.double quotation markIt’s heartbreaking to see Afghans and 13 other nationalities flattened into a single, dangerous caricatureIn the late 19th century, Afghan cameleers – many from what is nowAfghanistanand neighbouring regions – played a crucial role in opening up Australia’s interior. Between 2,000 and 3,000 cameleers helped transport supplies, sustain remote communities and, most notably, build the overland telegraph line that connected Australia to the rest of the world. Without them, the nation’s economic and technological development would have looked very different.That day in the park, the past and present folded into each other.The crowd was electric with youthful energy. Women in vivid dresses moved freely, laughing, filming, savouring the simple fact of public celebration. Many had fled the Taliban – a regime that strips women of education, work and autonomy. Here, they stood unafraid. Australian flags fluttered along the festival boundaries: we belong.What struck me most was the gratitude layered with determination. This is not a community withdrawing into itself but one building outwards – forming cricket clubs, opening small and medium-sized businesses, volunteering at schools, mosques and neighbourhood centres.When the news leaked of a proposedimmigration plandrafted under the previous Liberal party leader Sussan Ley, which seemed to “blacklist” countries deemed misaligned with Australian “values”, it landed with particular force, even if the party’s new leader, Angus Taylor, hastened to distance himself from it.It’s heartbreaking to see Afghans and 13 other nationalities flattened into a single, dangerous caricature. Afghanistan is not synonymous with the Taliban. It never has been. It is also the land of poets whose verses mocked extremism and celebrated beauty, and thinkers whose work speaks to a shared human longing for freedom and dignity. Afghan culture encompasses Sufi mystics, artists, musicians, feminists, farmers, engineers and cricket tragics. Like any society, it is plural, contradictory and alive.Australians from countries on the proposed blacklist work in places like hospitals and build small businesses, contributing as doctors, academics, tradies and community organisers.Interestingly, among many Afghan Australians I have spoken to, there had long been a quiet, sometimes surprising, softness toward theLiberal party, despite liking many of Labor’s policies. This is because when Kabul fell in August 2021, Australia under the Coalition government did not entirely walk away. About 4,000 Afghans were helped to evacuate. For those who escaped, that decision meant survival.Gratitude, however, does not cancel grief. Thousands remain stranded. Families are separated. Visas stay frozen in limbo. But, as one young Afghan Australian once told me: “When someone helps you escape death, you don’t forget it.”I saw him again this week, not far from the Day Light restaurant, at a mutual friend’s shop preparing for the Ramadan night market. Amid the lights and laughter, he looked deflated. How, he asked, could anyone propose painting entire nations as morally suspect? How could communities trying daily to integrate and contribute be reduced to a risk category?When it comes to immigration, the Liberal party is putting politics ahead of social cohesion – and logic | Abul RizviRead moreOur business-minded friend interrupted gently. Politicians, he shrugged, might spread fear for division and rule, but people-to-people bonds are harder to break.“My eight-year-old speaks in a stunning Aussie accent,” he said, laughing, before the topic of our conversation moved to citizenship applications.Most Afghan humanitarian visa holders arriving after the Taliban takeover, including all three of us, are eligible this year. There is pride in that. And hope.Australia’s strength has never come from purity tests or cultural fear. It has come from the beautiful human overlap – from cameleers and poets, from refugees and doctors, from misnamed restaurants serving mouth-watering food.Any politics that denies this diversity is not protecting Australia’s values. It is betraying them.Shadi Khan Saif is an editor, producer and journalist who has worked in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Germany and AustraliaExplore more on these topicsLiberal partyOpinionAustralian immigration and asylumAfghanistanAustralian politicsMigrationCoalitionMelbournecommentShareReuse this content"

It’s going about this the wrong way | Intifar ChowdhuryRead moreTheCoalitiondid a preference deal with One Nation at the last election and voted with One Nation in the Senate about 80% of the time under both Morrison and Dutton.So, the erosion of values has been creeping for a while but has been less overt than in the northern hemisphere, with good reason.When you fly over the United States, as I did many times in my years as a foreign correspondent there, you will see the lights of major population centres across the inland.This is Trump’s heartland. He took his initial ground in rural areas and the populated fringes of inland cities, many of which were negatively affected by open-world trade rules and immigration. In 2024, he extended that impact into the fringes of Democrat strongholds, even along the coasts.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThis was Scott Morrison’s election strategy in 2022, and Peter Dutton’s in 2025, and this is where the Taylor-Hume Liberals are still trying to go.But the flyover-state rhetoric that translates from America’s midwest and Appalachia to Queensland lands differently in our big, culturally rich and diverse coastal cities.Targeting voters drifting to One Nation, therefore, will further alienate urban seats, especially in the face ofPauline Hanson’s disgusting attacks on Muslim Australians.On the basis that the standard you walk past is the standard you accept, the first test will be whether the Liberals respond to her comments by preferencing One Nation last in forthcoming byelections – as John Howard did so many years ago.It will not be lost on voters in metropolitan Australia that one of Taylor’s first steps was to dog whistle on immigration just as Hanson was disgracefully pontificating that there is no such person as a “good Muslim”.To survive, Barry says the Liberal party must differentiate itself with bold policy and economic hope.But if Labor has minimal definitive policy framework to provide a fair, safe, happy, prosperous future for our kids, the Coalition is a vacuum.There is nothing bold or hopeful toinspire the younger voterswho are looking for it.One of Tim Wilson’s first pronouncements as shadow treasurer was to try to walk away from his previous support for an end to preferential taxation of capital gains on investment property, acknowledged by most reputable economists as a way to help younger voters join the home owning class.And with real wages declining for the first time in two years, Wilson suggested the Reserve Bank should pay less attention to its full employment mandate and more to inflation, effectively endorsing more interest rate rises and cost-of-living pressure.He was later reported as walking back those comments,but repeated: “They’re clearly not putting enough emphasis on inflation.”It’s enough to send a shudder through households struggling with mortgage repayments and other expenses.There is no credible policy on climate change and renewable energy, with the new opposition leader, Angus Taylor, saying definitively: “We are rejecting Labor’s net zero ideology.” (Reminder,this follows support from big coal and big miningfor the Coalition at the 2025 election.)There is nothing on housing supply, or empowering women (even inside their own party); nothing on government integrity and accountability; nothing on health and education and nothing on AI and technology.AsTom McIlroy wrotein these pages after Taylor’s appointment as Liberal leader: “Taylor flagged he won’t move quickly to announce new policies, falling back on motherhood statements and principles on key issues including tax reform and immigration.”Business as usual then?Charlotte Mortlock, the founder of Liberal women’s organisation Hilma’s Network, resigned from her leadership role there and from the Liberal party itself afterSussan Ley was dumpedas the party’s first female leader.She accused Liberals of being “algorithmed”.In other words, they are so influenced by social media that they’re “creating public policy for that virtual reality”. This is the “noise” that Barry also points to.It’s being fed by the Liberals own proxy, Advance. The conservative influence factory is flooding social media with anti-immigration content, for example, to amp up the resentment.We “mount significant nation-changing campaigns”, Advance’s executive director Matthew Sheahan told a conservative conference recently.It appears the Liberals are living in that echo chamber.But the young voters they need to find are not.Is Tim Wilson an ‘inflation nutter’? Why the new shadow treasurer’s RBA comments are making wavesRead moreWilson’s flippant dismissal of tax reform to alleviate pressure on housing supply is a case in point. So isTaylor’s apparent opposition to a universal early childhood education system.These are initiatives geared to intergenerational equity, and that is where the bold policy hope has to come from.The Coalition likes to talk a lot about Australian values, leaning to American-style anthem, flag and country vibes.I would suggest that our core value is fairness.For migrants who outperform in business, for women who can boost our economic productivity, for children who can use their education to take us forward, for young people who deserve a level playing field to participate in the economy.That means a “fair go” – for everyone.Zoe Daniel is a three-time ABC foreign correspondent and the former independent member for GoldsteinExplore more on these topicsAustralian politicsOpinionLiberal partyCoalitionAustralian economyAngus TaylorOne NationcommentShareReuse this content"

But though our faces anxiously turn to the sky, our hands are joined in a solidarity that rises above hungerSat 21 Feb 2026 07.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 21 Feb 2026 07.25 ESTShareEvery year, Ramadan comes as a sanctuary for the soul. For Muslims like me, it is a sacred pause in the chaos of life. But this year, as a woman displaced from the familiar streets of Gaza City to a rented room in Al-Zawayda, I am searching for a peace that feels like a ghost. The world calls this a “ceasefire”, yet from my window the silence feels heavy. We are holding our breath because the fear of death has not disappeared, it has just become unpredictable.I did not welcomeRamadanthis year with the golden lanterns that once adorned our balconies. I welcomed it to the roar of bulldozers clearing the bones of neighbouring houses and with the constant buzz of thezanana, the Israeli surveillance drones, overhead. Even as we stand in prayer, that metallic humming drowns out theadhan, the call to prayer, reminding us that we are still watched and that our “calm” rests at the mercy of a sudden strike.My heart remains in theruins of Gaza City. I mourn the vibrant life of Al-Zawiya market, the scent of its spices, and theal-Omari mosque, where our collective prayers once felt like an unbreakable fortress. Ramadan used to mean true warmth to me. I experienced it at my family home in Gaza, in the Rimal neighborhood, where the table brought us together, filled with laughter and peace. Sometimes I would break my fast with my family, sometimes with friends or neighbours, as if the month were teaching us that the heart had room for everyone.Today, we stand in cramped rooms, our ears tilted toward the sky. We pray for mercy and listen for the whistle of a missile that may decide our “truce” has expired. Displacement has turned every ritual into a mountain to climb. The cost of food and drink for the entire month of Ramadan used to be no more than 1,000 shekels, while today it is easily 3,500 shekels without even fully meeting basic needs.As I walk home from work just before sunset, I move through rubble and sand that fill the air and sting the eyes. The road I take is a winding path between collapsed buildings and deep craters. At that hour, my thoughts are simple: what can I prepare foriftar, when we break our fast, from so little? Ramadan evenings once meant anticipation – choosing where to break our fast, stepping into spaces filled with light and laughter. Now, I calculate portions of lentils and count what remains in the cupboard, trying to create something that still feels like home.Even through this grief and exhaustion, I see a defiant and beautiful hope. In Al-Zawayda, neighbours share their small portions of lentils or dates with dignity that rises above hunger. This solidarity is our sacred resistance. It is our way of declaring that even if our homes are destroyed, the human spirit within us will not be crushed. We light a single candle, not because it will keep the darkness away, but because the act of lighting it is itself a victory over despair.Young Muslims have created an inclusive Ramadan that works for everyone. Now that’s in danger | Nosheen IqbalRead moreRamadan for the children is the hardest part. They have learned the language of war, and can hear the difference between a shell and an explosion, even before they have learned the songs of Ramadan. When they ask “Will the bombing return tomorrow?” they are really asking if they have a future. Something we can’t answer – for them or ourselves. Yet when I see them hanging a torn decoration on the side of a tent, I understand something essential: inGaza, hope is not a feeling. It is a decision.Please understand, while you at home may hear that it is quiet here – with fewer stories in the news about usand afragile “ceasefire”reported – quiet is not peace. Real peace is the right to the ordinary. To walk to a market that still exists and hasn’t been turned to rubble, to pray in a mosque that has not been desecrated, to go home to a neighbourhood that hasn’t been flattened, to sleep without wondering whether silence is merely the prelude to another nightmare.This Ramadan in Gaza comes with a different spirit. As theadhansounds tonight, I feel a flicker of tranquility. Not because the world is just or we can see an end to our suffering, but because we are still here, weaving hope from threads of ruin. We fast, we pray and we remain – not out of habit, but as an act of reclaiming our souls from the wreckage.Majdoleen Abu Assi is a project coordinator and humanitarian practitioner based in Gaza, PalestineDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Colour theory? Yet more ways we’re supposed to live our livesFrancesca NewtonIn these times of social, political and even environmental instability, is it any wonder that we turn to influencers for instruction?Sat 21 Feb 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 21 Feb 2026 06.56 ESTShareAgroup of young women are about to try colour analysis for the first time. One says she suspects she’s not “supposed to wear gold”, and then holds up both hands swathed in gold rings and bracelets. The video cuts to the same woman with a strip of gold fabric laid across her chest. A sad trumpet sound plays before the strip is whipped off and replaced with a silver one. “See?” the analyst says. “Way better here.” The woman says: “Yeah”, but she sounds unhappy.Colour analysis is a method of picking out the shades that suit your skin tone. After its first life in the 1980s and 90s, “getting your colours done” found a new audience on TikTok in 2024 and has only become more popular since. This clip was one of many thrown up by my Instagram feed but it stuck with me, largely because it seemed so depressing in its portrayal of the trend as something to be endured rather than enjoyed. Directions on what you’re “supposed” or “not supposed” to wear, it intimated, should be followed even if it means sacrificing your own preferences.Some videos are more explicit, annotating photos of celebrities dressing “against their palette” withred crosses, or stating that “Wrong coloursdon’t whisper… they SCREAM”, as if by wearing a certain green you’re subjecting yourself or others to a form of torture.This doctrinal tone doesn’t just extend to what colours women should allow in their wardrobe. Social media platforms are full of messaging about the “right” hairstyle, neckline or skirt length. One trend sees women telling each other to “always remember” specific combinations of necklines and hairstyles, as though there were a singular formula for successful self-presentation and we will shortly have to sit an exam. Under the guise of “etiquette”, rules reach into the most trivial parts of life: howto sit, for example, or howto eata forkful of rice.Part of this must come down to the economics of engagement. To “influence” someone is to affect their actions, and using the imperative mood creates a sense of authority regardless of credentials (of which I suspect most aspiring rulemakers have none). Declamatory language attests to its own gravity, urgency and universality. It’s used because it presses you to listen.Still, I don’t think the demand is entirely confected. The thing in me that watches these videos – something in millions of us, judging by the engagement on these posts – does actuallydesiresome guidance on how to look, live, be. It wants to get ahead of life’s uncertainties by doing the things it’s told that smart, desirable women do – to comply with broadest-possible-appeal homogeneity if that also means approval and success.Few of us are consistently satisfied with our lives. Those few become fewer in periods of instability and living-standards decline. The rules on your feed promise a shortcut: act the right way or buy the right things and you will create a version of yourself so correct that this correctness forms a layer of insulation against the world’s problems. It’s no surprise that one of the most visible strains of rules-based content concerns “the grind”; even in the fashion and beauty posts, “elegance” often serves as an analogue for wealth.To an extent, all this is just a rehash of established advertising principles. Good marketing doesn’t make audiences want something: it convinces them they need it. But this time our status as rule followers is a part of the promotional package. We’re being sold belief systems and gurus rather than specific jumpers or pairs of jeans. And that, I think, speaks to a broader phenomenon: a desire not only for the outcomes but for rules themselves.Beyond Order by Jordan Peterson review – more rules for lifeRead moreWe live in a moment when real-world rules feel particularly weak. That applies both at the highest geopolitical level and at the point of personal conduct.Young people feelthe conventional tenets of hard work and financial prudence no longer apply, and even the rules we learn as kids – to treat others kindly or say sorry when we’ve done something wrong – our leaders nowopenly mock. TikTok and Instagram’s frantic energy is filling that gap, sometimes consciously. Search “rules for life” on Instagram and you’ll find millions of Jordan Petersons proselytising their way to be a person.On an individual level, of course, lots of the rules have merit. Meditating every morning probablywouldmake me calmer. Following the60-second rulewouldhelp me structure my day. But I’m not convinced that happiness can come in the context of the minutely prescribed existence that incorporating more than a few would demand. You can’t discipline yourself out of your historical context; you can only find ways to face it. Friends will laugh at me writing about colour like this, given I mostly wear black, but the point is that it’s what I like.Francesca Newton is a writer and editorDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

For instance, I believe TV’s reliance on reviving old shows is a risk-averse, creative regression. On the other hand, I love it. I particularly love it when fictional characters have visibly aged. There’s a broken humanity that you don’t get with flawless, collagen-rich skin. You sense you could talk to them about your sciatica and they’d get it.I got that feeling with the new series ofScrubs(Disney+, from Thursday 26 February), a show I once mainlined on E4. Scrubs was as comforting as tea and toast. Surprisingly malleable, too. In its bones, it was a coming-of-age workplace bromance between junior doctors JD and Turk, played by then newcomers Zach Braff and Donald Faison. Their chemistry was the show’s anchor, balancing sassy racial harmony with irreverence and heart, as they bore witness to universal human drama. But is it healthy enough to survive resuscitation, more than 15 years after its last episode aired?Sensibly, the writers have shaken things up. JD has grown into complacent early middle age, working as a private doctor for the affluent and elderly. “You write scripts in the suburbs” is Turk’s withering appraisal. (For a hot second, I thought he was beefing with Braff’s indie film-making.) Braff directs the first episode, in which a problem with one of JD’s pampered patients takes him back to Sacred Heart, the training hospital where he earned his wheels.The move brings him face to face with old comrades, including old flame Elliot, cheerful chauvinist the Todd and an emotional Turk, who is suffering from burnout. “I wish this guy would die all at once, instead of in tiny little pieces,” the baby-faced chief surgeon shockingly exclaims in theatre. In fairness, he’s a father of four now. It’s amazing he’s standing.At least JD’s irascible mentor can’t call him “Newbie” any more, like he used to, right? “What can I do for you there, Oldie?” asks Dr Cox. John C McGinley is still electrifying, his character a methamphetamine Martin Sheen, given to virtuosic, rhetorical putdowns, delivered in sentences longer than those of a 19th-century novelist.Cox has a problem, though. Tough love is out, political correctness is in, as policed by the figure of Sibby, a wellness/HR figure, who pops up genie-like at any impassioned outburst, with instructions to “take it down a few degrees” or attend cultural sensitivity workshops.I was dismayed when she appeared, and by recurring jokes about the “feelings police”. Scrubs isn’t the only comedy that has to address a vigilant climate around banter and power dynamics. It’s particularly an issue for returning series that made their name in the good ol’ days. I sympathise – puritans haven’t enjoyed this much cultural power since they closed the theatres. But it’s a defensive stance for TV shows to take. The anxiety of being muzzled leads to an obsessive preoccupation with it, so you no longer talk about anything else. It’s half of how the culture war perpetuates itself, and it’s boring.View image in fullscreen‘Feelings police’ … Vanessa Bayer as Sibby in Scrubs, season 10.Photograph: Jeff Weddell/DisneyHappily, after two episodes the show decides it can only be itself. “Why do you have the physique of a menopausal lesbian?” an insolent younger character asks the older, not yet dignified JD. It’s funnier for it, and the show clearly has affection for gay people, among other minorities. It begins to take on worthy subjects: the dehumanising US healthcare system; patient quotas doctors must meet to maximise hospital profits; TikTok diets that threaten health; orthorexia in gym bros. Speaking with conviction, and an open heart, matters more than speaking correctly. That’s also something I believe.Will Scrubs Redux evolve, Gray’s Anatomy-style, with generations of younger characters taking the torch? Scenes with the new newbies fall a little flat – but if Dr Cox taught me anything, it’s that you have to give people time. The chemistry between the seasoned leads sparks enough to sustain things for now. Turk is soon moonwalking again, the writers are throwing out zingers you’ll want to keep in your back pocket. I liked this far more than I expected. We all need a little TLC, more than ever, and it turns out I actually do want a scrub. It gets some love from me.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe watcherZach BraffTV comedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Authors and avid readers discuss the rise of metrics, and reveal how many books they finished last yearEmma LoffhagenSat 21 Feb 2026 04.00 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleEvery January, thousands of readers log on to Goodreads, Instagram or TikTok and make the same declaration: this is the year I read 50 books. Or 75. Or 100. Screenshots of spreadsheets circulate, templates for tracking pages and percentages are downloaded, friends publicly pledge to “do better” than they did last year. What was once a private pastime is announced, quantified and, in some corners of the internet, judged.The appeal is obvious: in a distracted age, reading can easily become crowded out by work, screens and fatigue. Literacy rates in the UK are stagnating: in 2024, around50% of UK adults read regularly for pleasure, down from 58% in 2015.As the UK launches itsNational Year of Reading, a steady drumbeat of commentary has framed the decline of book culture as a civilisational crisis. Columnists have painted lurid pictures of a post-literate society, in which the shrinking cultural centrality of books represents a slow unravelling of the habits that once underpinned modern public life. In this context, reading targets promise discipline and a sense of progress.But do yearly reading goals actually help us read better, or do they risk hollowing out the very activity they claim to protect? As reading is increasingly tracked and performed online, there is a growing sense that a solitary pleasure is being reshaped by the logic of metrics and visibility. In a culture that counts steps, optimises sleep and gamifies meditation, the pressure to quantify reading may say less about books than about a wider urge to turn even our leisure into something measurable and, ultimately, competitive.double quotation markI used to set huge targets – 70 or 100 books a year, then I’d get to December and feel guiltyFor Ayesha Chaudhry, who co-runs the Instagram account@between2books, this online book culture has become alienating. “The numbers I see online are wildly unsustainable,” she says. “I used to set huge targets – 70 or 100 books a year, written out in my diary. Then I’d get to December, feel guilty, and stare at all these empty spaces on the page.”Last year, Chaudhry decided to purposely slow down, reading just 10 books – the fewest since childhood – and considers it one of her most satisfying reading years. “I actually sat with what I was reading, and also turned it into something more interactive,” she says. “Most of those books came into my life through conversations, recommendations from people I met on holiday, or listening to an author at an event. They became social experiences rather than items to tick off.”The shift, she says, has eased both pressure and overconsumption. “I was buying books to meet goals, then feeling anxious because they weren’t read. It became a loop.” Now, her aims are non-numerical: exploring authors’ backlist titles, genres outside her comfort zone, and more time spent thinking rather than counting.According to philosopherC Thi Nguyen, author of The Score, the phenomenon Chaudhry describes sits within a much wider cultural shift. In his book, Nguyen explores how modern life increasingly gamifies ordinary activities, showing how metrics and scoring systems can distort our experience of what we value.“Gamification is when you take a natural activity, such as reading or communication, and explicitly apply game-like design features – scores, levels, streaks – to motivate people,” he says. The danger, Nguyen argues, is “value capture”: the moment when rich, complex experiences are flattened into numbers that begin to stand in for meaning.“It’s very hard to share something like ‘this book changed me’ in a way that’s publicly accountable,” he says. “But it’s extremely easy to share that you’ve read 100 books. So the number becomes a kind of social currency – even though it doesn’t track what mattered.”From step counts and calorie trackers to follower numbers and productivity dashboards, modern life increasingly rewards what can be measured and compared. “Large-scale data systems are built around what’s easy to count, not what’s genuinely important,” Nguyen says. “Curiosity, delight and genuine meaning cannot survive translation into a spreadsheet.”That is not to say that voracious reading is always fuelled by an unhealthy desire for self-optimisation. Ella Risbridger, author ofIn Love With Love, represents the opposite extreme. Last year, she read more than 1,000 romance novels while researching her book, but deliberately refuses to track them. “I try to avoid anything that makes reading feel like maths,” she says. “Reading is where I go to escape targets.”Journalist and author Afua Hirsch’s experience also illustrates this tension. As a judge for major literary prizes, she has spent years reading under intense deadlines. “When I was judging the Booker, I had to read about 150 books in five months,” she says. “It was literally a book a day.”Hirsch describes this kind of reading as both a privilege and a strain. “Your brain becomes like a computer. You’re processing, and that’s stressful, especially when something is beautifully written and you want to linger.” After such intense periods, she often needs time to relearn how to read for pleasure.double quotation markMetrics can help people get started, but ideally they’re temporary scaffoldingNguyen is careful not to dismiss metrics altogether. Used lightly, he says in his book, scoring systems can be useful, giving people a clear goal and immediate feedback. After all, we are in a moment of genuine concern about literacy. Withreading levels falling among childrenand attention spans fraying across all ages, numerical goals can be the first step on the ladder. “Metrics can help people get started,” he says. “But ideally, they’re temporary scaffolding. You need to develop your own reasons to read.”Reader tracking platformStoryGraph, the fastest-growing rival to Amazon-owned Goodreads, was built in conscious opposition to the competitive reading culture increasingly fostered online. Founded by Nadia Odunayo, the platform positions itself as reader-first, data-light and deliberately flexible.“Before I built the product, I spent months just watching Bookstagram,” Odunayo says. “A lot of people were stressed by social media and the sense that reading was a competition. I didn’t want to build something people would burn out from.”Instead of focusing solely on the number of books completed, StoryGraph allows users to set page goals, time goals, or habit-based challenges. Page goals avoid incentivising short books, Odunayo says, and allow for books abandoned partway through. “If you read 50 pages, that effort matters,” she says. “You’re not punished for curiosity, or for reading War and Peace.”The platform also foregrounds non-numerical challenges: reading across cultures, genres or identities; working through prize shortlists; only reading books already owned. Many are open-ended, deliberately resisting the pressure of annual completion. “You could be doing these challenges for the rest of your reading life,” Odunayo says.The tension is clear: reading goals promise incentives in an era of distraction, but they also risk importing the logic of productivity into one of the few remaining spaces of offline pleasure. As Nguyen puts it: “Reading goals can be good starters, but if the number remains the reason you read, something has gone wrong.”Running the numbersAuthors, a bookseller, an influencer and a librarian tally their 2025 readsDerek Owusuauthor: 38 booksI didn’t read a book until I was 24. When I discovered reading, it was for pure pleasure. I read at my own pace and reread freely. I don’t usually track the number of books I’ve read, and even worrying about whether I’ve read “enough” irritates me. If I’ve read five books, who cares? I’m baffled by people being impressed or unimpressed by reading totals.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Kate PetersThe only goal I set is if I really like an author, I’ll read their back catalogue. I don’t count how many books there are, I just keep going until I get tired. I want to improve as a writer, so I read with that in mind too. But when I’m writing it’s also paradoxically harder to read at all, because I become tunnel-visioned and I don’t want to accidentally plagiarise anything.Rereading is a big part of how I read too. People say you can’t judge an album after one listen, but a book gets one read and a definitive verdict. Nabokov said: “One cannot read a book: one can only reread it.” The first time, you learn the texture; the second time, you see the craft.My opinions change with every reread. Last year, I reread The Fall by Albert Camus and thought, “Why did I love this so much the first time?” It’s probably because I was in my early 20s and very angsty. I reread F Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby every year: last year I didn’t like it much; this year I thought it was amazing.Chrissy Ryanbookseller atBookBar: 145 booksLast year was the first time I set a reading goal: 100 books. I thought it was achievable and would keep me focused, especially if I hit a reading rut. When you work in books, a rut can spiral into, “Do I not love books any more? What if I can never read again and this is my whole career?” The goal helped, but only because I made a rule: if I started stressing about numbers, I’d stop.Owning BookBar has changed how I read. I’m usually buying three to six months ahead, and I try to read as much as possible in that window to know what I’m stocking. If a book is pitched as “big and buzzy” and I’ve read it and didn’t enjoy it, I might not buy it. Conversely, sometimes I miss a book and read it later, such asThe Correspondent by Virginia Evans– I wish I’d caught it earlier because I loved it and it sold really well.Some of my favourite books I read last year (which are actually coming out this year) areI Want You to Be Happy by Jem CalderandFrida Slattery As Herself by Ana Kinsella.Reading is pleasure and work for me. As a bookshop, you’re taste-making: you’re saying, “We endorse this.” That creates pressure, which can become suffocating. So, in December I stopped reading ahead and read purely for pleasure, and it reminded me why I love it. I’m trying to return to classics and older books more this year too, because having a greater understanding of literary context makes me a better bookseller.Jack Edwardsbook influencer with1.5 millionfollowers acrossInstagramandTikTok: 137 booksI set reading goals that feel achievable. Last year, my goal was 100 books and I read 137. The point isn’t competition; it’s noticing how I spend my time. How much did I read last week versus how much time did I spend on my phone? The latter becomes about how you’re perceived; it turns toxic.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Kate PetersOne of the ways I’ve managed to build a career out of this is by gamifying it – I realised that numbers make things more clickable: it’s the reason people love listicles, that number is satisfying to us. But, for me, reading has always been something I really enjoy, and you have to make sure you’re only competing with yourself rather than doing it for other people.I think of reading like going to the gym: you train endurance and strength. It’s not just how long you read, but how long you can sustain focus and critical thought. The brain is a muscle, you build it over time.I’m naturally a slow reader and I like lingering over books. I read with a pen in hand, underlining and marking passages. If someone pulls a book off my shelf, the markings show my path through it. The book tells the author’s story, but it also tells the story of me reading it.Two of my favourite books I read last year wereRejection by Tony Tulathimutte, which I thought was such a fun exploration of internet culture and the loneliness epidemic, andGunk by Saba Sams, an amazing novel set in a nightclub in Brighton about an unconventional family dynamic.My goals now are mostly non-numerical. After studying English literature, I realised how narrow the canon can be, so I prioritised literature in translation, and I fell in love with Argentinian horror and Japanese and Korean micro-studies of character. This year, I’m reading more African writers and exploring the continent’s literary heritage.Olivia Young-Thompsonlibrarian: 45 booksLast year, I read about two or three books a month, but I didn’t set a target. I also started writing my own book, and when I’m writing I find it hard to read much. One hobby replaced another for a while, and that’s fine.My reading was a mix: tiny charity-shop paperbacks, big novels, classics and “fluff”. My favourite books from last year includedKatherine Arden’s Winternight trilogy, which I loved because it felt cold and wintry during a hot summer, and also some nonfiction, particularlySharon Blackie’s If Women Rose Rooted.Working as a librarian, I actually don’t feel huge pressure to read hundreds of books, though it helps to know about the prize winners, as that’s what people often come in looking for your thoughts about.Some people read 100 books a year, and if you can do that, wonderful. But if you can’t, you shouldn’t be seen as any less of a reader. I think the competitive side of reading mostly exists online.There’s also a difference between racing through novellas and spending weeks with War and Peace. I hate fast fashion and fast anything, and I’m scared books are starting to fall into that category too. I’ve gone back to rereading books I loved as a child – it’s like re-listening to a favourite album. Forgoing that pleasure just to add another number to a tally feels pointless.Jan Carsonauthor: 300 booksI read for about four hours a day. It can sound shocking, but reading is my job. That time includes reading for pleasure, for content that I’m teaching my students, articles I’m writing and proofs I’ve been sent.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Polly GarnettI don’t read in four-hour chunks. I break it into an hour in the morning, an hour in bed, and I read on the treadmill or exercise bike. I keep a book in my bag, so if someone’s late for coffee or I’m stuck on a bus, I read, which pulls me away from doomscrolling. Short stories are perfect for those small windows of time.I keep a semi-privateInstagramto track what I’ve read, but it’s just for me really. A lot of my goals are non‑numerical – for example, this will be my seventh year of reading an author’s entire canon in chronological order. That doesn’t have to be an overwhelming goal: in 2020, I did Agatha Christie, which was a lot of books, but for Toni Morrison it was only 11. You see writers grow into their voice, which is heartening in a publishing culture that venerates the perfect debut.My favourite books last year wereSarah Perry’s Death of an Ordinary ManandVincenzo Latronico’s Perfection. I try to read across genres and I’m not a snob about what I read, either. Some authors slow you down and reward attention, such as Marilynne Robinson and Hilary Mantel. I’m also drawn to older writers such asIris MurdochandMargaret Drabble; the sentences move at a different rhythm. I spend a lot of time talking about books with friends – I love that communal argument and exchange.Explore more on these topicsBooksSociety booksFictionSocial mediaLiteracyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was probably a boarding school thing. Very stiff upper lip. My parents are not the most emotionally available human beings, either. I like to tease them by saying: “I love you.” You can see the panic in their eyes. They will normally say: “All right then, bye.”My gran died when I was about 18, and I was sad, of course, but in terms of tears there was nothing, no water. I never cried at movies. I didn’t cry on my wedding day, nor at the birth of either of my daughters. It never alarmed me. I actually thought I might have underactive tear glands. Looking back, it was probably all about control.My cultural awakening: Bach helped me survive sexual abuse as a childRead moreIn 2023 I went to see the musicalOperation Mincemeatfor the first time in the West End. What struck me was the humour – a lot of it was taking aim at the public school culture I grew up with. I didn’t cry then but I did have the urge to see it again. I think it was maybe the third or fourth time of going when the song Dear Bill got me. It appears halfway through the musical and the lyrics take the form of a letter from a woman to her husband, who is away fighting in the second world war. I was shocked to find myself crying. I had to go back to see it with my wife, Yael, to prove to her that I could now cry. She definitely thought I was a bit emotionally repressed. When the song came on I took her hand and dabbed it on the side of my eye. Her face was one of utter shock.I’ve thought about why it unlocked something in me and I think it’s because the song itself has so many layers of repression to it. The character who sings it, Hester Leggatt, rarely shows any emotion. And the lyrics themselves only talk about the heartache of separation through the metaphor of tending to roses. There’s a line about how the flowers are dull and not thriving. I thought: is that how my wife and children see me?double quotation markNow every time I see the show I'm almost crying when I get there. It's like a Pavlovian response to hearing the intro musicAs the song continues, we witness the gradual release of Hester’s true feelings: anger, guilt, all sorts of emotions pour out. One line – “Why did we meet in the middle of a war, what a silly thing for anyone to do” – was written in the real-life letter the song is based on. That added another layer to it.One thing you notice on maybe the third time you go is that, halfway through the song, Hester accidentally says the name of her former love, Tom, rather than Bill, the pretend character she is writing the letter to. That moment is especially poignant. I’ve now been to see Operation Mincemeat 29 times, with trip number 30 already booked. I often cried at Dear Bill, but then it moved on to other songs, such as Useful, which is about the women whose important wartime work went largely unrewarded. Now when I see the show I’m almost crying when I get there. It’s like a Pavlovian response as soon as I hear the intro music.I’ve been to see the musical on Broadway too with my family, and I have met the cast at the stage door. I’m a teacher and I have taken my year 6 kids to see it. I think I heard some sniffles during that, and it wasn’t just me.‘We wrote it living on Tesco sandwiches and anxiety attacks!’ How Operation Mincemeat conquered the worldRead moreI have since found myself crying in lots of situations outside Operation Mincemeat. It has been like learning a new skill. I always cry now when I watch the film Interstellar. When my class watched Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom, one of my pupils said: “Look, Mr Allen’s crying!” I even cried at a bloody Brandi Carlile concert and that’s not my type of music. She sang a song that was basically a farewell to her children’s innocence, and I had tears streaming down my face. Even Yael thought that was a bit much – and she will cry at a Dove advert.I have definitely become a more rounded person. When a good friend of mine, Josh, died of stomach cancer at 34, completely out of the blue, I went to the funeral and was an absolute mess. Josh knew what I had been like before, so I liked to imagine him looking down at me sobbing and finding it hilarious. But in a strange way it felt good. To sit there and repress it would have been terrible. Instead, this was cathartic. We went for drinks afterwards and it felt as if I had really got it all out. Without Operation Mincemeat, I’m honestly not sure I would have been able to.Share your cultural awakeningsShare your experiencesYou can tell us how a cultural moment has prompted you to make a major life change by filling in the form below or emailing us on cultural.awakening@theguardian.com.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

But in order to thrive, museums need sustainable, long-term public funding to help meet the annual costs of keeping the doors open and welcoming everyone to our public collections,” she said.The UK is an outlier among leading cultural nations in not charging at the door. France’s Louvre charges £28 for entry, Spain’s Prado £13, the US’s Museum of Modern Art £22, and the Vatican Museums £17.Against that backdrop, a growing number of senior museum figures – some of whom once supported free entry – have begun to argue that the policy may no longer be fit for purpose.They include Nick Merriman, the former leader of the Horniman Museum & Gardens and English Heritage, whotold the Daily Telegraphlast week that while free entry had driven up visitor numbers, it had done little to diversify audiences. “You just get more middle-class people going,” he said. “In principle, why not charge? Most people, for the national museums, are willing to pay.”Roy Clare, the former head of Royal Museums Greenwich, called for a “more sophisticated approach”, arguing that free access did not need to apply “24/7 or 365”.View image in fullscreenThe Royal Observatory, part of the Royal Museums Greenwich, London.Photograph: AaronP/Bauer-Griffin/GC ImagesMark Jones, the former director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, and interim director of the British Museum from 2023 to 24, described universal free entry as “regressive and inequitable”. He has said that taxpayers on modest incomes are subsidising access for tourists who can afford to pay, while charging could also help alleviate overcrowding.Writing in the Art Newspaper, the art critic and historian Ben Lewis said it was time to “dump the British art world’s gold-plated, diamond-encrusted sacred cow” and introduce entrance fees.The debate is unfolding against a stark financial backdrop. Between 2010 and 2023, core funding for UK arts and cultural organisations fell by 18%. In its latest survey, the Museums Association found61% of respondents were planning service cuts in 2024–25.At the Tate,staff staged a seven-day strikelast year in response to repeated restructures, redundancies and below-inflation pay rises, with some workers reporting they had to use food banks.View image in fullscreenStaff at the Tate Britain on strike last autumn.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianNoel McClean, of the Prospect union, which represents workers at the National Gallery, National Portrait Gallery, and Tate, said workers were “bearing the brunt” of the crisis. “If nothing is done, drastic action may follow,” he warned. “There are already fears that free access could be at risk – yet it is vital for social, economic and educational purposes.”While national museums remain free for now, many regional and independent institutionshave already begun chargingwhere entry was once free, including the Kettle’s Yard in Cambridge.

In September, shecancelled a trip to the UKto receive an award for fear of arrest.In an exclusive interview with the Guardian, Rooney said: “I am of course immensely pleased and heartened that the high court has found the proscription of Palestine Action unlawful. This is a victory not only for the Palestine solidarity movement but also for civil liberties in Britain.“The proscription of a political protest group under the Terrorism Act represents a truly extreme assault on ordinary rights and freedoms, and the high court acknowledged as much.”The “very significant interference” with the rights to freedom of speech and freedom of assembly was one of two grounds on which Ammori’s claim was successful. Rooney said the issue was fundamental to the ban, as the legal question was “not whether Palestine Action is justified in carrying out its activities, but whether it ought to be a criminal offence even to have that debate”.She added: “It’s important to bear in mind that the primary purpose of the Terrorism Act is not to criminalise acts of violence, which are already illegal, but to criminalise otherwise lawful acts of speech, association, financial dealings, and so on.“These measures, which represent a significant infringement on free speech and other rights, were intended for use against armed groups that pose a serious threat to the public. The parliamentary debate on the Terrorism Act at the time of its passing testified clearly to this intention.“The use of such measures against a protest group that poses no threat whatsoever to the public is totally unprecedented and, we now know, unlawful,” she added.While the judges’ found in favour of Ammori, they rejected the idea that Palestine Action was non-violent or that it was engaged in civil disobedience, describing it as an organisation that “promotes its political cause through criminality and encouragement of criminality”.Responding to the judgment, the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, cited those findings while expressing disappointment at the result. “The proscription of Palestine Action followed a rigorous and evidence-based decision-making process, endorsed by parliament,” she said.“As a former lord chancellor, I have the deepest respect for our judiciary. Home secretaries must, however, retain the ability to take action to protect our national security and keep the public safe. I intend to fight this judgment in the court of appeal.”The high courtsaidthe proposition that Palestine Action was non-violent “rests on the premise that damage to property, regardless of extent, does not involve the use of violence. That is a view that many would struggle to comprehend, and we for our part are unable to accept.”Rooney disagreed. “To me, and I think to many other people, the word ‘violence’ implies harm to a living being,” she said. “Inanimate objects cannot suffer. And damaging one’s own property – for instance, breaking up old belongings in order to dispose of them – clearly is not a form of violence. Does the same act become violence if the property belongs to someone else? That’s a philosophical question as much as it is a legal one.“Of course, Palestine Action does intentionally use property damage in service of a campaign against genocide and apartheid. This is absolutely consistent with the tradition of civil disobedience, from the suffragettes to the environmental movement. I must admit that I am baffled by the judges’ claim that civil disobedience must be ‘characterised by restraint’. We have obviously been reading very different history books.“So yes, I disagree with some sections of the judgment – though, unlike the home secretary, I do agree with its conclusions.”In her second witness statement in the case, Rooney said it was “almost certain” that she wouldno longer be able to publish new workin the UK while the ban on Palestine Action remained in effect and that her existing books might have to be withdrawn from sale, describing such a scenario as “a truly extreme incursion by the state into the realm of artistic expression”.While the judges said they proposed quashing the proscription decision, for the time being Palestine Action remains banned as the court said it would await arguments from the Home Office on why it should remain in place pending an appeal.“If an order is found to be unlawful or unconstitutional, then it seems to me that it ought to be quashed there and then,” said Rooney. “But I am now feeling confident that the order will soon be quashed altogether, and that my work will remain in print in the UK as a result. I will look forward to visiting Britain again when that time comes.”Explore more on these topicsPalestine ActionSally RooneyCounter-terrorism policynewsShareReuse this content"

Not only is this present among artists themselves, but among people working in galleries, museums and other cultural institutions.According to the latest UK governmentstatistics, the creative industries employ 2.42 million people, of which 78% identify as being from a “more advantaged socio-economic background”.Last year,Guardian analysisfound that almost 30% of artistic directors and other creative leaders were privately educated, compared with a national average of just 7%. More than a third (36%) of the organisations’ chief executives or other executive directors went to private schools.Molloy works as a consultant for artists and galleries, and her career in the arts spans more than a decade. She describes the experience as being “surrounded by people who’d gone to private school and studied art history – a subject barely even available in state education”.“There’s no diversity of voice or thought in that, and it’s creating a bubble. It’s exclusionary, unfair and ultimately makes the art world less vibrant and harder for working-class people to infiltrate,” says Molloy.Working Arts Club has created a network of creative job-seekers and professionals through its newsletter and Whatsapp group, where job vacancies and events are shared.View image in fullscreenA Working Arts Club performance.Photograph: David Owens“Those who are just starting out in the sector can immediately be chatting with experienced people from large organisations,” says Kirsty Jukes, a communications officer at the Manchester Art Gallery, who will lead the northern wing of the club. “Having seen the benefits of the London iteration myself, I know it would be a great network to have up here as well.”Amy Gilles, 31, a club member and operations manager at the Quentin Blake Centre for Illustration, said it had made networking “much more accessible”.“I received a free ticket to attend Frieze Art Fair, which is incredibly expensive and a huge financial barrier. Being able to go and see how the industry works was hugely impactful,” said Gilles.Other members highlight the need for class-based initiatives within the sector. “Networks, clubs and collectives focused on working-class people are so important because they create spaces where shared realities don’t need explanation,” says Jennifer Jones, 26, a club member who also founded a working-class artist group calledGrafters Collective.“I’d been feeling like no one around me understood how much harder it is to be in these spaces and to balance everything when you don’t have financial support, don’t have industry connections and don’t understand the social codes or how the industry works because you come from outside of these circles,” she says.As well as the launch party in Manchester, there will be a social event in Liverpool in April. As part of the club’s expansion, Molloy and Jukes hope to partner with galleries, museums and art fairs in the north of England to set up panel talks and tours for its members.Molloy says the club is looking for funding “to make the network sustainable and allow it to grow”.Explore more on these topicsArtClass issuesInequalityNorth of EnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s the tail end of winter, 2021. Kensal Green Cemetery in west London: the imperial mausolea canted and crumbling, low clouds dissolving into rain. We are still  in that  strange phase of the pandemic when we are masked, newly aware of our bodies and the space around them. We are here to bury Nikos, a man who for me, for many, was the incarnation of Corfu.I had spent my 20s trying to find the perfect Greek island, hopping from the well-trodden (Mykonos, Santorini, Cephalonia) to the more obscure (Kythira, Symi, Meganisi). None quite matched the vision I had dreamed into being as a child, when I segued from Robert Graves to Mary Renault, then to Lawrence Durrell and John Fowles. Greece was an idea before it was a place: freedom and deep thought, a constellation of sand, salt and thyme.View image in fullscreenThen, on a whim, I accepted an invitation to play cricket in Corfu.I knew little about the island at the time – not about its strategic history, nor how that position had shaped a culture that is at once Greek, Venetian and British. I hadn’t yet walked the Liston, the elegant colonnaded arcade that might be Venice or Trieste, Bologna or Perugia were it not for the cricket pitch laid out in front of it. The pitch is surrounded by a car park; its groundsmen battle heat, salt spray, digging children and fouling dogs. Yet it remains the only cricket pitch in the world I know that’s set within aUnesco world heritage site. Taking guard there, you look up to the Old Fortress for solidity, and to the Palace of St Michael and St George for elegance and flair.View image in fullscreenThe cricket pitch next to the elegant arcade in Corfu Town.Photograph: Ernestos Vitouladitis/AlamyI went out with the Lord’s Taverners, a UK sports charity team. We were a motley bunch: a couple of former internationals – Andy Caddick and Chris Cowdrey – some actors, entertainers and a handful of writers, including me. The Corfiots, it turned out, were very good at cricket. The Greek national team is drawn almost entirely from the island. We were soundly beaten, then consoled by warmth, generosity and a run of excellent dinners in the Old Town.It was over one of those dinners – at thePergola– that I met Nikos Louvros and his wife, Annabelle, our hosts and the founders of Cricket Corfu. Nikos was rambunctiously Greek, full of wild energy; Annabelle was English in that particular way that falls deeply for Greece and builds a life around it. I recognised the impulse. By the end of the meal of lamb, ouzo and excellent local wine, we had planned our future together: we would launch a literary festival.View image in fullscreenFestival co-founders Annabelle and Nikos LouvrosOver the subsequent years, that vision has taken glorious shape.Corfu literary festivalbegan modestly: at our first, in 2017, there were as many speakers on stage as there were people in the audience. I remember Nikos’s hope, irritation and finally, characteristically, laughter as invited guests failed to show up. But there was never any sense it would stop. With Nikos beside you, everything seemed possible.Slowly, buoyed by local support, the festival grew into something far larger than we had imagined. We’ve had Stephen Fry and Sebastian Faulks, Bettany Hughes and Natalie Haynes, Matt Haig and Tom Holland. They came and spoke, they stayed at the heavenlyKontokali Bay hotel, or in the villas and apartments ofIonian Estates, and they fell in love with Corfu as I had. Many have come back to speak several times.double quotation markMyrtiotissa remains the beach that feels closest to a private miracle. Lawrence Durrell called it ‘perhaps the most beautiful beach in the world’Nikos lived for this – for showing others the beauty and drama of the island on which he was born, then left and returned to. He is gone now, but the festival endures. This September, it will return, larger and more magical than ever, with Homer’s Odyssey at its heart – a fitting subject for an island where the mythic and the everyday still fold into each other with ease.This is what I learned from Nikos, and from Corfu, over the years: swim early, before the day warms and when the water still has a faint bite. Swim after lunch, when the sea feels silky. Swim at dusk, when the surface holds the day’s heat and the light becomes thick and slow. Corfu is large enough and varied enough that you can build an entire itinerary around water and never feel you are repeating yourself.On the west coast, Myrtiotissa remains the beach that feels closest to a private miracle. Set in a steep green cradle, it is an initiation to reach it. Not unreasonably, Durrell called it “perhaps the most beautiful beach in the world”.View image in fullscreenPaleokastritsa beach.Photograph: Carmen Gabriela Filip/AlamyPaleokastritsa possesses a different kind of beauty. The monastery above the bay looks down over a scatter of coves where the water is so clear you can see the rocks far below, like a second landscape suspended in blue.Then there is the north-east, which has calmer waters, protected coves, a more intimate coastline. Agni Bay is a gentle curve of shoreline made for long lunches.Agni Tavernasits close enough to the water that you can leave your table, swim and return still tasting salt. Eat fish, eat simply, let time loosen its grip. If you can, arrive by boat: the north-east coast has a tradition of taking water taxis between bays, and there is something unmistakably Corfiot about stepping straight from deck to lunch.A surprise – especially if your image of Greek islands is Cycladic sparseness – is how green Corfu is. The interior rises and folds like a small country. Olive groves run for miles; cypresses spike the skyline. Drive up into the villages above Paleokastritsa and you reach Lakones, perched high enough to make the island feel suddenly vast. AtBoulis, the food is good, but it’s the terrace view you come for, the sense of stepping straight into the blue horizon.double quotation markMy novel is a love letter: an attempt to pay proper attention to a place that has given me more than I can easily nameCorfu’s cuisine is not what you usually think of as Greek: shaped by Venetian influence, by centuries of contact with Italy and by produce from the island’s land and sea.Pastitsadais a beef stew with pasta;sofritoisbeef or veal slices braised in a sauce of white wine, vinegar, garlic and parsley;bourdetois fish stew.In Corfu Town, make time for a night atSalto– contemporary but grounded, with excellent ingredients and a superb wine list. Then go for ice-cream atPapagiorgios. Walk the Old Town with a cone in hand, the stone still warm, and you feel part of a long tradition of summer nights.In 2020, in a brief, improbable lull between Covid lockdowns, we held the festival as if it were an act of defiance against the gods. The world was half closed; plans changed by the hour. Yet, for a few days, the island opened its arms and let us in. Chairs were spaced out, masks slipped on and off, hand sanitisers were perched on every table – and still there was laughter, ideas, beauty. Things that made us feel human.View image in fullscreenMyrtiotissa beach.Photograph: Hemis/AlamyOne morning, Nikos appeared with a boat. He had a gift for that – arriving as if from nowhere, already halfway into the next idea. “Come,” he said. A dozen of us climbed aboard and pulled away from the town, leaving behind the anxious news cycle and the low-level fear of that year. We ran along the north-east coast, cutting the engine in inlets you would never find from land: slivers of shingle, limestone shelves, beaches no bigger than sofas. Each time we stopped, we swam as if trying to slough the year off our skin. I felt like freedom, something snatched from darkness.That was the last festival Nikos attended. He died of Covid the following January – on my birthday.Hot springs, empty beaches, forests and wine: exploring the unspoilt Greek island of IkariaRead moreWhen I think of Nikos now, I think of that day on the water: of joy under pressure, of how precious it becomes. When he died, the island felt altered – not less beautiful, but more charged, as if the light carried grief in waves. Yet, Corfu also teaches something: that love for a place can outlive the person who brought you there, and become a way of honouring them.I have tried to do that in my own way, too. My novel A Stranger in Corfu is dedicated to Nikos. It grew out of this island – its layered past, its atmosphere of secrecy and hospitality, the sense that stories cling to the land. The novel is, at heart, a love letter: an attempt to pay proper attention to a place that has given me more than I can easily name.Go to Corfu and do not hurry. Swim often. Drive into the hills. Eat as if time were a gift. Let the island reveal itself at its own pace – slowly, then all at once.And if, one day, someone appears with a boat and an idea, say yes.A Stranger in Corfuby Alex Preston is publishedby Canongate(£18.99).

You could flip the sweet in your mouth and rub the flavour you wanted with your tongue. Too tart? Flip to the custard side. Too creamy? Flip again. It was one of the best ways to spend 10 minutes as a seven-year-old in the early 1990s. A few decades on, a lot has changed. Mum no longer has a corner shop, I don’t love boiled sweets any more, but eating rhubarb and custard is still a fantastic way to spend 10 minutes (at the very least).Rhubarb and custard trifleYou’ll need two large, roughly 30cm x 40cm oven trays and a 20cm trifle bowl. You can make the custard ahead of time, even the day before, up to the point when you add the whipped cream.Prep10 minCook1 hrCool30 min+Serves81.2kg forced pink rhubarb, topped, tailed and cut on an angle into 4cm pieces200g caster sugar3 oranges, zest of 1 finely grated, then all 3 juiced, to get 150ml3 large egg yolks1 tbsp vanilla paste10g cornflour(1⅓ tbsp)1 big pinch fine sea salt120ml whole milk600ml double cream30 trifle sponge fingers30g flaked almonds, toastedHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Put the rhubarb in an oven tray, add 150g sugar and all the orange zest and juice, then toss. Arrange the rhubarb into a single layer (you may need a second tray), cover tightly with foil and bake for 20 minutes. Carefully lift off the foil and check the rhubarb with the tip of a sharp knife: the rhubarb shouldn’t resist the knife at all, but it should keep its shape. If not, cover and bake again, checking for doneness every five minutes.Once the rhubarb is cooked, take the tray out of the oven and leave to cool. After about half an hour, once it has cooled, drain off the liquid into a jug and set aside. Store both the rhubarb and juice separately, covered, in the fridge.In the meantime, make the custard. Mix the egg yolks, vanilla paste, cornflour, the remaining 50g sugar and salt in a medium to large heatproof bowl. In a saucepan, heat the milk and 240ml of the cream, stirring regularly until small bubbles start to appear. Very slowly, pour this into the egg yolk mix in the heatproof bowl, whisking all the time. When properly mixed in, pour the lot back into the pan, and heat on a low to medium heat, whisking all the while, until the custard thickens. Take off the heat and pour into a heatproof bowl; cover the surface of the custard with a circle of nonstick baking paper, to prevent a skin from forming, and leave to cool completely.Whisk the remaining 360ml cream to soft peaks, fold 120g of it into the cooled custard, then transfer to a container, cover and chill until needed.To assemble, pack 15 sponges tightly in a single layer on their sides (rather than on their backs) in the base of the trifle dish. Drizzle over around 150ml of the rhubarb juice, then add half the rhubarb, followed by half the custard. Repeat the layers again (sponge, juice, rhubarb, custard), then finish with the remaining whipped cream. Sprinkle the toasted almonds on top and keep in the fridge until ready to serve.Explore more on these topicsVegetablesMeera Sodha recipesFoodDessertFruitBiscuitsBritish food and drinkEggsrecipesShareReuse this content"
