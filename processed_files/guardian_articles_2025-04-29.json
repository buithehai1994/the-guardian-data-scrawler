The government has been told it will not be in phase one – though that leaves the door open to be in either phase two or three.”Trump 100 days: from cornerstone of the west to unreliable allyRead moreA spokesperson for the business department said: “The US is an indispensable ally and negotiations on an economic prosperity deal that strengthens our existing trading relationship continue.“We’ve been clear that a trade war is not in anyone’s interests and we will continue to take a calm and steady approach to talks.”The White House did not respond to a request to comment.British officials first presented a draft deal to their US counterparts weeks ago, before the president’smajor tariff announcement. They hoped to agree a deal in time to grant the UK an exemption but, when that failed, shifted their focus instead to a self-imposed deadline of 19 May.Whitehall sources say, however, that negotiations have continued to be unpredictable in the weeks since Trump made his announcement. US officials are nowreportedly demandingthe UK lower its food quality standards to allow imports of American beef and chicken – something the Labour government has long ruled out.The draft agreement prepared by the British side would lead to the UKreducing its digital services tax, which is paid only by major US technology companies, in return for lower tariffs on steel, aluminium and cars. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, has also held out the possibility of reducing the 10% tariffs on US cars as an additional sweetener.But in the past few days the Trump administration has decided to split its negotiations with 17 different countries into three groups, each of which will get a week to negotiate in turn – a developmentfirst reportedby the Wall Street Journal. The US has imposed a deadline of 8 July for talks to conclude – several weeks later than the UK target.Sources said UK officials had been told the immediate priority would be negotiating with Asian countries, with South Korea at the top of the list.Scott Bessent, the US Treasury secretary, told reporters on Tuesday that Asian trading partners such as India, South Korea and Japan “have been the most forthcoming, in terms of doing the deals”.He also criticised European countries for imposing digital services taxes on US companies, saying he wanted them to be removed. The British government has offered to reduce the tax but not to drop it entirely.‘Trump wanted to break us’, says Carney as Liberals triumph in Canadian electionRead moreDespite the new negotiating approach from the Trump administration, British negotiators are hopeful they will be able to continue talks – even if in a more unofficial capacity – throughout the next few weeks.One government source described the US tactics as “makeshift and unpredictable”. Another said contact had continued in the past few days despite the promised phasing of talks.However, the UK is making better headway with India and the EU.Negotiators held crunch talks on Tuesday afternoon with their Indian counterparts, after Piyush Goyal, India’s trade minister, told businesses at a roundtable in London that 25 out of 26 aspects of the deal had been agreed.UK officials were hopeful of finalising the deal on Tuesday, but one source briefed on the talks said they broke up without agreement on national insurance contributions. A longstanding sticking point has been Delhi’s concern that Indians working temporarily in the UK on business visas must pay national insurance despite not being eligible for UK pensions or social security benefits.The expectation is that at least one more round of talks will be needed to clinch any deal. Officials are in discussions over a potential visit byKeir Starmerto India this year once an agreement has been finalised.Meanwhile, British ministers including Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister, and Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, met Maroš Šefčovič, the EU trade commissioner, amid signs that a UK-EU deal could be getting closer.Šefčovičtweeted afterwardsit had been “a productive exchange on securing balanced trade relationships, as we face new global dynamics”.The Guardianrevealed last weekthat Brussels was willing to make major concessions to its proposals for a youth mobility scheme to get a deal over the line, including limiting work visas to 12 months, restricting the sectors EU citizens can work in.However, experts say that the plans to align British agricultural standards with European ones would make it impossible to give concessions on US demands to align with US ones instead.Anand Menon, the director of the thinktank UK in a Changing Europe, told MPs on Tuesday: “If the Americans say you have to lift the regulations that restrict the access of our goods to your market, that is incompatible with what we need to do to sign a … deal with the EU.”Explore more on these topicsTrade policyDonald TrumpKeir StarmerEconomic growth (GDP)Economic policynewsShareReuse this content"

The country is at risk, people are at risk, and there is not enough being done.”She said it was frightening that the government was not taking seriously the rapidly increasing risk of flooding and was insteadconsidering cuts to flood defences.The Treasury has indicated thatflood spending would not be ringfencedand could be reduced in the spending review in June.Brown said: “If that means they’re thinking of cutting the money forresilience to flooding, we would ask them to think again. I can’t be clear enough about our message: we cannot wait to take action. This is not tomorrow’s problem. It’s today’s problem. And if we don’t do something about it, it will become tomorrow’s disaster.”She pointed tofloods in Valenciathat killed 220 people in October andfloods in Germany and Belgiumin 2021 with similar numbers of deaths. “These are very close to home. These things could happen in the UK and we need government to recognise that this is the disaster that could be happening tomorrow and start to really take this seriously,” she said. “It is quite frightening that the evidence we’ve got shows that it isn’t yet.”Without increased focus on making the UK’s infrastructure and economy more resilient to extreme weather, the impacts of the climate crisis could destroy about 7% of the UK’s GDP by 2050, the CCC found. This compares with acost of cutting greenhouse gas emissions to net zeroby 2050 of about 0.2% of GDP per year.View image in fullscreenCommittee member says deadly floods in Valencia, Spain, ‘could happen in the UK.’Photograph: José Jordan/AFP/Getty ImagesThe CCC’s latesttwo-year assessment of the UK’s progress in adapting to climate change, published on Wednesday, found failure across every measure and every form of infrastructure, from transport and energy to communications. People’s health was being put at risk by the failure to adapt, the report found, and thenatural environment was being damaged.One in four properties will be at risk of flooding by 2050 unless urgent action is taken, up from about 6.3m properties today, the report found. More than a third of the railways and road networks are already at risk of flooding, which will rise to about half by 2050.More than half of England’s top quality agricultural land is already at risk of flooding, and harvests like last year’s – thesecond worst for arable on record– could become more common.Although many of the findings in the CCC assessment relate to measures taken under the previous government, Brown said that Labour was failing to respond to the threats. “We’re seeing no increase in action,” she said.The Environment Agency warned last year thatinflation was eating into flood defence budgets, meaning fewer people were being protected for the same expenditure. The National Audit Office warned of a quarter of new flood defence projects being abandoned.View image in fullscreenLow water levels at Baitings reservoir, West Yorkshire, in 2022, when a heatwave caused more than 3,000 excess deaths in England.Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesA government spokesperson said: “As part of our plan for change we are investing a record £2.65bn to repair and build flood defences, protecting tens of thousands of homes and businesses and helping local communities become more resilient to the effects of climate change such as overheating and drought.”Flooding is the most obvious impact of the climate crisis in the UK, but rising temperatures are also taking a toll. Drought has meant 20 million people are subjected to water restrictions,wildfiresare outrunning the capacity of the fire brigade to extinguish them – the area burned in 2025 has exceeded the previous annual record before summer has even started – and heatwaves are forecast to become more frequent and intense.The climate crisis is already imposing costs on the NHS. There were more than 3,000 excess deaths in England in the heatwave of 2022, and one in five doctors reported that surgeries and operations had been cancelled, the CCC found.Philip Evans, a senior climate campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said: “Britain’s firefighters and insurers have already warned we’re not set up to cope with the increase in floods, wildfires and heatwaves. Now climate experts confirm it’s not getting better. This means our farms are under water, food prices are going up, homes are wrecked and ordinary people count the cost.”He called for taxes on fossil fuel companies to pay for the preparations needed. “The government must bolster Britain’s resilience. Oil and gas companies are fuelling this extreme weather and making billions from doing it, so we need climate taxes on these profits to pay for adaptation measures and protect us from the extreme costs of weather chaos.”Tom Lancaster, the head of land, food and farming at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank, called for ministers to rescind thecuts to sustainable farming programmes. The ECIU estimated that that the impact of the climate crisis added about £360 to the average household food bill in total for 2022 and 2023.“Investing in [support schemes for sustainable farming] will be needed to build the resilience of UK food production, and will be a key test of whether the government has taken the criticism in this report on board,” he said.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisLabourClimate Change CommitteeFloodingDroughtExtreme weatherGreen politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Results on Tuesday confirmed that the Liberals fell just short of a majority government and would therefore need the support of political rivals to govern.Canada election: Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre loses seat he held since 2004Read moreMirroring a theme of the campaign, Carney told election-night supporters that Trump wanted to “break us, so that America can own us”, adding: “That will never, ever happen,” to shouts from the crowd.He also gave a stark assessment of a world order once defined by an integrated global trading system with the US at the centre, saying such a system was over, and he pledged to reshape Canada’s relationships with other nations.“We are over the shock over American betrayal. But we will never forget the lessons,” he said.Later on Tuesday, the two leaders struck a more conciliatory tone and agreed to meet “in the near future”, according to Carney’s office, which said Trump had congratulated the prime minister for his victory. “The leaders agreed on the importance of Canada and the United States working together – as independent, sovereign nations – for their mutual betterment,” it said.In a shock result, the Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre,lost the seat he has held since 2004, even as his party performed better than had previously been expected. The Tory leader pledged to keep his job during his election night speech, but the loss is expected to inflame tensions within the party.“While we will do our constitutional duty of holding the government to account and proposing better alternatives, we will always put Canada first as we stare down tariffs and other irresponsible threats from President Trump,” Poilievre told supporters.“Conservatives have been leading the debate and we will continue to put forward the best arguments to improve the lives of our people right across this country.”Jagmeet Singh, leader of the progressive New Democratic party leader, also lost his seat in a national vote that saw the NDP have their worst-ever result, losing party status and most of their seats. In an emotional speech Singh announced he would resign as leader.View image in fullscreen‘Let’s put an end to the division and anger of the past,’ Carney said in his victory speech.Photograph: Blair Gable/ReutersCarney praised other party leaders for campaigns that he said had strengthened the country’s democracy. “Let’s put an end to the division and anger of the past. We are all Canadian and my government will work for and with everyone.”After a narrow victory in the previous federal election, the Liberals relied on the leftwing New Democratic party to help it pass legislation. Monday’s vote appeared likely to produce a similar result, with the Liberals and the NDP together holding enough seats to pass legislation.For the Liberals, the win marks aremarkable recoveryfor a party that was, until recently, on track for electoral devastation. Carney’s predecessor as leader, Justin Trudeau, served as prime minister for nearly 10 years but the twilight of his leadership was marked by repeated threats of mutiny, bitter feuding and a fed-up electorate.Until the end of 2024, internal discussions within the Liberal party were grim: under their most optimistic scenarios, they could only hope of holding the Conservatives to a minority government. Outright victory was nowhere on the party’s radar.“We were dead and buried in December. Now we are going to form a government,” David Lametti, a former Liberal justice minister, told CTV late on Monday. “We have turned this around thanks to Mark.”View image in fullscreenCarney celebrating at the Liberal party campaign headquarters in Ottawa.Photograph: Sean Kilpatrick/APTrump’s threats to annex the country to make it the 51st state, his belittling of Trudeau as “governor” and threats of economic coercion have all contributed to a sharp feeling of anger and betrayal towards Canada’s southern neighbour.“The shift in polls was absolutely without precedent,” said David Coletto, the head of the polling firm Abacus. “But to see the honeymoon that followed – and the way that support held, is also unprecedented. I can’t think of other jurisdictions around the world where we’ve seen this complete reset. And this turns on two factors: how unpopular Justin Trudeau was, and how much of a threat and gamechanger Donald Trump has meant to Canada.”House of Commons seats chartFor the Conservatives, defeat marks a disappointing end to an election campaign the party had been demanding for months. Under the leadership of Poilievre, the Tories had for the past two years seemed all but certain to form a government.But within weeks of Trump’s threats and the emergence of Carney as the new Liberal leader, their25-point poll lead evaporated.View image in fullscreenPierre Poilievre’s Conservatives had been demanding an election for months.Photograph: Amber Bracken/ReutersTo have come inches from victory and then to lose is likely to kick off a sombre postmortem for the party – and internal feuding over the future of the Conservative movement.For Carney, who served as prime minister for only nine days before calling a snap election, the gambit was one in which he hoped to make history for the party. But also on the line for Carney was the prospect of making history for an entirely different reason: had he lost, he would have inherited the mantle of Canada’s shortest-serving prime minister.Ian Laroque, a campaign volunteer who lives in Carney’s Ottawa electoral district, said: “I saw how Carney conducted himself and I felt like he was really a man who met the moment. He wasn’t a polished politician. But he’s the kind of person we need to lead the country right now. It’s not every day you get an economist during an economic crisis.”Monday’s vote was unusual in other ways, too: for the first time in nearly 70 years, the two main parties were set to take more than 80% of the vote between them, reflecting the collapse of other smaller opposition parties including the NDP and the separatist Bloc Québécois.In an emotive speech to supporters, Jagmeet Singh announced he would step down as leader of the NDP after failing to win his seat. In its worst-ever performance, the progressive party failed to meet the 12-seat threshold needed to retain official party status – the second time in its history it has been unable to do so.The loss of party status means the NDP loses certain parliamentary privileges, including the ability to ask questions during question period as often as recognized parties. These rules can be amended at the discretion of the speaker, however. The NDP will also lose out on money allocated to parties for research purposes, which is distributed proportionally to the number of seats held by a recognized party.Explore more on these topicsCanadaMark CarneyAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Yet if they are to keep alive their shot at history, the pursuit of a firstChampions Leaguetriumph, they are going to need something extraordinary in the second leg of this semi-final next Wednesday.The atmosphere at the Parc des Princes will be red-hot andParis Saint-Germainwill not easily be shifted from the advantage that Ousmane Dembélé’s fourth-minute goal has given them. The French champions showed why they have won so many admirers across the continent this season, calling the tune for the opening 35 minutes or so. And again towards the end when they expertly retightened their grip.Arsenal resisted, showed their mettle and they had their moments. Gianluigi Donnarumma was forced to make crucial saves from Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard. Mikel Merino had a goal disallowed. But this was not the barnstorming night that Arteta had wanted, one to rival thefirst leg of the quarter-final against Real Madrid, when Arsenal won 3-0.Arsenal v Paris Saint-Germain: Champions League semi-final, first leg – liveRead morePSG were in total command during the closing stages and the truth was they could have scored again. After João Neves had lifted a shot high, one PSG substitute, Bradley Barcola, dragged wastefully wide of the far post when clean through before another, Gonçalo Ramos, hit the crossbar when one-on-one with David Raya. Ramos had run through all alone. He almost had too much time.Dembélé was dropped for PSG’s visit in the league phase of the competition in October, whichArsenal won 2-0, after a disagreement with Luis Enrique. Yet the striker made the difference, breaking a six-game scoring drought with what was his 25th goal in his past 25 club games. He was not the only PSG player to shine.“Bring your boots,” Arteta had told theArsenalfans. In other words, be prepared to live every moment with the players. The idea was for the biggest game in Emirates Stadium history to have the most emotional atmosphere, for Arsenal to feed off the sheer scale of the possibilities but it did not really happen. PSG killed the mood.Luis Enrique’s team made it happen at the outset, settling into their passing rhythms straight away and stunning the Emirates with the early goal. It was certainly a worry from an Arsenal point of view to see how easily Dembélé was able to motor up through the centre of the field and go left for Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, who ran at Jurriën Timber. Which was an even bigger worry.View image in fullscreenOusmane Dembélé fires PSG ahead.Photograph: Alex Pantling/Uefa/Getty ImagesKvaratskhelia popped the ball back to Dembélé, whose low first-time shot through a crowd was slightly scuffed but the precision made up for it, the ball kissing the far post on its way in. Cue delirium among the travelling ultras, who lit flares and detonated a firecracker. PSG hogged possession for most of the first half, so slick and comfortable, Vitinha prominent. From right to left, Désiré Doué, Dembélé and Kvaratskhelia shimmered with menace. PSG’s movement was too much. Arsenal chased shadows. It was the remorselessness of the PSG press, as well. Arsenal had to work hard to construct their moves from the back. There were anxious moments as they did so.The good news for Arteta was that his team dug out a foothold in the final 10 minutes of the first period, Bukayo Saka crackling to life, taking it upon himself to be the catalyst. When Jakub Kiwior pulled back for Merino, PSG were grateful to Neves for a last-gasp tackle.Arsenal’s big chance of the half came at the very end of it, Myles Lewis-Skelly releasing Martinelli, who had only Donnarumma to beat from an angle on the left. The goalkeeper made an important block.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Kvaratskhelia worked Raya but it was Doué who fully extended him on 32 minutes, darting inside and shooting violently for the near corner. Raya changed directions smartly to save. In between times, Kvaratskhelia wanted a penalty after running into a stray arm from Timber. He went down too easily.View image in fullscreenGianluigi Donnarumma saves from Gabriel Martinelli.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianArsenal began to get frustrated with the officials, a collective howl greeting the decision on 43 minutes to penalise Saka for a minuscule touch on Nuno Mendes. Saka would have been away on goal. He was booked for his reaction. There was further angst at the start of the second half after Merino headed home from Declan Rice’s free-kick. After a ridiculously long delay, the VAR showed that Merino was offside.Arsenal could feel the belief returning. They pushed higher. Rice, playing as the No 6 in the absence of the suspended Thomas Partey – who was missed – grew in influence. When he strode upfield in the 56th minute, he put Trossard through up the inside left. Trossard’s pace turned it into an even bigger chance. His underpowered shot was turned away by Donnarumma.William Saliba made a vital challenge on Achraf Hakimi inside the Arsenal box and the question was whether Arteta’s team could make it happen at the other end. They could not. PSG reasserted themselves and it could have been worse for Arsenal if Barcola and Ramos had not blown their late chances.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueArsenalParis Saint-Germainmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The space is also brightened by huge animated displays of woodland scenes, buzzing bees and a wide variety of Londoners who talk about their home design choices – some of which are recreated in the store.It will display about 6,000 Ikea products, ranging from “Billy” bookcases to drinking glasses, and about 3,500 of those items will be available to take away on the spot, while the rest can be delivered to homes.The store’s opening is regarded by some as key to hopes for a revival of Oxford Street, which has gradually been rejuvenated after a slump in visitor numbers during the Covid pandemic, after which a number of sites sat vacant while a plethora ofcheap American candy shops moved in.In the past two years, the number of vacancies andcandy shops have droppedand the street has been boosted by new openings, including HMV, whichreturned to the site of its original storein November 2023, and the sportswear brand Under Armour.The seven-storey former Topshop building is also home to Nike Town, which is taking more space in some of the upper floors, an outlet for beauty specialist Space NK as well as office space.Explore more on these topicsIkeaLondonShoppingRetail industrySadiq KhannewsShareReuse this content"

We have been engaging with course providers for several years already, and we only grant approval where they meet our high standards.”In November, Wes Streeting, the health and social care secretary, announced an independent review of the PA and AA professions led by Prof Gillian Leng, the president of the Royal Society of Medicine.Danny Mortimer, the chief executive of NHS Employers, said: “The formal accreditation of the courses of study that PAs and AAs must complete is an essential component of regulation and public safety.“We await the outcome of the Leng review but recognise that individual NHS organisations also have a responsibility to support PAs and AAs to both use their knowledge safely with patients, and to ensure appropriate professional development and supervision.”Prof Phil Banfield, the council chair at the British Medical Association, said it was “difficult to understand” how the GMC could approve the courses when the Leng review into PAs and AAs has not concluded.He added: “The medical profession has alarming worries about the quality and robustness of these courses, with reports of exams with 100% pass rates.“We have made doctors’ concerns clear in our submission to the Leng review, which includes a call for an independent body of doctors, without links to course providers, to determine proportionate and safe expectations of what can be covered in curricula for assistant roles within a two-year training period.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

TheDepartment for Education(DfE) has missed its recruitment target for secondary teacher training in all but one of the past 10 years.With secondary school pupil numbers likely to peak in 2028, piling further pressure on the system, the NAO called on the government to publish a delivery plan, outlining how it intends to recruit the additional 6,500 teachers within the timeframe. It also urged ministers to “assess the extent to which the further education workforce model is fit for purpose”.Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the chair of the public accounts committee, said: “The DfE assesses that meeting the government’s pledge for 6,500 more teachers will be very challenging. Even if met, it is not clear that this will be enough to fix the nationwide shortage of teachers amidst growing numbers of students.“There needs to be a new cross-sector approach to recruiting and retaining enough high-quality teachers. Otherwise, workforce challenges will continue to pose a real threat to young people’s education and life prospects.”Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said: “Despite the government’s pledge, secondary schools and further education colleges face a challenge in securing enough teachers to support growing student numbers.”Jack Worth, the school workforce lead at the National Foundation for Educational Research, said the report sent a clear message to government that it would miss its 6,500 teacher recruitment pledge if it does not take action now.“Unfilled vacancy levels are at their highest rates since records began in 2010, with pay, stress from dealing with pupil behaviour and workload pressures reported to be contributing to teachers leaving the profession,” he added.“Properly funded pay rises are urgently needed alongside and non-financial measures, such as workload reduction and flexible working, to improve both recruitment and retention.” The Treasury has already saidany pay rises must come from existing budgets.Responding to the NAO report, Phillipson reiterated the government’s commitment to recruiting 6,500 more teachers. “We’re already seeing green shoots, with 2,000 more secondary school teachers training this year, alongside a boost in the number set to begin training in shortage Stem [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] subjects, but there’s still much more to do.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However it seems that it was conducted as a simulation and so may not be true to a real application process.”Explore more on these topicsTeacher shortagesTeacher trainingBridget PhillipsonLabourSchool fundingSchoolsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Before this study, no such comprehensive evaluation had been published.Exercise also seems to boost psychological wellbeing and overall quality of life, lending weight to its routine inclusion in treatment protocols for the disease, the study’s authors said.The findings of the review, led by Shengjing hospital of China Medical University, were published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. It included 485 associations from 80 articles, all evaluated as being of moderate to high quality. Types of exercise studied included aerobic and resistance exercise, high-intensity interval training, tai chi and yoga, among others.Exercise significantly reduced various side-effects associated with cancer and its treatment compared with usual care or no exercise, the study found.It lessened heart and peripheral nerve damage associated with chemotherapy, brain fog (cognitive impairment) and shortness of breath (dyspnoea).It also changed body composition and key physiological indicators of health, such as insulin, insulin-like growth factor, and C-reactive protein in people with cancer.Exercise also improved sleep quality, psychological wellbeing, the normal workings of the body and social interaction, while boosting overall quality of life.There was evidence of high to moderate certainty that preoperative exercise reduced the risk of postoperative complications, pain, length of hospital stay, and risk of death.“In conclusion, this study reinforces the efficacy of incorporating exercise into cancer treatment protocols,”the researchers wrote.“Moderate- to high-certainty evidence showed that exercise, compared with usual care or no exercise, significantly reduced cancer-related adverse events, improved body composition and biomarkers, enhanced sleep quality, psychological wellbeing, physical function, social interaction and overall QoL [quality of life].”Celene Doherty, a specialist cancer information nurse atCancerResearch UK, who was not involved with the study, said it provided further evidence that exercise could help reduce side effects from cancer treatment and improve long-term health.“However, cancer patients go through a lot when they are diagnosed, and focusing on lifestyle changes like being more active might sound overwhelming,” she added.“It’s important to take things at your own pace and do activities that are right for you.” She said patients who would like advice or support on their situation should speak to their cancer team.Explore more on these topicsCancerFitnessHealthCancer researchMedical researchnewsShareReuse this content"

Governmentstatistics for Englandrecorded 1.15m incidents in 2023-24, up 6% from a year before.While councils already have the powers to seize and crush vehicles used in fly-tipping, Defra said administrative hurdles mean this is rarely done, with the bulk of such action last year taking place under just two councils.As well as working with councils to make this easier, local authorities will also be able to charge fly-tippers for the cost of seizing and storing any vehicles. Police will be encouraged to help identify vehicles being used with drones and mobile CCTV cameras.While rules do not allow new policies to be announced specific to areas where elections are taking place on Thursday, national initiatives are permitted. With Labour expected to face a strong challenge from Reform UK, other new policies have covered topics such as immigration and policing.To unveil the initiative,Steve Reed, the environment secretary, visited a recycling centre in Wokingham, Berkshire, where a van used in fly-tipping was being crushed.Reed said: “Waste criminals and fly-tippers who blight our towns and villages have gone unpunished for too long. That ends today. The government is calling time on fly-tipping. I will not stand by while this avalanche of rubbish buries our communities.“Waste crime is trashing communities across the country. Fly-tipping has skyrocketed by a fifth while the number of prosecutions has fallen by the same amount since 2018-19.“The failure to punish these criminals has left our high streets, roads and countryside buried under an avalanche of rubbish.”In a parallel initiative, the Environment Agency will be given extra resources to carry out checks on licensed waste operators, with more powers to revoke permits for rogue companies, as well as fining them.Philip Duffy, the agency’s chief executive, said: “Waste crime is toxic. Criminals’ thoughtless actions harm people, places, and the economy, blighting our communities and disrupting legitimate businesses.“We’re determined to bring these criminals to justice through tough enforcement action and prosecutions. That’s why we support the government’s crackdown on waste criminals, which will ensure we have the right powers to shut rogue operators out of the waste industry.”Explore more on these topicsWasteEnglandLocal electionsLocal politicsLocal governmentSteve ReednewsShareReuse this content"

Moving along a line of refrigerated lorries, the teams in hazmat suits went about their grim work: preparing the remains of 757 Ukrainian military casualties handed over byRussiafor the journey back to Kyiv.Clipboards in hand, intermediaries from the Red Cross checked their lists. For each body shrouded in white plastic, the Russians had provided a number, a name, a location, sometimes a cause of death. And then, at the very bottom of the last page, a mystery entry: “NM SPAS 757.” The letters were abbreviations, taken to mean “unidentified man” and “extensive damage to the coronary arteries”.It would be weeks before officials could confirm what the Guardian and its reporting partners are publishing today. The unlabelled remains were those of a woman. Not a soldier, either, but one of the most high-profile civilians detained since the full-scale invasion.The journalist Viktoriia Roshchyna was captured in the summer of 2023 near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station. It was at least her fourth reporting trip into the occupied territories. She was by this stage of the war the only Ukrainian journalist prepared to risk crossing the frontline in order to pierce the information blackout imposed by Russia.Roshchyna died after a year in detention, aged 27.Information on the circumstances of her death is limited. Roshchyna was held without charge and without access to a lawyer. During her detention, her only known contact with the outside world was a four-minute phone call to her parents, a full year after she was taken.View image in fullscreen‘For her it was a mission’: Viktoriia Roshchyna at work.Photograph: hromadskePreliminary forensics suggest “numerous signs of torture”, according to the prosecutor. Burn marks on her feet from electric shocks, abrasions on the hips and head, and a broken rib. Her hair, which she liked to wear long and tinted blonde at the tips, had been shaved.Sources close to the official investigation have also disclosed that the hyoid bone in her neck was broken. It is the kind of damage that can occur during strangulation. However, the exact cause of death may never be known because when her body was returned during the exchange on 14 February, certain parts were missing, namely the brain, eyes and larynx.A war crimes investigation has been opened with a view to prosecuting those responsible.There were also witnesses to her suffering. The Guardian, working with media partners including Roshchyna’s publisher, Ukrainska Pravda, in a collaboration led by the French newsroomForbidden Stories, has tracked down first-hand testimonies to reconstruct the events that led to Roshchyna’s capture, and the details of her treatment in detention.This account, part of the Viktoriia project, is part of an investigationinto the abduction and systematic torture of whatUkrainebelieves could be as many as 16,000 of its civilians, the second part of which will be published on Wednesday.Most of those detained are being held without charge. The conditions of their detention constitute a suspected war crime, and evidence is being gathered for eventual prosecutions.The detained are aid workers, journalists, business owners, local politicians, church leaders, and anyone suspected of resisting the invasion. They are being held at more than 180 facilities in the occupied territories and inside Russia itself. And yet, in all the noise around peace talks, they are rarely mentioned. It is a subject Roshchyna felt was under-reported, and it was the focus of her last mission.The information about her final months has been gathered thanks to more than 50 interviews with survivors of Russian captivity as well as the families of some of those still held. Legal sources operating inside Russia and the occupied territories have also shared information, as have prison officials who resigned from the service in distress over what they had witnessed.While questions remain, one thing is certain: Roshchyna fell victim to the very crimes she had set out to expose.‘Extraordinary work’Known to her family as Vika, Roshchyna grew up in the shadow of war. Her father was a veteran of the Soviet war in Afghanistan, and she was 17 when Russia annexed Crimea. She and her sister were raised in the same town as Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Kryvyi Rih, where her parents still live, was 30 miles from the Russian advance into southern Ukraine in 2022.Colleagues said she was obsessed with work and uncompromising. “She had no life beyond her job, no friends, no partner. But also doing extraordinary work. For her it was a mission,” said Sevhil Musaieva, the editor-in-chief of Ukrainska Pravda. “She was one of the bravest journalists I met in my career.”View image in fullscreenWorkers in refrigerated lorries deliver the bodies of Ukrainian troops – and of Roshchyna – in February.Photograph: TelegramTo protect her sources, Roshchyna used multiple phones. She would set her messages to disappear, and her articles were written in files that would also self-delete. Roshchyna herself would vanish for weeks at a time, re-emerging to file her reports.In March 2022, while reporting from the occupied city of Berdiansk, she had a first brush with danger. Captured by a soldier and turned over to agents of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), she was coerced into recording a propaganda video and let go a few days later, after a public outcry.On her return home, colleagues urged her to rest and seek therapy. Her state of mind was fragile and she was very thin, they recalled.But Roshchyna continued to cross the frontline.She exposedthe intimidation of workers keeping the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station running, and investigated the shooting of two 16-year-old boys who had dared to oppose the occupation.Musaieva said that on Roshchyna’s last journey she was looking for the location of black sites, basements or industrial buildings where Russian security operatives systematically used torture to interrogate civilians or coerce them into false confessions. She was building a list of the FSB agents responsible.MapMelitopol ‘garages’Roshchyna left Ukraine for the last time on 25 July 2023, taking a roundabout route into the occupied territories because there were no safe passages over the frontline. At 2.09pm that day, her phone connected to a Polish mobile network. From Poland, she travelled through Lithuania and north into Latvia.A photo of her passport and her entrance form, obtained by this investigation, suggests she entered Russia from Latvia, under her own name, via the Ludonka border crossing. The card states she was heading to the city of Melitopol. She travelled 1,000 miles south through Russia, crossing into occupied Ukraine a few days later.On 3 August, just a few days into her trip, her father, Volodymyr Roshchyn, raised the alarm after realising she had stopped checking in to her online messaging accounts.Information he has gathered, together with the accounts of three people held with Roshchyna at a notorious prison in the Russian coastal town of Taganrog, just inside the Russian border, points to what happened next.One of the witnesses was her cellmate, who was released last September and recorded her testimony on video for the prosecutor. She has asked not to be named, to protect herself and her family.Roshchyna appears to have rented an apartment in Enerhodar, the dormitory town next to the Zaporizhzhia power plant. She paid in advance for three nights and, leaving her backpack behind, went out to search for black sites.The journalist told her cellmate she thought she had been spotted by a drone. A police car arrived and she was taken to the police station, a five-storey building covered in pockmarked blue tiles where the windows are reinforced with metal grilles. She was held there for several days before being moved 80 miles (130km) south to Melitopol.The name translates as city of honey, and the area is famous for its cherry orchards. During the occupation, it played a far darker role. “In Melitopol there is a big concentration of FSB and they have these temporary detention centres,” said a European intelligence official familiar with the situation in the occupied territories. In a process known as filtration, the FSB triages captives, depending on how valuable it deems them to be. Roshchyna is likely to have been considered a special case, given the information she was gathering.The prosecutor believes she was taken to a black site in Melitopol known as the “garages”, and according to her cellmate’s testimony, Roshchyna later recounted how she was tortured there. Her body was covered in bruises. “During interrogations, they used electric shocks … She got stabbed a few times – I saw them on her: arm for sure, leg too … Fresh knife scar – forearm, soft tissue between wrist and elbow. A scar of roughly 3cm, pierced through. She said one guy, she called him a jerk … was brutal, unhinged.“On her leg, above the heel – I saw that too, 5cm wound. She said: ‘I told them not to touch my leg … I begged them not to touch that wound.’”Towards the end of 2023, Roshchyna was told by an FSB officer she named as Maxim Moroz that she would be transferred to another prison and was promised better treatment there. According to witnesses, she was transported alone, by Jeep, to Taganrog. Here, she was detained at a pre-trial detention centre known as Sizo 2.Refusing food“She arrived already pumped full of unknown drugs,” said a second detainee who encountered Roshchyna at Taganrog, who cannot be named for security reasons. “She arrived and she basically started to go crazy.”View image in fullscreenThe conditions at Taganrog were among the worst at the many detention facilities used to hold Ukrainian soldiers and civilians.Photograph: Yandex MapsThe Guardian will publish a separate, detailed account of the abuses inflicted on Ukrainians held at Taganrog. The conditions there were among the worst seen at any of the many detention facilities operated by Russia.Ukrainian intelligence has recorded 15 fatalities at the prison, based on information from released troops. In the torture rooms, soldiers and civilians were water-boarded, beaten and shocked in an electric chair. When outside their cells, they were forced to adopt a stress position known as the swan – bent forward with their hands clasped behind their back at chest level. Food was severely rationed, with four and a half spoonfuls per plate, according to one detainee who counted.For Roshchyna, the effect was catastrophic. She stopped eating. “We would talk to her but she was lost in her head, eyes terrified,” recalled the first witness, her cellmate. Roshchyna would lie “curled up foetal on the floor” behind a curtain that screened the toilet, out of sight of the guards.Her weight dropped to 30kg (less than 5st). “She could stand up, but only with me helping as she was in such a state that she could not even lift her head off the pillow. I would prop her up and she would grab the top bunk to pull herself upright,” her cellmate said.Yevgeny Markevich, a soldier now in rehabilitation in Ukraine after a prisoner exchange, said: “She did not officially declare a hunger strike, she simply began to refuse food.” . He said he saw her once but heard her most days as she was held near to him, in cell 115. “At first she explained it by saying that it was for religious reasons, fasting or something, then she began to say that she could not [eat] for health reasons.”View image in fullscreenYevgeny Markevich, who is now in rehabilitation.Photograph: SuppliedRoshchyna’s feet and legs swelled, according to her cellmate’s testimony. She was offered heart pills but appears to have refused these. Heart problems and fluid retention in the leg tissues are both signs of starvation.In June, she was carried out on a stretcher. She spent several weeks at a hospital in Taganrog where, according to witnesses, she was watched over by six masked guards armed with machine guns. The level of security, and the efforts made to keep her alive, suggest Moscow saw her as a valuable negotiating pawn. In July, she was reportedly sent back to Taganrog with an IV drip in her arm. It seems she continued to refuse food.The head of the prison asked her cellmates what she liked to eat, and separate meals were cooked for her. Witnesses say she was offered bananas and sweets.In April 2024, her family had received thefirst official confirmationthat Roshchyna was alive, in a letter from the Russian defence ministry. It stated only that she “has been detained and is currently in the territory of the Russian Federation”.View image in fullscreenRoshchyna’s cellmate recording her testimony on video for the public prosecutor.Photograph: Slidstvo.InfoColleagues began pulling strings. A message was sent to the Vatican, where Pope Francis, who had been able to communicate with Russia through backchannels, agreed to ask for her name to be added to the prisoner exchange list.Word eventually reached her editor that she was to be released. Towards the end of August, Roshchyna was allowed to phone home. Her parents were told by the Ukrainian negotiators she was on hunger strike. They kept their mobiles switched on all day, waiting for her call. When she finally came on the line, Roshchyna was speaking in Russian. “I was promised that I would be home in September,” she told them. Her father urged her to eat. Then she said her farewells. “Well, that’s it. Bye, bye. Mom, Dad, I love you.”‘Not in the databases’On 13 September, bathed in autumn sunshine, 49 prisoners of war stepped off a coach from Russia on to Ukrainian soil. A welcome party met them with flags and bouquets of yellow sunflowers wrapped in blue tissue paper. Roshchyna’s cellmate was there, along with at least two other men held at Taganrog. But the journalist was missing.View image in fullscreenThe Taganrog prison’s director, Aleksandr Shtoda, claimed Roshchyna was ‘not in the databases’.Photograph: suppliedExactly why has never been made clear. On 8 September, Roshchyna was taken from her cell, ready for the long journey back to Ukraine. The anonymous Taganrog detainee was one of the last to see her alive.“We asked a girl from the cell to help her go down. With her help, she went down when they were supposed to exchange her. After that, a security officer came and said that the journalist never made it to the exchange. The officer added: ‘It’s her own fault.’”Some weeks later, the deputy head of Russia’s military police wrote to Roshchyna’s father to say she had died on 19 September.When Roshchyna’s body was eventually returned, it was in such bad condition that visual identification was difficult. However, attached to her leg, examiners found a tag with the handwritten inscription “V.V. Roshchyna”, and the DNA test was a match with her parents.Her father, in his grief, refuses to accept she is gone. He has requested additional examinations. And he has continued to write letters, including to Taganrog, demanding information. The Sizo director, Aleksandr Shtoda, has replied twice claiming Roshchyna was never there. His most recent response, in January, stated she “is not and was not listed in the databases”.In November 2022, Roshchyna described what motivated her. She had been given an award for courage by theInternational Women’s Media Foundation, but she did not want to stop work to attend the ceremony in Los Angeles and so she sent a message, hailing her colleagues.“We have remained faithful to our mission, to convey the truth to the world, countering Russian propaganda,” she said. “Unfortunately, many journalists have died. I want to dedicate this award to them. After all, they died in the fight for the truth, trying to record Russian crimes. I thank them.”View image in fullscreenA former colleague of Roshchyna holds a framed photo of her at an event in her memory in Kyiv last October.Photograph: Anatolii Stepanov/AFP/Getty ImagesExplore more on these topicsThe Viktoriia projectUkraineEuropeRussiaPress freedomfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As parts of Spain and Portugal wereplunged into a blackout on Monday, the swaying gondolas had come to a halt metres above the ground, leaving people trapped inside.About four hours later,video postedonline by the ski station showed a rescuer lowering themselves into a gondola to set up a system of ropes that allowed the skiers to rappel to the ground.The scene from Granada’s Sierra Nevada was among many harrowing tales that have emerged after an hours-long blackout that grounded flights,paralysed trains and metros, and cut off mobile communications across the Iberian peninsula.In the small Basque city of Eibar, 11 people were trapped in a public lift for more than three hours. “It’s unbelievable that this could happen,” Mempho Mujanovictold the newspaper El Diario Vasco. “Nobody can understand how, in the 21st century, we ended up spending so much time in a lift.”Cash, emergency food and wind-up radios: How to survive a power outageRead moreThe lift came to a halt as it was making the 40-metre descent from a school to the street below. As the temperature began to rise inside, some of the six trapped four-year-olds began banging on the glass doors, anxious to be let out.Metres below, people watched nervously from the street, shouting messages of support and urging them to stay calm as emergency workers scrambled to get them out.About 90 minutes later, rescuers managed to open a hatch in the lift, allowing cooler air to circulate and water to be passed around. Three-and-a-half hours into the blackout, they made it out. “Thank goodness the pregnant woman had some diapers in her purse, so we were able to take care of the little ones’ needs,” said Mujanovic.Across Spain andPortugal, the lengthy blackout unfolded mostly peacefully, with many flocking to bars and terraces – where some resorted to pooling cash or racking up IOUs as ATMs and card payment systems remained down.Others resigned themselves to walking kilometres tomake it homeafter metros and commuter trains came to a halt. Mobile phone coverage was scant, leaving many wondering if their loved ones were safe and sound.In Madrid and Lisbon, snarled-up traffic added another layer of complication, as the blackout had knocked out traffic lights. At most intersections, a crawling procession of drivers was left to negotiate waves of pedestrians, occasionally helped by police and, in one case, by a manwielding a baguette.On Tuesday, police said they were investigating four deaths connected with the blackout: a Madrid woman who died after a fire, possibly caused by a candle, broke out in her flat; and in northernSpain, an elderly couple and their son who are believed to have died of carbon monoxide poisoning linked to a malfunctioning generator.When the power went out, an estimated 150,000 people in Madrid were inside the metro and its facilities. About 44 trains ground to a halt in tunnels deep underground, forcing passengers to use their phones to light the way as they crossed tracks, platforms and stairs to make it to safety, according to the newspaper El País.The Madrid regional government said metro staff had spent the night combing kilometres of tunnels to ensure nobody had been left behind.View image in fullscreenA dark metro station in Madrid during the outage.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesFor many, their odysseys continued long after the power was restored. On Tuesday morning, about 26 hours after boarding a train in Barcelona, Patricia Díaz lamented that a six-hour trip to the south-eastern Spanish city of Albacete had become a journey still with no end in sight. “They’re returning us to Valencia,” shetold El País.She described herself as among the lucky ones, however, in that her train had come to a halt close enough to the station that she and other passengers had been able to get out and stock up on food and water at a nearby supermarket.Around midnight, they were told they would have to spend the night on the train. “I’m small and I’ve been able to curl up between two seats, but I’ve barely slept,” she said.The train that Renato, 64, and Diana, 70, tourists from Argentina, were on had travelled just 6km en route from Madrid to Barcelona when the power went out, leaving them trapped inside for nine hours as the temperature inside their wagon rose, drinking water ran out and the restrooms became unusable.Around midnight, the pair were back at Madrid’s main station, unsure what to do next. “We’re shipwrecked in the 21st century,” they told the news siteEldiario.es.Thousands of travellers across the peninsula faced similar dilemmas. With hotels full and spotty mobile coverage making it difficult to sort out other solutions, sports centres, train stations and airports were turned into makeshift refuges. “We all slept on the floor like dogs,” one woman stranded at Barcelona’s Sants station with a 10-year-old girl,told the BBC.As the power was restored late on Monday to central Madrid, some local people turned up at the main train station to help. Lola, 43, brought blankets and was offering to take people to hotels to check for vacancies, while Carlos, 34, and Claudia, 30, told Eldiario.es they had come to offer their spare bedroom and living room sofa to anyone in need of a place to stay.Spain and Portugal power outage: what caused it, and was there a cyber-attack?Read moreJavier Orquina, 50, wandered the train station with a cart full of groceries, handing out supplies. Living nearby, he said he had felt compelled to help after he saw the “mess” going on. “I put everything I had in the cart and came here,” he told the newspaper El Mundo.Analysts said those hit hardest by the blackout included the hospitality and retail sectors, as many were left grappling with spoiled stocks and a day’s lost earnings.At Disfrutar in Barcelona – currently ranked theworld’s best restaurant– the power went out just as the diners, many of whom had reserved their spots months in advance, were due to arrive. “The shopping was done, many had arrived from the other side of the world, and we had to serve them,” Oriol Castro, one of the restaurant’s chefs, toldLa Vanguardia.Staff were dispatched across the city to buy camping stoves and candles, said Castro, “which we set up through the kitchen so we could work”. The team went through the intricate menu, which spans about two dozen plates, figuring out which dishes could realistically be served without power and those that would have to be left out.They managed to pull it off. But when the meal came to an end, the lingering power outage meant they had another problem: how to charge diners for bills that had probably run into the hundreds of euros.With ATMs still out of service and card payment systems down, the team opted for trust. “We gave them the information so they could make a bank transfer in the next few days to settle the bill,” said Castro.Explore more on these topicsEuropeSpainPortugalEnergyEnergy efficiencyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The women of that play revolve around him like acolytes, from his obliging wife to an infatuated bookkeeper and, controversially, the romanticised figure of Hilda, who reminds him of “kisses” between them when he was a renowned builder and she just a child.InLila Raicek’s modern take, his wife – clever, accomplished and angry – is the fulcrum. Henry Solness (Ewan McGregor) is a “starchitect” and Elena Solness (Kate Fleetwood) is the head of a publishing empire who has arranged a dinner, inviting Henry’s long-estranged student, Mathilde (Elizabeth Debicki), with whom he had a tryst 10 years ago, when the Solness’s young son had just died. Love then was mixed with grief. Now it is reignited when Mathilde reminds Solness of what they meant to each other, retrospectively. “All that grief and all that rapture,” says Solness, as his memories come rushing back.Directed byMichael Grandage, this is Ibsen-adjacent rather than an adaptation or straight translation. Mathilde is given power and agency: she is a journalist and has written a novel inspired by her affair. There are throwaway references to Norway but the play is set in the Hamptons, with a lovely symbolist set by Richard Kent whose design has flecks of David Hockney in the flat blue sea in the backdrop and a modernist white slatted structure in the foreground which represents the chapel that Henry has rebuilt (it burnt down 10 years ago and took the life of his young son).This is very much a play about the consequence of infidelity on a marriage, and a wife’s pained rage (Ibsen’s Hilda was apparently inspired by real-life associations he had with younger women). Fleetwood is magnetic as Elena and she eclipses McGregor, who is boyishly earnest in his relationship with Mathilde, despite playing the older man. He seems genuinely in love and does not have the bearing of the narcissist he is supposed to be.View image in fullscreenPsychosexual power dynamics … Elizabeth Debicki and McGregor.Photograph: Johan PerssonThere is not quite the chemistry between Mathilde and Henry either, although both actors are able in their parts. Mathilde’s novel is called Master and there is some effort to evoke psychosexual power dynamics between them, but this does not contain enough heat.The script reckons with the problematic aspects of Ibsen’s play in many ways but also complicates them. There is talk of Henry’s grooming of the young Mathilde and Elena tries to create a #MeToo moment of public shaming but Mathilde is reluctant to define her experience as such.The clash between father and son, from Ibsen’s play, is dealt with in passing between Henry and Ragnar (David Ajala), an influencer and rival architect, rather than with Henry’s son. Instead, female camaraderie, treachery and generational difference is explored. Elena’s assistant, Kaja (Mirren Mack), mocks her so-called feminism and Mathilde speaks of how Elena “slut-shamed” her after her affair with Henry, while Elena herself mocks the younger women for all their talk about agency and power. A debate around the good/bad feminist is opened up in their judgments of each other but it sounds rather conceptual.The play is full of plot, especially in Elena’s many machinations. There are moments of great intensity, mostly in the scenes featuring Fleetwood, and real candescence to the writing at its best. The focus on the women is interesting and intriguing, even though it means Henry feels rather spare to the drama. This is a story not of genius men building castles in the air for their princesses but of what destruction they wreak in their homes in so doing. Really, it is the drama of The Master Builder’s Wife.AtWyndham’s theatre, London, until 12 JulyExplore more on these topicsTheatreEwan McGregorHenrik IbsenWest EndMichael GrandageElizabeth DebickireviewsShareReuse this content"

The answer: it dependsMadeleine AggelerTue 29 Apr 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Apr 2025 12.15 EDTShareHumans have long glamorized suffering, hailing it as an essential ingredient of growth. In the ancient Greek tragedyElektra, Sophocles wrote: “Nothing truly succeeds without pain.” In the 1980s, the actor and aerobics instructorJane Fondatold people: “No pain, no gain.”But when it comes to workouts, how much pain – specifically, how much post-workout soreness – is actually a good thing? The answer: it depends.“It’s not terrible if you become sore,” says Dr Michele Bird, a clinical assistant professor of applied exercise science at the University of Michigan School of Kinesiology, but soreness “is not required to maintain our overall fitness level”.So how sore is too sore? We asked experts.What is muscle soreness?Muscle soreness after a workout is also known as delayed onset muscle soreness, or Doms.Doms usually sets in 12 to 24 hours after a workout, says Bird. It feels like a dull achiness within the muscle. If the pain is sharp, or centered around a joint, that is probably not muscle soreness but something potentially more serious, says Bird.It’s not exactly clear what causes muscle soreness, says Dr Sarah Kuzmiak-Glancy, an assistant professor of kinesiology at the University of Maryland. Right now, she says, there is a general consensus within the medical community that the soreness we feel after a workout is a result of the body’s repair mechanisms.“When you do a workout, specifically resistance exercise – though also aerobic exercise to a degree – what you do is damage the muscle cells and connective tissue,” Kuzmiak-Glancy explains. As the body repairs this damage, it results in hypertrophy, or an increase in the size of muscle cells. This repair process can lead to soreness, which may be a result of inflammation that takes place while the body heals.Whatever causes Doms, it’s not lactic acid, she says.But what about all the PE teachers who said soreness was the result of lactic acid buildup in the muscle? “We have to kill this myth,” Kuzmiak-Glancy says. Lactic acid is an important chemical that the body uses to fuel muscles with oxygen. While it may be responsible for pain that occurs in the midst of exertion – the burn on your last three biceps curls, for example – it is generally metabolized and gone from the bloodstream within an hour.Is it good to be sore after a workout?It depends on who you are and what your goals are.There are times when one might want to push their physical limits, Bird says – maybe you’re trying to win a competition or achieve a personal record. Soreness after a workout like that is to be expected. But not every workout can or should be that intense.“One of the most common mistakes we make is that we keep trying to make personal bests each time we work out,” Bird says. Instead, vary the type of exercise you do and the intensity of your workout – that way, the body has time to recover.You are more likely to be sore when you first start a new type of workout that moves your body in ways your muscles are not accustomed to moving.“Soreness is your muscles learning something new,” says Jessie Diaz-Herrera, a certified fitness instructor and co-founder ofPower Plus Wellness.Diaz-Herrera says that while some people “associate soreness with doing a good job”, others may already struggle with chronic pain and want to avoid any additional discomfort.“We don’t want to exacerbate that pain,” Diaz-Herrera says.Diet culture– which emphasizes appearance and control, and does not take mental and emotional wellbeing into account – has co-opted much of fitness culture, Diaz-Herrera argues. “In reality, exercise is supposed to help our longevity,” she says. “Our goal is to make sure we can functionally live better every day.”Soreness isn’t necessary for that, she says. If you want to avoid Doms, Diaz-Herrera suggests measuring the success of your workout by asking yourself questions like: do I feel energized? Happy? Less stressed?And something is better than nothing, experts say. “Every contraction of your muscle is better than no contraction,” says Kuzmiak-Glancy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But exercising when you are experiencing excessive soreness puts you at risk for injury like muscle strain or joint injuries, says Kuzmiak-Glancy.Not only that, you won’t be able to progress meaningfully in your workouts because “you’re not setting your body up in a way to perform optimally”, Kuzmiak-Glancy.If you’re extremely sore, it’s important to give your muscles time to rest and recover. You can also engage in gentle movement like stretching or walking. “The best thing you can do for your body is continually moving your body,” says Diaz-Herrera.How do you prevent excessive soreness?First, make sure your body is adequately prepared and has enough fuel and water to make it through a workout, and to recover after.“If we’re dehydrated, we will definitely be sore,” says Diaz-Herrera.If you’re going into a high-intensity workout, eating some carbs beforehand can be helpful, Diaz-Herrera says. And protein after a workout is important to help your muscles recover. “That could look like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, or hummus and pretzels,” she says.An effective training plan that builds “day to day, week to week with slow, progressive increases” can also help mitigate Doms, Bird says. This also means only increasing one variable at a time – bumping up either speed or distance when running, for example, or only weight or reps during weight training.Training different muscle groups on different days can also prevent overexercising any single muscle.“I don’t work out the same muscle group two days in a row,” Kuzmiak-Glancy says. “So maybe I’m going to the gym seven days a week, but I only do biceps one day a week.”If you are sore after exercising, massages, foam rolling and light yoga can help muscles recover. But the best way to recover is to stick to the basics, Bird says: good nutrition, adequate sleep and managing your stress.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyFitnessfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But can she attract newcomers while keeping diehards happy? And is she having sleepless nights?Arifa AkbarTue 29 Apr 2025 14.30 EDTShareIndhu Rubasingham is starting her tenure at the National Theatre with a blast of bloody anarchy – of the ancient Greek variety. The opening play in her inaugural programme is a part verse, part spoken-word reworking of The Bacchae, which features orgiastic delirium and violent frenzy as a group of women tear a king to bits.Rubasingham will direct Bacchae (without its definite article) herself. This reimagining of the Euripides drama is the work of first-time playwright Nima Taleghani, better known as an actor (he featured inJamie Lloyd’s rapping Cyrano). There is a certain anarchic spirit to this kicking-off point: Rubasingham is putting a debut writer’s play on the NT’s biggest stage, the Olivier, which has never before showcased a first work.Bacchae’s trailer cuts between the glossy, blood-smeared lips of different members of the female chorus who coolly rap about the terror they have wreaked. “Chewed his face off,” they say, while a pair of lips suck a dismembered thumb as if it were a lollipop. Another trailer, for a forthcoming Hamlet directed by NT deputy artistic director Robert Hastie, shows Hiran Abeysekera as the Dane in dark shades and mischievous grin. “To be or not to be, innit,” he says with a glint. Hamlet is another symbolic choice: it was the first play Laurence Olivier staged when he founded the NT.Rubasingham is sitting cross-legged at one end of a sofa at the NT with Kate Varah, co-chief executive of the theatre with Rubasingham, on the other. Rubasingham thinks Bacchae is an apt way to launch her first season: the play revolves around Dionysus, who is the god of theatre – and the Olivier’s auditorium was architecturally inspired by the amphitheatre at Epidaurus, where The Bacchae was staged in the fifth century BC. “I think it’s an important statement,” she says. “I’m really excited about it. The Bacchae is one of our oldest plays. It harks back to the roots of western theatre, and Nima’s voice, language and skill are so refreshing. It’s contemporary to the point that a dear colleague, when he first read it, went, ‘Do you think you’re cool enough to direct this?’”Young and punkish it may be, but what will the purists say? “Well, The Bacchae has always been about disruption,” says Rubasingham. “It was traditionally staged around festival time so it had an anarchic quality. And if we’re going to do Hamlet, too, we’d better do something interesting, otherwise why would we want to see the play again and again and again?”You do pore over your first show and get angst-riddenIndhu RubasinghamSo far, so bold. Disruption is in fact a key theme of Rubasingham’s first season, alongside celebration, reinvention and internationalism. And music will apparently play a vital part in this programme, with one forthcoming collaboration between Rubasingham and none other than the rapperStormzy. Staging Bacchae in the Olivier is about challenging the idea of what gets played where, she says, and who gets the biggest platform. “For me, new writing sits in all three NT spaces, just as musicals sit in all three. One of the things we’re exploring is musicals in the Dorfman.” To that end, there is an adaptation of the 2014 film Pride,based on a true storyabout the LGBTQ+ community’s support for the 1984 miners’ strike.This does not necessarily herald an erosion of the established boundaries between the NT’s three stages, she says, more that decisions may be made on a case-by-case basis. “Bacchae,” she reflects, “is totally made for the Olivier.”Varah, who has been at the NT since 2022, adds: “It’s the right kind of risk.” She points out the juxtaposition of heritage and renewal in Rubasingham’s programme. “So taking something that has depth, rigour and legibility with an audience, and giving it a completely new take, renews people’s contract with the piece.”Might it also be about getting a different demographic through the doors – especially the longed-for younger generation? “What’s really important,” says Rubasingham, “is that thisNational Theatreis welcoming to the audiences that have loved it for decades, as well as new audiences. I hope it hits that sweet spot in appealing to younger audiences and people who love classical theatre.”View image in fullscreen‘Zadie Smith talking to Chaucer’ … The Wife of Willesden, directed by Rubasingham, at London’s Kiln theatre.Photograph: Marc BrennerShe has even coined a term for her blend of canonical and contemporary: the “modern mainstream”, which she hopes will redefine what people think of as mainstream. She recalls doingThe Wife of Willesdenwhen she was at the Kiln theatre. “It was Zadie Smith talking to Chaucer. I love these relationships between exciting, contemporary playwrights and the original author. That dialogue feels very alive.”Meanwhile, in a move thatwillappeal to traditionalists, the repertory system is to return, banner-headed by the mega-wattage of Paul Mescal. The Gladiator II star will perform in the first of two rep seasons: in A Whistle in the Dark, directed by Caitríona McLaughlin,and Death of a Salesman, directed by Rebecca Frecknall.Rep has been missing from the NT since 2019, a factbemoaned by playwright David Harein recent years. Is this connected to his very public protest? “No, not at all,” says Rubasingham. “I’m very fond of David but that’s not it.” It was halted due to Covid, adds Varah, out of survival instincts: putting on two shows featuring the same actors is much more costly and complicated than it was a decade or two ago.Rep will be tried out on the Lyttelton stage for a season. “This is an opportunity to think about a hybrid model we could bring back, in some of the stages in some of the seasons. It enables those who want to play with it, but won’t be a structural barrier to everything else we want to programme. One actor might say, ‘I can’t do it because I’m contracted to X.’ And then we’ll do a straight run. But if there’s another who says, ‘I’m energised and excited and will keep myself free’ then we can plan. It’s all about being agile and allowing the artist and audience to come first.”Mescal practically bit Rubasingham’s hand off when she offered him the chance to rep. “We were talking about a particular play,’ she says, “and then, when we started talking about rep, he gotsoexcited.” Mescal has won plaudits for his stage work but is still more of a screen A-lister. Does this trend towards “celebrity casting”, prevalent on Broadway and in the West End, make for a healthy theatre ecology?View image in fullscreenPractically bit off Rubasingham’s hand … Gladiator II star Paul Mescal will try rep.Photograph: Aidan Monaghan/AP“It’s lovely to get Paul Mescal in a rep season,” she simply says. “That’s exciting and he’s a brilliant stage actor. It’s always going to be about the quality – and it’ll make people excited about coming.” What about farther afield? Is it not a danger to keep going down this road? “I don’t think it’s a danger at all,” says Rubasingham. “I think where it goes crazy is in America as ticket prices become $900.”But in London, I point out, the tickets for some of Jamie Lloyd’s shows have jumped to several hundreds, likewise for Rebecca Frecknall’s Cabaret. “It’s hard because it’s a different model. If I were a commercial producer in the West End, I’d probably do the same thing. That’s why I’m so excited about being here – I don’t have to put myself in that position.”After a thoughtful pause, she adds: “I think those shows that have really expensive tickets allow producers to take a risk on something else. That’s the balancing act.”View image in fullscreenWatch this space … Stormzy is announced as one of Rubasingham’s forthcoming collaborators.Either way, says Varah, celebrity casting means something different at the National, where the average price of a ticket is £33, with a quarter of all tickets costing under £25. “There’s joy for a teenager or school student coming in to see an actor they might have seen on screen,” she continues. “A teenager may think, ‘I’ve seen them on telly so I trust going into this place I might not have walked into before.’ We would never want the commercial to subjugate the art. But there is actually a valid audience development point. We’re the gateway to theatre for young people.”The theatre, they point out, has also democratised access via its digital schemes such as NT Live, allowing audiences to see Andrew Scott in Vanya at the cinema for cinema prices, or at homewith NT at Home, accessible in 184 countries and free to schools.Rubasingham looks eminently at home here on the sofa, and in talking about programming. After a long handover period, when outgoing directorRufus Norrisfinally left the building, he wrote her a card. “It was very, very, very sweet,” she says. “I didn’t find it until a few days later. He’d just written, ‘You’ve got this.’”She certainly sounds as if she has. Does she feel this is the case? “Because I’ve been an artistic director before, and I’ve worked here numerous times before, there’s a familiarity. It’s big, 10 times bigger than the Kiln, but all the principles are the same. It wasn’t a shock to the system.”So no sleepless nights over this first big reveal? “I haven’t had sleepless nights – but you pore over what’s going to be the first show and get really angst-ridden. Everyone’s going to have an opinion about it. I wanted to find the right thing that says the right thing. And it’s been wonderful asking writers what they want to write about, meeting actors, musicians, composers, choreographers. It’s a world of possibilities. That’s thrilling.”Explore more on these topicsNational TheatreIndhu RubasinghamTheatreRufus NorrisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Not just the movie, with its clumsily forced narrative beats and whiplash tonal shifts. But also, its title characters, the broken and lonely souls who ditch the colourful costumes and wear their emotions on their sleeves, as if it’s their brand.Havoc review – Tom Hardy’s gonzo gun mayhem misses the pointRead moreThese reluctant heroes, led by Florence Pugh’s Yelena Belova, the troubled sister to Scarlett Johansson’s late Black Widow, are defined by how much they need therapy. They wrestle with themselves more than the bad guys, in a way that’s more pronounced than the most unstable among Marvel’s stable of wisecracking world saviors. They’re endearingly vulnerable, at times devastatingly so, and yet still fun and exciting enough to save Marvel.The globe-dominating franchise, biding its time until the next wave of Avengers movies, has been in desperate need of saving, what with recent misfires like The Marvels and Captain America: Brave New World. And Thunderbolts, which happens to be the best thing to come from the brand since WandaVision (still the high watermark), gets the job done.You would be forgiven if you’re wondering who the hell the Thunderbolts* even are. The title stylized with an asterisk playfully winks at the general air of uncertainty around them. In the comic books, Thunderbolts started out as a series where, in the Avengers absence, villains disguise themselves as heroes. Here they’re a Suicide Squad-like team up consisting of villains and antiheroes, repurposed supporting figures from some of Marvel’s more forgettable movies and TV shows.David Harbour returns as Yelena’s dad Alexei Shostakov aka Red Guardian, who has been slumming it as a limo driver ever since the events in Black Widow, while readily on-call for hero duty. Wyatt Russell’s John Walker, the disgraced Captain American replacement, who was fired after he murdered an unarmed insurgent in The Falcon and The Winter Soldier, also checks in for duty. There’s also Ant-Man and The Wasp’s villain Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen) and, the most popular among them, Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), the former Winter Soldier. He’s all too familiar with the redemption journey the Thunderbolts, all haunted by sins from their past, are embarking on. But this time, the redemption is two-fold. It belongs to Marvel too.I would be remiss not to point out that this franchise has a pretty good track record with B-teams like this. The whole MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) got off the ground with leftovers like Iron Man, Captain America and Thor, after all – when more popular heroes like Spider-Man and the X-Men had been loaned out to other studios. And when these would-be Avengers became the dominant force in entertainment, the Guardians of the Galaxy, complete with a machine gun toting raccoon and a tree voiced by Vin Diesel, came out of left field to grow into fan favourites. It’s as if, when Marvel is unburdened by familiarity and the entitled demands of fans, they can approach something, dare I say, original.OK, maybe original is too much, then and now. Thunderbolts is more like a fresh spin on the familiar Avengers formula, one that, as Pugh inferred in an interview with Empire Magazine, borrows some trendy touches from indie A24 movies. The latter studio is behind Midsommar, the gruesome thriller where Pugh came on hard with the trauma, and Oscar-winner Everything Everywhere All At Once, which casts a large shadow over the plot and climactic action in Thunderbolts.The action, so often imbued with and even led by personality, immediately feels different from its opening frames, which actually boasts captivating aesthetics – a rarity in the Marvel universe. “There is something wrong with me,” are the first words we hear from Pugh’s Yelena, as she teeters over the edge of Merdeka 18, one of the world’s the tallest building. She takes a deep and meaningful breath, as if she’s comfortably embracing death (and this won’t be the first time she does that), before leaping off the ledge.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Marvel Studios. © 2025 MARVEL/PAShe’s not taking her own life, but throwing herself into combat, engaged in impressive acrobatic choreography that’s often shot from a distance or even overhead, as if disembodied, giving us the space to observe its thrills while also reflecting where she’s at emotionally. She’s talking about her feelings while throwing roundhouses. Her dry internal monologue riddled with flip gallows humour that fits the mood, as if she’s detached from those emotions she identifies in comical though not necessarily healthy ways.Her mission is to destroy evidence, covering the tracks for Julia Louis-Dreyfus’s scheming CIA director Valentina Allegra de Fontaine, who Congress has in the hot seat for her questionable tactics. On another such mission, Yelena, along with fellow covert operators Ghost and John Walker, are themselves the targets. They’re sent to take each other out. After a nifty little brawl, they decide, despite their antisocial behaviour, to work together instead.They also happen upon Bob, who Lewis Pullman plays as an undefined mass of anxieties and yearning. He’s a top-secret human guinea pig, genetically engineered with cataclysmic superhuman abilities, which, as you would expect, goes bad. Here, Thunderbolts borrows a little from Josh Trank’s Chronicle, which was also about giving superpowers to someone in crisis.‘I was being a sassy Karen’: Florence Pugh’s skyscraper stunt positions her as the new Tom CruiseRead moreThe eventual showdown between the Thunderbolts and Bob’s supervillain side the Void, who consumes humans in dark shadows, is ambitious if also ungainly, taking place largely in surreal internal spaces that Yelena amusingly dubs “interconnected shame rooms”. The characters battle their emotions, fighting for healing, as the movie tries Everything Everywhere-style to wrestle some theatricality out of all this. That climax makes for an admirable attempt at doing right by the movie’s mental health themes, which Thunderbolts, more often than not, doesn’t earn.It’s already hard to take this stuff seriously in a franchise trying to earn some goodwill as it nudges our attention towards upcoming Avengers movies. Thunderbolts often irritates because the depression and trauma the movie supposedly grapples with so often lives on the surface, like easy characters traits that are spoken out loud or worn like another costume fitting.But if it ultimately works, it’s all due to Pugh, who can wrestle sincerity out of a screenplay (and a franchise) that has so little, capturing a whole emotional arc in just her moments of silence. She’s a superhero performer, easily navigating the tricky balance between cheeky Marvel-brand humour and genuine pathos.Thunderbolts can be messy, sure. Pugh is the kind of star who can thrive in such mess.Thunderbolts is out in US and UK cinemas on 2 May and showing in Australian cinemas nowExplore more on these topicsSuperhero moviesMarvelFlorence PughAction and adventure filmsJulia Louis-DreyfusSebastian StanComics and graphic novelsreviewsShareReuse this content"

On opening night of her Cowboy Carter world tour at the four-year-old SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, she brings forth a sweeping, theatrical spectacle that reclaims country music, reframes American identity and reminds everyone who’s still driving pop’s evolution after all these years. Her nearly three-hour, seven-act performance draws heavily from Cowboy Carter – her Grammy-winning country epic – and threads in nods to Renaissance, the ballroom-infused predecessor that lit up stadiums barely two years ago. Rather than stake a claim in country, Beyoncé goes deeper: celebrating the Black roots of the genre and exploding its boundaries with precision, power and polish.Country music is cool now – even the pop girlies are leaning into it. I’ve finally been vindicated | Rebecca ShawRead moreOutside SoFi, vendors hawk more cowboy hats than you’d see at a Los Tigres del Norte show. Inside, anticipation sizzles. Projected across the massive stage-length screen: CHITLIN’ CIRCUIT – a nod to the historic Black music venues where blues, country and rock took shape. The show begins with American Requiem – the Sign o’ the Times-drizzled opener from Cowboy Carter – followed by a haunting Blackbiird. Then comes a defining moment: a Hendrix-inspired Star-Spangled Banner, laced with the thunder of Freedom, flashing red, white and blue. The screen reads: “Never ask permission for something that already belongs to you.”Images of Linda Martell and other Black country pioneers flash behind her asBeyoncé– in a white Mugler leather set and matching cowboy hat – thanks “those who came before me” and praises fans for “giving me the creative liberty to challenge myself”. Ya Ya kicks the tempo up, Blue Ivy joining the dancers as Beyoncé shakes off her cowboy hat and flips her hair like it’s 2003. By the time she reclines on a throne and a robotic arm pours her a whiskey, the crowd is all in.Act two opens with a sharp-shouldered, Janet Jackson-flecked America Has a Problem, delivered behind a press podium. Then come Spaghettii, Formation and Diva, the last complete with a deadpan TikTok-inspired bit. The band rises on three-story platforms as horns blast and dancers swarm. Blue Ivy returns, nailing the Déjà Vu choreography and earning a roar from the crowd.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Parkwood EntertainmentAct three softens. Alliigator Tears and Just for Fun give way to Protector. “This is my first time singing these songs,” Beyoncé says. “I’m so happy to be singing them with you.” Her seven-year-old daughter, Rumi, joins her onstage, beaming and waving mid-song. Behind them appears a tribute: “I once had a thousand desires / But in my one desire to know you / all else melted away.” Throughout, Beyoncé’s attention to detail is unmatched. Every movement and frame is measured. Her team – a small city of dancers, designers, stylists and crew – maintains astonishing cohesion. The show is genreless in the best sense: fiddles accompany gospel vocals, a robotic arm shares space with a golden mechanical bull.Visuals and interludes deepen the themes. Western vignettes cast Beyoncé as an outsider. In one stylized duel, an older white cowboy unloads bullets – they bounce off her body. She is, as ever, bulletproof. Desert Eagle, Riiverdance and II Hands II Heaven follow under warm, glowing lights. During Sweet Honey Buckiin’, Beyoncé and her dancers groove in chaps and belts while Blue Ivy takes center stage again.The Renaissance era still pulses: she rides a mechanical bull during Tyrant, just as she once rode Reneigh, her disco horse. “Welcome back to the Renaissance, y’all,” she says, as I’m That Girl, Cozy and Alien Superstar unfold with the same crisp choreography and glittering, refashioned props. Then comes Daddy Lessons, performed live for the first time since 2016’s Lemonade tour, as Beyoncé flies across the stadium on a massive pink horseshoe. Cuff It gets a sweaty, slowed-down treatment on a satellite stage. Later, she nods to Destiny’s Child with elements of Bills, Bills, Bills in Thique, images of the group playing onscreen.As the show stretches toward its final act, the transitions grow looser but no less captivating. A remix of Texas Hold ’Em melts into Crazy in Love and Heated, before Before I Let Go lifts the crowd to a final release. The songs still come fast – 36 in total – but there’s space for moments, too. For 16 Carriages, Beyoncé boards a glowing red convertible and soars above the stadium, leading a massive singalong. She closes with Amen – the bookend that concludes Cowboy Carter – draped in a US flag gown in front of a masked Statue of Liberty head with braided hair: a final image both symbolic and searing.At 43, Beyoncé isn’t circling the globe like she did for Renaissance – but her 10th concert tour is a theatrical, tightly executed masterwork. She isn’t here to prove she belongs. She’s here to remind us she already owns it. And if this is only Act II, the real takeaway might be just how powerful Act III will be when it finally lands.Explore more on these topicsBeyoncéCountryPop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

WhyKemi Badenochwas out and about giving interviews for the second day running, looking and sounding as if she wasn’t completely fed up. With a smile that could have passed for genuine. This wasn’t the Tory leader we had come to know and to whom we had become largely indifferent.Kemi had been punching the air asthe Canadian election results came in. It was all beyond her wildest dreams. Not just a victory for the Liberal party, but the personal failure of the country’s Conservative leader. Pierre Poilievre had not just lost a 20-point lead in a matter of months, he had also lost his own seat. He was now officially a nonentity.Hopefully Robert Jenrick would follow suit. It was Honest Bob who had been leading the Tories’ charge to worship at the knee of Poilievre. As recently as last year, he had been writing articles for rightwing publications in praise of the CanadianConservatives. They were the future, he had gushed. They were the role model for Tories in the UK. Vive Pierre!It’s not often that a plan comes together, so Kemi was determined to enjoy her moment. And all the better that it had come good onDonald Trump’s 100th day in office.Most people in the UK didn’t have a good word to say about the US president. They didn’t like the way he implicitly condoned whatever Vladimir Putin did. Happy to give away parts of Ukraine to the Russians that the Ukrainians were unwilling to concede. They didn’t like the way Agent Orange had sent JD Vance to Rome to finish off the pope. Francis should have been allowed to die in peace. Mostly, they just didn’t like Trump. Didn’t like his friends. His attitude.And to be fair, Kemi hadn’t been entirely thrilled about any of this either. But she had been a great deal more enthusiastic about the trade war. A chance to see Keir Starmer squirm as he sucked up to Trump. Sycophancy on a par with Chris Philp. And getting almost nothing in return. A bully is always going to bully. The UK wasn’t even first in line for a trade deal. Or even in the top 10. And whatever happened we were going to have to suck up the same 10% tariffs as the Heard Island penguins. Good. The UK on the floor, just where Kemi wanted it while Labour was in power.ButCanadahad been her personal project. In her few phone calls with the new US administration, she had always urged them to treat Canada as the 51st state. It’s what Canadians want. Even if they don’t know it yet. And the president had duly obliged. With predictable results. A massive backlash against America and a turnaround in fortunes for the Canadian liberals. All of which left Jenrick looking like the halfwit she knew him to be.So, all in all, Tuesday was a good day. God bless The Donald. And God bless the Canadians. Who cared that the UK Tories were heading for a disastrous set of local election results? Certainly not her.Kemi was even up for an interview with the BBC’s Matt Chorley on Radio 5 Live. At her most cheerful when suggesting she would personally deport hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants. Or criminals as she preferred to call them. She had no idea where she was going to deport them to, mind. She wasn’t going to get into details. Maybe just put them on to planes and see where they crashed when they ran out of fuel.Would she resign if the local election results were as bad as feared? KemiKaze couldn’t contain her amusement. Absolutely not. Surely if the Canadian elections proved anything, it’s that the Tory party should not rush to do anything. “Anyone who thinks that this is an overnight task and that changing leader yet again is the solution is not paying attention,” she said. Mentioning no names, Honest Bob. But if the cap fits. If the Tories really wanted to replace her with an idiot who admired a foreign politician who could lose a 20-point lead in a heartbeat, then they were even more deluded than she had thought.Elsewhere in Westminster, little stirred. Almost as if everyone was just marking time before the Thursday elections. Nor was it just Kemi who was trying to manage expectations. Everyone was at it. Despite Reform being narrow favourites to win the Runcorn byelection, Nigel Farage was downplaying his chances.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But he’s deadly serious about winning power, even if he has no idea what to do with it once he has it. So serious that he pulled Richard Tice from a Channel 4 debate on Wednesday night. Voters have a habit of taking an instant dislike to Dicky the moment he opens his mouth. Scrub that. He doesn’t even need to say a word. One look is enough.As for Labour, Starmer was keeping a low profile. His most effective form of campaigning given his current popularity. Busy using the time to think of a way of congratulating The Donald on his achievements in his first 100 days. “You’re great, Mr President. The best. The very best. People are loving you. They only wish you could do more. Have you thought about becoming Pope? You could do Poping. You want me to bend over? Just tell me how far.”It was left to Ellie Reeves to get Labour’s excuses in early. The Tories were making it easy for Reform in Runcorn by not campaigning, she said. Kemi’s smile just got bigger. There were benefits to the Tories being so toxic. Just don’t ask about any possible deals with Farage.Explore more on these topicsKemi BadenochConservativesCanadaLocal electionsLocal elections 2025AmericasLocal governmentcommentShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The Sage Bambino Plus is a £350 espresso machine that leaves the espresso brewing to you but automatically steams the milk at the press of a button. I don’t want to spoil the surprise, but this is probably the best beginner’sespresso machineon the market. Whether you’re starting out or just want to upgrade from a more basic machine, such as the excellentDe’Longhi Stilosa, it’s a great choice.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The simple design and ease of use are all part of the appeal and are among the reasons why I still enjoy using it as much as I do, despite far pricier machines dotting my household. To be clear, this isn’t a fully assisted machine that holds your hand throughout the process. You still need to learn the manual espresso ropes by dialling in the correct grind size and dosage for the perfect shot. But the combination of the useful tools in the box and an informative, helpful manual means that even beginners will soon find their feet.Once you’ve done your bit – brewing an espresso to the best of your ability – the Bambino Plus is happy to take over. Fill the supplied stainless steel jug with a little milk, place it on the drip tray and submerge the steam wand, then all that’s required is to press one of the little buttons on the machine’s front and wait. The quiet rumble and splutter turn to a rhythmic pulse, and after a minute or so, your jug of cold milk is steamed to a hot, silken froth. Pour the milk into your espresso, and voilà – you’re now a barista. Congratulations. I’ll have a cappuccino, please. No sprinkles.View at CurrysView at AmazonWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreen‘Almost everything you need comes in the box.’Photograph: Sasha MullerThe Bambino Plus’s silver exterior evokes the polished metal of far pricier machines, but its compact footprint tiptoes more daintily on the kitchen surface, making it perfect for slotting in neatly between microwave and food mixer. And its price, while hardly pocket money, puts it firmly in the realms of the affordable runaround when compared with the four- and five-figure tags of turbocharged enthusiast machines.Almost everything you need comes in the box. There’s a stainless steel milk jug, a light plastic tamper, a razor tool for getting the pucks of ground coffee just so. There’s also a little pin mounted on a plastic fob for clearing the steam wand’s nozzles when they inevitably get blocked with dried milk. You get a light metal portafilter, which is helpfully accompanied by a range of baskets for single and double shots.The reason I sayalmosteverything is because the one essential missing is a coffee grinder. I’d recommend something likeKingrinder’s K6 (£99), if you can put up with a hand grinder, orBaratza’s Encore ESP (£159.94), if you can stretch to it. A pair of scales to measure out your dosage of beans would also come in handy. I’d recommend buying some that are accurate to at least 0.1g.Everything you need to make great coffee – and the kit that’s not worth your moneyRead moreThe selection of filter baskets is useful, especially for those just starting out. The single- and double-shot pressurised baskets are ideal if you want to make espresso from supermarket ground coffee: the dual-wall construction aims to increase the brew pressure to create a frothy, richcremafrom coffee that’s neither ground finely enough nor as fresh as it could be. If you do have access to fresh, good-quality coffee and a grinder, then you can use the unpressurised baskets instead. That’s what I’d recommend doing.SpecificationsType:manual espresso machine with automatic milk frothingDimensions:19 x 36 x 30cm (WDH)Water tank:removable 1.9lReplaceable water filter:yesAccessories supplied:54mm portafilter (3 ear),tamper, razor dosing tool, water filter, 480ml milk jug, pressurised baskets (single and double), unpressurised baskets (single and double), cleaning tool, back flush discTime to heat up:6secsTime to steam milk:56secsGrinder included:noNoise:46dB (brew), 59dB (steam)Weight:5.9kgWarranty:two-year repair, replace or refund at Sage’s discretionWhat we loveView image in fullscreenSimple buttons mean the Sage Bambino Plus is easy to use.Photograph: Sasha MullerView at CurrysView at AmazonThe Bambino Plus is easy to get to grips with. The front fascia is simply laid out, with a couple of bigger buttons for pouring single or double shots. There’s a button to start the milk frothing and two smaller buttons to tailor the milk temperature and frothing level – each of which is adjustable through three preset amounts. It doesn’t hurt that the user manual is written to be read and referred to rather than flung immediately into the recycling bin.Around the back, the removable 1.9-litre water tank feels sturdy and clips home with a reassuring thunk. There’s a single ClaroSwiss water filter in the box, which slots into the bottom of the tank and provides up to three months of filtration.Replacement filters cost £14.95.That water is heated by a Thermoblock boiler, which takes only three seconds to heat up, unlike traditional boilers. Turn on the machine, and the buttons flash for a few seconds, then illuminate constantly once the brew temperature is reached. Unlike most sub-£500 machines, that brew temperature is managed by a PID temperature controller to maintain the right degree of heat, crucial for creating a consistently rich, flavourful espresso. There’s even low-pressure pre-infusion, a feature generally found only on pricier machines, which saturates the coffee puck with water for a more even extraction.Pouring a perfect espresso still requires trial and error – par for the course with any manual espresso machine – but Sage’s user manual andcatalogue of YouTube videosmake it as undaunting as possible for beginners. Even if you don’t have accurate scales, the razor tool ensures you don’t overfill the filter baskets, and getting that unctuous texture of espresso – almost slowing to a drip but just barely flowing into the cup – is a fairly simple case of adjusting the grind size and dosage. As with most things, a little patience reaps rewards.Those rewards are uniformly lovely indeed. I tried various medium- and dark-roast beans from my usual roaster,Craft House Coffee, and the Bambino Plus did a good job with all of them. The only potential shortfall is that the preset brew temperature isn’t hot enough to get the best from light roasts, so it’s tricky to get a balanced-tasting shot – they tend towards sourness. If light roasts are your thing, you’ll need to look for a pricier machine with an adjustable brewing temperature.For anyone wondering why they can’t just save a few bob and opt for the standard Sage Bambino instead, well, you can – but I’d advise against it. The Bambino omits the automatic milk frothing and lacks the pressure-relief valve of the Plus. The utility of the latter shouldn’t be underestimated: if you grind so fine that the machine chokes and espresso slows to a drip, the Plus will release that pressure into the drip tray. Do the same on the standard Bambino, and your only option is to remove the portafilter, at which point the pressure will escape suddenly and sneeze coffee grounds and brown water in every direction.Scientia potentia est-presso.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

For instance, pouring a few shots of hot water through the empty pressurised portafilter gets everything nice and hot, making it easier to get consistent-tasting shots. You can use that water to preheat your cups – the top of the Bambino Plus has a ridged area for cups, but it doesn’t get usefully hot enough.If you’re wondering why there isn’t a hot water button for americanos and the like, then you’ll find the answer on page 14 of the manual. Press the single-shot and milk-foam buttons simultaneously, and the steam wand will do exactly that. Frankly, though, a dedicated button wouldn’t have gone amiss – hopefully Sage will add one for the Bambino Plus’s eventual successor.If you’re a fan of fast, hassle-free coffee and you’ve managed to read this far, then I’d still strongly advise that you consider this purchase carefully. The theatrics of grinding, measuring, tamping and brewing are all part of the appeal of manual espresso, but this is still nowhere near as immediate as a capsule or bean-to-cup machine, despite the Bambino Plus’s rapid warmup and automatic milk frothing. I’d keep a less involved brewing method – a cafetiere, AeroPress or perhaps even a basic capsule machine – close to hand for when you want a less involved brewing process.My final quibble is that the price could be more competitive. Pre-pandemic, the Bambino Plus used to retail for about £250 – the price soared during the appliance shortages of lockdown and never came back down. If its current price of £349.95 is too spendy for your liking, then patience will reap rewards: you’ll regularly find it discounted during sale periods.Warranty and repairabilityView image in fullscreenRepairing the most common problems costs between £80 and £120.Photograph: Sasha MullerSage provides a two-year repair or replace warranty against faulty workmanship and materials – as you’d expect, anything deemed to be standard wear and tear isn’t included. If a replacement machine is warranted, it’s worth noting that the original warranty period is not extended.Should issues arise outside the warranty, however, most of us would rather avoid retiring a coffee machine to landfill. I spoke with Radu Bria, the owner ofespressorepairshop.co.uk, a coffee and espresso machine repair business in Stockport, to get his opinion on the Bambino Plus’s repairability.It gets off to a good start: Bria indicated that it was easy to disassemble the machine to access the internal parts, which isn’t always a given on more affordable machines. He did raise that sourcingreplacement partscan take time, as there’s only one official supplier in the UK, and restocking takes several weeks.Going by the Bambino and Bambino Plus machines that pass through his workshop, the most common problems are a faulty solenoid coil, a faulty temperature probe/sensor or a blocked thermojet due to hard water – and repairing these costs from about £80 to £120. If you’re hoping to keep the Bambino Plus brewing beyond its warranty period, it should be possible to maintain it for a good few years. However, when it comes to a blocked thermojet, don’t think that the included filter – or a simple water-filter jug – will prevent limescale. It won’t: you’ll need an under-sink water softener or reverse osmosis filter to achieve that.Sage Bambino Plus: should I buy it?Quibbles aside, the Bambino Plus is quite possibly the most perfect beginner machine. Over the several years that I’ve owned one, it’s been one of my favourites for its ease of use, small footprint and quality brews – and that’s despite a multitude of pricier pretenders having attempted to usurp its place in the kitchen. The only question that remains is whether I really need a fourth cappuccino before lunchtime.

Is that where politics has got to?No, that’s where the discussion began, about who would win: 100 men or one gorilla?At what? Chess? Life?Life would be interesting. No, a fight of course. A hundred men against one silverback gorilla.Like when100 Japanese kids played football against three professional footballers?Not really, becausethat actually happened(the kids lost 1-0). This is purely hypothetical.It would be the way to settle it, once and for all: 100 men v 1 silverback. No rules (try explaining theMarquess of Queensberry Rulesto an ape), anything goes.True, but animal rights people might have something to say about it.Human rights people, too, possibly.Anyway, the debate has kicked off again, when the question was posed to X users last week. Since then it’s been raging onFacebook,TikTok,YouTube, all your socials.Mr Beast even weighed in.On whose side?Mr Beast is, despite the name, a man. One man.I know! The influencer.Actually, he didn’t really say who he thought would win.100 men obviously– we used to hunt mammoths.With spears.We’ve got spears, and you said no rules.OK, then the gorilla has an AK-47 … Anyway, the point is, it’s what one user called a“real interweb discussion”.Other examples of which are… Man v bear.Bear obviously, plus I’ve seenGrizzly Man.Man v shark.Duh! Shark! (see Jaws).Bear v shark. (Also a novel,interestingly.)Blue dress v gold dress?Thedress. Exactly. Those viral debates that gain momentum and plot twists with the addition of videos and memes.But ultimately aren’t that important?Maybe not, but perhaps they bring people together in a different way from the usual toxic conversation online. A humorous distraction.From work, too.See also the real world.Andto return to 100 men v 1 gorilla: what about women?What about them?Where do they stand on this important issue?Well, I’m afraid some are seeing it as a way to get rid of some unwanted men. “Can I be the one that specifically picks the 100 men to fight the gorilla?”one posted.Followed by: “I have a list.”Do say:“Yeah, but the silverback can not just lift – but throw –up to 815kg!”Don’t say:“So when are we getting the reality TV show of this?”Explore more on these topicsLife and stylePass notesSocial mediaAnimalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The S&P 500 is down 6% this year, versus a gain of 2.5% for FTSE 100 index and a 3% improvement in the pan-European Stoxx Europe 600. The differences aren’t enormous but they mark a reversal from recent years.Will that be enough to stop the “exodus” of UK and other European companies to the supposedly higher-valued and more liquid US markets? The thesis – plodding European versus dynamic US – has been the popular narrative for years as the likes of the plant hire groupAshtead, the plumbing group Ferguson and the Paddy Power-owningFlutterhave moved their primary listings to the US. It has become obligatory to describe every departure as “another blow” to London.Well, here’s a “reality check” report from the New Financial thinktank that ought to be digested by any footloose board of a UK-quoted company that imagines its share price would be higher if only the listing was in the US. It ain’t necessarily so.The report identifies 130 European companies, including 51 UK ones, that have moved to the US over the past decade, whether by switching their listing, listing for the first time or merging into a US shell entity. The collection is large, no question – worth $676bn (£504m) in today’s money at the time of the moves. On the other hand, it’s also just 2% of the number of European companies.View image in fullscreenThe London Stock Exchange. The FTSE 100 index has gained 2.5% this year.Photograph: Tolga Akmen/EPABut the startling finding is the post-switch performance. The analysis shows that 70% of European companies that have moved to the US are trading below their listing price; fewer than a fifth have beaten the S&P 500; and three-quarters have not beaten the European market after their move.The numbers, it should be said, are skewed by the appalling performance of European companies that joined the brief US fad for SPACs, or “blank cheque” special purpose acquisition companies. Of the 42 firms that took that route, nine went to zero (thinkCazooand theelectric van firm Arrival). But even among the mature companies that simply switched their listings, the share price performance amounts to roughly a par score: 44% have performed better than the European market since they moved.Why might that be? Simply because the valuation premium on US markets (about 30% at the last count) doesn’t translate at the level of individual companies or sectors. A large chunk of the go-go US rating is accounted for by the massively greater weighting of highly valued and large technology firms. As New Financial puts it: “US stocks have a higher valuation because they have higher growth and higher return on equity, not because they happen to be listed in the US.”None of which is to say that European firms should never move. For some, it will make sense. Revenue-wise, Ashtead and Ferguson had morphed into US entities. Sweden’s Spotify had probably outgrown its home market. Sadly, it was probably commercially reasonable for SoftBank torelist Arm Holdings, the UK’s most celebrated tech firm, in the US where it could rub shoulders with the likes of Nvidia. And the US undoubtedly has advantages in biotech.The point, though, is that the grass is not always greener, except (from the point of view of executives) when it comes to boardroom pay, which one suspects is a swing factor in some cases. There have been successes – Arm is definitely in that camp – but the overall performance of departers “suggests that moving is not a panacea”, says the report.It is not prescribing complacency and is full of ideas to improve European stock markets by making them less fragmented. But, in the hierarchy of market-related things to worry about, US drift is probably not top of the pile, especially if Trumpian chaos is now deterring corporate tourists.Instead, here is the report’s genuinely alarming statistic: 1,000 listed companies in Europe, with a combined value of more than $1tn, have been acquired by private equity and privately held companies in the past decade. The march of private equity still feels like the bigger threat to stock markets.Explore more on these topicsBusinessNils Pratley on financeStock marketsFTSEEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

IneptitudeRobert ReichFrom deportations to human rights to the economy, the president’s actions have resulted in mayhem. Here’s a samplingTue 29 Apr 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Apr 2025 14.22 EDTShareSome Democrats fear they’re playing intoDonald Trump’s hands by fighting his mass deportations rather than focusing on his failures on bread-and-butter issues like the cost of living.But it’s not either-or.The theme that unites Trump’s inept handling of deportations, his trampling on human and civil rights, his rejection of the rule of law, his dictatorial centralization of power,andhis utterly inept handling of the economy is theineptnessitself.In his first term, not only did his advisers and cabinet officials put guardrails around his crazier tendencies, but they also provided his first administration a degree of stability and focus. Now, it’s mayhem.A sampling from recent weeks:1. The Pete Hegseth disaster.The defense secretary didn’t just mistakenly share the military’s plans with the editor of the Atlantic; we now know he shared them with asecondSignal group, including his wife, brother and personal lawyer.He’s a walking disaster. John Ullyot, who resigned last week as Pentagon spokesperson, penned anop-ed in Politicothat began: “It’s been a month of total chaos at the Pentagon.” Last Friday, Hegseth fired three of his senior staffers. His chief of staff is leaving. As Ullyot wrote, it’s “very likely” that “even bigger bombshell stories” will come soon. The defense department “is in disarray under Hegseth’s leadership”.It’s not just the defense department. Much of the federal government is in disarray.2. The Harvard debacle.ATrump official isnow claimingthat a letter full of demands about university policy sent to Harvard on 11 April was “unauthorized”. What does this even mean?As Harvard pointed out, the letter “was signed by three federal officials, placed on official letterhead, was sent from the email inbox of a senior federal official and was sent on April 11 as promised. Recipients of such correspondence from the US government – even when it contains sweeping demands that are astonishing in their overreach – do not question its authenticity or seriousness.”Even though it was “unauthorized”, the Trump regime isstanding by the letter, which has now prompted Harvard to sue.3. The tariff travesty.No sooner had Trump imposed “retaliatory” tariffs on almost all of the US’s trading partners – based on a formula that has made no sense to anyone – than the US stock and bond markets began crashing.To stop the selloff, Trump declared a 90-day pause on the retaliatory tariffs but raised his tariffs on China to 145% – causing markets to plummet once again.Presumably to stem the impending economic crisis, he declared anexemptionto the China tariffs for smartphones and computer equipment. By doing so, Trump essentially admitted what he had before denied: that importers and consumers bear the cost of tariffs.Now, Trump is saying that even his China tariffs aren’t really real. Following warnings from Walmart, Target and Home Depot that the tariffs would spike prices, Trump termed the tariffs he imposed on China “very high” and promised they “will come down substantially. But it won’t be zero.”Markets soared on the news. But where in the world are we heading?4. The attack on the Fed chair fiasco.When Trump renewed his attacks on Jerome H Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve – calling him “a major loser” and demanding that the Fed cut interest rates – Trump unnerved already anxious investors who understand the importance of the Fed’s independence and feared that a politicized Fed wouldn’t be able to credibly fight inflation.Then, in another about-face, Trump said on Wednesday he had “no intention” of firing Powell, which also helped lift markets.An economy needs predictability. Investors won’t invest, consumers won’t buy, and producers won’t produce if everything continues to change. But Trump doesn’t think ahead. He responds only to immediate threats and problems.Who’s profiting from all this tumult? Anyone with inside knowledge of what Trump is about to do: most likely, Trump and his family.5. The KilmarÁbrego García calamity.After the Trump regime admitted an “administrative error” in sendingÁbrego Garcíato a brutal Salvadoran torture prison, in violation of a federal court order, Trump then virtually ignored a 9-0 supreme court order to facilitate his return.To the contrary, with cameras rolling in the Oval Office, Trump embraced Nayib Bukele – who governs El Salvador in a permanent state of emergency and has himself imprisoned83,000 people in brutal dungeons, mostly without due process. Trump then speculated about using Bukele’s prisons for “homegrown” (ie, American-born) criminals or dissidents.Meanwhile, after the Trump regime deported another group of immigrants to the Salvadoran prison under a rarely invoked 18th-century wartime law, the supreme courtblocked it from deporting any more peopleunder the measure.6. Ice’s blunderbuss.Further illustrating the chaos of the Trump regime, immigration officials have been detainingUS citizens. One American was held by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) in Arizona for10 daysuntil his relatives produced papers proving his citizenship, because, according to his girlfriend’s aunt, Ice didn’tbelievehe was American.Last week,the Trump regime abruptly took action to restorethe legal status of thousands of international students who had been told in recent weeks that their right to study in the United States had been rescinded, but officials reserved the right to terminate their legal status at any time. What?Freedom depends on the rule of law. The rule of law depends on predictability. Just like Trump’s wildly inconsistent economic policies, his policies on immigration are threatening everyone.7.

This was supposed to be the first big “gotcha” from the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), but as we know now, it was a lie. The US government buys condoms for about 5 cents apiece, which means $50m would buy 1bn condoms or roughly 467 for every resident of Gaza. Besides, according to afederal 2024 report, the US Agency for International Development (USAID) didn’t provide or fund anycondoms in the entire Middle Eastin the 2021, 2022 or 2023 fiscal years.Then there have been the frantic callbacks of fired federal workers, such asup to 350 employees at the National Nuclear Security Administrationwho work on sensitive jobs such as reassembling warheads. Four days after Doge fired them, the agency’s acting director rescinded the firings and asked them back. Similarcallbacks have occurredthroughout the government.Trump and Musk are threatening the safety and security of Americans – for almost no real savings.8. Measles mayhem.As measles breaks out across the country, sickening hundreds and killing at least two children so far, Trump’s secretary for health and human services, Robert F Kennedy Jr, continues toclaimthat the measles vaccine “causes deaths every year … and all the illnesses that measles itself causes, encephalitis and blindness, et cetera”.In fact, the measles vaccine is safe, and its risks are lower than the risks of complications from measles. Most people who get the measles vaccine have no serious problems from it, theCDC says. There have been no documented deaths from the vaccine in healthy, non-immunocompromised people, according to theInfectious Diseases Society of America.Kennedy also says: “We’re always going to have measles, no matter what happens, as the [measles] vaccine wanes very quickly.” In fact, the measles vaccine is highly protective and lasts a lifetime for most people. Two doses of the vaccine are 97% effective against the virus,according to the CDC and medical experts worldwide. The US saw3m to 4m casesa year before the vaccine. Today it’s typically fewer than 200.9. Student debt snafu.After a five-year pause on penalizing borrowers for not making student loan payments, theTrump regime is about to requirehouseholds to resume payments. This could cause credit scores to plunge andslow the economy.Many of the households required to resume paying on their student loans are also struggling with credit card debt at near-record interest rates and high-rate mortgages they thought they would be able to refinance at a lower rate but haven’t. Instead of increasing education department staffing to handle a work surge and clarifying the often shifting rules of its many repayment programs, the Trump regime has done the opposite and cut staff.10.Who’s in charge?In the span of a single week, the IRS hadthree different leaders. Three days after Gary Shapley was named acting commissioner, it was announced that the deputy treasury secretary, Michael Faulkender, would replace Shapley. That wasthe same day, not incidentally, that the IRS cut access to the agency for Doge’s top representative.What happened? The treasury secretary, Scott Bessent,told Trumpthat Musk had evaded him to install Shapley.Meanwhile, the Trump regime is cutting the IRS in half – starting with6,700 layoffsand gutting the division that audits people with excessive wealth. These are the people meant to keep billionaires accountable. Without them, the federal government will not take in billions of dollars owed.At the same time, the trade adviser Peter Navarro has entered into a public spat with Musk, accusing him of not being a “car manufacturer” but a “car assembler” because Tesla relies on parts from around the world. This prompted Musk to call Navarro a “moron” and “dumber than a sack of bricks” in a post on X, later posting that he wanted to “apologize to bricks”.The state department has been torn apart by thefiring of Peter Marocco, the official who was dismantling USAID, by Marco Rubio, the secretary of state. Career officials charged that Marocco, a Maga loyalist, was destroying the agency; Trump’s Maga followers view Marocco’s firing as a sign that Rubio is part of the establishment they want to destroy.Worse yet, Trump hasfired more than a half-dozen national security officialsafter meeting with thefar-right agitator Lara Loomer, who was granted access to the Oval Office and gave Trump a list of officials she deemed disloyal.Bottom line: no one is in charge. Trump is holding court but has the attention span of a fruit fly. This is causing chaos across the federal government, as rival sycophants compete for his limited attention.Incompetence is everywhere. The regime can’t keep military secrets. It can’t maintain financial stability. It can’t protect children from measles. It cannot protect America.While we need to continue to resist Trump’s authoritarianism, we also need to highlight his utter inability to govern America.Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.

With friends like that, POTUS surely won’t be carrying his own clubsTue 29 Apr 2025 09.05 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Apr 2025 17.08 EDTShareAt what point does realpolitik tip over into nakedly facilitating conflict of interest/corruption? I only ask in the strictest hypothetical terms after reading that Keir Starmer’s government has been exploring whether golf bossescould host the 2028 Open championshipat Donald Trump’s Turnberry resort in Ayrshire. Sorry, but no. It’s almost as if the prime minister is compiling material for a seminal 2025 business manual. Call it The Art of the Kneel. Perhaps Starmer could ask the Treasury to “explore” buying a load of Trump meme coins.According to reports, Donald Trump has frequently mentioned in his phone calls with the prime minister that he’d prefer it if the Open returned to Turnberry. As so often with this particular caller, the reply to this should simply be, “And I’d prefer to be talking to Mickey Mouse, but we’re all making compromises.” Failing that, just go with: “God, you always want MORE, don’t you? Scotland invented the great game of golf.Have you said thank you ONCE?” Unfortunately, the actual reply seems to have been: “Capital idea, Mr President! How can we make that happen?”And so it is that officials from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport are said to have been sounding out the R&A – which organises the Open – as to the potential obstacles to Turnberry hosting the championship, an event almost as lucrative as it is prestigious. Turnberry has made a profit precisely once in the past 10 years, and is currently one of the many operating companies run by Trump’s sons, Uday and Spewday. It lost £1.7m last year, but the advent of a major championship would certainly turn that around. Alas, the R&A effectively suspended Turnberry from the list of eligible Open venues over the matter of the January 6 attack on the seat of US democracy, which the club’s owner had, of course, fomented.But the new R&A boss, Mark Darbon, has made more positive noises about the course, at the same time as stressing that infrastructure at the location remains a challenge given how much the event has grown in size in recent years. Darbon has previously said that keeping pace with that growth would require 60,000 hotel beds. I can only imagine what the prime minister is thinking. “Wait, so someone would need to build some more hotels? What a great opportunity for some lucky business genius …”Honestly, why doesn’t our permanently ingratiating government go the whole hog and start putting money into Trump’s crypto project, which this week saw the president announce he’d have dinner with the top 220 holders of his $Trump cryptocurrency token – a pledge that promptly earned him and his allies$900,000 in trading feesin under two days. One senator called this “themost brazenly corrupt thinga president has ever done”, somehow not adding the words “since maybe last week”. After all, we are dealing with a man who turned the White House lawn into a car sale for his friend Elon Musk, on a date that feels about a million years ago, given how much has happened since. But, upon checking, turns out to have been only last month. And as discussed here way back then, these are not the vibes of a nation whose best days are ahead of it, which is why sinking to Trump’s level feels as humiliatingly post-moral as it is strategically useless.Whitehall officials ‘pushing for the Open to return to Trump-owned Turnberry’Read moreTo the consternation of a huge and growing number of people in the UK, we are already giving him a second state visit, Starmer having produced the King’s invitation on camera in the Oval Office two months ago, with all the excruciating flourish of a magician pulling a hat out of a rabbit. The diplomatic diarists are supposedly zeroing in on a run of dates in September for that horror show, which last time saw D-day veterans and British troops being “inspected” by a draft dodger who described trying not to get STIs in 1980s Manhattan as “my personal Vietnam”. Enduring another round of this is supposedly our best card.Yet what have we got out of playing it? Not tariff exemptions, or security guarantees for Ukraine – or indeed security guarantees for ourselves. No world leader has ever got anything out of inviting Trump into their gifting suite, yet they keep doing it, perhaps imagining that repeating the same play multiple times and expecting different results is the definition of statecraft.Evidently, another bauble must always be found. To anyone who thinks about it for more than 10 nanoseconds, even discussing the possibility of returning the Open to Turnberry while Trump is president lays you open to being involved in mucky inducement. But weirdly, giving personally valuable gifts in supposed exchange for preferential treatment seems to be legit when the recipient is the president.We can only speculate about quite why civil servants should be required to conduct these grubby little feasibility studies. Perhaps Starmer is too cowardly or wet to find a way of explaining to Trump that obviously it wouldn’t be appropriate, and has instead kicked the president’s persistent inquiries down the chain, in the hope that someone else will make the decision instead. Maybe the guy who runs the golf. That would be an interesting impression for a country to give of itself, wouldn’t it – the idea that the only thing stopping Starmer from leaning wholly into an obviously immoral quid pro quo is the width of the A719. And that the person who makes the tough decisions isn’t the prime minister, but the chief executive of the R&A.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Now he’s pulling up the ladder behind himChristopher MarquisFederal funding was critical to Tesla’s survival, yet the Doge boss now derides subsidies as government overreachTue 29 Apr 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Apr 2025 14.10 EDTShare“Pulling up the ladder after you’ve climbed it” refers to a familiar social pattern: achieving success thanks to certain advantages – then working to dismantle those very structures, denying others the same opportunities. Many have cited immigrant Trump voters as an example; some who have benefited from relatively open immigration policies now advocate for stricter border controls and cuts to legal immigration. The American upper middle class have been dubbed “dream hoarders” who, after achieving success, work to keep the bottom 80% down with a variety of subtle barriers, such as legacy college admissions and exclusionary zoning.Few individuals embody ladder-pulling more starkly than Elon Musk. Though he has been lauded as a self-made innovator and visionary entrepreneur, Musk’s empire only exists thanks to the support of massive public investment. Yet as leader of the “department of government efficiency” (Doge), he has directed and overseen the dismantling of the very government programs, regulations and subsidies that enabled his rise.Musk’s companies, particularly Tesla, SpaceX and SolarCity, have benefited from an estimated$38bn in public support, including government loans, tax credits and federal contracts. In 2010, Tesla received a $465m low-interest loan from the Department of Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) program. That funding was critical to keeping Tesla alive – without it,insiderslater told the Washington Post, the company would have gone under. The success of Tesla’s flagship Model S, the expansion of its manufacturing base, and even the illusion of its early profitability were all bolstered by public money.Zero-emission vehicle credits and the $7,500 federal EV tax credit were equally pivotal. Tesla earned billions by selling regulatory credits to legacy automakers struggling to meet emissions standards. In the first nine months of 2024 alone,43% of Tesla’s net income came from these credits. The company also profited from California’s emissions credit system through a scheme involvingphantom battery-swapping infrastructure– credits that provided hundreds of millions in additional income.Despite this, Musk now derides subsidies and regulations as government overreach and has used Doge to slash many of the same types of programs – such as renewable energy incentives and federal climate investments – that once saved his own companies from bankruptcy. These were essential to Tesla’s success, and now he wants to limit other entrepreneurs and businesses from the same opportunities.While Musk claims he aims to eliminate “waste”, his companies continue to benefit from government contracts. SpaceX has received more than$17bn in federal awards since 2015, including lucrative Nasa contracts and taxpayer-funded Starlink deployments in Ukraine. The irony could not be more profound: Musk attacks the legitimacy of public spending even as his empire remains one of its top beneficiaries.The craven self-interest that drives this behavior is particularly on display when considering Musk’s newfound advocacy for policy built on climate denial. Tesla was conceived in the shadow of climate change – and succeeded largely because US federal and state governments treated climate as an emergency. Regulatory frameworks created demand for EVs. Emissions credit markets made Tesla profitable. Yet Musk has now aligned himself with climate deniers like Vivek Ramaswamy and Donald Trump,dismissed environmental, social and governance(ESG) concerns as “the devil”, and supported deregulation plans that could allow polluting industries to ignore environmental rules altogether and make it harder for other EV companies to grow. This is not just hypocrisy – it’s a calculated repositioning: he made his fortune as a climate-focused entrepreneur, and now he aims to protect his personal and political power through climate skepticism.Elon Musk did not succeed in a vacuum. In America, we are inclined to celebrate the heroic individual entrepreneur while ignoring – and even downplaying – that massive public support was the foundation of their success. Consider the iPhone: nearly all of its core technologies, from GPS and touchscreen displays to the internet itself, were publicly funded. Covid vaccines and the pharmaceutical industry, too, have relied heavily on NIH-funded research.And yet, Musk, Steve Jobs and other tech titans are cast as heroic innovators, while the state is derided as inefficient or meddlesome – even as it continues to underwrite the very innovations that fuel the economy. Further, while the risks of developing these innovations are mitigated by public funding, the profits they create are almost entirely privatized. If American taxpayers had taken equity in Tesla for their $465m investment,it is estimatedsuch a stake would be worth over $300bn today. Instead, it is Musk alone who has enjoyed such wealth.To deny that is to erase the role of taxpayers, government scientists and policy architects who built the foundation upon which Tesla, SpaceX and many innovative industries rest. But Musk’s recent efforts – whether gutting climate policy, leading anti-regulatory initiatives, or supporting anti-democratic actors – represent not just a betrayal of that legacy, but a systemic effort to pull up the ladder and rewrite the rules to benefit only himself.Ultimately Musk’s story is a warning: those who climb the ladder with public help are inclined to later destroy the mechanisms that led to their success. For Musk to admit that he had substantial help to become the world’s richest man would undermine the lone genius narrative that has granted him astonishing power with impunity. By pulling up the ladder, “lone geniuses” don’t just block others from the same opportunities, but also undermine the very idea of collective progress and investment in the public good. The outcome will be the erosion of future innovation and, ultimately, a well-functioning society.Christopher Marquis is theSinyi professor of management at the University of Cambridge and author of The Profiteers: How Business Privatizes Profits and Socializes Costs.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskOpinionUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

What if I told you this was also a way to protest capitalism?Tue 29 Apr 2025 10.51 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Apr 2025 22.30 EDTShareSomewhere in Zhejiang province,China, a woman is living my dream. She gets up in the morning and then, almost immediately, goes back to bed. She lies prostrate all day long, scrolling, eating some food, opening some packages, showering at 2am, then snoozing again. As a longtime sleep enthusiast – and the mother of a child who thinks that 5am is a good time to start the day, all systems go – I think this sounds like bliss.The woman in Zhejiang is known as @jiawensishi – and also “rat person”. I am not being rude; that’s what shecalls herself. There are lots of rat people out there: it’s a whole trend in China. You might have heard of the “lying flat” movement a few years ago, when young people lazed around displaying symptoms of mild depression, and some thinkers, including the novelist Liao Zenghu, theorised that it was a passive-aggressive resistance movement, rebelling against the demands of materialism and capitalism. Well, “rat people” are arodenty reboot.You may be a rat person if you lack any desire to climb the career ladder as well as any desire to do, well, anything except for eating, sleeping and scrolling. Moving to the UK is, apparently, a risk factor for going full rodent. According to the South China Morning Post, “Chinese students studying abroad in the UK are among the most visible examples of rat people. Faced with grey, rainy skies and high living costs, many of them choose to stay indoors, avoiding social interaction to conserve their mental and physical energy.”It is a principle of the 21st century that if somethingcanbe monetised, then itwillbe monetised. And despite the fact that rat people are supposed to be rebelling against the demands of hustle culture, a fair few seem to be leaning into it. A cartoon character called Big Rat, the unofficial mascot of the movement, has been slapped on merch andreportedly brought in over one million yuan($140,000) in sales. According toBloomberg, “One influencer named Wang Yutong has already started using the ‘rat person’ idea to promote a skincare product.”The crypto kids are going to get in on this and we’re going to have a RatCoin soon, aren’t we?

We had no light, no power, no phone signal, not even water in some apartment buildings.Traffic lights were out across the capital. Police officers and volunteers could direct traffic on only a few of the major avenues, but pedestrians still managed to cross the streets, with most drivers stopping or slowing down of their own accord.Not every supermarket was open, but many were still selling food in an orderly manner. People shared tips on which stores were accepting credit cards. At a small bazaar in my neighbourhood, customers were asking how many torches were left so others behind them in the queue could also buy one.Hospitals continued working on backup generators, but non-urgent operations were cancelled. Home care became a major challenge: elderly neighbours had to climb eight or nine flights of stairs in some buildings, mechanical lifts for bedridden patients stopped working and insulin supplies in people’s homes were at risk as fridges lost power.View image in fullscreenA street in Madrid in darkness, 28 April 2025.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesMadrid’s subway was quickly evacuated, but thousands of passengers were stranded for hours in high-speed trains acrossSpain, never reaching their destinations. Drivers queued for fuel in petrol stations, many unable to pay without cash. Some people walked to get home, while others waited it out in bars and outdoor cafes –luckily the outage struck on a warm spring day.As I walked through Madrid, I joined crowds gathered around the few available radios. One driver had parked their car, rolled down the windows and had the radio on loud so others could listen. It made a street in my district one of the best places in the city to follow the news. A group of young people took some chairs out. Many listened attentively. People were worried, but there were laughs too and cheers for the communal radio.At elDiario.es, the Spanish newsroom I work for, breaking news coverage was managed by our teams in the Canary and Balearic Islands, which were unaffected by the outage, and by the deputy editor, who had been sent to Rome to cover the pope’s funeral and the conclave. At around sunset, I finally managed to send a few messages, standing on a street corner in front of a closed bank where the wifi was miraculously still working.View image in fullscreenPeople walk up steps in Lisbon next to an inactive escalator, 28 April 2025.Photograph: Armando França/APWithin about 12 hours, power had been restored to most of Spain, a remarkable turnaround given the severity of the outage. The Iberian blackout showed the resilience of basic services – and for me, the calm with which most people reacted was remarkable.But this extraordinary event has also exposed our many vulnerabilities in a power-dependent and internet-reliant world. Few had conventional radios, offline phone alternatives, or even emergency supplies. Most of us live in small apartments, so stockpiling is uncommon. Above all, we had little idea of where to go in case of an emergency other than home or work. Civil protection infrastructure and preparedness are not part of our collective thinking.I recalled the words of Keir Giles, a defence expert, who told me a few weeks ago in relation to the risks of hybrid war and other emergencies in Europe: “The farther west inEuropeyou go, the less idea people have of where they can go for help, support, shelter, food and evacuation in the event of a crisis.”When the European Commission recently recommended that every household prepare asurvival kit, the typical reaction among Spanish citizens and politicians was laughter and disbelief. The Spanish foreign minister said the kit was a way to “worry citizens needlessly”. Even Spain’s European commissioner, Teresa Ribera, a vice-president of the EU executive, said she was “surprised” by the way the initiative had been introduced.Spain went through an especially brutal Covid pandemic and has endured several big climate-related emergencies, includingsevere flooding in Valenciajust six months ago. But even after these crises, many Spaniards still view emergencies as things that happen elsewhere, in other parts of Europe, to other people in the world.The war at the heart of Europe still feels distant, despite copious evidence of hybrid attacks originating in Russia, including the killing of a former Russian pilotwho had defectedto Spain. Europe’s critical infrastructure must be vulnerable in the current geopolitical climate.It’s still too early to know what caused this historic blackout in the Iberian peninsula. Opposition parties are already attacking the government for supposedly acting too slowly in keeping the public informed or identifying the cause, but this was frankly impossible in such a short timeframe. What is clear is that governments and citizens need to be better prepared for these uncertain and dangerous times. Monday was a jolt; a reminder that civil emergencies don’t just happen to someone else.María Ramírez is a journalist and deputy managing editor of elDiario.es, a news outlet in SpainExplore more on these topicsSpainOpinionEuropeEnergy industrycommentShareReuse this content"

His novels include Tell Her Everything and The CollaboratorTue 29 Apr 2025 11.27 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Apr 2025 12.08 EDTShareBy all accounts, the26 people killedlast week in a picturesque meadow in Pahalgam in Kashmir were selected for slaughter by the militants on the basis of their religion. We’ve readheart-rending testimonyof how the families watched as the men, almost all Hindu, were shot from close range. These wereunconscionable killings. We’ve also read how Kashmiri tourist guides and pony operators rescued many Indian tourists, at great risk to their own lives.Whether this attack was carried out by Pakistani militants, local Kashmiris, or both, is immaterial to the families of the dead. Their lives are destroyed, along with the Indian state’s carefully constructed facade of normality in the region – a facade sustained by the tourism boom of recent years.We have been here many times before. For nearly four decades, Kashmir has gone through cycles of bloodletting, periods of relative calm, triumphant declarations of normality and wilful conflations of silence with peace – for it to start all over again. In 2019, too, we were told about the return of normality, that the conflict was over. But that image was shattered that February when Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammedattacked a paramilitary convoy, killing 40 Indian soldiers and bringing the two countriesto the brink of war. In many ways, in addition to the three warsthey’ve actually foughtsince 1948, the two countries have always been on the brink of war – they hover around it for periods of time, then come back, arms and rhetoric raised.A generation has grown old with this catastrophic binary, thecost mostly borne by Kashmiris, more than 70,000 of whom have been killed, about 10,000 disappeared, and over 200,000 Kashmiri Pandits (Hindus) displaced since the uprising against Indian rule in 1989, and by Indian citizens killed in bomb blasts or attacks such as the one in Pahalgam. It would be absurd to suggest that violence of this kind emerges from a vacuum, for the origins of lethal violence lie both in our history and politics: in the still-festering wound of partition in 1947 on religious lines and the unresolved nature of the dispute over Kashmir.How has India reacted to attack in Kashmir and why are tensions in region so high?Read moreSince 2018, India has ruled the region directly via a governor appointed by Delhi; the following year Narendra Modi’s government formallyerased Muslim-majority Kashmir’s limited self-rule. Although there’s now an elected chief minister in place, the position has been effectively rendered titular – so defanged that in a high-level security meeting earlier this month, the current incumbent, who is a Kashmiri, was left out. To exercise control over the territory, India maintains a huge military force, estimated to bearound half a million soldiers, both inside Kashmir and on the de-facto border with Pakistan.The people ofKashmirhave had little or no say in their future for as long as I can remember. In seasons of normality, they are allowed a semblance of localised power and an increase in economic activity, but it’s often short-lived, because every few years, the tensions bubbling under the surface burst into the open.Pakistan, which rules the other half of Kashmir, is saddled with multiple problems, mostly emerging from the military’s hubristic hold over power, which has crippled the country economically and politically. Its forever-fledgling democracy was dealt a body blow when the country’s most popular political leader of the last decade, Imran Khan, wassent to prison in 2023rather than being allowed to lead his party in elections the following year.The country’s status as a leveraging player in regional geopolitics has diminished considerably since the US withdrawal from Afghanistan and the Taliban takeover. It is no longer a partner in the “war on terror” because the US has lost interest in that war. For the military to justify its monopoly over the state, it has historically used Kashmir as a chip: Pakistan needs a strong and well-financed army because, one day, we will liberate Kashmir fromIndia. So far, it has failed spectacularly in this mission – it was left watching from the sidelines when a resurgent Hindu nationalist India fully annexed its half of Kashmir.Pakistan accuses Indian agenciesof sponsoring the rising insurgency in Balochistan; in particular, the hijacking inMarch of a train by Baloch militants. India has historically accused Pakistan of arming and sending militants into Kashmir. In the late 80s and early 90s, thousands of Kashmiris went across to Pakistan-administered Kashmir forarms and training.Now, in the wake of the recent attack, the two countries are again close to a dangerous conflagration.I will stop your water, says India. I willsuspend our peace treaty, retorts Pakistan. Kashmiris have never wanted to be a bone of contention between the two states; they have paid a staggeringly steep price for this 75-year relationship of attrition.Internally, Kashmir has never really been normal, despite the narrative push and despite the appearance of normality, scripted elsewhere and executed on the ground through a security-administrative complex. Underneath the quiet, there is growing resentment at what Kashmiris see as their incremental and cumulative dispossession and disempowerment, in the form of newdomicile and land laws, and in the absence of any real representational politics. Human rights activists, journalists and politiciansremain in jailunder harsh anti-terror laws.Nobody is allowed to speak; surveillance is probably at its highest since the start of the armed insurgency in the late 1980s; a previously independent and robust press has almost entirely been forced into a supine, compliant role. Most accounts from Kashmir speak of suppressed anger at the growing powerlessness and the humiliating deprivation of agency. Many Kashmiris talk aboutdham, a quiet, bruising suffocation, with no space to breathe. That all this is fertile ground for militancy is hardly a surprise, whether local or Pakistan-sponsored.Most accounts in the press suggest that a strike by India is imminent, which will most likely be followed by a tit-for-tat response by Pakistan. Though analysts speak of minimum or “managed hostility”, wars have a way of getting out of hand. Tensions can spiral, and the consequences for Kashmir and the subcontinent would be devastating. Despite pressures for a strike for revenge, especially as such a display of power would translate into political capital, India should begin the long-overdue process of consultation with the Kashmiri people; in other words, to go to the heart of the matter. Pakistan should then have no option but to support such an initiative.Far too many people have already perished, in Kashmir, in India and in Pakistan. Rather than exchange fire, as they have done every day since the attack in Pahalgam, and on and off for decades, the countries could do well, for the sake of their peoples and for Kashmiris, to break this cycle of forever war over this earthly paradise.Mirza Waheed was born in Srinigar, Kashmir.

So it was good to learn that the independent pay review body is expected to recommendan increase of around 4%in England for 2025-26, along with 3% for NHS workers. There are staff shortages across many parts of the public sector. Schools are not unique in having trouble with recruitment and retention. But the importance of education means that the government must do all in its power to prevent children from missing out, and fund the increase in full.By refusing to do so, ministers would send the wrong signal to a beleaguered profession and the country at large. There are strong arguments for investing in public services across the board – and not only in England. But the case for ensuring that there are enough teachers should be unarguable for a government that is hopeful about the future and wants voters to feel the same.The gap between public and private sector pay hasgrown over the past decade. Dismayingly, the former is now lower in real terms than in 2010, with experienced teachers facing some of the steepest drops. Labour’s acceptance last year of an above-inflation5.5% rise for teachers, and similar deals for other public sector workers, was an overdue boost to morale as well as incomes.The government now risks undoing that progress. Teaching has always been a challenging job, and onerespected by the public. But for complicated reasons it is particularly difficult at the moment. Cuts to other services and benefits are one factor, with schools filling in gaps and meeting needs – such ashunger– that ought to sit outside their purview, and that were exacerbated by the pandemic. Chronicproblems in the special educational needs systemadd significantly to workloads, as pupils who need extra support struggle to cope.Behaviour is another concern. IfSir Keir Starmer learned anythingfrom Netflix’s Adolescence, and the debate it stirred up around teenage boys, this must surely include a greater understanding of the challenges faced by teachers. Rudeness and aggression linked to internet use are not the only reason why secondary-school classrooms can be hostile places. But a recent survey found that most teachers see social media as the“number one cause” of poor conduct, with female staff bearing the brunt, and some parents refusing to support schools in upholding standards.Other kinds of changes connected with technology and the pandemic have also had an impact. Many graduate professions now enjoymore flexibilitythan five years ago, with “WFH” an ordinary part of the employment lexicon and accepted practice. Teaching, along with other public-facing roles, is excluded from this trend. It remains a physically demanding role involving high levels of personal interaction and strict timetabling.The government has budgeted for a 2.8% rise. These figures must now be revisited. Telling schools to find the money by cutting other budgets would undermine the point of the pay rise, which is to make teaching more attractive. To allowarbitrary fiscal rulesto prevent teachers from being properly remunerated would be unjust folly. The pay review recommendations are a good opportunity to let go of damaging constraints – and to tell the public why.The last Labour government used the slogan“those who can, teach”to recruit teachers. Teachers could now turn this back on ministers and demand that those who can, pay.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The governing party’s Lazarus moment was sparked by a man who was not on the ballot – though he took the chance to reiterate that the country should become the 51st US state, implying thatvoters could then elect him.By then it wasalready clearthat Donald Trump’s threats had backfired. Monday’s result was a clear repudiation of his agenda. For two years, the Conservatives’ Pierre Poilievre looked like a dead cert as the next prime minister, assailing Justin Trudeau’s government on issues including the cost of living, housing and immigration. His partybuilt a 25-point lead. But within four months, Mr Trudeau’s resignation, his warning that Mr Trump’s “51st state” remarks were no joke, and the imposition of swingeing US tariffs, transformed the contest. Mr Poilievre lost his seat. The Liberals are embarking on a fourth term, though this time perhaps as a minority, under Mr Trudeau’s replacement Mark Carney.Mr Trump made Canada’s political and economic sovereignty the central issue. Mr Carney, a member of Mr Trump’s despised global liberal elite, pitched himself as the man for a crisis: an experienced technocrat from outside politics who guided Canada’s central bank through the great recession, and the UK’s through Brexit.Both Mr Poilievre and Mr Trump said that the Conservative leader was not Maga material. But he certainly appeared Maga-adjacent,moving further rightand building an energetic base by embracing culture wars and attacking “wokeism”, pledging “jail not bail” and promising to cut international aid and defund the national broadcaster.His defeat was effected primarily by other parties’ supporters resolving to unite around the Liberals. The leftwing New Democrats lost around two-thirds of their seats, including that of their leader Jagmeet Singh, who has resigned – though they have retained enough to ensure a progressive majority in parliament. TheBloc Québécoissaw a smaller fall, as Mr Trump’s aggression overshadowed separatist aspirations. But Conservative support actually rose. For the first time in almost a century, Canada’s two main parties eachgot over 40% of the vote.Mr Carney has plenty to celebrate, but limited room for manoeuvre over difficult terrain: “President Trump is trying to break us so America can own us,” he warned in his victory speech. He knows that Mr Trump takes advantage of perceived weakness. But the US president also nurses grievances. Mr Carney has promised to work more closely with allies in Europe and Asia. Hisdiplomatic experienceand international contact book will help.The external economic threat and internal cost of living crisis are inseparable. This campaign, thanks to Mr Trump, put the nation centre stage. But as prime minister, Mr Carney will also need to address society, and tackle the kind of underlying problems that have led to the triumph of Mr Trump and like-minded politicians elsewhere. He has promised to double housebuilding and create hundreds of thousands of skilled jobs, and wants to eliminate internal trade barriers. Opponents may well retort that Liberals have had three terms to realise their vision.Other politicians should be cautious about drawing lessons from this very particular contest. Canada faces a unique threat from the US, though it has economic leverage as well as vulnerability. This is, nonetheless, a welcome rebuff to American bellicosity and rejection of rightwing populism.Explore more on these topicsMark CarneyOpinionCanadaDonald TrumpUS politicsRepublicanseditorialsShareReuse this content"

But I’ve seen firsthand how they cut crime”, 25 April). In addition to his emphasis on how they can help steer young people away from crime and violence, their wider societal benefits also need to be highlighted.Research published byUK Youth in 2022, for example, concluded that by also improving health (including mental health) and opening up employment and educational opportunities, youth work in England has a “direct economic value” of £5.7bn and an indirect value of at least £3.2bn. And that is before we begin to take into account the informal educational opportunities they open up, plus the chance for young people to discover talents that they may not know they have, or lack the confidence to try out.Bernard DaviesLeamington Spa, WarwickshireSimon Jenkins highlights a much-neglected form of provision for young people. As he notes, youth centres and other forms of youth work do not just keep young people away from trouble but offer them opportunities to develop the skills that will help them towards more fulfilling lives. One unremarked consequence of the savage cuts to youth provision since 2010 has been a parallel reduction in the availability of training courses for youth workers, who are vital supporters, challengers and mentors.Youth services have always been a partnership between the state, voluntary bodies and, increasingly, young people themselves.

The UK’s current approach to net zero relies heavily on leveraging international private investment, which allows for foreign corporate control and ownership over the growing green economy.People need to experience the benefits of warmer homes, new green jobs, cleaner air and secure, sustainable energy in their everyday lives, and in their local communities.Community wealth-buildingoffers a path forward to localise those benefits anddemocratise ownership.The use of “anchor institutions” like universities, local government institutions and hospitals to support local green businesses, such as energy co-operatives and social enterprises, can be key to ensuring that wealth generated from the green economy stays in local communities. This model has been successfully trialled in places likePreston,Oldham, Lewes andNorth Ayrshire.Researchhas found that most voters don’t actually dislike green technologies or even green policies – they dislike feeling left behind and feeling as if distant political and economic elites are making all the decisions and getting all the benefits from changes forced on them.It’s time to revive local economies through a community-centred approach to net zero.Dr Max Lacey-BarnacleBrighton, East SussexHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Arsenal were disappointing in defeat, going behind early on and squandering good chances to equalise. But Arteta emphasised the “small ­margins” that would decide this tie, and urged his side to put in an improved display next Wednesday.“I don’t know the percentage, but we have a lot of chances to be in that final,” Arteta said. “The time to do it is going to be in Paris. We are at half-time. My message is exactly the same as when we beat Real Madrid at home 3-0. We have to go to Paris and win the game and we are more than capable of doing it. You have two teams where the margins are so small.Ousmane Dembélé, last matinee idol in Paris, finally delivers on big stageRead more“I think we need to be better. We know that there was not that much in it. It could have gone either way and we need to pull things to our side. We needed to be a little bit more ­accurate, but we have whetted our appetite and we want to go to Paris and do what we need to do. If you want to win theChampions Leaguefinal, you have to do something special, and now we have to do something special in Paris.”Arteta revealed he made a tactical tweak after around 20 minutes that redressed the balance of the game after a dominant opening period forParis Saint-Germain, although he was coy on what it actually was.“It was an issue with the ball,” he said, “and if you don’t correct that the midfield has to come back. It was something that was very ­specific and very ­important, and we ­corrected it. This is the difference in the ­Champions League, the margins are so small.”The PSG manager, Luis Enrique, offered a similar analysis, declaring himself satisfied with the win but promising more hard work and ­suffering next week. “Mission ­accomplished this evening, but we could have come out with a draw and it would have been fine as well,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Selection is imminent – for the four-day match Trent Bridge that gets under way on 22 May and a training camp in Loughborough that precedes it – and after four rounds of the County Championship, the contenders are beginning to take shape.Top orderHad the New Zealand series before Christmas been five Tests, there is every chance Zak Crawley would have been compassionately hooked before its conclusion, such was his ordeal at the hands of Matt Henry. But England may well point to Crawley’s average of 46.6 in his most recent outings against India and Australia as reason to persist. A couple of half-centuries for Kent has hinted at an upturn, but without a Test century since the 2023 Ashes Crawley still needs a score.Ben Duckett is a comparative lock these days, but the No 3 position remains another talking point.Jacob Bethell made a bright first impressionin New Zealand – three half-centuries, including a near-miss 96 in Wellington, were all eye-catching contributions – but he is with Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League and a release to face Zimbabwe seems unlikely. After whipping players out of the IPL early last summer, England have promised their apparent superiors not to do it again.It could, therefore, offer a reprieve for Ollie Pope, who performed admirably as an emergency wicketkeeper batting at No 6 while the management were getting all gooey-eyed about Bethell. The question here is what runs for Pope against Zimbabwe would mean for the India series beyond the standard“good headache to have” cliche.View image in fullscreenOllie Pope could get a reprieve for England.Photograph: Ben Hoskins/Getty Images for Surrey CCCA solitary home Test would not normally necessitate back-up in this department but England may also want Ben McKinney to experience the setup. Even in a low-scoring, seam-dominated match like his Durham side’s two-day win at Worcestershire last weekend, the giant left-hander – still only 20 – looked highly promising.Middle-orderThe panel could easily spend more time deliberating their preferred selection meeting biscuits than England’s middle order. Joe Root and Harry Brook are due to return for Yorkshire this week while Jamie Smith, back playing for Surrey after missing the New Zealand tour on paternity leave, is fresh from being named one of Wisden’s five cricketers of the year and inked in as first-choice wicketkeeper. The only potentially thorny issue is whetherBrook, the new white-ball captain, should replace Pope as vice-captain.A greater unknown is Ben Stokes, who is yet to play after hamstring surgery at the start of the year but, aged 33, remains determined to see out his England career as a fully-fledged all-rounder. Durham’s head coach, Ryan Campbell, is not expecting Stokes to play county cricket in the buildup, meaning Zimbabwe could serve as the only chance for the captain to get red-ball preparation before the India series.SeamersEngland’s lust for pace is well documented, but skilful new-ball expertise is also valued, hence Chris Woakes taking on Jimmy Anderson’s mantle last summer (and ending his personal winter on the road with three wins from three). Woakes is yet to appear for Warwickshire this year, a growling ankle the subject of a recent injection, and this could well open the door for Sam Cook.Essex supporters will be asking what took them so long. Cook has finessed 318 first-class wickets at 19.76, numbers that suggest, whatever the speed gun says, the right-armer is doing something batters do not like. Having thrived in the Kookaburra ball rounds last summer, and knocked back franchise offers to play for the Lions over the winter, Cook appears most likely to partner Gus Atkinson with the new ball. It would also soften some grumbling in the shires regarding England’s opinion of county cricket.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Brydon Carse,breakout star of the winter, is on the comeback trail after a toe injury, whileMark Woodand Olly Stone are already ruled out of the Test summer with knee injuries. Enter Jofra Archer? Not so fast.Archer is at the IPLand while his Rajasthan side seems unlikely to make the playoffs – these clash with England’s lead-up to the Zimbabwe Test, hence the difficulty with Bethell – he would still need to increase his workloads after a year of white-ball cricket.On the plus side, Josh Tongue has returned for Nottinghamshire and as well as getting batters hopping at the crease he has recorded two game-breaking five-wicket hauls. Matt Potts is technically an incumbent and continues to motor in for Durham, while England may also be lining up Sonny Baker for a taste of the environment, having asked Hampshire to rest the 22-year-old this season.SpinnerLike Japanese knotweed, the identity of England’s best spinner remains the hardiest of perennial dilemmas. Shoaib Bashir took 49 Test wickets in 2024 – third-most behind Jasprit Bumrah and Atkinson – but each one cost 40 runs apiece with a strike-rate of 64. In three outings for Glamorgan this season – a loan deal that highlights part of the problem – the 21-year-old has two wickets at 152 and gone at more than four runs an over.Less than a year out from the Ashes, and having fast-tracked Bashir due to his height and over-spin, the question is whether England will blink. Not that they are flush with alternatives if they do. One option, and something that would solve the No 8 spot if Woakes is not yet ready, is Hampshire’s Liam Dawson, another named among Wisden’s five after a stellar 2024. But left-arm spin is notoriously ineffective in Australia. Farhan Ahmed, an orthodox offie with a wonderfully energetic wind-up, has impressed for Nottinghamshire and could follow his brother, Rehan, into the England setup, but, aged 17, he would be Bazball’s biggest gamble yet.England (possible):Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Harry Brook, Ben Stokes (c), Jamie Smith (wk), Gus Atkinson, Sam Cook*, Josh Tongue, Matthew Potts, Shoaib Bashir, Sonny Baker*, Ben McKinney* (*uncapped)Explore more on these topicsEngland cricket teamCricketfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The trio have 14 world titles between them and few would bet against that number increasing as they continue to cut a swathe through the draw in Sheffield.“There was a big element of [competition] in the early part of our careers,” said O’Sullivan. “If one did well the others wanted to do better. John was the first to win a world championship, then it was Mark, then me. You’re always wanting to keep up with them.“I think that stopped a long time ago. We keep going as it is. I’m not sure how much longer we can keep going on for, though. There are so many young players coming through. I think we just love the game. We love playing, we love competing. Without it, you think, what would I do with my time? A lot of it is that as well.”O’Sullivan found it all too easy to build up a commanding lead over Si, who showed few signs of the form that had swept him to the semi-finals on his Crucible debut two years ago. Si did fashion a century to pull level at 1-1 and rallied again from 4-1 down, but a missed black off its spot when he stood on the verge of reducing the deficit to a single frame cost him dearly, as O’Sullivan cleared up and finished the session with a quickfire 121 to put himself firmly in control.Higgins and Williams, who number seven world titles between them, are taking part in the oldest last-eight clash since Eddie Charlton beat a 65-year-old Fred Davis in 1979. Higgins, whose 50th birthday is two weeks after this year’s final, led 5-3 at the end of the first session.But Williams, who turned 50 in March, had claimed the last two frames, including a break of 104, and the Welshman went on to take four of the first five when the action resumed to move ahead, opening with a run of 92. Scotland’s Higgins subsequently hit back, claiming the next two frames, before Williams claimed the final one of the evening to bring the match back all square.Former champion Luca Brecel clung on to Judd Trump’s coat-tails by winning the last two frames of the opening session – including a break of 128 – to reduce the deficit to 5-3 in their last-eight contest. Trump fired consecutive breaks of 106 and 110 in the fourth and fifth frames, moving him within one of matching Neil Robertson’s record of 103 centuries in a single season.Zhao Xintong is one frame away from the semi-finals as he dominated the first two sessions of his clash with fellow qualifier Chris Wakelin. The Chinese player, who is playing as an amateur as he continues his comeback from a 20-month ban for involvement in a betting scandal, was 6-2 up after the first and ended the second 12-4 ahead.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Dubois, the IBF champion, shook his head when asked if his actions had been premeditated. “No, it was just one of them things,” he said.“If you get angry or ­something, it just happens in boxing. I want to put my hands on him properly on the 19th and show everyone.”Dubois said that when Usyk laughed “I didn’t expect that from him. But you know the Ukrainians – they do all this mind work and mind control stuff. But I just need to be right, physically and ­spiritually, and that will be enough on the night.”Usyk’s mental strength is such that even Dubois conceded he will not be able to find a weakness in the ­psychological armour of the WBA, WBC and WBO champion. “But he’s always into psychological warfare,” he said. “I think he’s a boring guy. He’s just at home with his mind shit. It’s all psychological, but when those guys feel the real pain and the heat, then you can break through that.“If you’ve got power on your side, you can do anything. I don’t think he can handle the pain or the heat that I’m going to bring. I’m going to just step up and win.”When Duboischallenged Usyk for his world titlesin August 2023 he struggled initially to match the ringcraft of the Ukrainian master. But the fight changed course ­dramatically when, in the fifth round, Dubois landed a withering punch on the ­beltline that was ruled a low blow. Usyk was in considerable distress as he slumped to the canvas. He was given almost four minutes to recover by the referee who, despite ­considering it an illegal blow, did not deduct a point from Dubois.Usyk was canny enough to weather the turbulent storm that followed and he re-established his authority and dropped Dubois twice before the fight was stopped in the ninth round.View image in fullscreenOleksandr Usyk holds up a ‘Boxing Lesson’ booklet.Photograph: Alex Davidson/Getty Images“I got through with that shot,” Dubois said as he remembered the impact of that borderline blow before Usyk found a way to beat him. “It was like a punch from the gods, though. But that’s in the past now. I’m a man of the future.”When told about that “punch from the gods” comment, Usyk paused for a long time before, in his typically ­languid way, he said: “God bless ­Daniel.

I’ve watched his fights, going back to his amateur days, and he doesn’t like it to the body at all.”Warren predicted that Dubois would break him down with a remorseless body attack and win by knockout.Such talk tickled Usyk. He rocked back in his chair, grinned, and produced a suitably cryptic response: “I do have a weakness, but no one will ever know about this weakness apart from me,” he said. “I will never talk about it because this weakness is ­hidden in an egg and the egg is ­hidden in a dog and the dog is hidden in a safe which is hidden in a dragon. So it’s impossible to find.”Usyk cackled with laughter as the contrast between him and Dubois was made even more obvious. The battle between two such opposites has only just begun.Explore more on these topicsOleksandr UsykBoxingnewsShareReuse this content"

Last Wednesday, Aluko said Wright “should be aware of” how much punditry work he was doing in women’s football and that it was important “women are not being blocked from having a pathway into broadcasting in the women’s game”.The former England and ­Chelsea forwardissued an apologyon ­Friday on Instagram, to which Wright responded on the same platform on Saturday by sayinghe could not accept it.Ian Wright rejects apology from Eni Aluko after punditry commentsRead moreThe pair have worked together as pundits covering England men’s and women’s matches onITVfor years. An ITV spokesperson said: “Ian’s standing in the sport is beyond question. As one of the UK’s most respected and much-loved footballers and sporting broadcasters, with a career spanning nearly four decades, Ian is an incredible advocate, ally and brilliant broadcaster of women’s football from a grassroots level as well as at the highest international competitions.”ITV’s remark will raise further questions about Aluko’s future in its punditry ranks. The broadcaster has a big summer of football, with exclusive live rights to England men’s World Cup qualifiers in June and joint live rights with the BBC for the Lionesses’ defence of the European Championship in Switzerland the following month.Although ITV has not announced its presenting team for the tournament Wright will be involved, as he was throughout its coverage of the qualifiers.ITV has confirmed Wright will be part of its FA Cup final team next month when his former club Crystal Palace meet Manchester City, 35 years after he came off the bench to score twice for Palace in a 3-3 draw in the final against Manchester United.Aluko wrote in her social media apology to Wright: “It was wrong for Ian’s name to be raised in that conversation, and for that I sincerely apologise. I’ve known and worked with Ian for many years and have nothing but love and respect for him.”Wright’s Instagram post in response was “liked” by several England players, including Alessia Russo, Mary Earps, Lauren Hemp and Alex Greenwood, as well as by the former international turned pundit Izzy Christiansen.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The RFU chief executive, Bill Sweeney, revealed that there is the possibility of expanding for the start of next season.Relegation would be officially done away with, however. No side has been demoted since Saracens had it forced upon them for salary cap breaches in 2020 and though there was the potential for a playoff between the side who finished bottom of the Premiership and top of the Championship this summer, only Doncaster met the necessary criteria and they are out of the second tier title race.RFU opens door to hosting Chelsea if they need temporary homeRead moreStating the case for an expansion league, this week Sweeney said: “The old traditional one-up, one-down promotion and relegation system doesn’t currently work in England.” He added: “We need to get new investment into the game.”Newcastle are bottom of the Premiership and may require a loan from the other top-flight clubs in order to ensure their place next season in the latest example of a club in jeopardy. In 2022,Worcester and Wasps went bustwhile London Irish and Championship side Jersey met the same fate a year later. Dowson believes removing relegation would encourage more investment into the game.“My concern is more the financial stability of the clubs and the unions,” said Dowson, who played for Worcester and Newcastle, who have both played in the Championship in the last 10 years. “Every single financial report is on huge losses.Australia lost $36m, the RFU lost £35m, Gloucester lost X, Bath lost X, Saints lost X. [Former chief executive Mark Darbon] last year said we’d lost £1.7m. He said that’s good, we were forecast to lose £2.7m. Rugby is nuts. That’s what frightens me, I feel like we’re sleepwalking into more Jerseys, more London Irishs, more Worcesters – it frightens me.“If you can get a model where people are a bit more confident in investing money because we can either run it as a sport or run it as a business and we’ve got to start thinking about the financial implications of relegation and it puts people off. You look at football, the last three clubs who got promoted got relegated, that’s a huge factor there.”View image in fullscreenGeorge Furbank has been ruled out of Northampton’s Champions Cup semi-final against Leinster.Photograph: Ashley Western/Colorsport/REX/ShutterstockAsked if that outweighs the ideals behind promotion and relegation, Dowson added: “It would be great if you could get to that point. But in the short term we’re putting fingers in holes, trying to make sure ends meet and it worries me.”Meanwhile, George Furbank’s hopes of being named in this summer’s British & Irish Lions squad have been dealt a blow with Dowson confirming the fullback will miss Northampton’s Champions Cup semi-final against Leinster in Dublin on Saturday.Furbank missed the Six Nations with a broken arm before making his comeback in Northampton’s quarter-final against Castres this month. He impressed after coming on after just three minutes, but was seen in obvious pain, replaced before full-time and may not appear again this season.Andy Farrell names his Lions squad next Thursday for the summer tour of Australia while England face July Tests against Argentina and the US. Dowson added: “George won’t play this weekend. He’s struggling to get over that arm break and getting back into contact is hard for him. It’s week by week really. He’s not a soft lad but it’s clearly very painful and we don’t want to make it any worse. I couldn’t tell you what’s going to happen [with the summer tours]. I’ve asked the physio about 485 times if he can play and the physio has said no every time. I’ll ask again next week.”Explore more on these topicsNorthamptonRugby Football UnionPremiershipRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

The Panthers described the incident at the time as a “freak accident”. CPR was administered on the ice at the Sheffield Arena, but ­Johnson died from his injuries.Petgrave was put on police bail, but after an 18-month investigation the CPS said it had now closed the case. “This was a shocking and deeply upsetting incident,” said Michael Quinn, the deputy chief crown prosecutor. “The CPS and South Yorkshire police have worked closely together to determine whether any criminal charges should be brought against the other ice hockey player involved.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“Following a thorough police investigation and a comprehensive review of all the evidence by the CPS, we have concluded that there is not a realistic prospect of conviction for any criminal offence and so there will not be a prosecution,” he added.“Our thoughts remain with the family and friends of Adam Johnson.”Johnson had previously played in the National Hockey League, where he made 13 appearances for the Pittsburgh Penguins, before ­moving to Canada and Germany and then switching to the UK to join the Panthers.Although Petgrave has never been named by South Yorkshire police, he went public about his arrest in December 2024, in afundraising appealon the website­CrowdJustice.com, where he has raised more than £18,000. “I am seeking help to cover some of my legal costs whilst I am subject to police bail, as well as additional costs if the matter proceeds to criminal court,” wrote Petgrave. “Any remaining funds will be donated to initiatives that promote safety in hockey.”Ice hockey’s global governing body, the IIHF, has since made neck guards mandatory for all its affiliated leagues from the 2024-25 season. However, they still are not compulsory in the NHL.After Johnson’s death the Panthers also retired his No 47 jersey – the seventh time they have retired a shirt in the club’s history.Explore more on these topicsIce hockeynewsShareReuse this content"

I think a lot of people say a lot of bad things when they are full of adrenaline in other sports. It just doesn’t get picked up.”Verstappen suggested it should be a problem for broadcasters, not drivers. The four-time champion said last year that TV includes drivers swearing “probably also for entertainment purposes”, adding: “I think it already just starts with not broadcasting it.”Whether there is significant progress will depend on the substance of any changes Ben Sulayem introduces. It appears he’s focusing on how punishments work, not changing the rules themselves. There has already been one sign of a more flexible approach when Carlos Sainz wasn’t fined for using an expletive in a news conference while he protested another fine for being late for a national anthem.Ben Sulayem’s four years in office have been marked by repeated confrontations with drivers and senior officials. A change of course on swearing could mean less tension ahead of a potential re-election later this year.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

He said “any strategy based on either ‘phasing out’ fossil fuels in the short term or limiting consumption is a strategy doomed to fail”.Writing the foreword for a report from the Tony Blair Institute (TBI), he said the current climate debate was “riven with irrationality” and suggested net zero was losing public support.His comments echo similar criticism of net zero by the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch.The paper itself, written by the TBI’s Lindy Fursman, said net zero policies were now “increasingly viewed as unaffordable, ineffective or politically toxic”.In the UK, however, climate change policies have retained popularity. The thinktank Persuasion UK said in a report published on Monday that Labour could lose far more seats at the next election from disillusioned leftwing voters defecting to the Greens than from defections to Reform. The most recent YouGov poll on the subject found 66% of UK voters were worried about climate change.Last week Keir Starmer said the government was going “all-out” for a low-carbon future,telling a conferencein London that tackling the climate crisis and bolstering energy security were “in the DNA of my government” and that “we won’t wait – we will accelerate”.But Blair, 71, said present policy solutions were inadequate and leaders should shift towards a “pragmatic policy” that prioritised technological solutions.He said this was borne out by rising demand for production of fossil fuels, especially in China and India, the doubling of airline travel and increased demand for steel and cement.He said he still believed the climate was “one of the fundamental challenges of our time” and that renewable energy was necessary. But he said the government needed “to alter where we put our focus”.Fossil fuels are the largest contributor to the climate crisis, accounting for more than 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions.Blair said there was disdain for policies such as carbon capture in favour of renewables, which he said should be reversed, though the UK government has already made some significant commitments on carbon capture.He called for an international embrace of nuclear power and more work on new small modular reactors.One Labour MP said it was an unhelpful intervention that could be interpreted as a direct critique of Starmer and his energy secretary, Ed Miliband.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

I don’t get the point of pushing something like this – and the unpopularity of net zero is just plain wrong,” they said.An industry source said: “I don’t think the sector has any need for a tech-optimist vision of climate action that doesn’t represent the fantastic work the industry is doing today to both decarbonise and roll out clean energy at an unprecedented scale and it seems bizarre that the TBI report doesn’t recognise that.”The TBI, which has been highly influential in Labour circles, had welcomed action on renewables as recently as February when the seventhcarbon budgetwas published.In a statement published at the time, Fursman said the programme was “rightly ambitious. In order to achieve it, cleaner options like heat pumps and EVs [electric vehicles] must be affordable and accessible”.Campaigners and industry figures said there were flaws in the TBI argument. Holly Brazier Tope, the deputy director of politics at Green Alliance, said: “This report is disappointing given Tony Blair’s strong track record on climate action, seeming to throw in the towel on avoiding the worst climate impacts and promoting defeatism instead of real solutions.“It also wildly exaggerates the public backlash, especially in the UK where support for climate action remains solid.”Adam Berman, the director of policy and advocacy at Energy UK, said:“Net zero is the economic opportunity of the 21st century. Through the rapid uptake in technologies like wind and solar, UK emissions have halved since 1990.“It’s not a question of either or: the UK will need both conventional clean technologies that are operating at scale today in addition to investments in newer technologies.”Explore more on these topicsGreen politicsFossil fuelsGreenhouse gas emissionsCarbon capture and storage (CCS)Tony BlairLabourClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

A “protest by post”, it had been sent by the Sheffield-based designer, maker and eco activist Wendy Ward. “I purchased this from Sainsbury’s at least 10 years ago,” she wrote in the accompanying letter. “It has served me well. However, I have no sustainable options available for what I should do with it.” Beyond repair, it was too damaged to donate to a charity shop, she explained. She couldn’t compost it as it had been blended with polyester, and she couldn’t repurpose it as cleaning cloths, as, being polycotton, it wasn’t absorbent. And, she added, “I don’t want to put it into a textile recycling collection as the likelihood is that it will beshipped overseasor incinerated and not recycled.” Ward qualified her assertions with links to respected sources – as a sustainable fashion PhD student, she is well informed on such matters.The vast bulk of the clothing ‘given back’ to fashion shops for recycling was destroyed, abandoned or sent overseas“The only action I can personally take,” she continued, “is to put it into my general waste bin. I don’t want to do this, as in Sheffieldall general waste is incineratedas ‘energy recovery’. This isn’t a sustainable option as such processes have been shown to be asdamaging to local air pollutionas burning coal.” So, she concluded, “as Sainsbury’s is responsible for designing and manufacturing this product, making decisions to use polycotton with no consideration for what could be done once it reaches the end of its life, I have decided to return it to you. I would really love to hear what you decide to do with it.”Sainsbury’s response, sent from its executive office, was “a lame fob-off”, Ward says, and read as if it had been “cut and pasted from a complaints template”. (Sample platitude: “Sainsbury’s always welcome feedback from customers.”) But when sheshared her protestwith her 20,000 Instagram followers, the resounding approval – “Brilliant!” “Please upload your template” – motivated her to launch a campaign: #TakeItBack. She createdan adaptable, deliberately non-combative letter(“If you’re confrontational, it won’t go anywhere,” she tells me), and encouraged her followers to return their dead clothes to brands. “It’s an empowering action,” she says. “I was wresting back a bit of control as a consumer.”View image in fullscreenWard at a sorting facility. The UK’s worn-out textiles are costing collectors and sorters £88m annually to process.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianI joined Ward’s #TakeItBack campaign, sending my daughter’s ravaged school tights to Marks & Spencer’s CEO, Stuart Machin. To the UK heads of Uniqlo and H&M, I sent my kids’ damaged polyester-blend T-shirts, and to French Connection’s CEO, a greyed, misshapen T-shirt of mine that’s so timeworn, it’s transparent, all accompanied by a version of Ward’s letter. I know they’ve all been received, because I tracked them, on Ward’s advice; similarly, I washed everything first. M&S was the first to respond, reminding me about its “industry-leading sustainability programme”, Plan A, and its take-back scheme. Uniqlo sent a letter acknowledging mine, and “will respond as soon as possible”. I haven’t heard back from H&M or French Connection yet.Ward recommends following up if they don’t answer the key questions: “What would you suggest I do with this item?” and “What are you actually doing about this problem?” She’s unsure how many people have joined her campaign, though she doesn’t expect vast numbers yet: “I know I’m preaching to the converted.”You may be thinking: why not donate your unwanted clothes and other textiles to a charity shop? End-of-life textiles have for many years been a valuable revenue stream for charities. Rag merchants would buy them by weight and sell them on to be down-cycled into stuffing, blankets, wipes etc. But many UK charity shops are now “having to spend money getting rid of waste textiles”, says Dawn Dungate, an independent consultant who advises charities on textile recycling. Indeed, Ward’s protest was inspired bya sign in her local charity shopasking customers to dispose of “damaged, torn or worn-out items” in the bin, “as the cost of disposal is very high”.The growing rag mountain particularly affects independent charity shops and small chains, which lack the donation volumes of bigger chains to woo textile collectors into taking their scrap (they are mainly interested in reusable items for export). “We can’t afford to upset our rag merchant,” says Emma King of Somerset-based Weston Hospicecare charity shops. “If they stop coming, our stock rooms become a health and safety nightmare, and we can’t accept more donations.” King considers herself “lucky” – they’re still getting paid for their unsold textiles: “Ten years ago, though, we’d get 65p per kilo. Now it’s just 10p.” They try to sell their scrap in-store, marketing it as upcycling projects and craft fabric. More remote shops in Cornwall and Devon are having to drive their waste clothing up the country, she says, “because it’s not financially viable for merchants to drive to them”; many shops are nowforced to refuse donations.View image in fullscreenA dumping site for secondhand clothes in Accra, Ghana.Photograph: Nipah Dennis/AFP/Getty ImagesMy local independent charity shop,Second Lifein East Sussex, found itself in “a crisis situation”, says manager Naomi Phitidis. In December, the rag merchant stopped coming, complaining that it was receiving too much end-of-life clothing (the shop had been donating the best of its unsold textiles to local charities for homeless people, rescue animals and families in need). “Because it costs the rag man to recycle scrap, they wanted the good stuff too,” Phitidis says. “And we weren’t even getting remunerated for it – it was just to get it out of the shop.” But the team felt uncomfortable about their unsold clothing going to Ghana, and their scrap to Pakistan, a global hub for textile recycling (that’s standard practice, by the way –the environmental action charity Wrap reportsthat, of the 469,000 tonnes of used textiles that passed through UK sorters and graders in 2022, 425,000 tonnes were exported). So instead they reluctantly decided to have the scrap incinerated locally (at a cost), and to resume donating locally, thus avoiding “waste colonialism”. “It’s depressing,” says Phitidis. “Making the right choice is so difficult.” Second Life now asks customers not to donate stained or damaged clothing: “We wanted to say yes to it, but it’s just too much.”The crisis is happening downstream, too. To understand why end-of-life textiles pose such a problem, we need to look at the industries dealing with them – the collectors, sorters and recyclers. The sector is facing “partial collapse”, according to a forthcoming Wrap report, seen exclusively by the Guardian. “Not everyone is going to make it through,” Wrap’s senior textiles specialist, Cristina Sabaiduc, tells me. Wrap found that the UK’s worn-out textiles are costing collectors and sorters £88m annually to collect and process – no wonder they don’t want them. Given this financial burden, Sabaiduc predicts that “textile banks in our neighbourhoods will disappear and charity shops will no longer take donations; charities will have to pay to incinerate [waste] and we’ll be putting stuff in the bin, even if we don’t want to.” The loss of revenue will be fatal for some businesses, she adds.It’s already happening. A decade ago, there were “60 or 70 sorting and grading companies”, says Dungate. “Now only a dozen remain … This market was booming, but it’s come to a crunch point.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

A2024 Wrap reportexplained that the “saturation of low-quality fast fashion” means that charity shops are selling fewer used clothes, and are therefore sending more to rag merchants. The low quality “results in less income for reuse and recycling sectors”, which leads to an increase in offshoring – ie it’s just not worth the bother here. Various shop managers tell me fast fashion doesn’t sell well for them because it dates quickly and doesn’t wear well over time (according to the European Commission,50% of clothes are discarded due to pilling and colour fading). At Second Life, volunteers clear out approximately 250kg of unsold clothing every fortnight – and that’s just one small shop.With the market flooded with unsaleable used clothing, it’s inevitable that scrap holds minimal value. What’s more, there isn’t a business case for what Ward calls “true recycling”, where unwanted textiles are recycled into new, fashion-grade fabrics (known as fibre-to-fibre recycling). According to Ross Barry of LMB Textiles, fibre-to-fibre recycling is more expensive – and much harder to do – than buying virgin polyester – “the cheapest form of plastic going”. Unsurprisingly, progress with fibre-to-fibre recycling has been minimal: “It’s not even at a drop-in-the-ocean stage yet,” says Barry (recycled-polyester clothing is mostly made fromplastic bottles, not old clothes). Besides, synthetic clothes have a high calorific value, states the industry websiteRecycling Inside, meaning that incineration for energy recovery makes commercial sense – not least whenalmost 70% of all textilescontain human-made fibres.OK, but what about the many fast-fashion take-back schemes, where you can drop off unwanted, used clothing to be reused or recycled (H&M, Primark, Zara)? Unfortunately, there’s little evidence to prove they are sustainable. A 2023 investigation by the environmental campaign group Changing Markets Foundation (CMF), entitledTake-back Trickery, found that 75% of clothing donated to fashion stores – among them, Marks & Spencer, H&M, Zara and Nike – was destroyed, abandoned in warehouses or sent overseas. Since then, says CMF’s Urska Trunk, “We’ve seen no indication that the situation has changed – take-back is textbook greenwashing.”A 2024 report by Remake, a sustainable fashion action group, found that none of the major fashion brands evaluated were sufficiently transparent about what happens to clothing collected through take-back programmes. (Reskinned’s take-back scheme, run by LMB, could be a better model – it collaborates with 32 brands including Finisterre, Seasalt Cornwall and Sweaty Betty, and says it resells only to the global north. The rest is repurposed by designers such as ELV Denim and Ahluwalia, or recycled into insulation, stuffing, wipes, etc.)View image in fullscreenUsed clothes discarded in the Atacama desert, Chile.Photograph: Martin Bernetti/AFP/Getty ImagesSo you can see why conscious consumers want to take fast-fashion brands to task. Ward has also sent her partner’s jeans back to Sainsbury’s, because, she says, “the elastane has degraded, so they have saggy knees and that weird fluting, and I can’t think of a way to remedy the problem”.Eilidh Weir, a Perthshire-based artist, also sent her kids’ synthetic school trousers back to Sainsbury’s. “They were second- or third-hand, I’d already mended them, and they were looking really ratty,” she says. “I wouldn’t feel right handing them on, and I don’t want them to end up in poorer countries – or the bin.” Sainsbury’s declined to comment on these issues when contacted.Where does the UK’s fast fashion end up? I found out on a beach clean in GhanaRead moreThe fact remains that doing the right thing with our clothes when they die feels like a “really difficult, unsolvable problem”, says Ward. Things could be different, she believes, if the policy of extended producer responsibility (EPR) – which holds companies accountable for their products’ end-of-life impact – were enforced (Ward calls her campaign “guerilla EPR”). While there are no plans to legislate for textiles EPR in the UK,the EU is expected to implement mandatory EPR for textileswithin the next couple of years. EPR is essential, says Dungate, “in order to fund the infrastructure for collecting, sorting and recycling [waste clothing]”. But, Ward adds, “many feel cynical about whether our government has the balls to do it”.Ward hopes her #TakeItBack campaign will illuminate what she views as a “hidden problem” – she likens charity shops and rag merchants to “Wombles getting rid of stuff that we don’t have to be faced with. People think they’re doing a good thing and that their rubbish will be of some use, but I think your average person would be shocked if they were confronted with the reality.”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The only beneficiaries of disrupting or killing this report are the fossil fuel industry … Congress must step up to ensure the report it requires by law is conducted with scientific integrity and delivered in a timely way.”Dave White, senior global futures scientist at Arizona State University, a lead author of NCA5, said the NCA “translates cutting edge science to inform American communities, including farmers, ranchers and businesses”.“Dismissing its authors and cancelling its development undercuts decades of bipartisan progress,” White added. “This leaves the nation more vulnerable to extreme heat, water shortages, floods and other climate-related disasters. This decision is not only reckless, but also indifferent to the economic, environmental and human health impacts already occurring.”Erin Sikorsky, the director of the Center for Climate and Security in the US, a thinktank, said in a social media post: “Pretending climate risks don’t exist doesn’t make them go away, unfortunately. This move puts Americans, our communities, and our security at risk.”Dismissing the experts working on the assessment is the latest in a barrage of moves by the Trump administration to end or reduce research into climate as it pursues a “drill, baby, drill” agenda to prioritize the fossil fuel industry.Federal websites have beenpurged of information related to the climate and extreme weatherand agencies reduced in size, prompting warnings Americans’ are being made less safe amid the reality of the climate crisis.In February, Trump officials also denied US scientists permission to attend a meeting of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world’s leading climate science entity.

Sources have previously told the Guardian Kneller was given thenickname “Karen Invisible”by staff, and described by some working for her as “absent”, with her “finger off the pulse”.Asked if such reports were fair, Kneller told MPs: “No, I don’t recognise that at all.“I have been highly visible within the organisation: weekly updates to staff, monthly staff briefings, I’m in calls and meetings all the time. So that is not something that I recognise.”The working from home policy had allowed the CCRC to recruit high-calibre staff from across the UK, enabling it to fill positions it had previously struggled to fill, MPs were told.But the committee chair, Andy Slaughter, said he was “shocked” senior staff were absent from the office. “There does seem to be a hole at the heart of this organisation,” he said.He asked Kneller, and Amanda Pearce, CCRC casework operations director, if they “really feel now, with everything that has happened, that you are the right people to lead this organisation forward”.Kneller replied: “I think we are absolutely the right people to lead this organisation.”The handling of the Malkinson case led to anapology from the CCRCand theresignation in January of its chair Helen Pitcher.Asked if she had personally apologised to Malkinson, Kneller replied: “No, I haven’t.” Asked if such an apology might be appropriate, she said: “Absolutely. Without doubt, we got that case wrong, Mr Malkinson was failed.”She added: “Absolutely, I extend my apology to Mr Malkinson. Everyone in the organisation deeply regrets what happened on that case. I can’t begin to think of the impact this has had on him, the double impact of serving a sentence, suffering miscarriage of justice and then the way we handled his case, so absolutely.”Kneller was questioned about reports in the Guardian thatshe had regularly attended Insead business schoolin Fontainebleau over the past five years, including a course whose fees are advertised at more than £21,000 for 10 days’ teaching.She said she was unable to confirm the exact figures. “What I can say is, over the course of my 12-13 years as a chief executive, the organisation has invested around £50,000 in my development,” she added.Slaughter asked what she thought of Pitcher’s resignation letter, in which the departing chair stated that some departing commissioners had advised her to remove the senior management team.Kneller said it was “unfortunate” and “it felt a very strange thing to say in a resignation letter”.She urged the committee “and others to judge our performance across all of our case work, and not only those cases that get into the headlines, which is a tiny, tiny minority of our casework”.Explore more on these topicsCriminal Cases Review CommissionUK criminal justicenewsShareReuse this content"

It said the hackers had then encrypted access to a server using software from the ransomware operator DragonForce last week.Tim Mitchell, a senior security researcher at Secureworks, said that while it was impossible for outsiders to confirm who the hackers were, the extent of the disruption caused to M&S indicated it had been subject to a ransomware attack. These attacks encrypt access to important systems and demand a ransom in return for a key to unlock them.He said Scattered Spider, also known as Octo Tempest, appeared to be “quite unusual” as a hacking group in that they were largely English-speaking – unlike the majority of such groups, which are based in places such as Russia, where there is a more “permissive environment” where they have more freedom to operate.He added: “Their motivation appears to be as much about bragging rights on those channels [where they communicate] as about money.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The impact on the M&S share price shows the damage these attacks can do and will have many corporate retailers working day and night to ensure they do not suffer a similar fate.“Ransomware gangs typically target companies like M&S with the aim of causing maximum disruption to force a quick payout. Their goal is simple: the greater the disruption, the greater the pressure on the company to pay the ransom.”Shoppers are still able to browse online and shop in M&S’s physical stores using cash or cards, but some difficulties continue in stores, with gift cards not currently being accepted.

It had become “a famous site, reproduced countless times in photographs, feature films and art”, he said.Graham and Carruthers travelled in Graham’s Range Rover from Cumbria in the late hours of 27 September 2023, the court heard.“By sunrise on Thursday September 28, the tree had been deliberately felled with a chainsaw in an act of deliberate and mindless criminal damage,” Wright said. “It fell on to a section of Hadrian’s Wall, causing irreparable damage to the tree itself and further damage to the wall.”Wright said the people responsible were Graham and Carruthers, who, in the technique they used, showed “expertise and a determined, deliberate approach” to the felling.He said: “First, they marked the intended cut with silver spray paint, before cutting out a wedge that would dictate the direction in which the tree would fall. One of the men then cut across the trunk, causing the sycamore to fall, hitting the wall. Whilst he did that, the other man filmed it, filmed the act on Daniel Graham’s mobile telephone.”View image in fullscreenAdam Carruthers leaving Newcastle crown court on Monday.Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PAThe jury was shown the phone footage, lasting two minutes 40 seconds, in which the chainsaw and the sound of the tree toppling can be heard and the silhouette of a figure using the saw can be seen.The wedge was put in the boot of Graham’s Range Rover – “perhaps a trophy taken from the scene, to remind them of their actions. Actions they appear to have been revelling in,” Wright said.“During that return journey Mr Carruthers received a video of his young child from his partner. He replied to her: ‘I’ve got a better video than that.’ Minutes later the video of the felling of the tree was sent from Graham’s phone to Carruthers’ phone.“At the time of that text conversation the only people in the world who knew that the tree had been felled were the men who had cut it down.”The next day the world’s media began reporting on the tree’s felling and the two men shared social media posts, Wright said, with Graham messaging Carruthers: “Here we go.”View image in fullscreenThe tree before it was cut down.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianWright said Carruthers sent Graham a Facebook post from a man called Kevin Hartness saying: “Some weak people that walk this earth … disgusting behaviour.”Two minutes later Graham replied to Carruthers with a voice note saying: “That Kevin Hartness comment. Weak … fucking weak? Does he realise how heavy shit is?”Carruthers replied with his own voice note saying: “I’d like to see Kevin Hartness launch an operation like we did last night … I don’t think he’s got the minerals.”Wright said this was “the clearest confirmation, in their own voices, that Carruthers and Graham were both responsible for the deliberate felling of the tree and the subsequent damage to Hadrian’s Wall.”The prosecutor said messages between the two men talked about the felling of Sycamore Gap going “wild” and “viral”. Wright said: “They are loving it, they’re revelling in it. This is the reaction of the people that did it. They still think it’s funny, or clever, or big.”Carruthers and Graham were once good friends, the jury was told, but not now. “That once close friendship has seemingly completely unravelled, perhaps as the public revulsion at their behaviour became clear to them,” Wright said. He said each man may now be trying to blame the other.Graham, of Carlisle, and Carruthers, of Wigton, are jointly charged with causing criminal damage worth £622,191 to the tree. They are also charged with causing £1,144 of damage to Hadrian’s Wall, a Unesco world heritage site. The wall and the tree belong to the National Trust.Graham and Carruthers deny all the charges against them.The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Both women were taken to hospital, with one sustaining life-threatening injuries.The manifesto, titled “the Otley run massacre”, also cites “neurotypical” people as targets, as well as general categories such as “humanity” and “human race”.In the social media post, the author says he has read the manifesto of the far-right mass murderer Brenton Tarrant, who carried out the massacre in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019. Tarrant killed 51 people in and close to two mosques.The Facebook post details the attack type as: “Mass murder, terrorism, revenge, misogynyic[sic] rage, homicide/suicide.”Counter-terrorism police have taken the lead in investigating after concluding that the suspect was likely to have written the tract. On Tuesday, they named Lawrence, 38, as their key suspect after he died. One of his victims has been discharged while the other is in a stable condition, police said.In a statement, counter-terrorism police in the north, which is leading the investigation, said: “We can confirm that the 38-year-old man who was arrested and taken to hospital on Saturday with a self-inflicted injury, has died.“This man was the key suspect and we can name him as Owen Lawrence from Headingley, Leeds. We believe he was acting on his own and are not currently seeking anyone else in connection with this matter.“Counter Terrorism Policing North East will continue to conduct a thorough and extensive investigation to establish the facts and circumstances around the incident. A file will be compiled and passed to the coroner.”The Guardian understands Lawrence was unknown to counter-terrorism police or the security services as a suspect beforehand. The senior national coordinator for counter-terrorism is still to declare the attempt at a mass casualty attack as a terrorist incident.Lawrence lived barely 200 metres off Otley Road and his last address was a flat that has been raided and searched by police.Jonathan Pryor, a Labour councillor for Headingley, said: “The events in Headingley this weekend have deeply alarmed our community, not only the planned attack but the disturbing rise in violent misogyny too. We continue to hold the two women attacked in our thoughts as they recover.“Every woman has the right to feel safe, and it’s essential we tackle any culture that normalises misogyny and opens the door to extremism.”A crossbow was recovered from the scene, as was a firearm, with police trying to determine how their suspect got hold of it.The head of Counter Terrorism Policing North East, Det Ch Supt James Dunkerley, said: “We understand there are concerns around the incident, and questions about how and why this has happened. Our teams are committed to carrying out an in-depth investigation to provide answers to those affected.”In another social media post from January, an account that appears to be linked to Lawrence lists things that he hates. It starts with “gender equality”, the soap opera Hollyoaks, bisexual relationships, Islamic extremists, “feminists of all four waves”, “feminoids”, the reality talent show Pop Idol, “female empowerment”, “dumb” and “fat people”, and “normies”.In this post and his supposed manifesto posted on Facebook, he referenced “the great replacement theory”. This is a bogus far-right claim that white populations are being replaced in society.Material from the suspect’s electronic devices is being investigated, as is his mental health and neurological state.Tracy Brabin, the mayor of West Yorkshire, said: “My thoughts remain with the victims and wider community following the horrific incident in Headingley at the weekend.”Counter-terrorism’s workload increasingly includes people who have no clear ideology, or where the causes driving them to violence are unclear.A fortnight ago, the Guardian revealed thatcounter-terrorism police and the National Crime Agencyhad set up a joint taskforce to tackle young males fixated with violence online that is often also fuelled by “strongly misogynistic” online material.Explore more on these topicsUK newsLeedsnewsShareReuse this content"

But it wasn’t until January 2021, by which time she was “emotionally fragile, anxious and stressed”, that menopause or perimenopause was mentioned.The coroner said: “Given her presentation it would appear that her underlying anxiety had been slowly building; possibly since 2008 but much more so since 2017.”She started HRT but in September 2022 declined again and the following month agreed to a voluntary admission to an acute psychiatric unit after she was found wandering in traffic. She was detained there under the MentalHealthAct.Potter had a devoted and supportive husband and family and she was given periods of home leave. It was during one of these periods, on 5 December 2022, that she killed herself.Last month an inquest jury concluded that Potter’s death was suicide and said menopause “contributed to her mental health decline and exacerbated her underlying anxiety”. The jury also said that her family “did not receive appropriate information to assist them in keeping Anne safe for an overnight stay”.In her report, which has been sent to the trust and a range of national bodies including NHSEngland, the coroner said: “I was surprised to learn that menopausal training is not mandatory in any area of clinical practice or specialism.“I am concerned that there is no requirement to undertake essential compulsory menopausal training for those working in relevant clinical practices.”She said she was told that the Somerset NHS foundation trust had just one “menopause specialist”, a GP, who covered the entire trust’s operations. The coroner said: “Menopause is a condition; it does have symptoms and it does have recognised presentations, yet there appears to be a failure to recognise this condition as having equal importance to other ailments or diagnoses.“If someone has concerns about heart disease, a worrying lump, a broken bone etc they expect to be able to consult a medically qualified professional who has a knowledge and understanding of their condition or presentation and can diagnose and treat accordingly; not just [and I paraphrase]: ‘Have a look at a website to help.’“I appreciate that each and every woman will experience perimenopause and menopause differently … and this, to some degree, creates difficulties, as a ‘one size fits all’ approach … cannot be offered, but the lack of recognition of the importance of this condition remains a significant concern.”Dr Andreas Papadopoulos, the associate medical director for mental health and learning disability services at Somerset NHS foundation trust, said: “Wehave listened to the coroner’s comments, and we are now working to develop a clearer single document that includes risks and a safety plan, that will be shared with families when a patient has leave from our mental health units.“We also carried out our own investigation, together with the family, and from this we are developing plans to improve our colleagues’ knowledge on the wider implications of the menopause, as well as improving the process of allocating a named nurse to individual patients. We’re also reviewing our colleague training around approaches to trauma-informed care.“We will now take time to review the coroner’s comments to understand what further steps we need to take.”In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

There were protest groups speaking on behalf of women in this court case, but ordinary women were not actually represented as a whole.“The disabled were not represented, and now we’re seeing the Conservatives saying that trans people have got to use the disabled loos, which impacts the lives of disabled people. The impacts of all of this have not been dealt with.”The supreme court judgment, and subsequent guidance from the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), the watchdog that enforces the Equality Act, has sent shock waves through the UK’s transgender community and left many business and services unclear about what facilities they are expected to offer.In an“interim update”on how the ruling should be interpreted, the EHRC said on Friday that in workplaces and services open to the public, such as hospitals or cafes, “trans women (biological men)should not be permittedto use the women’s facilities and trans men (biological women) should not be permitted to use the men’s facilities”.Over the weekend, the Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden said it was “a logical consequence” that transgender people would be banned from using the toilets of the gender they identify as.McCloud said that, rather than resulting in clarity, the judgment and subsequent government and commission statement had “brought chaos”.“There’s chaos because we’ve got the supreme court saying one thing, and we’ve got the government and the EHRC saying another, we’ve got planning rules that the last government set, whereby inclusive bathrooms are supposed to be discouraged.”McCloud’s comments came as Carla Denyer MP, the Green party co-leader, asked how the government would respond “both to distress within the trans community and further confusion for employers, businesses and service providers who are trying to understand what the supreme court ruling means for them”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Debt at the utility rose from £3.4bn when Macquarie bought in to £10.8bn when it sold its last stake in 2017. At the same time, Macquarie and other investorsreceived dividends worth £2.8bn.Ben Way, the group head of Macquarie Asset Management, last month told investors on a call that Thames Water had improved under its ownership.“We’re actually proud, very proud of our ownership of Thames Water,” Way said. “It was a much better business, imperfect, but much better business after our stewardship, and we can’t talk about what happened subsequently.”Way, who has worked for Macquarie since 2006, denied any link between Thames Water’s more recent financial struggles and the bank’s ownership, according to a transcript hosted by the data company AlphaSense. The Financial Times first reported on the comments.“So imagine being blamed for a house that you own seven years ago when the roof leaked,” he said. “It is quite strange.”Despite the £3bn debt package, Thames Water still has to secure longer-term equity investment in order to fund upgrades to sewer and water treatment works after decades of underinvestment. Thames haschosen KKR, a US private equity investor, as its “preferred partner”.

Kill your local MP.” The group have also denied allegations they have shown support for Hamas and Hezbollah.Overnight on Monday, Kneecap – Liam Óg Ó Hannaidh, Naoise Ó Cairealláin and JJ Ó Dochartaigh – posted an apology on X and suggested the condemnation had been an “effort to derail the real conversation” about Gaza.The band have previously claimed they are facing a “coordinated smear campaign” afterspeaking out about“the ongoing genocide against the Palestinian people”.“To the Amess and Cox families, we send our heartfelt apologies, we never intended to cause you hurt,” they said in the 500-word statement.They went on: “Establishment figures, desperate to silence us, have combed through hundreds of hours of footage and interviews, extracting a handful of words from months or years ago to manufacture moral hysteria.”During an urgent question about the band in the Commons on Tuesday, the Home Office minister Dan Jarvis urged the organisers of June’s Glastonbury festival to “think very carefully” about whether Kneecap should perform there.During the exchanges, which involved Mark Francois, the Conservative MP who asked the question, referring to the band as “despicable evil”, Jarvis seemingly agreed with another Labour MP who suggested Kneecap’s music should be removed from platforms such as iTunes and Spotify.Coxtold BBC Radio Ulster’s Talkback programmethat Kneecap’s most recent statement was only “half an apology”.“It’s fine to say that you’re sorry for it, but the way that they have actually spoken about it is to suggest that it’s a conspiracy, that they have been targeted unfairly, and for me, that then doesn’t come across as unfortunately particularly genuine,” he said.Jo Coxwas killed in June 2016by a far-right extremist.Kneecap said in their most recent statement they “do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah”.They added: “We also reject any suggestion that we would seek to incite violence against any MP or individual. Ever.“An extract of footage, deliberately taken out of all context, is now being exploited and weaponised, as if it were a call to action. This distortion is not only absurd – it is a transparent effort to derail the real conversation.”Keir Starmer’s official spokesperson said on Monday the prime minister believed the band’s comments were “completely unacceptable” and that he “condemns them in the strongest possible terms”.Katie Amess, whose father, David Amess, wasmurdered by an Islamic State fanaticin his Southend West constituency, said she was “gobsmacked at the stupidity of somebody or a group of people being in the public eye and saying such dangerous, violent rhetoric”, and demanded an apology.On Tuesday, she told PA Media that the group’s statement was “deflection and excuses and gaslighting”, adding that it appeared they had been “badly advised”.She said: “It was absurd, that’s not an apology. It’s deflection, it is not taking accountability, it’s making excuses.“They don’t understand what they’re talking about. They obviously aren’t educated enough in what they’re speaking about to think that they can use those excuses and everybody will be like: ‘Oh, never mind, let’s move on to something else.’”Scotland Yard is reportedly looking into the alleged call to kill MPs, along with another concert from November 2024 in which a member of the band appeared to shout: “Up Hamas, up Hezbollah” – groups that are banned as terrorist organisations in the UK.Explore more on these topicsKneecapConservativesJo CoxnewsShareReuse this content"

We have found the owner of the tortoise that was handed in at the start of the week. His name is Leonardo.“He went missing from his home in July last year so has been missing for nine months. His owners searched all over for him but sadly feared the worst when he wasn’t found. They couldn’t believe it when they heard the news and were really pleased he was found safe and healthy.”TheBBC reportedthat, after a social media campaign, a dog walker had spotted Leonardo walking down a street and taken him to the pet shop, where staff helped track down his owner, Rachel Etches.Etches told the broadcaster: “It was totally my fault; we were out in the garden, we’d just had our second child, I got a bit distracted and he just wandered off out of our sight.“He’s led a very comfortable life for 13 years under a heat lamp in my house, so we didn’t think he was going to survive the winter being out for the first time.”Leonardo reportedly previously escaped a few years ago but was found again a couple of days later.“They’re very adventurous beings, they always test the boundaries of wherever they’re put,” Etches told the BBC.Etches believes Leonardo must have gone into hibernation for winter and went on the move again once the weather started to improve.Explore more on these topicsPetsCumbrianewsShareReuse this content"

Many are having to stay in temporary accommodation for several years, often in dangerous, unhealthy and unsanitary conditions.Mairi MacRae, director of policy and campaigns at Shelter, said: “It is a national shame that so many thousands of children in England are growing up in cramped, insecure temporary accommodation – sharing beds with siblings, eating dinner from trays on their laps, and being moved from one place to the next with no stability. This should never be the reality for any child, but without urgent action, the number of homeless families is set to soar.“Local councils are buckling under the pressure of the housing emergency, forced to spend billions just to keep people off the streets. It’s nonsensical that we keep sinking taxpayers money into damaging short-term fixes when we could invest in lasting solutions that give families the security and stability of a real home.”Temporary accommodation possible factor in deaths of 74 children in EnglandRead moreCouncils in England are meant to use temporary accommodation as a stopgap when a person or family first approaches them asking to be housed and until they have decided whether they are under a statutory duty to give them more permanent housing. But the lack of social housing means people are often being left for years in bedsits or bed and breakfasts – including those with children.Government figures show nearly 17,000 familieshave now been livingin temporary accommodation for over five years. In London,more than 60% of householdswith children in temporary accommodation have been there for two years or more.Many of these rooms and flats are dirty, pest-ridden and unsafe, according to people who have lived in them. The Guardian spoke to people who complained about mouse infestations, a lack of space for children and unsafe communal areas.The Shelter projections suggest the problem will get much worse over the next few years, even with government action to tackle the problem.The charity analysed historic data to show the rate of increase in temporary accommodation.Analysts then factored in the likely effect of therenters’ rights bill, which will stop private landlords evicting tenants without due cause, and recent increases in government funding for affordable housing.Both of these policies will limit the number of people having to approach authorities for emergency accommodation. But Shelter found that neither will be enough to compensate for the expected rise in private rents over the period.The analysis shows that by 2029, an estimated 182,000 households will be in temporary accommodation – a 44% increase on current levels.Experts warn the rise is likely to put further pressure on cash-strapped councils, pushing more closer to the brink of bankruptcy. But they say the problem can be alleviated with a major boost to social housebuilding.While Angela Rayner, the housing secretary, has promised the Labour government will deliver the biggest boost to affordable housing in a generation, many in the sector say this will not be achievable without a major boost in funding at the spending review in June.Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, will announce at that point how much she intends to put into the affordable housing programme over the next five years, with campaigners calling for it to be given several billion pounds a year.MacRae said: “The spending review in June is a critical moment for the government to act. If they are serious about ending homelessness, they must commit to building 90,000 new social homes a year for a decade – ensuring that every family has the foundation of a genuinely affordable, stable home.”Explore more on these topicsHousingThrough the roofChildrenRenting propertyLocal governmentTax and spendingSocial housingHomelessnessnewsShareReuse this content"

The former US vice-president, who lost to Donald Trump in the November presidential election, is expected to offer a sharp critique of theTrump administration, in San Francisco.In addition, the Trump administration reportedly dismissed other Biden appointees to the council, including the former White House chief of staff Ron Klain; the former UN ambassador Susan Rice; the former deputy national security adviser Jon Finer; the former labor secretary Tom Perez; the former ambassador to Spain and Andorra Alan Solomont; and Mary Zients, the wife of the former White House chief of staff Jeff Zients,according toJewish Insider.Anthony Bernal, who served as a senior adviser to the former first lady Jill Biden, was also fired from the council, the New York Timesreported.Many of those reportedly fired on Tuesday had been appointed in January. Presidential appointments to the council typically serve for a five-year term.US federal agency texts Barnard College employees to ask if they’re JewishRead moreSolomont, who was appointed to the council in 2023, told Jewish Insider that he learned of his dismissal through an email from a staff member of the White House presidential personnel office.“On behalf of President Donald J Trump, I am writing to inform you that your position as a member of the United States Holocaust Memorial Council is terminated, effective immediately,” the email reads. “Thank you for your service.”The email provided no explanation for the dismissal and the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.A statement from the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum reads: “At this time of high antisemitism and Holocaust distortion and denial, the Museum is gratified that our visitation is robust and demand for Holocaust education is increasing.“We look forward to continuing to advance our vitally important mission as we work with the Trump Administration,” it added.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationJudaismAntisemitismDonald TrumpKamala HarrisUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

They did not need to be taken to hospital,” Magnus Jansson Klarin, a spokesperson for Uppsala police, told Svenska Dagbladet.“We cannot answer whether there is one or more perpetrators at this time,” he added.The minister of justice, Gunnar Strömmer, condemned the “brutal act of violence” and said his department was in close contact with police and was closely monitoring developments.The deadly incident came as the city prepared to celebrate Valborg – a Swedish bonfire festival marking the arrival of spring – on Wednesday, with an event to be attended by thousands of people.Strömmer said: “A brutal act of violence has occurred in central Uppsala. The police have confirmed that three people have lost their lives.“This at the same time as the whole of Uppsala has begun the Valborg weekend. What has happened is extraordinarily serious.”Trains coming in and out of the city were temporarily stopped between about 5.30pm and 6pm local time.A large police operation was under way near Vaksala Square. TV4 News reported that the incident had taken place inside a hair salon.Police said they were first alerted to the incident shortly after 5pm when they received several calls from members of the public about loud bangs.Several people were found with suspected gunshot wounds and police cordoned off a large area while they investigated.At 7.25pm, police confirmed that three people were dead after the shooting and that relatives were yet to be notified.“Police are investigating the incident as murder,” the force said in an update. Later a spokesperson said the crime had been declared a special incident.Explore more on these topicsSwedenEuropeShareReuse this content"

It’s among a handful of nations that enforces compulsory voting, boasting a turnout rate of more than 90%. The preferential voting system, in theory, means no votes are wasted and choice matters. In recent years, Australians even have an emblem for their civic duty – ademocracy sausage– the natural conclusion of voting on a Saturday at schools eager to raise funds.Also unique is Australian campaign vernacular, which is, year after year, keenly adopted by the media and politicians alike. From donkey voting to corflute stoushes and spruiking, here are some of the weird idioms you need to know to keep abreast of what’s been happening in the lead-up to Saturday’s federal election,which pitches incumbent Anthony Albanese’s Labor against Peter Dutton’s Liberal-National Coalition.4:14Voting 101: What is Australia’s preferential voting system and how does it work? – videoRortsVoters hate rorts, and politicians love to accuse each other of rorting. Rorts come in many forms. Election rorts are when the parties distribute taxpayer dollars unfairly to boost their chances of winning votes – like handing out grants for community sports clubs based on colour coded spreadsheets rather than merit.There was the sports rorts affair of the 1990s,sports rorts 2.0 in 2020, thecarpark rorts of 2021and ongoing entitlement rorts across party lines. If it’s not illegal, but it’s deeply dodgy or unfair, you mighthave a rort on your hands.CorflutesCorflutes are plastered across every major street in Australia for a few weeks when an election is taking place and then disappear into the ether. The word is a registered trademark of Corex Australia, denoting, in a political context, corrugated plastic sheeting used for temporary signage to promote a candidate, found anywhere from shopping centres to trees, highways or front gardens. Essentially, it’s a waterproof poster, but Australians call it a corflute.View image in fullscreenCorflutes awaiting a stoush at a polling centre in Darwin.Photograph: Aaron Bunch/AAPDuring this campaign, as in many previously, the corflute has been anobject of warfare– torn from fences and trampled, defaced with offensive graffiti and, in some cases, lit on fire. The corflute has become so divisive that one Australian state hasbanned it from being erected on public infrastructure, describing it as “visual pollution”.StoushStoush is a word the media loves to use whenever there is conflict. It spans a wide spectrum: if you’re in an animated debate, that’s a stoush. If you’re brawling, that’s a stoush. If you’ve taken someone to court – stoush. Same goes for policy disagreements, factional differences, campaign disputes. Parties may be stoushing internally, or with other parties, industry groups or lobbyists. The prime minister was even involved in astoush with Canada over Vegemite.Needless to say, there has also been an outbreak ofcorflute stoushes.SpruikingAccording to the internet, “spruik” may derive from the German wordSpruch, meaning “a saying”. In an Australian context, it has evolved to become slang for promoting something with a bit of flair.The PM doesn’t announce a new policy or some federal funding, he spruiks it. He doesn’t pitch the budget to young people, he spruiks the budget. A party doesn’t promote a former success, they spruik their wins.Having said that, spruik can also be used as an insult – if you’re“quick to spruik, but slow to act”or spruiking when you shouldn’t be spruiking (like campaigning at a politically neutral event, or spruiking as a distraction from the real story).TradiesIf you don’t appear during the election campaign decked out in hi-vis and a hard hat, you may as well kiss any chances of a leadership role goodbye. Championingtradies(slang for a tradesperson) is as essential to politicians as hugging babies, patting dogs and speaking kindly about their mothers.And you do not – ever – refer to a tradesperson as anything other than a tradie, whether in an official media release or at a press conference. One Liberal candidate has run this year on his work and family credentials,using the tagline: “Tradie. Soldier. Dad.”Fake tradiesAn important sub-category of tradies is the fake tradie – someone playing an unconvincing role as a tradie in campaign ads – which sprang to prominence thanks to a Liberal party advertisement in the 2016 campaign that waswidely mocked online. This year’s contenderstrongly resembled a campaign volunteerfor the former Liberal MP Tim Wilson.Voting informallyAustralian elections arenotoriously informal in terms of dress sense, but technically an informal vote is when, instead of putting a number against the candidates, you draw something stupid on your ballot paper,such as a penis.Donkey voteDonkey votingis something people do when they don’t care about who wins the election, or they don’t want their vote to count, but also don’t want to get fined for not casting a ballot (yes, it’s a thing). It’s pretty simple. On the lower house ballot paper, Australian voters must number all candidates in order of their preference. Donkey voting means starting at the top and numbering them in order down the page rather than considering them on their merits. (That means it is a small advantage to be listed at the top of the ballot, which is why candidates are drawn randomly in abizarre ceremonyinvolving a blindfolded member of the Australian Electoral Commission.)As for why it’s called a donkey vote? Presumably it’s a cruel take on donkeys - alleging they are stupid or misguided. Which is nothing like the reality ofAustralian politics.Explore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025Australian politicsexplainersShareReuse this content"

A family of three died from apparent carbon monoxide poisoning after using a generator in the north-west of the country, while a woman died in Valencia after her oxygen machine failed. Another woman died in Madrid in a fire started by a candle.Speaking on Tuesday morning after electricity had been restored to both countries, Sánchez said that while it was still too early to know exactly what had gone wrong with the power supply, lessons would be learned to prevent any further large-scale blackouts.“It’s clear that what happened yesterday can’t happen again,” he said, as he announced the creation of a commission to investigate the incident, which will also examine the role of private energy companies.The prime minister said his administration would “get to the bottom of this matter”, carrying out any necessary reforms and enacting any necessary measures to ensure there was no repetition of Monday’s events.‘Any radios?’ Rush to buy supplies in Madrid as blackout hitsRead morePortugal’s prime minister, Luís Montenegro, said his government would ask the EU’s Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators to perform “an independent audit of the electrical systems of the affected countries to fully determine the causes of this situation”.Despite energy providers in Spain and Portugal concluding that a cyber-attack was not to blame for the loss of power, Sánchez once again stressed that “no hypothesis” was being ruled out while the country’s intelligence services continued their investigations and analysis.The prime minister also warned people to be on the lookout for fake news that was still circulating, and dismissed suggestions that the blackout was the result of his administration’s decision to phase out nuclear power.“Those who link this incident to the lack of nuclear power are frankly lying or demonstrating their ignorance,” Sánchez said, adding that nuclear power generation “was no more resilient” than other electricity sources.View image in fullscreenPedro Sánchez speaking on Tuesday.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images‘People were stunned’: how massive blackout unfolded across Spain and PortugalRead moreNot long after he spoke, Spain’s highest criminal court, the Audiencia Nacional, said it had opened an investigation to determine whether “an act of computer sabotage” could have been perpetrated “against critical Spanish infrastructure”. Announcing the investigation, a judge at the court said cyberterrorism was “among the possible explanations” for the blackout.Hours earlier, however, Spain’s electricity operator, Red Eléctrica, said the blackout was not the result of a targeted attack.The operator’s head of services, Eduardo Prieto, said preliminary investigations meant “we can rule out a cybersecurity incident”, adding that there was nothing to suggest “there was any kind of intrusion into the Red Eléctrica control system”.Prieto said two consecutive events, which took place at 12.32pm on Monday and then a second and a half later, pointed to a “generation disconnection” that had cut off the supply across the peninsula. While the system weathered the first event, it could not cope with the second. Prieto said the problem had originated in south-west Spain, which is where much of the country’s solar energy is generated.View image in fullscreenPeople buying groceries in a dark shop in Lisbon on Monday, before power was restored.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe Portuguese government also ruled out a cyber-attack.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Across the border in Portugal, the electricity operator REN said all substations were fully operational and the national network had been “perfectly stabilised” by 11.30pm on Monday.In a statement early on Tuesday, Spain’s national meteorological office, Aemet, appeared to rule out the weather as a possible culprit. “During the day of 28 April, no unusual meteorological or atmospheric phenomena were detected, and nor were there sudden variations in the temperature in our network of meteorological stations,” said Aemet.REN also said it had not sent a message circulating on social media on Monday attributing the blackout to a rare atmospheric event. The message, in Portuguese, claimed the shutdown was due to “a fault in the Spanish electricity grid linked to a rare atmospheric phenomenon”.View image in fullscreenStranded train passengers who spent the night at Atocha railway station in Madrid.Photograph: Rodrigo Jimenez/EPA“REN confirms we did not put out this statement,” a spokesperson told Agence France-Presse.All of Spain’s airports were operating on Tuesday morning, but the transport ministry advised people to check with their airlines for possible changes and to find out whether they would be able to get to the airport on public transport.The state rail operator, Renfe, said the country’s train network, which was badly hit by the blackout, was gradually returning to normal but that local train services were suspended in regions including Murcia, Extremadura and Andalucía.About 35,000 people were rescued from more than 100 trains after the power cut hit on Monday.Widespread outages are unusual in Europe. In 2003, a problem with a hydroelectric power line between Italy and Switzerland caused blackouts for about 12 hours, and in 2006 anoverloaded power network in Germanycaused electricity cuts across parts of the country and in France, Italy, Spain, Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands.Explore more on these topicsSpainPortugalEnergy industryEuropeShareReuse this content"

Lynch, once described as Britain’s Bill Gates, and his 18-year-old daughter, Hannah, were among the victims.Lynch, who in June last year wascleared of fraud chargesin the US relating to the purchase of his company,Autonomy, by Hewlett-Packard in 2011, was enjoying a lavish voyage around Sicily to celebrate his acquittal alongside Hannah, and his wife, Angela Baraces, whose company owned the Bayesian.Among those onboard were Lynch’s attorney from Clifford Chance, Chris Morvillo, and his wife, the jewellery designer Neda Morvillo, and Morgan Stanley International’s chair, Jonathan Bloomer, and his wife, Judy Bloomer, a former psychotherapist. All four died in the incident. The yacht’s chef, Recaldo Thomas, was the seventh person who died.Fifteen people survived, including Baraces.Investigators hope the yacht will yield vital clues: whether a series of human errors led to the sinking, as initially suspected, or if other factors were at play. Once ashore, forensic examination will determine if one of the hatches remained open and whether the keel was improperly raised.The wreckage sits at a depth of 50 metres in the bay of Porticello, which is under surveillance by Italian authorities.Experts expect the salvage operation to be fiendishly complex.Sicilian port officials have declared a 650-metre exclusion zone around the sunken vessel, forbidding “any navigation, anchoring, diving, swimming or fishing until the work is complete”. The recovery, which could stretch on for weeks, has been entrusted to Hebo Maritiemservice and Smit International.A 55-metre barge, the Hebo Lift 2, will arrive in Porticello soon, its 700 sq metre deck carrying a heavy-lift crane, specialist diving apparatus and a remotely operated underwater vehicle. Offshore, the Hebo Lift 10 – one of Europe’s largest floating cranes – will use its 83-metre boom to hoist the yacht from the seabed.To facilitate the lift, the master mast of the Bayesian – standing 75  metres tall and weighing over 24 tonnes – will be cut away. Once raised, the vessel will be towed to Termini Imerese, where prosecutors have opened an inquiry into suspected manslaughter. The captain,James Cutfield, a New Zealander, and two British crew members,Tim Parker Eaton and Matthew Griffiths, have been placed under investigation.Being put under investigation inItalydoes not imply guilt and does not mean formal charges will necessarily follow.Insurers estimate the salvage will cost about $30m (£22.4m), a bill the Bayesian’s underwriters will pick up.Experts are baffled by how the Bayesiansank within 60 seconds. Some experts speculate the crew may have underestimated the weather bulletin.Search efforts began within hours of the incident, with divers from the fire brigade working non-stop.The first body to be recoveredwas that of Thomas, on the afternoon of the sinking. Two more bodies were recovered two days later, those of Jonathan Bloomer and Chris Morvillo. In the afternoon, their spouses were also found.The following day,Mike Lynch’s body was foundand a few hours later divers recovered the body of his daughter,Hannah, the seventh and final victim.All of their bodies have undergone postmortem examinations. Lucio Di Mauro, a forensic doctor and technical consultant for the Morvillo’s family, said the victims all died due to “so-called mechanical asphyxia by drowning”.“It is important to clarify that, in forensic medicine, the determination of death by drowning is particularly complex, as there is no single pathognomonic lesion that alone allows for an incontrovertible diagnosis,” Di Mauro added. ‘‘Nevertheless, the data collected are consistent with this pathophysiological mechanism.”Last September, Italian authorities requested additional security around the wreck of the luxury yacht, after fears were raised that material in watertight safes onboard could be of interest to foreign governments.The authorities were reportedly concerned thattwo super-encrypted hard drivesin the sunken yacht’s watertight safes could fall into the wrong hands.Explore more on these topicsItalyEuropeAutonomyHewlett-PackardShareReuse this content"

WPS is yet another woke divisive/social justice/Biden initiative that overburdens our commanders and troops — distracting from our core task: WAR-FIGHTING.”The defense secretary added the program was “pushed by feminists and left-wing activists”, claiming “Politicians fawn over it; troops HATE it.”Trump 100 days: from cornerstone of the west to unreliable allyRead moreBut the decision is raising some eyebrows as the initiative was established during Trump’s first administration when he signed the Women, Peace and Security Act in 2017, making the United States the first country in the world to codify standalone legislation on the matter.The Trump campaign even courted women voters byciting the initiativeas one of its top accomplishments for women on its website.Attempting to square this circle, Hegsethlater claimedthe Biden administration had “distorted & weaponized” the original program. “Biden ruined EVERYTHING, including ‘Women, Peace & Security,’” he insisted.The Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment clarifying what will change in this iteration of the WPS following the secretary’s announcement. Hegseth had indicated the Pentagon would comply with minimum requirements under federal statute but would lobby to defund the program during the next budget cycle in his initial post.The defense secretary’s problems with the program could also create awkward tension with multiple Trump cabinet members who were architects of the very policy he’s now dismantling. Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security secretary, wrote the 2017 legislation while serving in Congress and Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, co-sponsored the Senate version.Rubio,just this month, called it “a bill that I was very proud to have been a co-sponsor of when I was in the Senate”, at the state department’s international women of courage awards ceremony.Mike Waltz, the national security adviser, also supported other legislation to strengthen the WPS and served as co-chair of the bipartisan Women, Peace and Security Caucus.And first-daughter Ivanka Trump, back in 2019, also publicly promoted the program, writingon social mediathat “Today I was proud to announce, with female police cadets, that Colombia will develop a #WPS National Action Plan as part of our WPS partnership.”The WPS program, which originated from a 2000 United Nations security council resolution, was first created to boost women’s participation in peace and security planning and protect women from violence in conflict situations.Iterations of the program have since been widely adopted globally as research has shown that peace agreements with women’s participation are more durable.Explore more on these topicsPete HegsethTrump administrationDEI policiesUS politicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Most of the state’s cases are from Lea county, adjacent to Gaines county in Texas.“The ideal situation is to see a few weeks of no increase in the case count before we can have some optimism in the spread slowing down,” said Singh.US pediatricians and infectious disease experts say the fight against rising measles cases nationwide is being hampered by a lack of forceful advocacy for vaccination from government health officials and statements on unproven treatments that are confusing parents.Doctors assert that vaccination is the most effective way to prevent infection. Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that’s airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. The disease has been considered eliminated from the US since 2000.Other states with active outbreaks – defined as three or more cases – include Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Montana, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.With one-fifth of states seeing active measles outbreaks, the US is nearing 900 cases, according to figures posted Friday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC’s confirmed measles cases count is 884, triple the amount seen in all of 2024.In communities with high vaccination rates – above 95% – diseases like measles have a harder time spreading through communities. This is called “herd immunity”.But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their children from required shots. The US saw a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak in Chicago that sickened more than 60.Explore more on these topicsTexasUS politicsHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

A decision was taken to change that policy at an SFA board meeting last Thursday and steps including legal and governance compliance are being worked through by the organisation.There are no trans women footballers registered in the women’s game in Scotland and the SFA is understood also to be developing new plans for increasing LGBTQ+ participation.The change comes a week after theUK supreme court ruledthat the term “woman” in the Equality Act refers only to a biological woman. The SFA’s decision is likely to prove controversial, with the supreme court ruling a response to a decision by the Scottish government to extend the definition of “woman” to include trans women. The Scottish first minister, John Swinney, this week urged sporting bodies to wait for guidance from the Equality and Human Rights Commission before revisiting their policies on inclusion.This month, before the supreme court verdict, the English FA confirmed it would continue to allow trans women to play in the women’s game provided they exhibited low levels of testosterone for 12 months. This decision is understood to affect 20 registered transgender players in England, with the FA reserving the right to consult a transgender and nonbinary eligibility committee should there be concerns over eligibility.An FA spokeswoman said on Tuesday: “We are carefully reviewing our policy and taking legal advice.”Explore more on these topicsFootballScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

They reported being beaten + used as human shields,” Lazzariniwrote on X.Those detained had been subjected to “sleep deprivation, humiliation, threats of harm to them & their families + attacks by dogs … [and] forced confessions”.UN officials said the reported abuse had taken place both in Gaza and in military detention sites in Israel.The Israeli military has not responded directly to Lazzarini’s accusation, but has previously denied allegations of widespread abuse in its detention facilities and by its troops.It has, however, launchedinvestigationsinto abuse by individual soldiers during the war, and into the use of detainees as human shields,bringing chargesagainst service personnel in some cases.In a statement, the Israeli military said it acted in accordance with Israeli law and international law, and protects the rights of individuals held in detention facilities under its responsibility.“Any abuse of detainees, whether during their detention or during interrogation, violates the law and the directives of the IDF [Israeli Defense Forces] and as such is strictly prohibited,” the statement said.The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS), said on Tuesday that Israel had released a medic held since a deadly and hugely controversial attack by Israeli troops on ambulances in southern Gaza on 23 March.Eight PRCS staff members, six from the Gaza civil defence agency and one Unrwa employee were killed in the attack, according to the UN humanitarian office OCHA.The killings sparked international condemnation, including concern from the UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, about possible war crimes.View image in fullscreenA screenshot from a video published by the PRCS shows the last moments before Israeli troops opened fire on its ambulances in the southern Gaza Strip.Photograph: Palestinian Red Crescent/ReutersRelations between Israel and Unrwa have deteriorated since the beginning of the war, which was triggered by a surprise attack by Hamas militants in southern Israel in October 2023 during which they killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 250 hostage.Israel bannedall cooperationwith Unrwa’s activities in Gaza and the occupied West Bank earlier this year, and claims the agency has been infiltrated by Hamas, an allegation that has been fiercely contested.The international court of justice, the UN’s highest court, is hearing statements from dozens of countries and organisations before delivering a legal opinion on Israel’s humanitarian obligations to Palestinians. A key issue is whether Israel’s ban on Unrwa’s operations in Palestine is legal.Israel is not participating at the ICJ but has dismissed the hearings as “part of the systematic persecution and delegitimization” of the country. The foreign minister, Gideon Saar, said on Sunday that the hearings were “another attempt to politicise and abuse the legal process to persecute Israel”.Israel seems set on destroying system of international law compliance, ICJ hearsRead more“The goal is to deprive Israel of its most basic right to defend itself,” he said. “It is not Israel that should be on trial. It is the UN and Unrwa. The UN has become a rotten, anti-Israel and antisemitic body.”The hearings come amid an intensifying bombardment of Gaza, which had killed at least 27 Palestinians in the past 36 hours, according to local health officials on Monday. The Israeli military said airstrikes had killed three militant commanders and that all targets were “subject to relevant provisions of international humanitarian law, including the taking of feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm”.Palestinian health officials in the territory say 2,151 people, including 732 children, have been killed since Israel broke a fragile ceasefire on 18 March that had been in place since mid-January.Israel imposed a tight blockade on Gaza almost two months ago, stopping all food, fuel, medicines and other items from entering. It says the measure is intended to force Hamas into releasing hostages and accuses it of systematically stealing humanitarian assistance.Rights groups accuse Israel of using a “starvation tactic” that endangers the whole population, potentially making it a war crime.Humanitarian workers say supplies are running desperately low, with most people eating one meal or less a day. Major agencies such as the World Food Programme and Unrwa have distributed their last stocks of flour and other basic foodstuffs, and medics say malnutrition levels are rising.View image in fullscreenPalestinians clamour to receive food in Khan Younis.Photograph: Hatem Khaled/ReutersHamas is still holding 59 hostages, 24 of whom are believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements and other deals.Families of deceased hostages called on Tuesday for the return of their loved ones’ remains. There are fears that poor conditions and continuing fighting could lead to many being destroyed or soon becoming unidentifiable.“After everything we went through on that day and since, it cannot be that my father’s body will also disappear from the face of the Earth,” said Bar Godard, whose parents were killed during the 2023 Hamas raid and whose father’s body was taken to Gaza.Negotiations for a fresh ceasefire appear to have stalled, with conflicting reports about progress in ongoing talks. Few observers expect a breakthrough in the near future, though analysts say Donald Trump’s scheduled visit to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates in May could lead to renewed US pressure on Israel that might secure a deal.Israeli forces have killed more than 52,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, since it launched its offensive on Gaza, according to the territory’s health ministry.Bombardments and ground operations have also destroyed vast areas and displaced about 80% of the population, many of them 10 or more times.Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to continue the offensive until all the hostages are returned and Hamas is either destroyed or agrees to disarm and leave the territory.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

Then, heat the mixture gently until it thickens and turns clear.Next, add 100g of water to cool the mixture, before blending it with 200g of cheese and adding toasted black pepper.The resulting sauce should then be mixed with 300g of pasta that has been cooked in slightly salted water until it is al dente, drained and allowed to cool slightly.This step helps prevent the excessive heat from destabilising the sauce. Finally, they say a little reserved starchy water can be used to adjust the consistency as needed.“A true Italian grandmother or a skilled home chef from Rome would never need a scientific recipe for cacio e pepe, relying instead on instinct and years of experience,” the researchers write. “For everyone else, this guide offers a practical way to master the dish.”Dr Ivan Di Terlizzi, one of the co-authors of the research, said the team consumed about 6kg of cheese for the study, with “most of it eaten with bread”.“Although we are still not tired of this delicious dish, one of the authors had blood tests showing very high cholesterol levels,” he added. “It’s the price of science!”“When heated, cheese proteins change their configuration and, therefore, aggregate,” said Dr Daniel Busiello, another co-author of the study from Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems inGermany. Starch, he said, mitigated this effect by binding to the cheese proteins, reducing their direct interactions and hence their formation of clumps.To explore the secret to a smooth and creamy sauce, researchers carried out a number of experiments using a fixed cheese-to-water ratio, but with varying concentrations of starch. The latter was controlled by dissolving known quantities of dry cornstarch in the water.The results revealed fewer clumps occurred at lower temperatures, regardless of starch concentration, with the team adding that the proteins did not start to clump below 65C. As temperatures increased, higher concentrations of starch were needed to avoid clumps forming and prevent the “mozzarella phase” – where huge wads of cheese appear.“At higher starch concentrations, temperature becomes less of a concern, as the sauce remains smooth even with less precise heat control,” said Busiello.Busiello added that pasta water alone contained too little starch to reliably prevent clumping, producing a smooth sauce only with careful temperature control.“Our recommended scientific approach uses a starch-to-cheese ratio between 2% and 3% by weight, allowing home cooks to reliably create a smooth sauce without worrying too much about temperature,” he said.Explore more on these topicsScienceFood scienceGermanyPastaFoodEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Thirty years on, a new play is to revisit the fierce rivalry between Blur and Oasis when both British bands put out a new single in the same week and competed to grab the No 1 spot in the charts. Some purchased both releases, many couldn’t care less, but for a few days it was a decision that defined you: whether to spend £2.99 on Oasis’s Roll With It or Blur’s Country House?The Battle is the debut stage play of novelist and screenwriter John Niven who said of the era: “Music was so central to the culture that two pop groups could dominate the entire summer, the evening news and the front page of every newspaper in the country. We’re going to take you back there.”These days, said Niven, music has “splintered into a billion different TikTok feeds”. The Official UK Singles Chart, now based on streams and downloads as well as CDs and vinyl, does not bring the nation together as its Sunday afternoon radio broadcasts once did. The play’s director, Matthew Dunster, said of the time: “Music mattered. I remember being in my 20s in 1995. What a wild time. Full of energy, naughtiness and hilarity. Just like John Niven’s play.” The Battle, said Dunster, is “a punchy, hilarious and revealing comedy about two of the best bands of all time”.The play – billed as “based (mostly) on real events” – will follow the feud between the two bands preceding the chart battle, including the 1995 Brit awards where Blur beat Oasis to the trophies for best British single, album and group of the year. A year after the chart battle, coverage of a music industry charity football match centred onLiam Gallagherand Damon Albarn tussling on the pitch as the group’s rivalry continued to be hyped by the media.View image in fullscreenBlur v Oasis on the cover of NME in 1995.Photograph: Steve Double / Camera Press/NMEThe new play will explore how music fans clashed as they picked which band to support. An allegiance to Blur or Oasis could go beyond the tunes and also open up questions about class, fashion, masculinity and the north-south divide. Producer Simon Friend said: “Throughout my sister’s teenage years, she had an enormous poster ofDamon Albarnon her wall, and I remember her falling out with friends over which band they loved more. Ever since, this story has been in the back of my mind, and I was delighted that John Niven agreed to write it because there is no more qualified or hilarious chronicler of this world. Combined with Matthew Dunster directing, we have a fearless team recreating the sweaty mid-90s carnage of the Battle of Britpop”.Niven worked in the music industry for more than a decade and drew upon some of his experiences in the Britpop novel Kill Your Friends, which was published in 2008 and then adapted as a film in 2015. Dunster is the director of the hit2:22: A Ghost Story, is currently revivingDealer’s Choice at the Donmar Warehouseand will this summer stage an adaptation ofThe Hunger Games in London.Casting for The Battle has not yet been announced. The play opens atBirmingham Repin February. Joe Murphy, the theatre’s artistic director, said: “Our audiences are going to have the time of their lives being taken back to the rivalries, the chaos and the big personalities that made it all so unforgettable.”After it finishes in Birmingham the play will go on tour and have aWest Endrun. As spoilers go, it’s not quite up there with The Mousetrap but, for the record, Blur emerged triumphant that Sunday in mid-August. Country House sold 274,000 copies while Roll With It shifted 216,000.On top of their Britpop rivalries, Oasis’s Gallagher brothers also feuded with each other for years but this summer they are reuniting for the much-anticipated Oasis 25 international tour. In a joint statement after its announcement, the band said: “The guns have fallen silent. The stars have aligned.” The Blur v Oasis battle has also long since abated. “I like them,”said Blur’s Alex James in 2024. “He’s an incredible singer, Liam, and he can’t help being a rock star.”Explore more on these topicsTheatreBlurOasisBritpopDamon AlbarnNoel GallagherLiam GallaghernewsShareReuse this content"

Many believe the character is meant to hail from a Romany or Gypsy background, which accounts for much of the prejudice against him.Most big and small screen adaptations of the novel have ignored this, with the character having been played by actors including Ralph Fiennes, Tom Hardy and Timothy Dalton. However,Andrea Arnold’s 2011 adaptationdid cast a mixed race actor, James Howson, in the role.View image in fullscreen‘It’s all art’ … Kharmel Cochrane speaking at the Sands film festival on 26 April.Photograph: Roberto Ricciuti/Getty Images for University of St AndrewsBoth Howson and his co-star, Kaya Scodelario, were also a similar age to the characters in the novel, who are in their early 20s for much of the story. Robbie is 34, while Elordi – who also hails from Australia – is 27.“There was one Instagram comment that said the casting director should be shot,” said Cochrane. “But just wait till you see it, and then you can decide whether you want to shoot me or not. But you really don’t need to be accurate. It’s just a book. That is not based on real life. It’s all art.”She continued: “There’s definitely going to be some English Lit fans that are not going to be happy. Wait until you see the set design, because that is even more shocking.

Her books were also nominated for the Booker prize, the Orange (now Women’s) prize and the Folio (now Writers’) prize. She remains the only person to have won the Whitbread prize (latterly the Costa) in two categories: she won the children’s book category in 1981 for The Hollow Land and the best novel category in 1991 for The Queen of the Tambourine. Old Filth was named as one of theBBC’s 100 greatest British novelsin 2015.Gardam was much admired by fellow authors, with Ian McEwan calling her “a treasure of English contemporary writing”. Describing Old Filth when it came out in 2004, fellow novelist Maggie Gee said Gardam’s writing “crackles with energy, variety, sensuous richness. It is the writing of a 25-year-old with the wisdom and subtlety of a razor-sharp 100-year-old.”Born in 1928, Gardam was raised in the seaside Yorkshire town of Redcar by a maths teacher father and a stay-at-home mother who was passionate about writing. “She wrote all the time, endlessly. She’d just say to any child in the street, excuse me, could you just take this letter to the post. And she was always writing sermons,” Gardam told the Guardianin a 2005 interview.Her 1985 novel Crusoe’s Daughter, about an isolated woman who is obsessed with books, specifically Robinson Crusoe, was partly inspired by Gardam’s mother, she said. It “has a lot to do with a girl not being educated, when if she had been a boy the money would have been found”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

After completing her degree in English, she had a number of book-related jobs, including a stint as a Red Cross travelling librarian, and then a career as a journalist, first as a subeditor on the Weldon’s Ladies’ Journal and then as assistant literary editor at Time and Tide.She married a barrister, David Gardam, whose career partially inspired her most famous novel, Old Filth, a tragicomedy about a retired judge grieving his wife. The couple had three children, and it was only when the youngest had started school that she began her first book. “I think I would have died if it hadn’t been published,” she said ina 2011 Guardian interview. “I was desperate to get started – I was possessed.”Gardam and her husband moved to Sandwich in 1987, where she remained after his death in 2010, before moving to Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire in her final years. Her last book was Last Friends, published in 2013 and shortlisted for the 2014 Folio prize. The finale to a trilogy that began with Old Filth and continued with The Man in the Wooden Hat, Last Friends was described as “exuberant and funny and dizzy and a little bit frightening” byGuardian reviewer Tessa Hadley.Gardam was one of the first novelists published by Abacus, an imprint of Little, Brown. Richard Beswick, Jane’s publisher, said the novelist was “hugely loved by us all. Her warmth, humour and wisdom are quite irreplaceable.”“I discovered that writing was very nice indeed when I was very young, and I never changed,” Gardamtold the Telegraph in 2013. “I don’t think my style has changed very much at all – though I hope what I say is a bit more interesting. It’s about getting to know a character and loving them, I think.”Explore more on these topicsBooksJane GardamFictionChildren and teenagersnewsShareReuse this content"

The pair previously starred in Disney adventure Jungle Cruise.It comes from the writer-director Benny Safdie, marking his first solo effort behind the camera. Together with his brother, he received acclaim for crime dramas Good Times and Uncut Gems.“Benny wants to create, and continues to push the envelope when it comes to stories that are raw and real, characters that are authentic and at times uncomfortable and arresting,” Johnson said toVarietyin 2024. “I’m at a point in my career where I want to push myself in ways that I’ve not pushed myself in the past. I’m at a point in my career where I want to make films that matter, that explore a humanity and explore struggle [and] pain.”The actor also made it clear that this does not represent “an abandonment of big, four-quadrant movies”.In December last year, Bluntcalledit “an incredibly immersive, very intense, very emotional experience” and Safdie a “very cool, aesthetically exciting, visual director”.Last year Johnson led Christmas action comedy Red One and will next be seen in the live-action remake of Moana.He was also recentlyattachedto another film with Blunt, a Hawaii-set crime thriller from Martin Scorsese that will also star Leonardo DiCaprio. Johnson will co-author a true crime book on the same subject,callingit “an unbelievable, inspiring and eye-opening experience”.Blunt was last seen alongside Ryan Gosling in The Fall Guy after she received her first Oscar nomination for Oppenheimer.

Jez Butterworth’s Mojo and Patrick Marber’s Dealer’s Choice proved to be superficially dazzling calling cards rather than enduring classics. Now a pallid 30th-anniversary revival of the latter reveals its weaknesses.Set in a restaurant where the manager Stephen (the Paul Bettany-esque Daniel Lapaine) and his employees Frankie (Alfie Allen), Sweeney (Theo Barklem-Biggs) and Mugsy (Hammed Animashaun) are gearing up for a late-night card game, the play brims with bants.Mentions of the National Lottery, which was only a few months old when the play premiered, hint at an incoming gambling epidemic. There are even period-correct beer labels, though credulity is stretched when someone repeatedly gets phone reception in a basement.It is when the writing veers away from jokes and jibes that the play sags irredeemably. Two-thirds of the characters have no inner life, and half are prone to sudden outbursts which resemble artificial attempts to raise the stakes. That almost succeeds when Stephen discovers that his son Carl (Kasper Hilton-Hille) has been gambling with Ash (Brendan Coyle), a rival patriarch, and reacts like a spurned lover. But the absence of peril and gravitas in Matthew Dunster’s staging, and in his conception of character, is total. Ash is defeated rather than dangerous. Carl, a slot-machine addict, is about as troubled as Doogie Howser MD. The card games are fatally boring.View image in fullscreenDefeated not dangerous … Brendan Coyle (Ash), left, and Kasper Hilton-Hille (Carl) in Dealer’s Choice.Photograph: Helen MurrayThere are compensations. In Moi Tran’s design, the restaurant is dominated by a pebbledash wall the colour of dried blood, which hints at the premises’ butcher-shop origins. A spectacular piece of engineering makes us feel as if we are descending into the basement for the second act.This is eclipsed by the most special effect of all: Animashaun, an exuberantly geezerish geyser of charm, toweringly tall and quarterback-shouldered but with a dancer’s grace. It is fitting in a play about competitive masculinity that a single performer should emerge victorious, but the contest isn’t even close: this is practically a one-man show. “You’ve lost the plot,” someone tells Mugsy. “Iamthe plot,” he snaps back.

This was the loud and clear messaging at the firstChanelshow since Matthieu Blazy took up his role. The show was held at Villa d’Este, the Lake Como palace hotel where Elizabeth Taylor, Greta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich holidayed and which Alfred Hitchcock, who filmed The Pleasure Garden there, pronounced the most beautiful place on earth.The location, booked a year in advance, provided the theme: life in a grand hotel. Think White Lotus on Lake Como, art directed by Slim Aarons. First on to the pebbled catwalk weaving through the hotel’s terrace was a white bathrobe-style coat. Then there were capri pants in the butter yellow of the hotel parasols, and a lilac tweed suit to match the wisteria trailing overhead. Models swung tote bags big enough for pool towels, while gold lamé cover-ups glinted as dazzling as sun on the lake.View image in fullscreenA white bathrobe-style coat.Photograph: Jacopo M Raule/Getty Images“To me, Como is about the light,” said Bruno Pavlovsky, Chanel’s president of fashion. “Life is cinematic here.” Famous faces including the actors Keira Knightley and Sarah Catherine Hook were dotted among a 900-strong audience mostly made up of Chanel’s biggest-spending clients.The Cruise season of catwalk shows, named for a time when Caribbean cruises requiring trunks of glitzy loungewear were in vogue among the rich, has evolved to stand for holiday glamour in general. Spending on holiday wardrobes has increased exponentially across all price brackets: consumers spend less on dressing smartly for work, and more on looking good on holiday for Instagram. Brands drop serious money on Cruise shows, because a slice of this lucrative holiday market is worth a lot in sunglasses.

The Chanel ambassador made a short film on location at Villa d’Este to accompany the event.Photograph: Jacopo Raule/Getty ImagesPavlovsky describes Chanel as being in a moment of “generational handover”. Blazy, who took up his role at the beginning of April, did not work on this collection or attend the show, which was credited to the design studio. Holding the fort as figurehead for the event in his absence was the Chanel ambassadorSofia Coppola, who made a short film on location at Villa d’Este to accompany the event, which she described as “about that version of yourself when you get away, when you may be different from how you are in real life”.Chanel has doubled revenue and headcount in the past decade to become the world’s second-largest luxury brand behind Louis Vuitton, with 36,500 employees at the end of 2023. It is more than 10 times the size of Bottega Veneta, from where Blazy arrives. His October debut is hotly awaited but Pavlovsky is “not so interested in what happens in October”. Rather, he is “interested in a future which begins in October. We work on Chanel time. We don’t rush.” Pavlovsky has said he will wait two years before judging whether Blazy is the right fit.Pavlovsky dismissed any suggestion of moving production to the US as a strategy to avoid tariffs. He said Chanel intended to maintain its current policy of price harmonisation, in which prices are consistent in every country in the world, adding that they would “find a way to cover the cost” of keeping prices low in US boutiques if tariffs were levied.View image in fullscreenTote bags were big enough for pool towels.Photograph: Stéphane Cardinale/Corbis/Getty ImagesPavlovsky told Womenswear Daily that it was “the great admiration and respect for the heritage and the work done by Mademoiselle Chanel, by Karl and by Virginie”, which he sensed in Blazy, which clinched the recruitment. “That was important to me, because it wasn’t about a kind of competition over image and size. It was about the depth of what the brand stands for, and how we could build on that to continue telling our story.” Blazy has begun to make changes, including the hiring of the seasoned British haute couture specialist Andrew Heather, who has worked under designers including Alexander McQueen and John Galliano.View image in fullscreenA lilac tweed suit matched the wisteria trailing overhead.Photograph: Antonio Calanni/APSilk scarves made in Como featured as ankle straps for heeled sandals on the catwalk. Chanel has recently taken a 35% stake in the Como-based manufacturer Mantero, which has been producing silk for Chanel blouses and printed scarves for more than 50 years. Under the terms of the deal, Mantero will continue to produce clothes for rival luxury clients including Dior, Saint Laurent and Versace, but Chanel believes that protecting key players in its supply chain is a sound investment, at a time when global economic pressures are putting many specialist producers out of business.Explore more on these topicsFashionChanelItalyEuropeSofia CoppolanewsShareReuse this content"

My problem is my sexual script, which intellectually I don’t believe, but still cannot seem to set down. My husband has a larger penis, a more typically masculine and societally attractive body and is older, more experienced and more skilled a lover than I am. I know none of this matters and that sex should be about mutual pleasure and connection, but I cannot help but feel inadequate, leading to performance anxiety.My husband is kind and reassuring, but this has been going on for our whole relationship and I feel stuck and frustrated.Being distracted during sex , whether it is due to any kind of anxiety, lack of confidence in your body, fear of losing your erection, fear of disease, germ phobia, stress about external life situations – or any one of many possible thought intrusions – will easily arrest your enjoyment of a sexual process, and often lead to sexual dysfunction. Rather than allowing negative thoughts and fears to intrude during erotic experiences, it is important to focus simply on the purpose of eroticism – pleasure. This is not easy for people who have become invested in achieving excellence of performance, or even just being able to maintain an erection. Switch your approach to sex, ask for your partner’s support and cooperation in being able to stop and relax whenever negativity intrudes and refocus on just giving and receiving pleasure. If your anxiety is generalised (it occurs in many other situations) it is important to seek formal treatment or proven methods to calm you.Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns toprivate.lives@theguardian.com(please don’t send attachments).

Whereas a product labelled “complementary” should not be a dog’s only source of nutrition, says Lauren Bennett, RSPCA scientific and policy officer, as these “do not contain all of the required nutrients, may lead to poor nutrition and can cause dietary deficiencies and associated disease, such as metabolic bone disease”.This sounds straightforward – but the price of “complete” foods varies considerably, and can’t be compared simply by cost per kilo, as different brands recommend different portion sizes. Comparing the daily cost of feeding a 5kg adult toy poodle, a clearer picture emerges.Wet dog food is usually the most expensive “complete” option. Buying six meaty 400g tins of Pedigree Chum worked out at £1.05 a day, while a Butternut Box subscription of “gently cooked, never ultra-processed” pouches of meaty dog food “taste-tested by humans” came to a whopping £2.02 a day.Comparing the daily cost of feeding the same poodle from 2kg bags of dry food, we found vegan options were a little cheaper, with Wilsons Vegan Premium Cold Pressed Dog Food at 82p a day, followed by Hownd Plant Powered Superfood at 69p. Wainwright’s Insects With Superfoods came in at 67p a day, but the standard non-vegan kibble was the most affordable, with Wagg Meaty Goodness dry food at 21p, andPetsat Home Complete Nutrition dry food with chicken 22p.More expensive dog food may have additional ingredients, such as fatty acids which can help with skin and coat health. However, “premium” brands may also seek to use less grains and cereals, unsustainably increasing the total meat content – withno evidence, according to the British Veterinary Association (BVA), that this benefits animal health and welfare. Using fresh ingredients in wet food can also increase the carbon footprint, if it needs to be transported and kept frozen.A higher-cost food doesn’t mean it’s necessarily healthier. Nobody should feel guilty about choosing cheaper ‘complete’ options“There may be very good reasons why you choose a higher-cost food, but that doesn’t mean it’s necessarily healthier than another dog food,” says BVA senior vice president, Dr Anna Judson, a practising vet. “Nobody should feel guilty about choosing cheaper ‘complete’ options. Buy what you can afford.” If you want individual advice for your dog, she recommends speaking to your vet or veterinary nurse.The ‘natural’ optionWe associateultra-processed foodswith having a lower nutritional value, but this isn’t the case for processed dog foods that are labelled “complete”. Despite this, unprocessed, organic and raw dog foods are becoming increasingly popular. Caroline Griffith, canine nutrition consultant, thinks cooking “fresh whole foods” in recipes tailored for dogs is the healthiest way to feed them – and, she says, it costs less money and reduces packaging waste compared to buying dog food from retailers. “If you can be savvy and make homemade, lightly cooked dog food, that’s going to be a very economical way to feed your dog.”Dogs have stronger stomach acid than humans, she says, so the meat you cook for dogs needs to be “just browned off” to the point where it has lost its “original raw colouring. Think rare or medium rare steak”. She also recommends feeding dogs with raw meaty bones from specialist pet food suppliers, as long as they are “safely sold” and have been frozen for several weeks to mitigate the bacteria and parasitic risks of these products: “Then you defrost it in the [dog’s] bowl so you don’t have to touch it,” she says.Again, these products will need to be transported while frozen, raising their carbon footprint. The BVA also has concerns about the potential disease risks that raw dog food poses to both dogs and humans. “We would always say: talk to your vet first,” says Judson. Creating a homemade, nutritionally balanced diet for your dog can be “really tricky” and “time consuming”. She recommends getting advice from a certified veterinary nutritionist from theEuropean College of Veterinary and Comparative Nutritionor theAmerican College of Veterinary Internal Medicinebefore you start. “It needs to be done with a lot of research and very carefully to get it right – and for many pet owners, that will be more complex than time permits,” says Judson.View image in fullscreenChow down … portion size is paramount.Photograph: Sally Anscombe/Getty ImagesPortion size is everything“Weighing portions accurately reduces waste,” says Judson. “This makes any product more sustainable, and it also helps to keep your dog at a healthy weight,” she says. A 2018 study foundup to 65% of UK dogsare overweight or obese.It is particularly important to consider your dog’s weight if you feed your dog leftovers. Bennett points out that human foods are often high in fat and salt, and so may not be suitable for dogs. “Additionally, the digestive tract of a dog differs from people, meaning that leftovers can cause digestive problems such as vomiting, diarrhoea, pancreatitis and in some cases, can be highly toxic and fatal,” she says. “Foods to avoid include anything from the onion family, chocolate, macadamia nuts, avocado, xylitol, grapes and raisins.” Judson advises against giving a dog more than 10% of their overall calorific intake in leftovers and treats.The eco alternativesAvoiding meat and dairy products is one of the best ways to reduce your environmental impact, and there is an ever-growing range of vegan dog food options. Dogs do not have to be carnivores and it is possible to feed them an eco-friendly, plant-based diet. But because these products haven’t been around long, Judson offers a word of caution: “The lack of robust long-term data about their safety means owners should definitely monitor their dog’s health for long-term impact.”Research also suggestsinsect production at a large scale for animal feedis more environmentally friendly than conventional livestock production. Dog food made with insects as an alternative proteinlaunched in the UKin 2019. There is promising evidence that dogs fed this dietsuffer no adverse short-term health effects, but more long-term studies are needed and, Judson says: “We’ve got to think about the welfare of insects that have been farmed.”Meanwhile, last summer, the UKbecame the first country in Europeto back cultivated meat for use in pet food and in February, a limited release of Chick Bites – a dog treat made from lab-grown meat –went on saleat Pets at Home in Brentford.Among meat-based dog foods, research suggests kibble is more sustainable than wet dog food. In 2022, researchers found wet pet food results ineight times more climate-heating emissionsthan dry pet food.Explore more on these topicsDogsThe Guardian guide to living with dogsAnimalsPetsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The formula, says Gurdeep Loyal, author ofFlavour Heroes(published in June), goes something like this: “You need two things: a really good fat and a really good sour.” Sure, that fat could be oil, but it doesn’t have to be. “It could be an egg yolk, it could be avocado, but if it’s oil, go for a flavoured one,” Loyal says, and in place of the usual acid suspects (vinegar or citrus), try the likes of gherkins, capers or preserved lemons instead. “My go-tos are preserved lemon whizzed up with a bit of their brine, some garlic-infused olive oil and maple syrup. Or avocado blitzed with gherkins, gherkin brine, a bit of sugar, if you want, and perhaps herbs such as chives or tarragon. Or chilli-infused olive oil blitzed with a teaspoon of tamarind.” These powerhouses are a dream on pretty much anything, he says, from a roast kale salad with chickpeas to baked butter beans or even as a dip for pizza crusts.For William Gleave, chef-patron ofSargassoin Margate, meanwhile, “Something with anchovies is always nice, because it goes with so many things”. For him, a “classic stolen/borrowed from the River Cafe” comes out tops: “It’s essentially a dressing with lots of chopped anchovy, grated garlic, red-wine vinegar, lemon juice, oil, black pepper and chilli flakes,” which is to say it’s bright, umami-rich and versatile. “Spoon that over everything from grilled fish to lamb or pork to crunchy veg, and it will feel as if you’ve put in a load of effort, even though it’s super-simple.”Another shortcut to big flavour iszhoug, says Marc Summer, founder ofBubala, which has just opened a third restaurant in London’s Kings Cross. “Whizz up a load of different herbs – coriander, parsley, mint – with oil, garlic andhawaij[a Yemeni spice blend with lots of black pepper, cumin and coriander].” That will transform meals in seconds: “Add it to pasta for an amazing herby sauce, or to fried onions, much as you might a curry paste.”Summer is also a big fan of crunches, especially when apricots are involved. “Make it as you would a chilli crunch, with lots of fried shallots, garlic and Sichuan peppercorns, then add hot oil, dried apricots and harissa for a really amazing, smoky-sweet oil.” Drizzle over yoghurty roast carrots or blanch some noodles, add tahini and top with the crunch: “That’ssotasty.” And remember, it’s the small things that count, so while the harissa’s out, Summer suggests combining it with honey and using as a marinade for vegetables before roasting: “That adds flavour quickly and puts a stop to same-old weekday meals.”Tahini sauce, meanwhile, is Xanthe Ross’s salvation’: “It feels indulgent,” says the author ofStay for Supper, “and it’ll instantly jazz up roast veg and salads, or use it as a dip.” You’ll most likely have all the ingredients (tahini, lemon, olive oil, sometimes honey and water) knocking around, anyway. That said, you can’t go far wrong with a classic vinaigrette, either, but mix up the vinegar element to keep things interesting. “It’s hard to make in small quantities, so have a batch in the fridge for the week,” she says. “That’s good on so many things beyond a green salad, such as tomatoes on toast for lunch, although the French might hate me for saying so.”Got a culinary dilemma?

Scientists weigh up the best options, from flicking it into the undergrowth to reusing newspapersKate McCuskerTue 29 Apr 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Apr 2025 02.01 EDTShareWhen Laura Young got Cooper the cavapoo in 2020, she knew that single-use plastic poo bags weren’t going to cut it. “Having a dog is a lifestyle extra,” says the 28-year-old environmental scientist. “I was aware that I wanted to try not having a negative environmental impact.” But where to start? The shelves seemed to be divided into two camps: bog-standard, single-use plastic wisps, and shiny, expensive bags brandishing eco buzzwords. “I was conscious that compostable bags weren’t the solution,” says Young. “But initially that’s all I could find and so that’s what I bought.”Often marketed as biodegradable, compostable or made from an alternative material such as cornstarch, they promise a more environmentally friendly option than single-use plastic. (Plastic poo bags, frequently made from low-density polyethylene, will sweat in landfill for thousands of years, breaking down into harmful microplastics and releasing climate-warming methane as they go.)“You’ve got plastic bags, you’ve got recycled plastic bags, you’ve got compostable bags, you’ve got biodegradable bags,” says Young. “There are actually so many materials now that it’s confusing.” She’s not alone in puzzling over which to buy, with the nation’s dogs producing more than 1,000 tonnes of poo every day in the UK.There’s the risk that owners go: ‘Well, it’s OK now because it’s biodegradable, so I can leave it in the forest’Compostable and biodegradable bags promise to break down in the right conditions but given that oxygen and light are needed for biodegradation to take place, these types of bags are rendered useless if binned and sent to landfill. Then there’s the danger that because they say biodegradable on their packaging, people won’t throw them in the bin in the first place. “People don’t clearly understand what buying a biodegradable bag means,” says Karl Williams, the director of the Centre forWasteManagement at the University of Central Lancashire. “There’s the risk that dog owners go: ‘Well, it’s OK now because it’s biodegradable, so I can leave it in the forest.’” The bags won’t biodegrade if just dumped out in the open, dog poo can contain harmful pathogens such as E coli and it is, for the record, littering.Some even argue that the environmental impact of manufacturing these types of bags does more harm than your standard plastic fare. “When you do the life cycle assessment of the whole process, they’re actually worse because you’re using so much energy to make the bag in the first place,” says Mark Miodownik, professor of materials and society at UCL. “It’s a very small industry, and its small size basically makes it inefficient. You’re still using a lot of energy and water to make these bags, but you’re competing with the scale of the trillion dollar plastics industry, which does things much more efficiently per bag.”In an ideal world, I kick the poo to the side. As long as it’s off the path, I think it’s going to decompose there better than being in a bagIt’s no wonder, then, that some dog owners are attempting to get rid of bags altogether. “In an ideal world, I kick the poo to the side,” says 55-year-old Lynda. “As long as it’s off the path, I think it’s going to decompose there better than being in any kind of bag.” Known as the stick and flick method, this type of dog waste disposal is controversial: a recent study from Belgium found that dog faeces and urine were being deposited in nature reserves at such a rate that it was overfertilising the soil and harming biodiversity. “Intuitively, you would think that nutrients are good for plants – adding nitrogen and phosphorus is something we do in agriculture and arable fields,” says Pieter De Frenne, professor of applied plant sciences at Ghent University, who led the study. “But only a subset of plant species can really take advantage of the additional nitrogen and phosphorus inputs.” As a result, many local flora will be driven out by thriving plants such as nettles and hogweed, reducing biodiversity. De Frenne advises against stick and flick in any ecosystem – whether you’re walking on or off the beaten track.So what’s the solution? For Miodownik, it’s surprisingly straightforward: “If you’re going to put it in a municipal bin or your own bin, you’re better off trying to reuse a bag that you already have in your possession that would otherwise go in the rubbish. You give it a second life, and you’re not consuming resources by buying a bag.”Dog walkers from across the country have come up with innovations of their own. Jacqueline Moore from Musselburgh fashions a folded sheet of newspaper into a parcel: “I can usually slide it under her while she poos.” While other intrepid owners have reported reusing everything from cereal bags to magazine postal pouches. As for Young, she’s settled on the best solution she could find: Scottish brand Project Harmless’s £15.50 bags that dissolve in water. That is, when she can’t find an old bread bag to use instead.Explore more on these topicsDogsThe Guardian guide to living with dogsAnimalsPetsWastefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The role usually involves termly meetings of the full governing body and membership, and meetings of one of the subgroups. You will also be expected to be on any complaint, exclusion and disciplinary panels. There is always a lot of paperwork to read.TheNational Governor Associationprovides lots of information and advice about what the role involves. Schools inform parents or carers about vacancies on their governing body. You can also sign up withGovernors for Schools, a service in England that matches schools with volunteers.Start or support a PTAIf a parent-teacher association (PTA) does not already exist at your school, talk to the headteacher or a leadership team member to ask whether they would like one established.Contact parents and carers through the newsletter asking who would like to be involved and ask the school to share a contact email address. Arrange your first meeting at a mutually convenient time for the school and parents. Explain the aims and what it could do.View image in fullscreenIf you want to set up a PTA you could contact parents and carers through the school newsletter.Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PAIdentify skills and people willing to become PTA members and take key roles, such as chair, secretary and treasurer. The websiteParentkindoffers lots of resources to help you set up a group, including guides to the different roles you will need to recruit people to.Where there is an existing PTA you could support it by helping to organise or publicise events, or by volunteering at and attending them.Give expertiseStaff cannot be specialists in every area in which they teach, so external experts can help extend pupils’ knowledge and skills.You may have skills that can obviously be taken into a classroom – say, for example, you’re a professional dancer or chef – but other jobs may also give you expertise you can share with pupils.A business strategist, for example, could bring real-life experience to economics courses.You could help with lessons or, if you have more time, run or assist with an after-school club.View image in fullscreenDo you have any relevant expertise? You could help with lessons or, if you have more time, run or assist with an after-school club.Photograph: Mint Photography/AlamySchools welcome specialisms such as web design, drama, art, entrepreneurship or sport.Jo Zwierzchaczewski-Mitchelhill, a parenting coach,has volunteered as a netball coach at her daughter’s primary school in Kent for four years and organised interschool netball games. She committed about two hours every week in term time, including the hour of the club. “I loved seeing the kids be active in sport and gain confidence in their ability as netball players. Also how they would gel as a team and the team spirit they developed,” she says. “I gained personal satisfaction from seeing the children progress.”If you yourself are studying and the course involves a placement, consider whether you could do it in a school. Drama therapy, social care, counselling and business courses often include a placement element.Speak in schoolsSpeakers can help motivate and inspire pupils, raising aspirations, increasing confidence and demonstrating possible career paths.Eloise Skinneris a psychotherapist and author who volunteers through the mayor of London’senterprise adviser network. She says: “The role’s quite flexible and can encompass all aspects of career support – from strategic planning and oversight of careers activities to in-person delivery of careers workshops, talks and events, which I tend to get involved with, taking five to 10 hours each term.”You can also find speaking opportunities through the freeInspiring the Futureschools service. Volunteers range from apprentices to chief executives, across a range of sectors.Think of your own network of friends and colleagues. As a governor at Heathcote secondary and science college in London, I’ve brought in speakers such as Rob Unsworth, a former editor of the BBC’s The One Show, to discuss media careers and the TV judge Rob Rinder, who regularly covers law. “Too often, bright young minds are held back simply because they’ve never met a lawyer who looks or sounds like them. By stepping into the classroom, I’m showing them that the legal world isn’t just for the privileged few – it’s for anyone with the grit and the brains,” Rinder says.Could someone you know talk about, motivation, disability awareness, entrepreneurship, the charity sector, medicine or science, for instance?VolunteerOne-to-one – or small group – support can have a huge impact on pupils’ learning and results. This is especially true for pupils who have special educational needs or who struggle in one area of learning.Sabina Green, the writer of theMummy Matters blog, volunteered regularly as a “reading buddy” at Deeping St James community primary school, near Peterborough. She attended a workshop on strategies for how to listen and question the pupils about what they were reading, as well as how to assist them. “Having them read small sections and discuss helped them recall information and build a mental picture, boosting their confidence,” Green says.She volunteered between one and two hours a week, but she says some grandparents volunteered daily as reading buddies.View image in fullscreenOne-to-one support can have a huge impact on pupils’ learning and results, so maybe volunteer as a ‘reading buddy’.Photograph: Posed by models; SDI Productions/Getty ImagesMentors can greatly affect a young person’s life, helping with personal and educational development by sharing their experience. You or someone you know could offer to mentor and support a young person facing challenges such as drugs, trauma, family issues or mental health. If you think you can help, contact the school’s pastoral lead member of staff to discuss how to get involved. Typically, it’s about an hour a week, but it depends on everyone’s needs.Donate goodsSchools get through an unbelievable amount of paper. Do you, or anyone you know, work at a print company or warehouse? Standard A4 white paper is useful, as well as paper of differing sizes, colours and textures, for art classes.Could you offer to produce leaflets for marketing or fundraising?Siân Pelleschi, a professional organiser, donates her clients’ unwanted items, such as books and clothes, to her children’s local schools. She also regularly donates unwanted or leftover craft materials from older generation crafters she works with.View image in fullscreenUnwanted books can be donated to schools, while PTA-run uniform shops will appreciate clothing such as a blazer that no longer fits your child.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/Alamy“My children’s schools are often in need of different materials they can use for projects or classes – so I tend to build up crafting items – pens, paper, paints … anything they can use in class with the younger children – and then take them in when I have enough to hand over that would be of use,” Pelleschi says.It is not only pupils who could benefit. Andy Coley gave 20 copies of his book Leadership is a Skill to the senior team of his local school federation.Before turning up with a donation, do check that the school wants what you have to give.Uniform shops are popular, usually run each term by the PTA, and will usually take donations of children’s shirts, skirts, trousers, blazers and jumpers that no longer fit. They can be sold to raise funds.Donate other people’s cashDo your online shopping throughEasyfundraising.org,which has partnered with more than 7,000 brands including big names such as Amazon, John Lewis and the leading supermarkets. It will donate part of your spending to a cause of your choice.Give as you Live Onlineis a similar setup. If your school is not registered, contact it and ask whether it would like you to go through the very simple process to do so. Once it is set up, the school can inform its community.Recycle ink cartridges atRecycle4Charity, which will donate money to a good cause of your choosing. You can add your school if it is not listed.Are you a bid writer or do you know one? Schools can apply for funding of up to £20,000 through national lottery’sAwards for All England(there are also programmes for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) to spend on projects.

He has crammed its walls with gold-framed paintings of great men from US history. In 100 daysDonald Trumphas turned the Oval Officeinto a gilded cage.The portraits of Andrew Jackson, Ronald Reagan and other past presidents gaze down from a past that the 47th seems determined to erase. Trump is seeking to remake the US in his image at frightening speed. Theshock and aweof his second term has challenged many Americans’ understanding of who they are.In three months Trump has shoved the world’s oldest continuousdemocracytowards authoritarianismat a pace that tyrants overseas would envy. He has used executive power to take aim at Congress, the law, the media, culture and public health. Still aggrieved by his 2020 election defeat and 2024 criminal conviction, his regime of retribution has targeted perceived enemies and proved that no grudge is too small.Trump 100 days: Trump’s whirlwind start to his second presidencyRead moreHistorically such strongmen have offered the populace a grand bargain: if they will surrender some liberties, he will make the trains run on time. But Trump’sdelusions of monarchyhave been coupled with a fundamental ineptitude.His trade war injected chaos into the economy, undermining a campaign promise to lower prices and raising the spectre of recession; his ally Elon Muskwreaked havocon the federal government, threatening health and welfare benefits for millions; his foreign policy turned the world upside down, making friends of adversaries and turning allies into foes.Having promised so much winning, Trump is losing. Just 39% of respondents approve of how he is handling his job as president,according to an opinion pollby ABC News, the Washington Post newspaper and Ipsos, while 55% disapprove. For the first time Trump is even under water on his signature issue of immigration.“Donald Trump’s first 100 days as president have been 100 days from hell for the American people,” Chuck Schumer, the minority leader,wrote in a letter to Senate colleagues. “His first 100 days have been the worst for any president in modern history, and unsurprisingly, he has the lowest 100-day job approval any president has seen in 80 years.”The scale of the disaster is hard to comprehend for anyone who expected a repeat of Trump’s first term. His first 100 days in 2017 were consequential enough: a travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries, an order for construction of a wall along the US-Mexico border and the firing of his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, over undisclosed contacts with Russia. But while America’s guardrails bent, they did not break.View image in fullscreenGuests including Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai and Elon Musk attend Donald Trump’s inauguration.Photograph: Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AFP/Getty ImagesFrom the momenthe was sworn inon 20 January 2025, with the tech oligarchs Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg looking on, it was clear that Trump’s second presidency would be of a different magnitude. Instead of the conservative stalwart Mike Pence as vice-president, there is the Maga isolationist JD Vance. Instead of the retired four-star general Jim Mattis as defence secretary, there is the former Fox News weekend host Pete Hegseth.And instead of experienced hands ready to curb Trump’s impulses, there is a cabinet of sycophants eager to indulge them, including in ostentatious displays for the TV cameras. Trump, 78,told the Atlantic magazine: “The first time, I had two things to do – run the country and survive; I had all these crooked guys. And the second time, I run the country and the world.”Leon Panetta, a former defence secretary and White House chief of staff, said: “In the first term there were some guardrails and individuals that were able to restrain him before he took action. In the second term he doesn’t have any guardrails and deliberately selected a cabinet in which loyalty was the primary quality that he was after.“The problem is that he goes ahead and takes actions that can cause tremendous disruption. The only check that I can see is when something he does could very well lead to an economic disaster of one kind or another. It’s only when that seems clear that he basically pulls back.”Trump and his allies had four years in political exile to plot and plan a disruptive agenda laid out in Project 2025, a set of proposals by the rightwing Heritage Foundation thinktank in Washington. Yet its execution has been undermined by the president’s mercurial nature, cabinet infighting and leaks, especially at the Pentagon, reportedly now in disarray.Charlie Sykes, a conservative author and broadcaster, said: “I’m struck by this weird combination of a focused and very well-planned agenda on the one hand and reckless incompetence on the other. You have Russ Vought [director of the office of management and budget] and the Project 2025 folks who clearly had a blueprint for action ready to go and yet you also see this pattern of dysfunction running through agencies like the Department of Justice and Department of Defense.”For Trump’s diehard supporters, his key strength is his success as a businessman and promise to run the economy accordingly. As president he has imposed tariffs on trading partners including Mexico, Canada and China, with Chinese goods facing a combined tax of 145%.The impact has been profound, with consumer confidence plummeting, stock markets convulsing and investors losing confidence in the credibility of Trump’s policies. In the ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll, 72% said they thought it was very or somewhat likely that his economic policies would cause a recession in the short term.View image in fullscreenHundreds of demonstrators gather in front of the White House for a ‘Hands Off’ rally in Washington DC on 19 April.Photograph: Mehmet Eser/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/ShutterstockTrump, who promised be a dictator only on “day one”, has signed more than 135 executive orders, well ahead of any other president in their first 100 days, bypassing Congress. He tapped Musk to lead the “department of government efficiency”, or Doge, aimed at reducing government waste with a Silicon Valley-inspired “move fast and break things” mentality.Doge has been slashing programmes, jobs and entire agencies, including the Department of Education, that by law receive funding under the purview of Congress. Musk and his team havecombed throughtax, social security and health records, putting private data at risk. While Musk initially aimed for $1tn in budget cuts, analysts predict that he will fall dramatically short.Doge has caused turmoil in medical research by firing doctors and scientists working to cure diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer’s. It hasfrozen fundingfor military veterans’ facilities and fired critical workers at hospitals serving disabled veterans. Musk has also described health and social welfare programmes as “the big ones to eliminate” and social security as “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time”.Even long-term political observers are aghast at Trump’s acts of self-sabotage.Paul Begala, a former White House adviser and Democratic strategist, said: “I expected him to be stupid. I expected him to be chaotic. I expected his team to be a bunch of sycophants and nincompoops. I expected the tariffs and trade war.“Here’s what I didn’t expect. For me, the defining word of these 100 days has been betrayal. A good politician takes office and tries to expand beyond his base; an average politician tries to reward his base; Trump is the first politician who’s screwing his base, betraying his base. I honestly don’t understand it.”View image in fullscreenUS Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents walk down a street during an enforcement operation in Chicago on 26 January.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesIn keeping with his campaign promise, Trump has implemented some of the hardest-line immigration policies in the nation’s history, driving a sharp decline in illegal border crossings.He invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport immigrants without due process, including sending alleged Venezuelan gang members to a mega-prison in El Salvador in defiance of a court order. The action was met with legal challenges and judicial rebuke. Trump also pledged to end birthright citizenship and proposed “gold cards” for millionaires to buy US citizenship.Another defining theme of the first 100 days is retribution. On his first day in office, Trump pardoned virtually everyone who took part in the 6 January 2021 insurrection. He has actively targeted prosecutors who investigated him, former officials who criticised him and universities whose policies he disliked. He ordered the justice department to investigate Christopher Krebs, a cybersecurity director who refuted unfounded claims of election fraud in 2020.Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said: “This will truly be known as the administration of revenge and retribution. No one’s ever done these things before. Even Richard Nixon, who kept an enemies list and was full of anger and resentment, couldn’t hold a candle to Trump.“It’s frightening and has the effect of intimidating people. He loves to bully and he has done more than any other president, certainly in a short period of time. There’s just nothing like this in all of American history. I’ve had so many people my age say, can I survive this? Because it’s stressful.”Trump’s executive orders have faced more than 150 lawsuits and judges have blocked the administration numerous times. The president called for the impeachment of a federal judge who ruled against him, prompting a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts. Last week agents arrested Hannah Dugan, a Milwaukee judge accused of helping a man evade immigration authorities at her courtroom.Trump is also waging a culture war. Funding for arts and cultural institutions has been cut, and leaders ousted, with the president declaring them fronts for a “woke” agenda. The administration has gone after the media, fighting against news organisations in court and seeking to dismantle the Voice of America broadcaster. Access for some outlets has been restricted while “Maga media” have been platformed.PEN America, which defends writers worldwide against autocratic regimes, said the opening weeks of the Trump White House were unlike anything seen since the red scare McCarthy era of the 1950s. It warned of a “five-alarm fire” for free speech, education, the right to protest and a war against ideas and language themselves.The events – along with outlandish statements about annexing Greenland, retaking the Panama canal and making Canada the 51st state – have hurt America’s reputation around the globe.View image in fullscreenPeople take part in a demonstration in front of the US consulate in Nuuk, Greenland, on 15 March 2025.Photograph: Christian Klindt Soelbeck/EPAPatrick Gaspard, a former official in the Barack Obama administration, said: “Donald Trump has been radically successful in demonstrating that in 100 days you can destroy a brand that’s been built up over nearly 250 years. If that’s a success then congratulations.”He added: “We’re in DefCon 1 in a democracy where the president is radically consolidating power, politicising non-partisan agencies, attacking civil society and private firms, and literally disappearing people from our streets. Tragically, those with influence only seem to be moved by the volatility in the stock market because of tariffs, failing to see that the entire edifice that makes their success possible is being dismantled.”Trump’s political honeymoon appears to be over. Even among Republicans, polling shows that there is ambivalence about his priorities, with only about half saying he has focused on the right things.Street protestsare growing across the country, judges continue to hand him defeats and Harvard University stood its ground against him. As the Democratic party tries to regroup, Trump could find his second 100 days heavier going than his first.In 2021 Sabato, the University of Virginia political scientist,told the Guardianthat history would remember Trump as by far the worst president ever on the basis of his first term. “I was wrong,” he acknowledged last week. “Thisis the worst presidency in American history.“The ignorance was actually our ally in the first Trump term. He didn’t know what he was doing and now, unfortunately, while he still doesn’t know what he’s doing, he knows more than he did. Trump believes he is infallible. He’s going to burn out with the public long before the end of this term.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsUS domestic policyElon MuskUS immigrationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Operating mainly through executive action, theTrump administrationhas affected nearly all facets of US foreign policy: from military might to soft power, from trade to immigration, reimagining the US’s place in the world according to an isolationist America First program.“The shake-up has been revolutionary, extraordinary. It’s upended 80-some years of American foreign policy,” said Ivo Daalder, president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and a former ambassador toNato.The Trump presidency has ended the relative peace in the western hemisphere since the end of the second world war underwritten by US economic, military and diplomatic influence, Daalder said.“The foundation of the Pax Americana was trust, and once you break trust, it’s extraordinarily difficult to restore,” he said. “And restoring trust – trust in America, trust in American institutions, trust in American voters – it takes a long time to rebuild.”The US’s key foreign policy and national security making institutions are in crisis. The Pentagon is mid-meltdown under the leadership ofPete Hegseth, whose erratic and unsteady leadership has been reflected in score-settling among his senior staff, while a leaked Signal chat embroiled the national security adviser, Mike Waltz, and others in scandal. The state department under Marco Rubio is undergoing a vast shake-up, and the US’s diplomats are beingsidelined in favour of envoys such as Steve Witkoffwith little background in foreign policy. Critics say the gutting of USAID will cut back on US soft power for generations.“There’s no better way to get us into a war, perhaps a catastrophic war, than essentially poking out your eyes and numbing your brain, and you’re left withDonald Trumpand a few people sitting in the White House winging it, and they’re not competent to wing it,” said Steven Cash, a former intelligence officer for the CIA and Department of Homeland Security, and the executive director of the Steady State, an advocacy group of former national security professionals. “And so we’ve seen that with the tariffs. We’ve seen that with Nato. We’ve seen that with Ukraine, and we’re gonna see a lot more of it.”After assuming office in 2021, Joe Biden declared: “America is back.”“The world now knows America is not back,” Daalder said. “America is gone again.”In a recent interview with the Zeit newspaper, Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, expressed similar sentiments, saying: “The west as we knew it no longer exists.”View image in fullscreenVice-President JD Vance participates in a bilateral meeting with the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, (not pictured) in Munich on 14 February.Photograph: Leah Millis/ReutersIn Munich,JD Vancedelivered a landmark speech openly pandering to Europe’s far right, accusing European leaders of “running from their own voters” and saying: “America can do nothing to help you.”A backlash has begun. Last month the EU presented an €800bn ($913bn) plan on the future of European defense, a putative step in what would be a herculean task to overcome internal divisions and onshore European defense manufacturing. The UK and other US allies have considered other efforts, such as limiting intelligence-sharing with the US. “We still need America now, but there is a vision [of a time] when we won’t any more,” said one European diplomat.Meanwhile, the Trump effect is beginning to sway elections as well – though not as he might hope.In the western hemisphere, Trump has terrorised US neighbours and tacitly declared what some have compared to a new Monroe doctrine, saying the White House planned to“take back” the Panama canaland annex Greenland, while regularly calling Canada the future 51st state.In an extraordinary bit of election-day meddling, Trump wrote a social media post suggesting that he was on the ballot in Canada’s vote, repeating thatCanadashould become the 51st state in order to avoid tariffs and reap economic awards.Canadians responded by duly electing the liberal candidate Mark Carney, completing a 30% swing in polling that has largely been explained by opposition to Trump’s tariff war and territorial menaces.In Europe, populist parties seen as Trump’s ideological allies are also on the defensive. While Trump was popular in terms of his ideological and anti-woke agenda, the trade war has made him “quite toxic, just in the last month or two, with a lot of the populist voting bases”, said Jeremy Shapiro, the research director of the European Council on Foreign Relations and a former special adviser to the assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasia.Nowhere has the shift in US foreign policy been felt more acutely than in Ukraine, where the sudden cutoff inUS militaryand intelligence sharing confirmed the Trump administration’s goals of pressuring Ukraine to accept a deal with the Kremlin, rather than the other way around. Those frustrations boiled over into an Oval Office meltdown fueled by Vice-President JD Vance that one former US official close to the talks called “disgraceful”.Trump has swung wildly on the war, on certain days targeting Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a “dictator” and then quickly pivoting to call out Putin for continuing to rain down missiles on Ukrainian cities. His theatrics have produced symbolic moments, includinga sudden recognitionthat “maybe [Putin] doesn’t want to stop the war” after speaking with Zelenskyy this weekend in the baptistry of St Peter’s Basilica. But in terms of hard results, Trump has not fulfilled a promise to end the war within 24 hours or produced a clear path to peace many months later.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump meets Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the Vatican on 26 April.Photograph: APThe Russians have said they largely tune out what he says in public.“We hear many things coming from President Trump,” said Sergey Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, during a television appearance this weekend. “We concentrate, as I said, on the real negotiations which President Trump supports and instructed his people to continue to engage in these negotiations.”Key among those people is Witkoff, a neophyte diplomat who has spent hours in conversation with Putin, often with no other adviser present. One person close to the Kremlin said that Witkoff was viewed as a reliable negotiator in Moscow with “a chance to make an agreement”, but added: “There is a chance it will pass by.”Much of the burden of international diplomacy now rests on Witkoff, who is also running point on other key negotiations. Trump has tasked him with reaching a deal to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, in effect renegotiating the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that he scuttled in 2018. Both the US and Iran have played up the talks, although “differences still exist both on major issues and on the details”, the Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, told state television this week.Ukraine, Gaza and Iran: can Witkoff secure any wins for Trump?Read moreAnd then there is the Middle East, where the Trump administration scored its greatest early success by negotiating a ceasefire in Gaza but then failed to prevent its collapse, withIsraelcutting off new aid to Gaza as the fighting continues.“There now seems to be less focus on ending the devastating conflict,” wrote Stefanie Hausheer Ali, a non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Rafik Hariri Center and Middle East Programs. “Trump’s threat in February to Hamas to release the hostages or ‘all hell is going to break out’ has, in practice, meant Israel restarting the war and blocking humanitarian aid from enteringGaza. Without an alternative to Hamas rule, the militant group may hang on and continue to fight as an insurgency, replenishing its ranks by recruiting desperate people.”Trump’s most extreme remarks have turned out to be bluster: he stunned the world when he claimed that he would turn the Gaza Strip into beachfront condos and said that the local Palestinian population would be forcibly removed. Months later, the initiative is largely forgotten.While attempting to close three landmark negotiations at once, the Trump administration has also launched a trade war with the entire world, establishing sweeping tariffs on all foreign imports before abruptly reversing course and cutting tariffs to 10% save for those against China.With so many major efforts ongoing, observers say that the government is largely paralysed to deal with smaller but still crucial issues in foreign policy and national security. As part of a blanket ban on refugees, tens of thousands of Afghans who assisted US troops against theTalibanare left waiting for relocation to the United States, a promise that was extended by previous administrations.“The lack of clarity and the chaos are the things that are causing so much pain,” said Shawn VanDiver, the founder and president of #AfghanEvac, a group that works with the state department to help resettle Afghans.He said he was critical of both the Biden and Trump administrations for failing to relocate the tens of thousands of Afghans who were far enough along in the vetting program to be relocated before Trump came into office.“The truth is, is that when America makes a promise, you should be able to trust our word,” he said. “If our flag waving over an embassy in Tunisia or Baghdad or Kabul, or Kyiv doesn’t mean this is the place where there’s truth, where there’s justice ... well, then what are we even doing here?”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS foreign policyTrump tariffsUS politicsVladimir PutinGazaUkrainefeaturesShareReuse this content"

As well as suspending the treaty, Delhi has suspended trade with Pakistan, summoned and expelled its diplomats, and suspended visas for Pakistanis. Pakistan has also suspended all trade with India and closed its airspace to Indian airlines.The Indus treaty governs the distribution and use of waters from the Indus River and its tributaries, which feed 80% of Pakistan’s irrigated agriculture and its hydropower. Dogar said its suspension had “sent shivers down our spines”.“We fearIndiacan cause flash floods or stop water destined for our crops,” he said. “India can starve us. Because now India won’t be responsible to share any data about flash floods or dam projects with Pakistan.”For decades, India has accused Pakistan of backing the violent separatist insurgency in Indian-administeredKashmir. Islamabad condemned the recent attack and called allegations of its involvement “baseless”.Authorities in Islamabad have described the suspension of the water treaty as “an act of war”.View image in fullscreenTeachers and students from Karachi University in Pakistan protesting on Monday.Photograph: Asif Hassan/AFP/Getty ImagesWhen both countries came into being as a result of partition in 1947, the source rivers of the Indus basin were all in India. Years of negotiation followed, before the treaty was brokered by the World Bank in 1960, giving control of the eastern tributaries to India and the western tributaries to Pakistan. The treaty has survived three wars between the nuclear rivals and is considered one of the world’s most successful water-sharing endeavours.Pakistan has an agrarian economy and a breadbasket that is dependent on the treaty. “Water is our life. We can’t compromise on it,” said Khalid Khokhar, president of the Farmers’ Association. “If they do it, this is a war. My ancestors were farmers as well. In times of crises the farmers sell the family’s jewellery, borrow money and do anything possible for farming. The water level is already low because of less rain and we are already very worried. There should be no politics on water. It is our lifeline.”Government officials and experts on both sides say India cannot stop water flows immediately, because the treaty has allowed it to build only hydropower plants without significant storage or dams on the three rivers allocated to Pakistan.“In the short term, there may not be any direct practical implication,” Himanshu Thakkar, coordinator of the India-based South Asia Network on Dams,Riversand People, told Agence France-Presse at the weekend. “Any safe infrastructure to divert water, beyond what is happening now, takes years, mostly more than a decade”.India’s existing dams do not have the capacity to block or divert water. “India cannot immediately stop the flow of these rivers, as it is technically unfeasible and economically not viable,” said Naseer Memon, a Pakistani water expert. But Memon warned of “disastrous” consequences if Delhi started to ignore its obligations to inform authorities in Pakistan about development on the rivers in the future. “This would be a humanitarian crisis. Millions of lives would be at stake.”India’s suspension letter sent to Pakistan said there had been “fundamental changes to the circumstances” since the deal was signed, including “population dynamics” as well as a “need to accelerate the development of clean energy”.The precious resource is being sucked up by increasing populations and surging agricultural requirements, as well as hydropower projects fuelled by rising energy needs.A senior Pakistani security official, requesting anonymity, claimed that India had been planning for some time to withdraw from the treaty and was using the Kashmir attack as an excuse. “We can’t sit and allow India to do it,” the official said. “The international community must play its role.”Explore more on these topicsPakistanIndiaKashmirSouth and central AsiaAccess to waterRiversWaterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

New York Republican congressman Mike Lawlerfaceda chorus of boos from constituents at a town hall this past weekend.On Sunday, Trumpsaiddisruptors at town halls should be “immediately ejected” and claimed without evidence that “radical left Democrats” are paying people to infiltrate town halls.In Florida’s third congressional district, Republican congresswoman Kat Cammack, has not held a town hall, virtual or in person, sincebeforeTrump took office in January.Cammack, who first came to office in 2021 as one of the youngest members of Congress,repeatedfalse claims about election fraud in the 2020 election lost by Trump to Biden and challenged the results.The district, comprising Gainesville and Ocala, Florida, with largely rural areas of north-west Florida hasvotedfirmly Republican, with Cammack first winning the seat in 2020 with 57.1% of the vote and securing re-election in 2022 and 2024 with more than 60% of the vote.Gainesville, the largest city in the district, and home to the University of Florida, typically favors Democrats, with Kamala Harris winning Alachua county by60%to 39% for Trump in the 2024 election.Voters in Gainesville and High Springs, Florida, a rural area north of the city, held empty chair town halls this past week after Cammack declined to hold a town hall after numerous requests.At a 25 April empty chair town hall in Gainesville, Florida, several constituents, which included retired federal workers and teachers, expressed frustration with a lack of response from Cammack’s office and several cited promises from her office that a town hall would be scheduled in April 2025.“People are afraid. They’re celebrating when their social security check shows up because they’re afraid it might not,” said Jenn Powell, co-chair of the Alachua County Labor Coalition, and one of the organizers of the town hall. “So while Kat Cammack is not listening to her constituents, we decided to have a town hall without her, and will deliver the forms of questions and video to her office.”View image in fullscreenThe empty chair town hall for Cammack in High Springs, Florida, on Sunday.Photograph: Michael Sainato/The GuardianOver 100 voters attended, addressing the empty chair with questions and concerns about cuts to federal services and research impacting the University of Florida, the largest employer and by farbiggest economic driverin the region.“Why are we not looking out for research that fuels this town?” a voter asked the empty chair.Voters also expressed complaints about inaction from Congress on the Trump administration’s cuts tocongressionally mandated and funded programs, issues with social security, anddrastic cutsto programs benefitting small farmers and the impact oftariffson farmers.They cited that Cammack authored theReins Actto prevent executive overreach, but has not reintroduced the legislation since Trump took office.“She’s not trying to listen to her constituents, and that’s a problem for the people who elected her. How can you not hear from us, or don’t want to hear from us when we have major concerns?” said Ebonie Bryant, chair of the Alachua county Democratic party. “We just want to make sure that the person that we elected knows how we feel, so they could properly represent us.”In High Springs, Florida, about 50 people attended an empty chair town hall on 27 April, where voters expressed similar concerns and questions about violations of the US constitution by the Trump administration’s actions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A day later, she realised she was going blind. She thought all her dreams were over – but the reality proved very differentByEmma RussellTue 29 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Apr 2025 08.59 EDTShareThe last night of Ashley King’s holiday shouldn’t have been especially memorable. It was 30 August 2011, and she and her best friend, Krista, went out barhopping in the tourist town of Kuta in southern Bali, as they had done many times before. King and Krista are from Calgary in Canada, and had decided to spend a year travelling after their high school graduation. They planned to explore the island of Bali, but King’s credit cards were stolen and Krista ran out of money, so they were stuck in Kuta, a party district.In one of the swankier bars on the strip, King was given a fruity vodka cocktail in a reusable plastic bottle, so she could dance without spilling it. She was drunk, she says, but not notably so. After nursing their hangovers the next day, she and Krista went to the airport at midnight: King was travelling to New Zealand for the rugby World Cup, and Krista to Australia.When King arrived in Christchurch, she was grilled at immigration: she hadn’t yet booked a return flight. She began to realise something was wrong with her. “I remember talking to the customs people and it was like I was drunk,” she says. “I could not form sentences in a way that sounded confident.”She dismissed it as exhaustion. There had been a delay before the six-hour flight from Bali to Sydney, and a second flight to New Zealand, and her luggage had been lost by an airline along the way. All this, after a heavy night out.She called her mother in Calgary, who bought her a return flightto Brisbane to appease immigration. “All I had with me was an iPod,” says King. “I didn’t even have a cell phone. I went to the bathroom and I was feeling so nauseous and disoriented.” It was the first time she had travelled alone, so she blamed her discombobulation on nerves too, the stress of trying to reclaim her lost luggage, and only having $15.View image in fullscreen‘I had so much confidence and self-esteem and all of that was completely stripped away’ … Ashley King in Bali, 2011.Photograph: Courtesy of Ashley KingAt 4pm she arrived at her hostel in Christchurch, falling asleep, her rest broken by nightmares in which she couldn’t breathe. A small lamp in the room had been on, but when she woke up, it seemed to have gone off. She thought her iPod was dead, too, because she couldn’t see the screen. The entire hostel was dim, in fact, so she assumed it was 5am or so, the sun yet to come up.King needed the bathroom and made her way along the corridor in the dark, accidentally locking herself out of her room. She stumbled down to reception for a new key, but the minute she was back upstairs, she began gasping for air. “It was like the feeling after you sprint, but I just wasn’t getting my air back.” She is asthmatic, and wondered if this was her first proper attack. Hyperventilating, she returned to reception, where the woman on the desk got her to breathe into a brown paper bag.Now King knew something was wrong with her eyes. It wasn’t 5am. It was noon. Her iPod wasn’t dead and the lamp hadn’t gone out.The receptionist drove her to a walk-in clinic, where King explained that she couldn’t see the fingers the nurse was holding up. She was taken to hospital. The doctors asked what she had done the night before. Had she taken drugs? Was she out partying?It wasn’t until her blood test results came back that they realised exactly what was wrong.Methanol is a type of alcohol sometimes mixed into bootleg liquor as a cheaper alternative to ethanol. One mouthful can be deadly. As methanol metabolises in the body it creates harmful by-products: formaldehyde (used to embalm bodies), formate and formic acid, which attack nerves and organs and can lead to blindness, brain damage and death. Formate is the main toxin that is produced and it acts like cyanide by stopping energy production in cells, which causes depression of the central nervous system. There were large quantities of methanol in King’s blood. The doctors were shocked, in the circumstances, that she had woken up at all in the hostel. In November last year, six tourists died in Laos from the suspected consumption of drinks laced with methanol.One of the few things that slows down the effects of methanol is alcohol. In hospital, King was given a plastic cup of vodka and orange juice. She downed it, and they poured her another – and another. “It was the most absurd drinking game I’ve ever played,” she says. “The drunker I got the more I could breathe, the more I was able to see.”She was moved to intensive care and given haemodialysis, a treatment to filter waste, salt and water from the blood when the kidneys are not working normally. They didn’t know if she would survive, so they rang her parents to tell them. Her mother, Carolina, flew to Christchurch not knowing if her daughter would be alive when she arrived.After the alcohol treatment, King sobered up and the doctors broke the news about her eyes. She was blind, and her sight would not return. “I’ve never felt so alone in my life,” she says. Her mum was still to arrive and she knew no one in New Zealand. “Three days ago, I had had my entire life ahead of me. And now you’re telling me that I’m blind?”Her mum arrived later that afternoon and both of them burst into tears.The doctors did everything they could to save King’s sight. They gave her steroids to bring down the swelling of her optic nerves, which helped temporarily. By the end of the week, she could see out of one eye and could see colour. She could even read again. But soon she found herself struggling to focus on the book she was reading. The words were disappearing. As her sight faded again, the doctors told her that they had exhausted their options.She remembers crying as she listed all the things she thought she would never do – go to university, get a job, fall in love. She had always wanted to study acting, but that now seemed out of the question.Recovering in a hotel in New Zealand, she listened to the 250 songs on her iPod touch, over and over again. She couldn’t read. She couldn’t watch television. Her life felt likeGroundhog Day, she says, when she returned to Calgary. “I would wake up every day hoping that I could see. And the worst part was that I still dreamed in vivid colour.”View image in fullscreen‘It has taught me that you truly have no idea what somebody is going through’ ... in Bali in 2011.Photograph: Courtesy of Ashley KingIn reality, she was stuck in her parents’ basement because they had rented out her room for a year to a Mexican exchange student. In Australia, she says, she had gained “so much confidence and self-esteem and all of that independence and confidence was completely stripped away”. She couldn’t drive her car or return to her old job, and when her friends planned a trip to Mexico she wasn’t invited; she assumed they didn’t want to take care of her. “I was mean and mad at the world and felt as if my life was stolen from me.”In the early days of blindness, King, who has about 2% vision, was in denial. She doesn’t have central vision, which is where all the functionality is in the eyes – being able to see colour, depth and detail – so everything is very static-y. “It looks like snowfall or a TV screen, or salt-and-peppery. And it’s all in a sepia tone.” She would try to meet friends in bars she knew well and pretend she was all right until, one day, she went out, crossed the street and was hit by a car. “I didn’t want help. I didn’t want to be a burden,” she says. “I didn’t want people to look at me differently.”King wanted to do everything she could do before losing her sight: travel, snowboard, cook, apply makeup. “I would take bronzer and put it all over my face like it was foundation. I got really, really obsessed with plucking my eyebrows because I believed they were overgrown. So I had really funky eyebrows for a while, because you shouldn’t do that when you can’t see.” Since then, technology has improved. At first, she had to use a handheld reader that magnified documents. Now, she can do most things on her iPhone.Her friends didn’t know how to interact with someone with a disability in those early days, she says, “because anybody that we had grown up with or seen with a disability was secluded away in a separate classroom. I didn’t even need to engage with somebody who had a disability. I was ableist without knowing it. Even when I lost my eyesight, I did not want to be a part of the blind community.”I’ve had people not believe me when I tell them I’m blind … there’s an idea that I’m supposed to have a cane or a dogWhat she needed was people to allow her to be angry. “I wanted there to be justice and there was no justice.” There was no way to prove that she was poisoned in the club she believes was responsible, and it has since closed down. After a friend had a stroke recently and lost part of her eyesight, King told her: “You’re allowed to be angry and frustrated and not leave the house.”Blindness is often an invisible disability, she says. “It has taught me that you truly have no idea what somebody is going through, because I’ve had people not believe me when I tell them that I’m blind. There is an idea that society perpetuates – I’m supposed to have a cane or a dog, or be wearing Ray-Bans.”Many of her initial fears proved unfounded. Two years after she lost her eyesight, she went backpacking to seven countries in South America: she climbed volcanoes, swam with sharks and began to share her experience of methanol poisoning with other travellers.She studied journalism at university, did an exchange in the UK, and visited India. When she first thought of going to India, it wasbecause scientists there were leading the way in stem cell research, which could restore her sight. But she held back, worried that if anything went wrong with the experimental treatment, she might be left completely in the dark. Her remaining 2% vision “has given me such a life,” she says.By the time King did go to India, she had forgotten about that initial motivation. “I met so many amazing people who were really life-changing,” she says, “and they liked me because of who I am now.”View image in fullscreen‘I didn’t want people to look at me differently’ … King on stage in Static: A Party Girl’s Memoir, a play based on her experience.Photograph: Samuel Obadero/Motif PhotographyAfter university, she interned for a magazine where she was asked to write about a company that was making theatre accessible for people with disabilities. A member of the audience was invited on stage to solve a crime and King went up, not revealing that she was blind until she missed a visual cue to shake an actor’s hand. It turned out one of the professional actors was blind too.At the end of the show, King was given a standing ovation: “the most riveting thing”. The founders of the company became her mentors and offered her a job – she still works there today. She went to drama school, as she had originally planned, began to audition and recently wrote a play based on her experience in Bali. She says she didn’t want it to come across as “really inspirational”. “I’m as flawed and imperfect as every other person out there. I just happen to be doing things that are a little bit harder.”She says there will always be a part of her that doesn’t accept that she’s blind. But there is nothing “I haven’t tried because I’ve been too scared”. A few weekends ago, she went snowboarding with friends, following her partner down the mountain as he gave her directions. In Morocco, two years ago, she tried sandboarding.At the start of that graduation trip, King dreamed of the life she would have when she returned home, full of excitement and opportunities. Fourteen years on, she knows she can achieve everything she wanted to back then. “Yes, there are physical things I can’t do, like drive a car, but the things that truly matter to me, I’ve found a way to make them happen. The more I’ve accomplished over the years, the more strength and determination it’s given me. I’m living the life I always dreamed of.”Explore more on these topicsHow we surviveDisabilityBlindness and visual impairmentAlcoholTravelling with disabilitiesGap year travelHealth & wellbeinginterviewsShareReuse this content"

Even so, I found this eerie. One August day in 2020, I was going to fetch clothes out of the washing machine when suddenly a cake tin fell at my feet with a loud clang. It wasn’t just any cake tin. It was the heart-shaped tin I had used to bake my own wedding cake. I wouldn’t have thought much of it except that it was only two months since my husband had left me, out of the blue.Nearly 23 years ago, this giant metal heart had been brand new. My husband-to-be had told me he liked fruit cake but hated glace cherries. For our wedding, I decided to bake him a rich, dark fruit cake with no cherries and chopped-up dried apricots to take their place. There are photos of us cutting the cake together looking blissfully happy. We would soon be on our way to Venice for our honeymoon.All these years, I kept the tin. We had three children and sometimes I used it to bake their birthday cakes: shiny brown hearts of chocolate sponge smothered in ganache. It lived in the bottom of a dresser in the hallway, where it was slowly rusting. I kept it there because it was too vast to fit in any of the kitchen cupboards. To give it away would have been unthinkable. It was a keepsake of our love.At the back of my mind, I’d imagined that one day I would use the tin to bake an anniversary cake. In one of her books, the food writer Ruth Reichl gives a recipe for the giant chocolate birthday cake she made for her husband, Michael, the first year that she knew him – a cake so colossal it took four men to help her lift it to the car. Reichl calls it simply Big Chocolate Cake. I had a vague idea that this would be the cake I’d bake for our 25th anniversary. We were getting closer to this moment. I told people how lucky we were, and how we never argued.As symbols go, a heart-shaped cake tin, bought for a wedding, is not exactly subtle. It’s Disneyfied romance, fashioned into a shiny object. I was only 19 when we met and 23 when we married. He was seven years older and was one of my college teachers, which didn’t seem to matter at the time.One morning in June 2020, sitting on an ordinary park bench, drinking a cup of coffee, he said he didn’t love me any more, not “like that”. He never elaborated what “like that” meant. It didn’t seem real. I thought that divorce was something that happened to other people – my parents, for example, who split up when I was 14. At the time, this had been the biggest shock of my life. One New Year’s Day, my father announced over lunch that his resolution was not to live with our mother any more. I was the one who had casually asked whether anyone had any resolutions. For years, I felt I caused him to leave with my question.My purchase of the heart-shaped tin suggests that I was urgently searching for a happy-ever-after: a sweet and unbroken heart. Of all my ex-husband’s excellent qualities, one of his greatest was – or so it seemed to me – that he was so steadfast. He never gave me a moment’s doubt about his loyalty. The morning of the day he left he brought me a cup of tea in bed, just as he always did, and I thanked him with real gratitude, just as I always did. When the tin clattered loudly to the ground, it echoed my own shock.View image in fullscreenBee Wilson at home.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianCertain kitchen objects become loaded with meaning in a way that we are not fully in control of. You can’t predict which will be the utensils you get attached to – the favourite mug, the spoon that feels just right in your hand – and which belongings decline over time into clutter. And then there are the objects that – even if they were made in some anonymous factory and bought in some anonymous shop – seem to carry with them a kind of magic. There is the plate that makes everything you put on it taste better, or the bowl you keep but can’t actually bear to use because it reminds you too strongly of the person who gave it to you.What should I do with the tin heart now that its original meaning was ruptured? When I told the story of it falling on the floor to friends, they all, without exception, made the same suggestion: I should invest the tin with new associations! I should bake a cake for myself in it, the richest cake imaginable, and throw myself a giant divorce party. I was comforted by the kindness of the suggestion, but didn’t feel quite ready for this yet. Instead, I left the tin where it was. I walked past it multiple times a day and sometimes winced slightly when I remembered it was there – a clanging metal symbol of rejection.I started to wonder whether the tin itself – and the cake I originally baked in it – was a powerful indication that our marriage was doomed from the start. Maybe a man who was so fussy about cherries was not the man for me.But when I picked it up, trying to decide what to do with it, the tin felt as solid as it did 23 years ago, as if it were still waiting to be used.Istarted looking for other people who had invested objects in their kitchens with strong meanings or emotions. The more I asked around, the more I saw that feeling emotional about kitchen objects was the rule rather than the exception, even for people who were not especially interested in cooking. I wasn’t alone in having intense and even magical feelings about the things I cooked and ate with.Many people told me that they could still feel the presence of a lost parent or partner in their china cupboard. I met someone who said that the one object belonging to his mother that he and his siblings all wanted when they cleared her house was a glass salad-dressing maker. His mother never rinsed out the garlic at the bottom, just adding fresh garlic before pouring in the oil and vinegar, meaning that this vessel carried the garlicky essence of decades of shared meals. Another person told me that she had a very powerful sense of one of her ancestors, whom she had never met, because she had inherited her rolling pin. A friend told me that the only thing she now had left from her French grandmother was a rusty old herb chopper from long-ago Paris, where her family ran a brasserie. My friend never used this chopper herself, but every time she looked at it she could see her grandmother’s hands, alive and cooking.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Cheryl Chan/Getty ImagesSome of the people I spoke to said that they were not at all sentimental about kitchen objects, but then when they thought harder there was always at least one exception. One man told me that kitchen objects did not interest him, only to reveal that after his mother’s death he had held on to some tea towels and place mats because they seemed to carry the “texture” of her.When people described their favourite objects, I noticed certain common themes emerging. Many of the most treasured objects were ones that they or people close to them had held in their hands and used daily – a grandmother’s wooden spoon, a mother-in-law’s butter dish decorated with a cow, a salt shaker inherited from a parent. Like pets or loved ones, these objects were cherished through daily touch. An excellent cook told me that when she walked past her Gaggia ice-cream maker – which happened every day – she would smile and sometimes even pat it because she had owned it for so long that it felt like one of the family.On the other hand, people also described as special the kitchen objects that they hardly used at all: a fragile porcelain bowl, some precious crystal glasses passed down through the generations, a linen tablecloth that only came out once a year. Some of these belongings had become so special – so hallowed – that almost no meal was good enough to justify their use. Like religious relics, they were venerated from a distance.There is more than one way of demonstrating that an object is special. You can learn to relate to old objects in new ways.One of the people who helped me to start making sense of all this was Roopa Gulati, a chef and food writer who decided to start using her parents’ precious best china after her husband, Dan, was diagnosed with a brain tumour. Having spent nearly five decades feeling that this beautiful dinner service was too good to use – she stored it in the attic for years – Roopa suddenly decided that life was too short not to bring out the good china while she could. Faced with the imminent threat of Dan’s death, her diffidence about using the best china melted away. “If it smashes, it smashes” became her new mantra.Roopa’s parents came from Punjab in northern India. She grew up in England, in rural Cumbria, with her brother and sister – the only Asian family in the village. Her father was an eye doctor. The clinic where he worked on Saturdays was next to a very expensive china shop and Roopa remembers that when she was about 11, he and her mother spent weeks looking at different sets of china before deciding on a purchase. It was 1975 and the whole set was “a huge outlay”, maybe £500.A generation ago, buying a dinner service was a weighty decision, perhaps all the more so for immigrants who were acutely aware of the opinions of others. A woman who worked during the post-second world war decades in a big department store recalled that many of her customers in the china department came in monthly, buying a precious piece or two at a time – a couple of cups and saucers one month, a dinner plate the next – until the set was finally complete.To those who owned them, laying out a special dinner service was a way not just to honour your guests but also to demonstrate what “best” looked like in your home. Roopa’s mother felt such pressure to get dinner just so for her guests that she laid the table two days before they arrived. Her beautiful dishes were a kind of armour with which, as a foreigner in this cold northern village, she shielded herself from the judgment of others.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alexandra Grablewski/Getty ImagesWhen Roopa showed me one of the plates her parents had chosen, a set calledBraemar by Royal Doulton, I instantly saw why they would have fallen in love with this particular set, which included vegetable tureens and bowls and platters along with plates. It was an elegant ceramic with a rare delicacy in colour and design: white in the middle, with a rim of silver followed by an olive-green ring and then two different geometric patterns. Roopa thinks that it must have reminded her parents of the Mughal designs of northern India.We were talking about the plates over lunch at Roopa’s house in London, where she has lived for the past 20 years. She generously cooked me lunch, a feast of dishes fromIndian Kitchens, a book she had been working on about the regional cooking of India. Dan joined us for the first course, a translucent broth of lamb scented with two kinds of cardamom and royal cumin, with fried onions and mint on top. It was only three months since Dan’s last stem cell transplant and he was still very weak. It felt like a miracle that he was home from hospital and in humorous spirits, despite his ordeal.Roopa described the pit she used to feel in her stomach at the idea of breaking one of the Braemar pieces. Suddenly I remembered the “don’t touch” terror I felt as a child walking into any kind of shop selling fancy stuff with my parents. Roopa’s fear around the Braemar remained even after her mother died and she took possession of the whole dinner service. Then her father died, but still she kept the dinner service in the attic because the thought of breaking any of it was too awful to bear.Roopa brought out some of her beloved Braemar plates, on which she served spinach and mustard greens cooked in copious amounts of butter, with flatbreads and finely sliced raw red onions on the side. It was a joy to be able to use the dishes so freely, she said. Her attitude to the dinner service changed immediately after Dan’s diagnosis. In the midst of her grief, she had started worrying about the unused plates up in the attic. She wanted the dishes to hold different foods and witness the conversations of another generation: her daughters’ children. I noticed that she was talking about her tableware as if it were alive.As children, we may be taught that certain possessions are only for best, but what if today is all we have? “Best” doesn’t have to be saved for feast days or honoured guests. Each morning that Dan was alive was now a special occasion for Roopa. Using these shiny plates also became a daily treat that reminded her of her own worth: a way to celebrate her own existence even when she felt she had done little except visit Dan in hospital. She found herself using the Braemar to brighten her ordinary solitary breakfast of toast and marmalade – something her parents would never have done.So many of us spend our whole lives denying ourselves the best things because the time is not right or we feel we haven’t earned them yet, or we fear that someone – probably our parents – will disapprove of us if we drop them. This attitude to objects sometimes goes along with a wider impulse of self-denial. This may be the legacy of hunger and rationing, or a religious childhood, or simply of the social attitudes of earlier generations. But if you don’t use the best china now, you may never use it.Roopa realised that the best way to honour the momentous and costly decision her parents made in the china shop all those years ago was to enjoy the crockery, because now could be the best and only time. “Dad’s no longer there and Mum is not either. This is life.”Some of the most poignant objects I found in my mother’s house when we were clearing it after she moved to a care home because of her dementia were two small platters made by Royal Doulton. They were in the bottom of one of the drawers where she kept her plates and bowls. These small oval-shaped platters – which dated to around 1910 – were decorated in dark, inky blue and bright green, with flower patterns done in fine lines using a delicate sepia brown, all against a creamy-white background. On the back of the platters it said “Matsumai”, along with the Royal Doulton mark. Both platters still had Gift Aid tags attached to them, suggesting that my mother had bought them from a charity shop and never used them.I brought the platters home, along with various boxes of papers and bowls and books and other keepsakes to pass on to her friends and relatives. These platters were too distinctive and special to give away to a charity shop, even if this was where they had come from in the first place. But they didn’t feel like something to give her friends because they had no real personal association with her. She had never served anything on them or even got around to removing the tags and washing them.For a long time, I forgot about the platters. It was only when we were distributing my mother’s stuff after her death in 2022 that I looked at them again. My sister did not want them, so I washed and dried them carefully and put them on a shelf with my other serving dishes, and started using them to serve some of my mother’s favourite salads. I realised I was trying to make food to please a dead person, which felt a little crazy.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alphotographic/Getty Images/iStockphotoMy mother was a brilliant Shakespeare scholarwho devoted decades of her life to understanding his sonnets. All she ever wanted was to be in the right, and to be loved. Often, especially after her divorce from my father, she seemed to feel that she was neither. When I served and ate food from the Matsumai platters, I wanted to bring her back so I could tell her that she was right to buy them and that I loved her.When I was talking in this vein over dinner one night, my oldest son said, “You’ve forgotten how difficult you found Grandma,” and it was true. She was kind to her bones but was also a deeply anxious person. When some tiny detail went wrong – and in the normal run of life, tiny details are always going wrong – she would loudly exclaim, “Oh no!”, as if the thing simply could not be borne. She repressed many of her feelings (because her parents had taught her to do so) and made me feel that I must repress mine, too. It was only after she developed dementia and some of her inhibitions had fallen away that she was able to tell me and my sister directly that she loved us. When I hold the Matsumai platters, I yearn to have her back – all of her, even the parts that drove me mad.Most of all, the platters make me feel how fleeting and sad life is. You buy these small treasures, hoping they will come in handy. You save them for something special. And then you die before the special event happens and they never get used.But things can have a second life (and a third and fourth), even if people can’t. Roopa Gulati spoke of giving her family’s Braemar dinner service another chance of living. I did the same with my mother’s unused platters. The more I celebrated them and arranged food on them, the more I could stop them from being junk, even if she would never know.When I finally decided to use the heart-shaped tin to bake another cake for my 50th birthday to share with my children, the tin was so much smaller than I remembered. In my memory, because of its emotional weight, it was vast enough to make a cake for dozens of people. But as I held it in my hand to scrub off the rust and bake with it, it didn’t look so very large.It was a relief to be able to look at the tin again without wincing. As with Roopa and her dinner service, I was happy that this object had the chance of a second chapter and new associations. What’s more, I was managing to look back at my own past more kindly. In the early days of separation, all the years of my marriage became polluted in my mind. If our relationship could end like this, it must never have been good. But now I could see that the love and hope I felt when I bought that shiny tin were also true.The magic of things is that they can live more than once, passing faithfully through many pairs of hands, gaining different meanings each time. Our most significant kitchen objects can keep us connected with the dead and the absent, so it’s no wonder we sometimes act as if they were charmed.I had a second celebration with some friends, old and new, a few months after my 50th birthday. I realised that my mother’s presence, far more than my ex-husband’s, was the one that hung over my kitchen. He had chosen to go, whereas she had left unwillingly.A young Syrian chef called Faraj Alnasser, a friend, came to cook a feast of Syrian food,including vegetarian kibbehfilled with oyster mushrooms and served on a warm yoghurt sauce with dried Iranian mint. Faraj had been telling me about his own most precious kitchen objects: two long metal vegetable corers which kept him connected with his mother and grandmother although they lived several thousand miles away in Cairo. These corers took Faraj back to the scents and memories of a peaceful Aleppo that no longer existed.Faraj made a feast of Syrian food, including the most incredible cheese scones seasoned with dill and za’atar, peach salad with tahini and lime, and a cucumber salad with fine strands of Syrian cheese and herbs.We were looking for plates for the cucumber salad when I showed Faraj the Matsumai platters. “Yes!” he said. “These are perfect.” Cucumber was my mother’s favourite vegetable and she would have been so cheered to see the green of the cucumber against the blue-black of the plate.Foreign mothers, foreign tongues: ‘In another universe, she could have been my friend’Read moreAt the crematorium nearly two years earlier, I had watched her poor little coffin taken away.Fear No More the Heat of the Sunfrom Shakespeare’s Cymbelinewas one of the songs at her funeral. “Fear no more the lightning flash, / Nor the all-dreaded thunder stone.” She would never again feel the warmth of the sun on her face but she was also free at last from the distress of dementia, which had made her so frightened.Yet looking down at the pale cucumber on the dark ceramic, I had the strangest feeling that she hadn’t really left after all. She was still vividly there in the pattern of that old plate, which had once caught and pleased her eye as it now pleased mine. Even in our supposedly rational age, this is the power of objects; they keep those we miss in the room with us. A plate or a tin may not be much but it can be something to hold when hands are gone.Adapted from The Heart-Shaped Tin: Love, Loss and Kitchen Objects, published by Fourth Estate on 8 May.

The Egyptian authorities, who jailed him on terrorism charges for a social media post about torture, claim his sentence will end in January 2027, discounting the period he spent in pre-trial detention, which is normally included in the sentence.“Alaa started his strike when he was notified that I’d gone into hospital. Now he’s sick, alone, in prison and we did not even know about it until he had been sick for a week. What more can we do?” said Soueif, who has grown increasingly desperate, saying that the British prime minister,Keir Starmer, is not doing enough to free her son.Fattah became a British citizen through Soueif in 2021 while incarcerated. His family had hoped that acquiring British citizenship would rapidly increase pressure on the Egyptian authorities to free the author, computer programmer and activist who is known as one of the Arab world’s most prominent prisoners of conscience.Earlier this year, Soueif began a daily sit-in while on hunger strike at the gates of Downing Street in an attempt to pressure Starmer to speak directly with the Egyptian president,Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, and demand he free her son. She met with Starmer in mid February.When her blood sugar dropped to dangerous levels after months without food, Soueif was hospitalised later that month.The prime minister told parliament soon afterwards that “I will do everything I can, to ensure the release in this case, and that includes phone calls as necessary. I’ve raised it before. I’ll raise it again. We raise it, and will continue to do so. I gave my word to the family that that’s what I’d do. That I will do, and I will.”He spoke to Sisi on 28 February where he “pressed for Alaa’s release”,according to a Downing Street readoutof their call.That conversation prompted Soueif to switch to a partial hunger strike of 300 calories per day, and she was discharged from hospital in early March. But in the two months since Starmer and Sisi spoke, there have been few signs of a shift from either government.“I started taking some 300 calories a day when the prime minister and President Sisi talked. But that was two months ago now and nothing has happened,” said Soueif.A spokesperson for the UK Foreign Office said that “securing the release of Mr el-Fattah remains an absolute priority, so that he can be reunited with his family. We continue to press for consular access.”The UK foreign minister, David Lammy, spoke with his Egyptian counterpart on 9 April, they added.Soueif’s nephew Omar Robert Hamilton said his aunt’s health was failing as she attempted to survive on a partial hunger strike. The 68-year-old activist and mathematics professor appears withered after months without real sustenance and is no longer able to stand upright.“Three hundred calories a day is not enough to sustain life, her muscles are being eaten away,” he said. “It’s like she is dying in slow motion.”Explore more on these topicsForeign policyEgyptProtestKeir StarmerAbdel Fatah al-SisiAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The two men were among 91 candidates on the ballot – most of whom were part of a protest calling for electoral reform.In a speech late on Monday, Poilievre conceded the election, but pledged to stay on as Conservative leader, saying it was an “honour” to hold the role.Trump effect leaves Canada’s Conservatives facing catastrophic lossRead more“To my fellow Conservatives, we have much to celebrate tonight. We’ve gained well over 20 seats,” Poilievre said. “We are cognizant of the fact that we didn’t quite get over the finish line. Yet we know that change is needed, but change is hard to come by. It takes time.”But without a seat in the House of Commons, Poilievre cannot serve as leader of the official opposition, and it is alsounclear if he can retain his residenceat Stornoway, the official residence of the opposition leader.If he does stay on as leader, Poilievre will need a Conservative MP to sacrifice their seat, allowing to him run in the by-election to fill the vacancy. That process takes time – Canada’s governor general must call the election between 11 and 180 days after being notified of the seat vacancy – and in all likelihood, Poilievre would not be able to return to parliament until the fall sitting.In recent weeks, Conservative officials confirmed to the Guardian that there was growing tension within the party over Poilievre’s leadership – and speculation that he would soon be forced out.“There will be a need for bloodletting,” said one senior member. “That could be the leader, or it could be the campaign manager. But there are some who feel the party fell far short of its goal – to win. And there is a price.”Poilievre became the youngest MP in Canadian history at the age of 25, and became Conservative leader in 2022. A sharp-tongued political brawler who cultivated a populist image, he became a lightning rod for discontent with the former prime ministerJustin Trudeauover whom he at one point enjoyed a 25-point lead.WhenDonald Trumpbegan to threaten Canada’s economy and autonomy – and then Trudeau stood down to be replaced by Mark Carney – Poilievre found himself on the wrong side of a surge of patriotic anger.Despite Poilievre’s personal defeat, the Conservatives did, however, win enough seats to form the largest official opposition in Canadian history at the expense of other opposition parties.And Poilievre was not the only party leader to lose his place in parliament: Jagmeet Singh, leader of the progressive New Democrats also failed to retain his Burnaby seat as the party saw its vote share collapse.‘Trump wanted to break us’, says Carney as Liberals triumph in Canadian electionRead more“It’s been the honour of my life to represent the people of Burnaby Central,” he said in an emotional speech, in which he announced his resignation as party leader. “Tonight they chose a new member of parliament and I wish them well.”The New Democrats – who held the balance of power after the 2021 federal election – were on track to lose 17 of the 24 seats they had in the last parliament and are likely to lose official party status.The loss of party status means the NDP will lose certain parliamentary privileges, including the ability to ask questions during question period as often as recognized parties. The NDP will also lose out on accessing money allocated to parties for research purposes, which is distributed proportionally to the number of seats held by a recognized party.The Green party’s co-leader Jonathan Pedneault also lost his bid to represent a district in Montreal.Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasJustin TrudeauMark CarneyDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Results on Tuesday confirmed that the Liberals fell just short of a majority government and would therefore need the support of political rivals to govern.Canada election: Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre loses seat he held since 2004Read moreMirroring a theme of the campaign, Carney told election-night supporters that Trump wanted to “break us, so that America can own us”, adding: “That will never, ever happen,” to shouts from the crowd.He also gave a stark assessment of a world order once defined by an integrated global trading system with the US at the centre, saying such a system was over, and he pledged to reshape Canada’s relationships with other nations.“We are over the shock over American betrayal. But we will never forget the lessons,” he said.Later on Tuesday, the two leaders struck a more conciliatory tone and agreed to meet “in the near future”, according to Carney’s office, which said Trump had congratulated the prime minister for his victory. “The leaders agreed on the importance of Canada and the United States working together – as independent, sovereign nations – for their mutual betterment,” it said.In a shock result, the Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre,lost the seat he has held since 2004, even as his party performed better than had previously been expected. The Tory leader pledged to keep his job during his election night speech, but the loss is expected to inflame tensions within the party.“While we will do our constitutional duty of holding the government to account and proposing better alternatives, we will always put Canada first as we stare down tariffs and other irresponsible threats from President Trump,” Poilievre told supporters.“Conservatives have been leading the debate and we will continue to put forward the best arguments to improve the lives of our people right across this country.”Jagmeet Singh, leader of the progressive New Democratic party leader, also lost his seat in a national vote that saw the NDP have their worst-ever result, losing party status and most of their seats. In an emotional speech Singh announced he would resign as leader.View image in fullscreen‘Let’s put an end to the division and anger of the past,’ Carney said in his victory speech.Photograph: Blair Gable/ReutersCarney praised other party leaders for campaigns that he said had strengthened the country’s democracy. “Let’s put an end to the division and anger of the past. We are all Canadian and my government will work for and with everyone.”After a narrow victory in the previous federal election, the Liberals relied on the leftwing New Democratic party to help it pass legislation. Monday’s vote appeared likely to produce a similar result, with the Liberals and the NDP together holding enough seats to pass legislation.For the Liberals, the win marks aremarkable recoveryfor a party that was, until recently, on track for electoral devastation. Carney’s predecessor as leader, Justin Trudeau, served as prime minister for nearly 10 years but the twilight of his leadership was marked by repeated threats of mutiny, bitter feuding and a fed-up electorate.Until the end of 2024, internal discussions within the Liberal party were grim: under their most optimistic scenarios, they could only hope of holding the Conservatives to a minority government. Outright victory was nowhere on the party’s radar.“We were dead and buried in December. Now we are going to form a government,” David Lametti, a former Liberal justice minister, told CTV late on Monday. “We have turned this around thanks to Mark.”View image in fullscreenCarney celebrating at the Liberal party campaign headquarters in Ottawa.Photograph: Sean Kilpatrick/APTrump’s threats to annex the country to make it the 51st state, his belittling of Trudeau as “governor” and threats of economic coercion have all contributed to a sharp feeling of anger and betrayal towards Canada’s southern neighbour.“The shift in polls was absolutely without precedent,” said David Coletto, the head of the polling firm Abacus. “But to see the honeymoon that followed – and the way that support held, is also unprecedented. I can’t think of other jurisdictions around the world where we’ve seen this complete reset. And this turns on two factors: how unpopular Justin Trudeau was, and how much of a threat and gamechanger Donald Trump has meant to Canada.”House of Commons seats chartFor the Conservatives, defeat marks a disappointing end to an election campaign the party had been demanding for months. Under the leadership of Poilievre, the Tories had for the past two years seemed all but certain to form a government.But within weeks of Trump’s threats and the emergence of Carney as the new Liberal leader, their25-point poll lead evaporated.View image in fullscreenPierre Poilievre’s Conservatives had been demanding an election for months.Photograph: Amber Bracken/ReutersTo have come inches from victory and then to lose is likely to kick off a sombre postmortem for the party – and internal feuding over the future of the Conservative movement.For Carney, who served as prime minister for only nine days before calling a snap election, the gambit was one in which he hoped to make history for the party. But also on the line for Carney was the prospect of making history for an entirely different reason: had he lost, he would have inherited the mantle of Canada’s shortest-serving prime minister.Ian Laroque, a campaign volunteer who lives in Carney’s Ottawa electoral district, said: “I saw how Carney conducted himself and I felt like he was really a man who met the moment. He wasn’t a polished politician. But he’s the kind of person we need to lead the country right now. It’s not every day you get an economist during an economic crisis.”Monday’s vote was unusual in other ways, too: for the first time in nearly 70 years, the two main parties were set to take more than 80% of the vote between them, reflecting the collapse of other smaller opposition parties including the NDP and the separatist Bloc Québécois.In an emotive speech to supporters, Jagmeet Singh announced he would step down as leader of the NDP after failing to win his seat. In its worst-ever performance, the progressive party failed to meet the 12-seat threshold needed to retain official party status – the second time in its history it has been unable to do so.The loss of party status means the NDP loses certain parliamentary privileges, including the ability to ask questions during question period as often as recognized parties. These rules can be amended at the discretion of the speaker, however. The NDP will also lose out on money allocated to parties for research purposes, which is distributed proportionally to the number of seats held by a recognized party.Explore more on these topicsCanadaMark CarneyAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Now he must redefine itLeyland Ceccoin OttawaPrime minister pledges to reduce country’s reliance on US trade – but must navigate competing visions for the futureTue 29 Apr 2025 12.20 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Apr 2025 22.00 EDTShareIn his victory speech early on Tuesday,Mark Carneywasted little time calling for a dramatic reshaping of his government’s relationship with the United States, arguing that threats fromDonald Trumpcast doubtCanada’s ability to function as a “free, sovereign, and ambitious” nation.The former central banker and investment executive had for months focused his electoral campaign on the threats from Canada’s largest trading partner and longtime political ally.Carney, a self-professed lover of policy mechanics, has pledged to redevelop Canada’s economy to reduce its reliance on the US – a daunting task, given that bilateral trade contributes to a fifth of Canada’s gross domestic product.Carney’s victory owes much to Trump and circumstanceRead moreAnd in what should have been a celebratory address, he took on a somber tone as he considered the end of the affair.“Our old relationship with the United States, a relationship based on steadily increasing integration, is over. The system of open global trade anchored by the United States – a system that Canada has relied on since the second world war, a system that while not perfect has helped deliver prosperity for a country for decades – is over,” he said.He also called for national unity, cognizant of the geographic and political frictions that had until recently, suggested Canadians would elect a Conservative government.“My message to every Canadian is this: no matter where you live, no matter what language you speak, no matter how you voted, I will always do my best to represent everyone who calls Canada home,” Carney said.Along with external pressure from Trump, Canada still faces a raft of unresolved internal tensions: a housing shortage, amplified by high immigration levels and the spiralling cost of living, has left voters increasingly frustrated and distrustful of the Liberal party. Carney has pledged to use the power of government to combat the interlocking crises, telling supporters on Tuesday morning that his ministers could “do things previously thought impossible at speeds we haven’t seen in generations”.“The point is is that we can give ourselves far more than the Americans can ever take away.The prime minister expects to have a call with Trump in the coming days, a senior Liberal said, and will begin negotiations on a new trade agreement.“He is treating his upcoming meeting like he did debate prep during the election: preparing for all possible scenarios,” the source said. “Because he doesn’t know which version of the president he might get.”There is little doubt Canada is at both an economic and political crossroads and Carney must navigate competing visions for the country’s future trajectory.“The big question is how much Canadian federal government wants to pursue closer relations with the United States,” said Peter Morrow, an associate professor of economics at the University of Toronto. “The challenge for Canada is that it’s not really is not in a good position to diversify away too much from its economic relationship with United States. Geography just makes it an obvious trading partner. And if you diversify too much, then it’s almost like you’re trying to pull a Brexit.”But Morrow says Canadian officials face a challenge in revisiting a trade agreement previously negotiated with Trump in his first term. “What sorts of concessions do you make in an agreement with a partner who’s shown that they’re willing to throw those agreements out the window?”In recent weeks, Canadians have engaged in economic nationalism,boycotting American goods and encouraging fellow citizens to seek out domestic options to supplant imports.“Everything we know is that companies that engage in global transactions tend to be more productive than companies that don’t. This nationalist turn inward for Canada is really not a good idea,” said Morrow. “What Canada should be doing is trying to buy from Europe, engage with a wider array of trading partners and resisting the temptations of economic nationalism.”Morrow points to recent discussions in Canada on whether to continue with the purchase of American-made F-35 fighter jets, knowing that the US might be an “unreliable partner” in the future. Critics of the multibillion-dollar deal with Lockheed Martin have suggested that Canada instead examine offers from European defense manufacturers.In his election night speech, Carney hinted at a goal of strengthening relations with like-minded allies in Europe. The technocratic Liberal leader, who previously served as governor of both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, has been eager to burnish his global credentials.In his brief, nine-day tenure as prime minister before calling a snap election, he met the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and UK prime minister, Keir Starmer. Carney’s defensive positioning of Canada’s economy and political alliances will be on display in June, when he hosts leaders from G7 countries in the province of Alberta.Juliette Théorêt, a University of Ottawa student of defence policy who attended Carney’s victory party, said the prime minister won her vote by pitching a vision of the country that involved less reliance on its longtime ally.“Before Trump, I don’t think national security and national sovereignty were big topics of conversation. And without him, there’s a good chance the election would have swayed in a different direction,” she said. “But threats of [making Canada the] 51st state, and this idea of not having a border between Canada and the US – that really pushed people to unite.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaMark CarneyUS foreign policyAmericasDonald TrumpTrump tariffsanalysisShareReuse this content"

It was 30 April 1975, and helicopters were frantically lifting personnel and civilians from the US embassy.Phuong, who had travelled down from the north, was initially held back by troops who said fighting was still continuing. When she was finally able to reach the centre of the city the following day, 1 May, she found chaos. Clothes and luggage were scattered and discarded along the streets. Buildings were being looted.It felt like a dream, Phuong, now 96, said. She stood inside the Presidential Palace on 2 May, watching as the president of SouthVietnam, ​​Duong Van Minh, surrendered.“He left through the palace’s back door, because at the front there were all the tanks [of the North Vietnamese],” said Phuong.View image in fullscreenXuan Phuong, 96, said she found chaos when she made it into Ho Chi Minh in 1975.Photograph: Rebecca Ratcliffe/The GuardianNorth Vietnam was victorious and the country was to be reunified after a decades-long war that had killed as many as 2 million Vietnamese civilians. For the US, which lost 58,000 servicemen, the episode was one of its most humiliating in history.On Wednesday, Vietnam will celebrate the 50th anniversary of 30 April, known officially as the Liberation of the South and National Reunification Day, with huge parades planned in what is now Ho Chi Minh City, after the revolutionary leader.In the run-up to celebrations, streets and alleys have been lined with the red flag and the gold stars of the nation,and fighter jets have roared through the skies above, rehearsing formations.The Trump administration has told its senior diplomats in Vietnam not to participate in anniversary events, according to a report in the New York Times – a decision that has dismayed veterans who have dedicated their lives to reconciliation.Relations between the US and Vietnam have shifted vastly since the war, from former foes to close economic partners – though some fear the decades of progress is being put at risk.View image in fullscreenJane Fonda, visits an anti-aircraft gun position near Hanoi, Vietnam, in July 1972.Photograph: APThis month, a US announcement of a punishing 46% tariff against Vietnam, which would devastate the country’s economic growth targets,left leaders in Hanoi staggered.Months earlier, drastic cuts to US foreign assistance were unveiled. Many fear this could jeopardise projects that assist the victims of Agent Orange, which has left 3 million people, many of them children, with continued serious health problems, or the work of teams that are cleaning up huge amounts of unexploded ordnance left behind.Although North Vietnam won the war, the entire country was left traumatised by the years of conflict, said Prof Dr Pham Hong Tung.“[People] lost their relatives. They were wounded … they had some very terrible memories,” he added.Vietnam faced conflict with Cambodia and China. Its economy was left in tatters, worsened by the Communist party’s limits on private enterprise and severe US economic sanctions, including a trade embargo.Reforms initiated in1986 transformed the country into a market-oriented economy, ushering in a period of rapid economic growth, though it remains a communist one-party state, and frequently jails dissidents.Over the past 50 years, Ho Chi Minh City has been transformed into a city of skyscrapers and become a crucial manufacturing hub. Its streets are crammed tightly with motorbikes and its restaurants and markets increasingly draw international tourists.Phuong, who now lives in the centre of the city, was born in 1929 into an aristocratic family in Hue, in South Vietnam. She left her home aged 16 to join the struggle against French rule, swapping a life of plenty for one where she slept in the jungle. She worked making explosives, in an overrun hospital and for the ministry of foreign affairs before becoming a journalist.She did not see her family throughout the war. By the time she entered Saigon in 1975, she found that her mother and siblings had already fled.“I had been away from my family for so long,” she said. “I was very disappointed. Even my hair turned white. I was distraught.”View image in fullscreenHo Chi Minh City, now full of skyscrapers, is preparing to mark the 50th anniversary with parades. Here, a group of women reserve their spot on the street in advance of the festivities.Photograph: Manan Vatsyayana/AFP/Getty ImagesHer family were among the more than 1.5 million people who fled, fearing persecution and incarceration in “re-education” camps under the new Communist leaders. Between 200,000 and 400,000 died as they made their journey, according to the UN.On the walls of Phuong’s apartment there are Vietnamese paintings, Buddhist sculptures and black and white photographs taken during the war.An image shows Jane Fonda, who visited Hanoi in 1972, in a white shirt, a camera hanging from her neck. Vietnam, one of America’s most divisive conflicts, and the focus of protest songs, attracted various high-profile visitors, whom Phuong was often assigned to assist while working at the ministry.On one occasion, she was tasked with finding a tailor to make Vietnamese clothing for Fonda, who had arrived in short clothes unsuitable for a war zone, she recalled.Phuong began working with foreign journalists and travelled to the centre of the country, where the heaviest fighting was taking place.“Bombs and bullets were like rain,” she says. At night, her team sheltered in a vast network of tunnels. “For people who have lived only over ground, you cannot imagine it. But at that time there was no choice,” she said.Today the same tunnels, which stretch for 2,000km (1,200 miles) and, in parts, are more than 20 metres deep, have been reinforced and transformed into tourist attractions. Visitors, using their phones to light the way, clamber down into the network of narrow pathways.The surrounding Quang Tri Province remains the area worst affected by landmines and unexploded ordnance. There have been 8,600 casualties since 1975, said Hien Xuan Ngo, of Project Renew, which conducts clearance work, assists victims and educates the community.“In certain areas … local people, because of economic pressure, sometimes they defy the risks,” he added. US funding has been critical to clearance efforts.View image in fullscreenA mother and her children after being rescued by US marines in 1975.Photograph: JT Wolkerstorfer/APProject Renew’s work was temporarily paused when Donald Trump froze foreign assistance, though it has since been given an exemption.Vietnam and the US had grown closer under Joe Biden, upgrading their relationship. Now, Hanoi now faces an increasingly delicate balancing act between Washington and Beijing, underlined by the looming imposition of a 46% tariff.The US accuses Vietnam of allowing Chinese companies to use its territory as a conduit to avoid tariffs that were imposed on China during the last Trump administration. The country’s economy is closely intertwined with both countries.Vietnam has always sought to avoid taking a side in the China-US rivalry. “The pressure from China [was] a motivation for Vietnamese people to normalise the relationship with America and the west and south Asian countries,” said Prof Dr Pham Hong Tung, the director of the Institute of Vietnamese Studies and Development Sciences. “The Vietnamese people are very practical,” he added, though the past is not forgotten.Has Phuong forgiven the US? There are others, worse affected than her, who deserve an apology.“For those who want to ask about forgiveness, go and visit the cemetery. There are a lot of the cemeteries in Vietnam filled with graves of people who died during the war. Many were only 17, not more than 20 years old,” she said.Phuong was eventually able to meet her mother in Paris, in 1989.Her mother barely recognised her on the day they were reunited at the airport. “My mother’s first reaction was to step back and look at me. In my 80-year-old mother’s mind she still thought of me as 16 years old,” she said. “My mom hugged me and we cried. No one around us understood why,” she said. Her mother never returned to Vietnam.As 30 April approached, Phuong’s friends visited the graves of those who died, and offered prayers.She planned to watch the parades, but from home, she said, and to spend time with friends “to talk about our memories, to read poems, and cheer one another – it has been a long life”.Explore more on these topicsVietnamAsia PacificVietnam warnewsShareReuse this content"

They included a barrage of phone calls, the arrest of his sister, and the issuing of a red notice, an international alert, through Interpol.The climax, in April 2021,was the call from Ma. “They said I’m the only one who can persuade you to return,” Ma said.H, who had known Ma for many years, recorded the call. He had done the same for calls he had received from other friends, as well as Chinese security officials, who had called in the weeks before, all with the same message.Transcripts of those calls presented in a French court, along with other legal records, provide a rare insight into some of the methods used by the Chinese regime to exert its influence around the world. The documents lay out in detail how a combination of threats, co-opted legal mechanisms and extrajudicial pressures are used to control even those beyond the country’s borders.The findings are part of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists’ (ICIJ)China Targetsproject, in which journalists documented the methods the Chinese regime uses to track and crush dissent abroad. The team includes the Guardian as well as Radio France and Le Monde, who obtained the transcripts and other legal paperwork.A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in the UK said: “The so-called ‘transnational repression’ byChinais pure fabrication.”Extradition threatH, 48, a China-born citizen of Singapore, was in Bordeaux, France, when he received the call from Ma. A year earlier, a warrant had been issued by Chinese police for H’s arrest on charges of financial crime. Then, China had put out a notice for him through Interpol’s international criminal alert system. The French authorities confiscated his passport while they considered whether to extradite him.in touch embedThe transcripts show that on the call, Ma suggested all of H’s problems would go away if he would help in the prosecution ofSun Lijun, a Chinese politician who had fallen out of favour with the ruling Chinese Communist party (CCP). Sun was being prosecuted for taking bribes and manipulating the stock market. “They are doing this all for Sun, not for you,” Ma said.Sun, a former deputy security minister, was entrusted in 2017 with overseeing security in Hong Kong during mass protests against Beijing’s crackdown on democratic freedoms. He had been arrested the year before H started receiving the phone calls. Later, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI)denouncedSun for “harbouring hugely inflated political ambitions” and “arbitrarily disagreeing with central policy guidelines”.He became one of many top officials caught up in President Xi Jinping’s sweeping anti-corruption campaign, which human rights groups have said serves as a tool for Xi to purge his political rivals.‘You have no other solution’The transcript of the call suggestsMa was not happy to have been drawn into the affair. “Why did you involve me in this?” he asked H.Like Sun, Ma had fallen out of favour with Xi’s regime. After giving a speech in October 2020 in which he criticised Chinese financial regulators, he was hit with repeated sanctions including a$2.8bn fine, and he disappeared from public view.The phone call to H was madesix months later. Ma explained in the call that he had been contacted by Chinese security officials. “They spoke to me very seriously,” Ma told H. “They say they guarantee that if you come back now, they will give you a chance to be exempted … You have no other solution … the noose will tighten more and more.”Later, Ma called H’s lawyer to reiterate the message.H did not return to China and his lawyers fought his extradition in the French courts.Clara Gérard-Rodriguez, one of H’s lawyers, said: “We knew that if H went back to China, he would himself be arrested, detained, probably tortured until he agreed to testify … and that most of his assets, the shares of his company, would most likely be also transferred to other persons.”The conviction rate for criminal cases in China is 99.98%, according toSafeguard Defenders, an organisation that investigates abuses by the Chinese regime. It has documented howforcible disappearancesandtortureare endemic within the justice system.The money laundering charges brought against H in China, a year before the call from Ma, related to his connection to a credit platform, Tuandai.com. The founder of that company wasjailedfor 20 years for illegal fundraising. The Chinese police believed that he had attempted to hide some of the misappropriated funds when the investigation started. H, who had invested in the company, was accused of helping to move some of the money abroad through companies he controlled.H’s lawyers told the French courts there was no evidence that he had known that the source of the funds was questionable. On a call to a friend, recorded in the French court documents, H protested his innocence. “None of this is true,” he said.The Chinese government issued a red notice for H through Interpol, the international police watchdog. This flagged him as a potential criminal to police forces around the world and meant he was unable to travel. “It is like a pin through a butterfly,” said Ted R Bromund, an expert witness in legal cases involving Interpol procedures. “It holds someone down, locks them in place so they can’t get away.”While red notices are used against serious criminals, campaigners have long warned that they can be abused. The British lawyer Rhys Davies recently told a government inquiry into transnational repression that red notices were “routinely used and abused by autocratic regimes to target dissidents and opponents overseas”. He called the system “the sniper rifle of autocrats because it is long-distance, targeted and very effective”.While other countries, including Russia, Turkey andRwanda, have also been known to abuse the system, China’s tactics are different, according to experts. Instead of relying on extraditions, the Chinese authorities use Interpol to locate people and then they ramp up the pressure, threatening them and family members back home until the individual agrees to return “voluntarily”.A spokesperson for Interpol said the system meant thousands of the world’s “most serious criminals” were arrested every year. They added: “Interpol knows red notices are powerful tools for law enforcement cooperation and is fully aware of their potential impact on the individuals concerned, which is why we have robust – and continuously assessed and updated – processes for ensuring our systems are used appropriately.”‘Psychological warfare’As H waited in France, trapped by the legal process the red notice had begun, he received calls from friends and security officials, in what his lawyers called “all-out psychological warfare”. Sometimes the tone was friendly, with promises that all charges would be dropped; other times it was more threatening.Transcripts of the call with the deputy investigator of the unit prosecuting Sun, Wei Fujie, suggest hepromised H that if he returned there would be “no prosecution now, plus the cancellation of the red notice”.A friend called and told H: “Within three days your whole family will be arrested!” Days later, H’s sister was arrested in China.His case is far from unusual. TheICIJ’s China Targets projectlogged the details of 105 targets of transnational repression by China, in 23 countries. Half of them said their family members back home had been harassed through intimidation and interrogation by police or state security officials.RehabilitationWhen H’s case came before the Bordeaux court of appeal, in July 2021, the court denied the extradition request. Later, the red notice was removed from Interpol’s systems. H’s lawyers successfully argued that the extradition request had been issued for political purposes, to compel testimony against Sun.Sun was convicted of manipulating the stock market, taking bribes and other offences, without H’s intervention in the prosecution. He was given a suspended death sentence.H, unable to trade or work in China, could not pay back loans or rent on a luxury property and became engulfed in debts totalling $135m, according to Chinese media. He declined to comment when approached by the Guardian.A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in the UK said: “China always respects the sovereignty of other countries and conducts law enforcement and judicial cooperation with other countries in accordance with the law.”Revealed: online campaign urged far right to attack China’s opponents in UKRead moreRepresentatives for Ma raised questions about his identity in the calls. The Guardian spoke to H’s lawyers, who said he had known the billionaire for many years prior to the call and that he had no doubt the caller was Ma. Throughout the legalprocess in which his lawyers challenged the red noticethere were no questions raised about the identities of the callers.Ma did not respond further to the Guardian.Earlier this year, he was seen energetically applauding Xi at a meeting of business leaders in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People – a sign, according to local media, of the billionaire’s public rehabilitation.Gérard-Rodriguez, H’s lawyer, said: “We saw and learned publicly of Jack Ma’s disappearance … this man, thought to be untouchable, extremely powerful, extremely well-connected in every country in the world, disappeared completely for several months and then reappeared, pledging his allegiance to the Chinese Communist party.“And in the end, it was the same thing expected of H … that he would return to show his loyalty, to show which side he was on.”Explore more on these topicsChinaThe China Targets projectJack MaFranceAlibabaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Now, fragments of that dream of immortality rise again – this time inPerth, where the largest exhibition of the Terracotta Warriors ever staged in Australia will head later this yearOpening on 28 June atWA Museum Boola Bardip, Terracotta Warriors: Legacy of the First Emperor promises not just a glimpse into ancient China, but a sweeping journey across its foundations in more than 225 artefacts, many of which have never left China.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning“It’s hard to put into words how significant this is,” said Alec Coles, CEO of WA Museum Boola Bardip. “Seventy per cent of these objects have never been to Australia before, and 40% have never left China.”“For me, this is the eighth wonder of the world,” he said. “There is nothing like it anywhere.”View image in fullscreenThe Terracotta Warriors were built to guard the tomb of Chinese emperor Qin Shi Huang in the second century BC.Photograph: MediaProduction/Getty ImagesDeveloped in collaboration with the Shaanxi Cultural Heritage Promotion Centre and the Emperor Qin Shi Huang Mausoleum Museum, Terracotta Warriors features 10 of the lifesize clay soldiers – the maximum number permitted to leave China – each weighing up to 180kg and standing 1.8m tall. Meticulously crafted from separate parts, each warrior was finished with a uniquely modelled face, capturing the individuality of a living army.Eight warrior sculptures last came to Australia in 2019 for the National Gallery of Victoria’s showTerracotta Warriors: Guardians of Immortality.WA Museum Boola Bardip’s upcoming exhibition will explore the story of China’s first emperor and the world he sought to recreate in death: bronze vessels, ancient chariots, gilded belt hooks, painted cavalry figures and rare gold ornaments, some so newly unearthed they’ve never been displayed anywhere before.“Qin Shi Huang not only unified China, he standardised measurements, currency and even language – and all of this decades before the Rosetta Stone was carved in Egypt,” Coles said. “You have to think about the extraordinary impact he had in such a tiny period of time.

In a world riven by political tensions, the exhibition will also gesture toward the enduring power of cultural diplomacy.“Cultural connections are important at any time, but perhaps especially now,” Coles said. “They transcend politics. Building stronger relationships and understanding is paramount.”“I hope visitors experience the same wonder that I did,” he added. “The beauty, the rarity, the achievement.

If elected, we will work hard to listen and consult in order to drive practical, positive improvements in our schools.”Henderson also pointed to a recent Coalition announcement to provide $100m to build and expand boarding schools for Indigenous students, and an early years literacy program for children living in disadvantaged communities.The National Catholic Education Commission welcomed the boarding school funding announcement. It has been lobbying throughout the campaign for the major parties to allow schools to preference the employment of staff who support their religious worldview.“Maintaining the authenticity of our mission is critical to the educational, pastoral and spiritual care we provide and our schools must be able to continue to employ staff who support that mission,” its executive director, Jacinta Collins, said.Earlier this month, the education minister, Jason Clare,wrote to Collins and the CEO of Independent Schools Australia (ISA),warning a Coalition government could “use funding as a lever to determine what students in non-government schools are taught”.“This shows an absolute abrogation of responsibility when it comes to the role of the majority government funder of the non-government school sector,” he wrote.When asked about the letter, the CEO of ISA, Graham Catt, said the body strongly believed “governments should not dictate how teachers deliver education in the classroom”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Any reforms, he said, must “respect sectoral diversity, school autonomy and the diverse needs of all learners”.The national curriculum waslast reviewed and updated in 2021-2022, under a federal Coalition government.4:09Voting 101: Should you vote above or below the line this election? Why does it matter? – videoThe executive officer of the Australian Association of Christian Schools, Vanessa Cheng, said there should be less government regulation and oversight in schools, not more.But she said the curriculum had scope to be decluttered, adding “ideological overlays” were making it cumbersome and it didn’t tailor to individual school contexts.“It needs to be fit for purpose and adaptable for different types of education philosophies,” she said. “I feel [the curriculum agreed to in 2022] didn’t give a strong sense of identity, in hope and confidence in who we are as a nation.“It’s not about culture wars, it’s about pride as Australians … There’s been an emphasis on negative parts of our history rather than celebrating positives.

US automakers will also be allowed to apply for tariff relief on a proportion of the costs imposed for imported parts, although that relief will be phased out over the next two years.Trump told reporters he wanted US automakers to “enjoy this little transition short-term”.Trump was “committed to bringing back auto production to the US”, the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, told reporters earlier on Tuesday, “so we want to give automakers a path to do that quickly, efficiently and create as many jobs as possible”.It comes afterindustry analysisfound that the US big three carmakers – Ford, General Motors and Stellantis – could face an increase of more than $42bn in costs as a result of Trump’s 25% tariff on the auto industry, with duties of almost $5,000 for the parts they import to make the average car made in America.“President Trump is building an important partnership with both the domestic automakers and our great American workers,” the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, claimed in a statement. “This deal is a major victory for the president’s trade policy by rewarding companies who manufacture domestically, while providing runway to manufacturers who have expressed their commitment to invest in America and expand their domestic manufacturing.”HSBC sounds alarm on trade war; Trump to soften blow of automotive tariffs – business liveRead moreTrump is due to travel to Michigan on Tuesday for a rally marking hisfirst 100 days in office. His return to the White House – and hopes to reshape the global economy with steep tariffs – swiftly ushered in a new period of economic volatility for firms in the US and overseas.After imposing 10% tariffs on imports from much of the world, the Trump administration plans to speak with 17 trading partners “over the next few weeks”, Bessent said, acknowledging that Trump – who has jolted longstanding US relationships with a string of markets – creates “strategic uncertainty” in negotiations.“As we start moving forward announcing deals, then there will be certainty,” said Bessent. “But certainty is not necessarily a good thing in negotiating.”After rapidly raising tariffs on Chinese products to 145%, Trump’s officials maintain that the risks for China are high – while playing down the potential impact in the US, despite widespread concern over potential shortages and price increases.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They know that President Trump is committed to fair trade, and have planned accordingly.”But with consumers in the firing line, reports that Amazon might start disclosing the cost of tariffs on its platform drew a sharp rebuke from the White House. “This is a hostile and political act by Amazon,” claimed the press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, following a call with Trump.Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTariffsAutomotive industryGlobal economyEconomicsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

With Dimitrov leading 6-4, 5-4 in Manolo Santana Stadium, both players were sent off the court as it became clear that Monday’s power outage that left Spain and Portugal without electricity would force the tournament to suspend all matches for the day. For Fearnley, this meant he had over 24 hours to ponder how exactly that crucial service game would pan out: “It’s impossible not to overthink it,” he said.After about 10 hours without ­electricity and mobile internet for most people in Madrid, power to homes and phones returned late on Monday night, prompting cheers in the streets. At the Caja Mágica, which is situated in the southern neighbourhood of San Fermín, power returned at around 8am on Tuesday, just enough time for play to resume at noon. In the end, Fearnley managed to avoid the worst case scenario – immediately losing his service game upon the restart – but he never quite settled down. His superb run from qualifying, which included a first career top-20 win against Tomas Machac in just his second clay-court event, ended with a hard fought 6-4, 7-6 (3) defeat by Dimitrov: “I was pleased with the way I handled the situation. Maybe I played that game a little bit too much in my head, and didn’t really think about if I was actually capable of ­winning the second set,” he said.Across the tournament grounds, nobody will forget the day the lights went out. Frances Tiafoe was waiting patiently for his match in the player restaurant. “We were thinking it’s gonna be like a 30-minute, hour thing,” he said. “[Tournament staff] were putting candles on our table and [it was] like: ‘Oh, now the whole ofSpainis out of power.’ [I responded:] ‘OK, that’s cool.’ They put another candle on the table: ‘France is out of power too.’ ‘OK, that’s cool.’ Then: ‘Italy’s out of power.’ I’m like: ‘Well, stop putting candles on the table.’”View image in fullscreenFrances Tiafoe said he would tell his grandchildren about the events in Madrid.Photograph: Julian Finney/Getty ImagesSince some players were not scheduled until much later, not everyone had yet made the trip to Madrid. Alex de Minaur took several leisurely walks during the day and opted not to travel to the tournament. Jack Draper, who reached the fourth round with a retirement win against Matteo Berrettini after taking the first set 7-6 (2), had also been out on a ­leisurely walk before his match, which was scheduled for the evening, when the power cut.“I came back to the hotel [and] all of a sudden the lights were off and everything,” he said. “I had to walk up 15 flights of stairs. So I was cramping in the legs, going up there, and then I came down. Took an hour and a half to get here in the car, trained a little bit and went back. Had a sandwich for dinner. It wasn’t that bad, actually, to just take everything off my mind, no phone.”As players attempted to leave the venue after play had been cancelled, the player restaurant and bar area was filled to the brim as players waited for a lift to their hotels, some of which were 15km away. Some opted to walk home, while others waited patiently. ew enjoyed a dinner typical of an athlete: “They still had bread here. So I had a lot of bread,” said Fearnley. Tiafoe, who defeated Alexandre Müller in straight sets, was slightly more blunt: “I ate complete bullshit,” he said. “Just a lot of chocolate.”Most players in Madrid noted that they were simply happy to be in good health and there was no reason to stress: “Honestly, at this point, I just added to the list of random things that have happened that delay a tennis match,” said Madison Keys. “There’s nothing that you can do. So just I took a nap, I laid down, I used my phone while I still had service. Then it stopped working, and I was like: ‘OK, I’ll take another nap.’”For Tiafoe, it is important to look at the glass half -full and to accept the circumstances without complaint. His experience on Monday, however, will also be a source of humour for years to come.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This was the loud and clear messaging at the firstChanelshow since Matthieu Blazy took up his role. The show was held at Villa d’Este, the Lake Como palace hotel where Elizabeth Taylor, Greta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich holidayed and which Alfred Hitchcock, who filmed The Pleasure Garden there, pronounced the most beautiful place on earth.The location, booked a year in advance, provided the theme: life in a grand hotel. Think White Lotus on Lake Como, art directed by Slim Aarons. First on to the pebbled catwalk weaving through the hotel’s terrace was a white bathrobe-style coat. Then there were capri pants in the butter yellow of the hotel parasols, and a lilac tweed suit to match the wisteria trailing overhead. Models swung tote bags big enough for pool towels, while gold lamé cover-ups glinted as dazzling as sun on the lake.View image in fullscreenA white bathrobe-style coat.Photograph: Jacopo M Raule/Getty Images“To me, Como is about the light,” said Bruno Pavlovsky, Chanel’s president of fashion. “Life is cinematic here.” Famous faces including the actors Keira Knightley and Sarah Catherine Hook were dotted among a 900-strong audience mostly made up of Chanel’s biggest-spending clients.The Cruise season of catwalk shows, named for a time when Caribbean cruises requiring trunks of glitzy loungewear were in vogue among the rich, has evolved to stand for holiday glamour in general. Spending on holiday wardrobes has increased exponentially across all price brackets: consumers spend less on dressing smartly for work, and more on looking good on holiday for Instagram. Brands drop serious money on Cruise shows, because a slice of this lucrative holiday market is worth a lot in sunglasses.

The Chanel ambassador made a short film on location at Villa d’Este to accompany the event.Photograph: Jacopo Raule/Getty ImagesPavlovsky describes Chanel as being in a moment of “generational handover”. Blazy, who took up his role at the beginning of April, did not work on this collection or attend the show, which was credited to the design studio. Holding the fort as figurehead for the event in his absence was the Chanel ambassadorSofia Coppola, who made a short film on location at Villa d’Este to accompany the event, which she described as “about that version of yourself when you get away, when you may be different from how you are in real life”.Chanel has doubled revenue and headcount in the past decade to become the world’s second-largest luxury brand behind Louis Vuitton, with 36,500 employees at the end of 2023. It is more than 10 times the size of Bottega Veneta, from where Blazy arrives. His October debut is hotly awaited but Pavlovsky is “not so interested in what happens in October”. Rather, he is “interested in a future which begins in October. We work on Chanel time. We don’t rush.” Pavlovsky has said he will wait two years before judging whether Blazy is the right fit.Pavlovsky dismissed any suggestion of moving production to the US as a strategy to avoid tariffs. He said Chanel intended to maintain its current policy of price harmonisation, in which prices are consistent in every country in the world, adding that they would “find a way to cover the cost” of keeping prices low in US boutiques if tariffs were levied.View image in fullscreenTote bags were big enough for pool towels.Photograph: Stéphane Cardinale/Corbis/Getty ImagesPavlovsky told Womenswear Daily that it was “the great admiration and respect for the heritage and the work done by Mademoiselle Chanel, by Karl and by Virginie”, which he sensed in Blazy, which clinched the recruitment. “That was important to me, because it wasn’t about a kind of competition over image and size. It was about the depth of what the brand stands for, and how we could build on that to continue telling our story.” Blazy has begun to make changes, including the hiring of the seasoned British haute couture specialist Andrew Heather, who has worked under designers including Alexander McQueen and John Galliano.View image in fullscreenA lilac tweed suit matched the wisteria trailing overhead.Photograph: Antonio Calanni/APSilk scarves made in Como featured as ankle straps for heeled sandals on the catwalk. Chanel has recently taken a 35% stake in the Como-based manufacturer Mantero, which has been producing silk for Chanel blouses and printed scarves for more than 50 years. Under the terms of the deal, Mantero will continue to produce clothes for rival luxury clients including Dior, Saint Laurent and Versace, but Chanel believes that protecting key players in its supply chain is a sound investment, at a time when global economic pressures are putting many specialist producers out of business.Explore more on these topicsFashionChanelItalyEuropeSofia CoppolanewsShareReuse this content"

It said Russian hackers, posing as Islamic State militants, targeted TV5Monde “to manipulate public opinion” and create panic inFrance.Since 2021, a branch of Russian military intelligence (GRU) dedicated to cyber-attacks had targeted a dozen French entities including defence, financial and economic sectors, the foreign ministry said. It said the targets had included entities “working in the daily lives of French people and public services, private enterprises as well as a sport organisation involved in the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games”.Barrot said that Russian military intelligence “has been carrying out cyber-attacks against France for several years using a method known as APT28.”APT28, also known as Fancy Bear, has been accused of carrying out dozens of cyber-attacks around the world, including on the 2016 US election, where it was accused of aiding Donald Trump by leaking Democratic party emails and those of the campaign of Hillary Clinton.Areport by the French Cybersecurity agency (ANSSI)released on Tuesday said that since 2021, ATP28 “had been used to gather strategic intelligence from entities located in France, Europe, Ukraine and North America.”The French foreign ministry said in a statement: “France condemns in the strongest terms the use by Russia’s military intelligence service of the APT28 attack group, at the origin of several cyber-attacks on French interests.”The group targets personal email accounts to retrieve data and emails, or gain access to other machines on a system.In September 2024 several international intelligence services, includingGerman authorities, warned of the risk of cyber-attacks targeting Nato countries that Fancy Bear carried out.The French foreign ministry said: “Alongside its partners, France is determined to use all the means at its disposal to anticipate Russia’s malicious behaviour in cyberspace, discourage it and respond to it where necessary.”Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsFranceRussiaEmmanuel MacronEuropeCybercrimenewsShareReuse this content"

An MP who visited the site put the chances of sabotage at 1%.Suspicion of cover-ups is rife, however, and the filing of criminal charges against media outlets and activists by the Tehran prosecutor’s office has caused journalists in Iran to voice concern about press freedom. Mizan news agency, the judiciary’s official media outlet, said violators would face legal consequences for attempting to publish “illegal news” about the explosion.Attacks on press freedom around the world are intensifying, index revealsRead moreOne Tehran-based reporter, speaking to the Guardian on condition of anonymity because of safety concerns, said: “Not only were we warned against ground reporting, we were also banned effectively from sharing reports on social media. In face of a tragedy such as this, what is there to hide? Either the death toll is way more than 70, or they are suppressing the real cause of the explosion. Following the filing of charges, our newsrooms are also self-regulating in fear that they’ll be facing legal consequences.”Officials have confirmed only that the goods that exploded on Saturday did not appear to have had a digitised reference code as required by Iranian customs law.0:59Drone footage shows aftermath of deadly Iran port blast – videoAs many as 130,000 containers are stored at the port, partly because the lack of infrastructure means customs authorities and government ministries do not process goods for export for weeks, a problem raised by the Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, on his visit on Sunday.Iranian officials said on Tuesday that the fire had, after four days, been brought under control and toxic substances had not leaked into the Persian Gulf. Reporting of the explosion has become increasingly difficult, with officials warning against believing foreign media or opposition groups such as the National Council of Resistance of Iran.Iranian officials have blamed mislabelling of dangerous cargo, but media outlets have not yet identified the company alleged to have imported the combustible material. The naval branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps insisted that the port was purely commercial, and said military goods did not pass through.Tuesday’s factory explosion was reported to have happened at the Ava Nar Parsian chemicals company, located in the Meymeh district of Isfahan, a site overseen by Iran’s national security council.The official committee investigating Sunday’s port explosion has said “failures in observing safety principles and passive defence have been confirmed”.Shahid Rajaee port, with an area of ​​about 2,400 hectares, has an annual capacity to handle 70m tonnes of cargo, and is estimated to process half of Iran’s imports.Mohammad Mehdi Shahriari, a member of the Iranian parliament’s national security commission, said four committees were examining potential causes, including the possibility that Israel had been involved in an attempt to disrupt negotiations between the US and Iran over the future of its nuclear programme.Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, the speaker, said parliament was looking at whether any negligence or intent was involved.Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricaPress freedomNewspapers & magazinesNewspapersnewsShareReuse this content"

They reported being beaten + used as human shields,” Lazzariniwrote on X.Those detained had been subjected to “sleep deprivation, humiliation, threats of harm to them & their families + attacks by dogs … [and] forced confessions”.UN officials said the reported abuse had taken place both in Gaza and in military detention sites in Israel.The Israeli military has not responded directly to Lazzarini’s accusation, but has previously denied allegations of widespread abuse in its detention facilities and by its troops.It has, however, launchedinvestigationsinto abuse by individual soldiers during the war, and into the use of detainees as human shields,bringing chargesagainst service personnel in some cases.In a statement, the Israeli military said it acted in accordance with Israeli law and international law, and protects the rights of individuals held in detention facilities under its responsibility.“Any abuse of detainees, whether during their detention or during interrogation, violates the law and the directives of the IDF [Israeli Defense Forces] and as such is strictly prohibited,” the statement said.The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS), said on Tuesday that Israel had released a medic held since a deadly and hugely controversial attack by Israeli troops on ambulances in southern Gaza on 23 March.Eight PRCS staff members, six from the Gaza civil defence agency and one Unrwa employee were killed in the attack, according to the UN humanitarian office OCHA.The killings sparked international condemnation, including concern from the UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, about possible war crimes.View image in fullscreenA screenshot from a video published by the PRCS shows the last moments before Israeli troops opened fire on its ambulances in the southern Gaza Strip.Photograph: Palestinian Red Crescent/ReutersRelations between Israel and Unrwa have deteriorated since the beginning of the war, which was triggered by a surprise attack by Hamas militants in southern Israel in October 2023 during which they killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 250 hostage.Israel bannedall cooperationwith Unrwa’s activities in Gaza and the occupied West Bank earlier this year, and claims the agency has been infiltrated by Hamas, an allegation that has been fiercely contested.The international court of justice, the UN’s highest court, is hearing statements from dozens of countries and organisations before delivering a legal opinion on Israel’s humanitarian obligations to Palestinians. A key issue is whether Israel’s ban on Unrwa’s operations in Palestine is legal.Israel is not participating at the ICJ but has dismissed the hearings as “part of the systematic persecution and delegitimization” of the country. The foreign minister, Gideon Saar, said on Sunday that the hearings were “another attempt to politicise and abuse the legal process to persecute Israel”.Israel seems set on destroying system of international law compliance, ICJ hearsRead more“The goal is to deprive Israel of its most basic right to defend itself,” he said. “It is not Israel that should be on trial. It is the UN and Unrwa. The UN has become a rotten, anti-Israel and antisemitic body.”The hearings come amid an intensifying bombardment of Gaza, which had killed at least 27 Palestinians in the past 36 hours, according to local health officials on Monday. The Israeli military said airstrikes had killed three militant commanders and that all targets were “subject to relevant provisions of international humanitarian law, including the taking of feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm”.Palestinian health officials in the territory say 2,151 people, including 732 children, have been killed since Israel broke a fragile ceasefire on 18 March that had been in place since mid-January.Israel imposed a tight blockade on Gaza almost two months ago, stopping all food, fuel, medicines and other items from entering. It says the measure is intended to force Hamas into releasing hostages and accuses it of systematically stealing humanitarian assistance.Rights groups accuse Israel of using a “starvation tactic” that endangers the whole population, potentially making it a war crime.Humanitarian workers say supplies are running desperately low, with most people eating one meal or less a day. Major agencies such as the World Food Programme and Unrwa have distributed their last stocks of flour and other basic foodstuffs, and medics say malnutrition levels are rising.View image in fullscreenPalestinians clamour to receive food in Khan Younis.Photograph: Hatem Khaled/ReutersHamas is still holding 59 hostages, 24 of whom are believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements and other deals.Families of deceased hostages called on Tuesday for the return of their loved ones’ remains. There are fears that poor conditions and continuing fighting could lead to many being destroyed or soon becoming unidentifiable.“After everything we went through on that day and since, it cannot be that my father’s body will also disappear from the face of the Earth,” said Bar Godard, whose parents were killed during the 2023 Hamas raid and whose father’s body was taken to Gaza.Negotiations for a fresh ceasefire appear to have stalled, with conflicting reports about progress in ongoing talks. Few observers expect a breakthrough in the near future, though analysts say Donald Trump’s scheduled visit to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates in May could lead to renewed US pressure on Israel that might secure a deal.Israeli forces have killed more than 52,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, since it launched its offensive on Gaza, according to the territory’s health ministry.Bombardments and ground operations have also destroyed vast areas and displaced about 80% of the population, many of them 10 or more times.Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to continue the offensive until all the hostages are returned and Hamas is either destroyed or agrees to disarm and leave the territory.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

Carriers make a zigzag maneuver when attempting to evade missile fire, causing them to list to one side.An official account of the ship’s movements was awaited on Tuesday as an investigation was being carried out.The Truman has been patrolling in the Middle East for several months, and recently had its stint extended by the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth.It is one of two US aircraft carriers operating in the area, where US forces have been striking theHouthison a near daily basis using fighter jets, bombers, ships and drones.“The F/A-18E was actively under tow in the hangar bay when the move crew lost control of the aircraft. The aircraft and tow tractor were lost overboard,” the navy said. The jet was part of Strike Fighter Squadron 136.The crew members who were in the pilot seat of the Super Hornet and on the small towing tractor both jumped out before the jet and the tug went into the Red Sea. Fighter jets are routinely towed around the hangar deck to park where they are needed.Monday’s incident was the second F/A-18 operating off the Truman to be lost in six months, after one was mistakenly shot down by the USS Gettysburg late last year.Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS militaryHouthisMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The space is also brightened by huge animated displays of woodland scenes, buzzing bees and a wide variety of Londoners who talk about their home design choices – some of which are recreated in the store.It will display about 6,000 Ikea products, ranging from “Billy” bookcases to drinking glasses, and about 3,500 of those items will be available to take away on the spot, while the rest can be delivered to homes.The store’s opening is regarded by some as key to hopes for a revival of Oxford Street, which has gradually been rejuvenated after a slump in visitor numbers during the Covid pandemic, after which a number of sites sat vacant while a plethora ofcheap American candy shops moved in.In the past two years, the number of vacancies andcandy shops have droppedand the street has been boosted by new openings, including HMV, whichreturned to the site of its original storein November 2023, and the sportswear brand Under Armour.The seven-storey former Topshop building is also home to Nike Town, which is taking more space in some of the upper floors, an outlet for beauty specialist Space NK as well as office space.Explore more on these topicsIkeaLondonShoppingRetail industrySadiq KhannewsShareReuse this content"

TheDepartment for Education(DfE) has missed its recruitment target for secondary teacher training in all but one of the past 10 years.With secondary school pupil numbers likely to peak in 2028, piling further pressure on the system, the NAO called on the government to publish a delivery plan, outlining how it intends to recruit the additional 6,500 teachers within the timeframe. It also urged ministers to “assess the extent to which the further education workforce model is fit for purpose”.Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the chair of the public accounts committee, said: “The DfE assesses that meeting the government’s pledge for 6,500 more teachers will be very challenging. Even if met, it is not clear that this will be enough to fix the nationwide shortage of teachers amidst growing numbers of students.“There needs to be a new cross-sector approach to recruiting and retaining enough high-quality teachers. Otherwise, workforce challenges will continue to pose a real threat to young people’s education and life prospects.”Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said: “Despite the government’s pledge, secondary schools and further education colleges face a challenge in securing enough teachers to support growing student numbers.”Jack Worth, the school workforce lead at the National Foundation for Educational Research, said the report sent a clear message to government that it would miss its 6,500 teacher recruitment pledge if it does not take action now.“Unfilled vacancy levels are at their highest rates since records began in 2010, with pay, stress from dealing with pupil behaviour and workload pressures reported to be contributing to teachers leaving the profession,” he added.“Properly funded pay rises are urgently needed alongside and non-financial measures, such as workload reduction and flexible working, to improve both recruitment and retention.” The Treasury has already saidany pay rises must come from existing budgets.Responding to the NAO report, Phillipson reiterated the government’s commitment to recruiting 6,500 more teachers. “We’re already seeing green shoots, with 2,000 more secondary school teachers training this year, alongside a boost in the number set to begin training in shortage Stem [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] subjects, but there’s still much more to do.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However it seems that it was conducted as a simulation and so may not be true to a real application process.”Explore more on these topicsTeacher shortagesTeacher trainingBridget PhillipsonLabourSchool fundingSchoolsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The country is at risk, people are at risk, and there is not enough being done.”She said it was frightening that the government was not taking seriously the rapidly increasing risk of flooding and was insteadconsidering cuts to flood defences.The Treasury has indicated thatflood spending would not be ringfencedand could be reduced in the spending review in June.Brown said: “If that means they’re thinking of cutting the money forresilience to flooding, we would ask them to think again. I can’t be clear enough about our message: we cannot wait to take action. This is not tomorrow’s problem. It’s today’s problem. And if we don’t do something about it, it will become tomorrow’s disaster.”She pointed tofloods in Valenciathat killed 220 people in October andfloods in Germany and Belgiumin 2021 with similar numbers of deaths. “These are very close to home. These things could happen in the UK and we need government to recognise that this is the disaster that could be happening tomorrow and start to really take this seriously,” she said. “It is quite frightening that the evidence we’ve got shows that it isn’t yet.”Without increased focus on making the UK’s infrastructure and economy more resilient to extreme weather, the impacts of the climate crisis could destroy about 7% of the UK’s GDP by 2050, the CCC found. This compares with acost of cutting greenhouse gas emissions to net zeroby 2050 of about 0.2% of GDP per year.View image in fullscreenCommittee member says deadly floods in Valencia, Spain, ‘could happen in the UK.’Photograph: José Jordan/AFP/Getty ImagesThe CCC’s latesttwo-year assessment of the UK’s progress in adapting to climate change, published on Wednesday, found failure across every measure and every form of infrastructure, from transport and energy to communications. People’s health was being put at risk by the failure to adapt, the report found, and thenatural environment was being damaged.One in four properties will be at risk of flooding by 2050 unless urgent action is taken, up from about 6.3m properties today, the report found. More than a third of the railways and road networks are already at risk of flooding, which will rise to about half by 2050.More than half of England’s top quality agricultural land is already at risk of flooding, and harvests like last year’s – thesecond worst for arable on record– could become more common.Although many of the findings in the CCC assessment relate to measures taken under the previous government, Brown said that Labour was failing to respond to the threats. “We’re seeing no increase in action,” she said.The Environment Agency warned last year thatinflation was eating into flood defence budgets, meaning fewer people were being protected for the same expenditure. The National Audit Office warned of a quarter of new flood defence projects being abandoned.View image in fullscreenLow water levels at Baitings reservoir, West Yorkshire, in 2022, when a heatwave caused more than 3,000 excess deaths in England.Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesA government spokesperson said: “As part of our plan for change we are investing a record £2.65bn to repair and build flood defences, protecting tens of thousands of homes and businesses and helping local communities become more resilient to the effects of climate change such as overheating and drought.”Flooding is the most obvious impact of the climate crisis in the UK, but rising temperatures are also taking a toll. Drought has meant 20 million people are subjected to water restrictions,wildfiresare outrunning the capacity of the fire brigade to extinguish them – the area burned in 2025 has exceeded the previous annual record before summer has even started – and heatwaves are forecast to become more frequent and intense.The climate crisis is already imposing costs on the NHS. There were more than 3,000 excess deaths in England in the heatwave of 2022, and one in five doctors reported that surgeries and operations had been cancelled, the CCC found.Philip Evans, a senior climate campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said: “Britain’s firefighters and insurers have already warned we’re not set up to cope with the increase in floods, wildfires and heatwaves. Now climate experts confirm it’s not getting better. This means our farms are under water, food prices are going up, homes are wrecked and ordinary people count the cost.”He called for taxes on fossil fuel companies to pay for the preparations needed. “The government must bolster Britain’s resilience. Oil and gas companies are fuelling this extreme weather and making billions from doing it, so we need climate taxes on these profits to pay for adaptation measures and protect us from the extreme costs of weather chaos.”Tom Lancaster, the head of land, food and farming at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank, called for ministers to rescind thecuts to sustainable farming programmes. The ECIU estimated that that the impact of the climate crisis added about £360 to the average household food bill in total for 2022 and 2023.“Investing in [support schemes for sustainable farming] will be needed to build the resilience of UK food production, and will be a key test of whether the government has taken the criticism in this report on board,” he said.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisLabourClimate Change CommitteeFloodingDroughtExtreme weatherGreen politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

We have been engaging with course providers for several years already, and we only grant approval where they meet our high standards.”In November, Wes Streeting, the health and social care secretary, announced an independent review of the PA and AA professions led by Prof Gillian Leng, the president of the Royal Society of Medicine.Danny Mortimer, the chief executive of NHS Employers, said: “The formal accreditation of the courses of study that PAs and AAs must complete is an essential component of regulation and public safety.“We await the outcome of the Leng review but recognise that individual NHS organisations also have a responsibility to support PAs and AAs to both use their knowledge safely with patients, and to ensure appropriate professional development and supervision.”Prof Phil Banfield, the council chair at the British Medical Association, said it was “difficult to understand” how the GMC could approve the courses when the Leng review into PAs and AAs has not concluded.He added: “The medical profession has alarming worries about the quality and robustness of these courses, with reports of exams with 100% pass rates.“We have made doctors’ concerns clear in our submission to the Leng review, which includes a call for an independent body of doctors, without links to course providers, to determine proportionate and safe expectations of what can be covered in curricula for assistant roles within a two-year training period.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Governmentstatistics for Englandrecorded 1.15m incidents in 2023-24, up 6% from a year before.While councils already have the powers to seize and crush vehicles used in fly-tipping, Defra said administrative hurdles mean this is rarely done, with the bulk of such action last year taking place under just two councils.As well as working with councils to make this easier, local authorities will also be able to charge fly-tippers for the cost of seizing and storing any vehicles. Police will be encouraged to help identify vehicles being used with drones and mobile CCTV cameras.While rules do not allow new policies to be announced specific to areas where elections are taking place on Thursday, national initiatives are permitted. With Labour expected to face a strong challenge from Reform UK, other new policies have covered topics such as immigration and policing.To unveil the initiative,Steve Reed, the environment secretary, visited a recycling centre in Wokingham, Berkshire, where a van used in fly-tipping was being crushed.Reed said: “Waste criminals and fly-tippers who blight our towns and villages have gone unpunished for too long. That ends today. The government is calling time on fly-tipping. I will not stand by while this avalanche of rubbish buries our communities.“Waste crime is trashing communities across the country. Fly-tipping has skyrocketed by a fifth while the number of prosecutions has fallen by the same amount since 2018-19.“The failure to punish these criminals has left our high streets, roads and countryside buried under an avalanche of rubbish.”In a parallel initiative, the Environment Agency will be given extra resources to carry out checks on licensed waste operators, with more powers to revoke permits for rogue companies, as well as fining them.Philip Duffy, the agency’s chief executive, said: “Waste crime is toxic. Criminals’ thoughtless actions harm people, places, and the economy, blighting our communities and disrupting legitimate businesses.“We’re determined to bring these criminals to justice through tough enforcement action and prosecutions. That’s why we support the government’s crackdown on waste criminals, which will ensure we have the right powers to shut rogue operators out of the waste industry.”Explore more on these topicsWasteEnglandLocal electionsLocal politicsLocal governmentSteve ReednewsShareReuse this content"

Cold water shock can affect anyone, no matter how fit or experienced they are.“It can lead to water inhalation and, in the worst cases, drowning. Be particularly careful near the water’s edge – it’s easy to slip and fall unexpectedly. And think twice before jumping into open water.”Research this month found that the number of UK homes overheating in summerquadrupled to 80%over the past decade.The study also found that the use of air conditioning soared sevenfold to 21% of homes between 2011 and 2022. The researchers warned that continuation of this trend could put strain on the national electricity grid, increase carbon emissions and fuel social disadvantage among families unable to afford air conditioning.The research was prompted by extreme heatwaves in 2022, when temperatures in the UK rose above 40C for the first time. The past two years have been the hottest on record globally, driven by the burning of fossil fuels.More than 10,000 people have died as a result of summer heatwaves from 2020 to 2024, data from the UK Health Security Agency shows.The huge rise in overheated homes and air conditioner use was “a shocking result”, said Dr Mehri Khosravi at the University of East London, who led the study. She added: “Over the heatwaves experienced in 2022 we had nearly 4,500 dead, but this excess mortality is hidden.”Explore more on these topicsUK weatherClimate crisisHerefordshireMeteorologynewsShareReuse this content"

Most of the state’s cases are from Lea county, adjacent to Gaines county in Texas.“The ideal situation is to see a few weeks of no increase in the case count before we can have some optimism in the spread slowing down,” said Singh.US pediatricians and infectious disease experts say the fight against rising measles cases nationwide is being hampered by a lack of forceful advocacy for vaccination from government health officials and statements on unproven treatments that are confusing parents.Doctors assert that vaccination is the most effective way to prevent infection. Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that’s airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. The disease has been considered eliminated from the US since 2000.Other states with active outbreaks – defined as three or more cases – include Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Montana, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.With one-fifth of states seeing active measles outbreaks, the US is nearing 900 cases, according to figures posted Friday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC’s confirmed measles cases count is 884, triple the amount seen in all of 2024.In communities with high vaccination rates – above 95% – diseases like measles have a harder time spreading through communities. This is called “herd immunity”.But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their children from required shots. The US saw a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak in Chicago that sickened more than 60.Explore more on these topicsTexasUS politicsHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Capt Jeremy J Burkett of the Alabama law enforcement agency said the animal’s owner and troopers were able to capture it.“When somebody said there was a kangaroo of course I didn’t believe it, and nobody believed it.

US automakers will also be allowed to apply for tariff relief on a proportion of the costs imposed for imported parts, although that relief will be phased out over the next two years.Trump told reporters he wanted US automakers to “enjoy this little transition short-term”.Trump was “committed to bringing back auto production to the US”, the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, told reporters earlier on Tuesday, “so we want to give automakers a path to do that quickly, efficiently and create as many jobs as possible”.It comes afterindustry analysisfound that the US big three carmakers – Ford, General Motors and Stellantis – could face an increase of more than $42bn in costs as a result of Trump’s 25% tariff on the auto industry, with duties of almost $5,000 for the parts they import to make the average car made in America.“President Trump is building an important partnership with both the domestic automakers and our great American workers,” the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, claimed in a statement. “This deal is a major victory for the president’s trade policy by rewarding companies who manufacture domestically, while providing runway to manufacturers who have expressed their commitment to invest in America and expand their domestic manufacturing.”HSBC sounds alarm on trade war; Trump to soften blow of automotive tariffs – business liveRead moreTrump is due to travel to Michigan on Tuesday for a rally marking hisfirst 100 days in office. His return to the White House – and hopes to reshape the global economy with steep tariffs – swiftly ushered in a new period of economic volatility for firms in the US and overseas.After imposing 10% tariffs on imports from much of the world, the Trump administration plans to speak with 17 trading partners “over the next few weeks”, Bessent said, acknowledging that Trump – who has jolted longstanding US relationships with a string of markets – creates “strategic uncertainty” in negotiations.“As we start moving forward announcing deals, then there will be certainty,” said Bessent. “But certainty is not necessarily a good thing in negotiating.”After rapidly raising tariffs on Chinese products to 145%, Trump’s officials maintain that the risks for China are high – while playing down the potential impact in the US, despite widespread concern over potential shortages and price increases.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In response, the company haspressured its third-party sellersto shoulder the burden of the extra import costs rather than pass them on to customers. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.“This is another reason why Americans should buy American,” Leavitt continued, though Amazon is headquartered in Seattle.Amazon moved to distance itself from the report, saying the idea had been considered by Amazon Haul, the company’s recently launched low-cost shopping hub, but had been rejected.“The team that runs our ultra-low-cost Amazon Haul store considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products. This was never approved and is not going to happen,” said Tim Doyle, Amazon spokesperson.Online shopping has been upended by Trump’s trade policies. The day before the White House took aim at Amazon, discount retailers Temu and Shein, which ship from China, began displaying 145% “import charges” in customers’ totals to reflect the surcharge on Chinese goods.Asked if the strident statement from the White House signaled a rift between Trump and Bezos, who stepped down as CEO in 2021 and donated $1m to Trump’s inauguration fund earlier this year, Leavitt said: “I will not speak to the president’s relationships withJeff Bezos.”Bezos and Trump endured a strained relationship during the president’s initial run for the White House. During the 2016 campaign, the Amazon founder publicly argued that some of Trump’s rhetoric, including threats to lock up his political opponents, damaged democracy, while Trump accused the tech giant of failing to pay enough taxes.Scrutiny of Trump’s first term by the Washington Post, which is owned by Bezos, angered the US president. He was further infuriated by Bezos’s apparent refusal to intervene. In a bid to pile pressure on Amazon, Trump threatened to block federal aid for the US Postal Service unless it hiked shipping rates for online firms.Since Trump’s return to power, however, Bezos has taken a noticeably different approach to the president. He attended Trump’s inauguration, alongside astring of other big tech founders, and Amazon donated $1m to Trump’s inauguration fund.Days before last November’s presidential election, the Washington Post announced its editorial boardwould not endorse a candidatefor the first time in more than three decades – prompting an exodus of subscribers. Bezos insisted the move was a “principled decision” and claimed that “inadequate planning” had led to the last-minute call.The Post went a step further in February, announcing anoverhaul of the newspaper’s opinion sectionto focus its output “in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets”, Bezos said. The decision angered readers and staff and prompted the resignation of the opinions editor, David Shipley.His actions drew a sharp rebuke from Marty Baron, the highly regarded former editor of the Washington Post, whotold the Guardianthat Bezos’s plan for the newspaper’s opinion section amounted to a “betrayal of the very idea of free expression” that had left him “appalled”.Amazon, meanwhile, is reportedly paying some $40m to license a documentary on the life of the first lady, Melania Trump.Explore more on these topicsAmazonE-commerceTrump tariffsTrump administrationTariffsDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Plus, Musk’s Doge time is up amid abysmal Tesla earningsBlake MontgomeryTue 29 Apr 2025 08.52 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Apr 2025 08.53 EDTShareThe European Union finedAppleandMetahundreds of millions of dollars last week.My colleague Jennifer Rankinreports:The European Commission has finedApple€500m (£429m) and Meta €200m for breaking rules on fair competition and user choice, in the first penalties issued under one of the EU’s landmark internet laws.The fines under the EU Digital Markets Act (DMA), which is intended to ensure fair business practices by tech companies, are likely to provide another flashpoint with Donald Trump’s administration, which has fiercely attacked Europe’s internet regulation.TheTrump administrationwas indeed quick to rebuke the fines: a national security council spokesperson toldPoliticothat the EU’s moves were a “novel form of economic extortion” that “will not be tolerated by the United States”.Interesting, too, is that while the penalties are no small amount of money, their impact likely pales in comparison to the scrutiny the tech companies are facing in the US. Though the EU boasts more robust consumer protections when it comes to tech, the cases against these companies on their home turf, where they have enjoyed great latitude in the past, threaten their core corporate structure, which has been key to integrating their products with one another and creating the walled gardens that have earned them hundreds of billions of dollars.Before Donald Trump ascended to the US presidency a second time, I would have predicted that little regulation of tech giants would emerge from his administration and that if there were any authority that would provide a check on Silicon Valley’s humongous and still growing influence, it would be Europe. That is not the regulatory landscape we find ourselves in, though. The US Department of Justice is engaged in serious pursuit of nearly every major American tech company for alleged monopolistic conduct. The bureau has filed suits against Apple, Amazon, Meta andGooglewithin the past two years. Meta’s trial began two weeks ago and threatens to unwind its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.Most severe – Google faces the consequences of losing two major antitrust cases in quick succession. The US has petitioned a judge to force the nearly $2tn company to divest one of its crown jewels, Chrome, the most popular web browser in the world.The US wields the sharper sword here since the tech giants are headquartered there. Unlike the EU’s fines, the antitrust cases in the US threaten the corporate organization of the tech giants, which, if altered, would redirect the profits and change consumers’ experiences with their products. These massively profitable businesses have rolled over far larger fines like speed bumps – recall when the US Federal Trade CommissionfinedFacebook $5bn for privacy violations, which Mark Zuckerberg mentioned during a few subsequent earnings calls and then never again. Facebook continued operating largely as it did before. The EUfinedGoogle fined €4.3bn in 2018 over Android’s preference for Google search. Apple wasfined€1.8 just last year over music streaming payments.A Chrome-less Google, on the other hand, would make for a less personalized experience of using the internet, I think, perhaps even for my fellow Safari users. YouTube and Google search could draw on less of your history.

The company brought in $19.3bn in revenue, well below Wall Street expectations of $21.45bn. The company reported an earnings per share of 27 cents, also well under investor expectations of 43 cents in earnings per share.Tesla profits also slid 71% to $409m compared with $1.39bn in net income the previous year.The company suffered a 13% drop in vehicle deliveries, making it the company’s worst quarter since 2022. Tesla closed the quarter with 336,681 vehicles delivered.The majority of Musk’s enormous net worth – he remains the world’s richest person despite a nearly$100bn declinein his fortune since the year began – consists of his partial ownership of Tesla. His shares in the company are worth quite a lot less than they were when Trump was inaugurated.During a call with disappointed Wall Street investors after Thursday’s earnings figures, Musk said his work to get the US government’s “financial house in order is mostly done”. “Starting probably next month, May, my time allocation to Doge will drop significantly,”he added. He is scheduled to leave Doge on 30 May, amid a strict130-day capon his service as a special government employee.The statement reminds me of the premature “Mission Accomplished” banner flown by former US president George W Bush soon after the disastrous Iraq war began: a declaration of victory that papers over a tumultuous reality very much still in flux. The success of Musk’s cost-cutting has yet to be determined. Four days before the earnings call, a federal judge in the USblocked his team’s effortsto shutter a top consumer financial protection agency. We do not yet know how much of his scything of the US federal government will remain in place.Read more about Elon MuskElon Musk to pull back in Doge role starting May amid 71% dip in Tesla profitsElon Musk’s xAI accused of pollution over Memphis supercomputerThe wider TechScapeAI images of child sexual abuse getting ‘significantly more realistic’, says watchdogMeta faces Ghana lawsuits over impact of extreme content on moderatorsTrump’s meme coin soars after he asks top 220 holders to dinnerApple ‘aims to source all US iPhones from India’, reducing reliance on ChinaUS food delivery app DoorDash offers to buy UK rival Deliveroo for $3.6bnWhat to do if your phone is lost or stolen: practical steps to restore peace of mindExplore more on these topicsMetaTechScape newsletterAppleTrump administrationEuropean UnionTechnology sectorElon MuskTeslanewslettersShareReuse this content"

Yet if they are to keep alive their shot at history, the pursuit of a firstChampions Leaguetriumph, they are going to need something extraordinary in the second leg of this semi-final next Wednesday.The atmosphere at the Parc des Princes will be red-hot andParis Saint-Germainwill not easily be shifted from the advantage that Ousmane Dembélé’s fourth-minute goal has given them. The French champions showed why they have won so many admirers across the continent this season, calling the tune for the opening 35 minutes or so. And again towards the end when they expertly retightened their grip.Arsenal resisted, showed their mettle and they had their moments. Gianluigi Donnarumma was forced to make crucial saves from Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard. Mikel Merino had a goal disallowed. But this was not the barnstorming night that Arteta had wanted, one to rival thefirst leg of the quarter-final against Real Madrid, when Arsenal won 3-0.Arsenal v Paris Saint-Germain: Champions League semi-final, first leg – liveRead morePSG were in total command during the closing stages and the truth was they could have scored again. After João Neves had lifted a shot high, one PSG substitute, Bradley Barcola, dragged wastefully wide of the far post when clean through before another, Gonçalo Ramos, hit the crossbar when one-on-one with David Raya. Ramos had run through all alone. He almost had too much time.Dembélé was dropped for PSG’s visit in the league phase of the competition in October, whichArsenal won 2-0, after a disagreement with Luis Enrique. Yet the striker made the difference, breaking a six-game scoring drought with what was his 25th goal in his past 25 club games. He was not the only PSG player to shine.“Bring your boots,” Arteta had told theArsenalfans. In other words, be prepared to live every moment with the players. The idea was for the biggest game in Emirates Stadium history to have the most emotional atmosphere, for Arsenal to feed off the sheer scale of the possibilities but it did not really happen. PSG killed the mood.Luis Enrique’s team made it happen at the outset, settling into their passing rhythms straight away and stunning the Emirates with the early goal. It was certainly a worry from an Arsenal point of view to see how easily Dembélé was able to motor up through the centre of the field and go left for Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, who ran at Jurriën Timber. Which was an even bigger worry.View image in fullscreenOusmane Dembélé fires PSG ahead.Photograph: Alex Pantling/Uefa/Getty ImagesKvaratskhelia popped the ball back to Dembélé, whose low first-time shot through a crowd was slightly scuffed but the precision made up for it, the ball kissing the far post on its way in. Cue delirium among the travelling ultras, who lit flares and detonated a firecracker. PSG hogged possession for most of the first half, so slick and comfortable, Vitinha prominent. From right to left, Désiré Doué, Dembélé and Kvaratskhelia shimmered with menace. PSG’s movement was too much. Arsenal chased shadows. It was the remorselessness of the PSG press, as well. Arsenal had to work hard to construct their moves from the back. There were anxious moments as they did so.The good news for Arteta was that his team dug out a foothold in the final 10 minutes of the first period, Bukayo Saka crackling to life, taking it upon himself to be the catalyst. When Jakub Kiwior pulled back for Merino, PSG were grateful to Neves for a last-gasp tackle.Arsenal’s big chance of the half came at the very end of it, Myles Lewis-Skelly releasing Martinelli, who had only Donnarumma to beat from an angle on the left. The goalkeeper made an important block.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Kvaratskhelia worked Raya but it was Doué who fully extended him on 32 minutes, darting inside and shooting violently for the near corner. Raya changed directions smartly to save. In between times, Kvaratskhelia wanted a penalty after running into a stray arm from Timber. He went down too easily.View image in fullscreenGianluigi Donnarumma saves from Gabriel Martinelli.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianArsenal began to get frustrated with the officials, a collective howl greeting the decision on 43 minutes to penalise Saka for a minuscule touch on Nuno Mendes. Saka would have been away on goal. He was booked for his reaction. There was further angst at the start of the second half after Merino headed home from Declan Rice’s free-kick. After a ridiculously long delay, the VAR showed that Merino was offside.Arsenal could feel the belief returning. They pushed higher. Rice, playing as the No 6 in the absence of the suspended Thomas Partey – who was missed – grew in influence. When he strode upfield in the 56th minute, he put Trossard through up the inside left. Trossard’s pace turned it into an even bigger chance. His underpowered shot was turned away by Donnarumma.William Saliba made a vital challenge on Achraf Hakimi inside the Arsenal box and the question was whether Arteta’s team could make it happen at the other end. They could not. PSG reasserted themselves and it could have been worse for Arsenal if Barcola and Ramos had not blown their late chances.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueArsenalParis Saint-Germainmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The stands are at the steepest pitch that regulations will allow, sightlines are unobstructed from every seat, and judging from the promotional videos, fans will never be more than 50 metres from either a toilet or a scouse pie, which seems like a key metric of success for any stadium in Liverpool.Among the new structure’s most hyped features is the South Stand, a single stand running from pitch to roof that will accommodate 14,000 fans and become, in the club’sown words, a “blue wall” and the “beating heart” of Everton’s home support.The story in Liverpool, in which the hope of urban renewal rises in the shadow of a new sporting landmark, is being repeated across much of the rich world. From Milan to Miami, these are boom times for new stadium construction in Europe and the US. But why does the whole infrastructural bonanza feel so empty?Everton Stadium’s “blue wall” is, of course, a nod to Borussia Dortmund’s famous “yellow wall” at Westfalenstadion, which now has a good claim to being the most widely imitated stadium feature on the planet. Every team building a stadium today wants a steep home end to host the most passionate fans and supply color and noise to the matchday experience: Tottenham Hotspur Stadium’s 17,500-seat South Stand was designed to create a“wall of sound”(or perhaps of fury, given therecent direction of the club), while in the US the Buffalo Bills are building a new 60,000-seater whose northern end zone will put fans as close as 12ft away from the on-field action and amplify home advantage, the architectsclaim, “through an intimidating wall of support.” The team owners and many fans want them; the cities think they need them. But who actually benefits when the big tops go up?Impressive structures though they may be, these new arenas all have a sameyness to them, even in the aesthetic claims that stadium designers now make about their creations’ sensitivity to architectural heritage. BothEvertonStadium and the Bills’ new arena, for instance, feature red brick bases that “nod” to the industrial history of their surrounding cities – transforming, for the denizens of these proud old manufacturing centers, the pain of deindustrialization into the expensive pleasure of participation in the 21st century leisure economy.Historically, the structural quirks and infelicities of stadiums – their harshness, exposure, sparse and potentially life-threatening food options, and barbarically long toilet lines – offered a kind of fuel to fan culture. Are we traveling towards a world of blandly perfect stadium engineering, where every stadium looks and feels the same, and every fanbase is funneled towards the same set of game-day habits and enthusiasms?Given how small the circle that dominates the design of top-level stadiums is, the drift to homogenization may be no surprise. Most of the high-profile stadiums built in recent years are the work of a handful of firms including Populous, which built the new arenas for both Spurs and the Bills and was responsible for the 2000s-era “retro” craze in baseball stadium design. Manica was responsible for Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, the Tennessee Titans’ new home ground in Nashville, and the location-pending new stadium for the Chicago Bears. Foster + Partners designed Lusail Stadium in Qatar and was recentlyenlistedby Sir Jim Ratcliffe to design theyurt citythat will eventually replace Old Trafford. Dan Meis is behind the new bowls for Everton and Roma. Whatever the particularities of each site and club, there is a formula to these stadiums now, and it’s making the gameday experience indistinguishable from Doha to Dallas.The reckless fantasy of austerity as a panacea is coming for European football | Aaron TimmsRead moreAcross Europe and the US, stadiums have become the great hope of urban regeneration – the prize asset that will, local officials hope, bring life and money back to stagnating cities. Superficially this seems like a perfect marriage: top clubs need the increased revenue that bigger, more sophisticated stadiums with richer facilities will bring, and cities need the boost to economic activity that should in theory follow from the construction of a major new venue. It’s true, of course, that in professional sport’s new world, revenue is king. For a football club in Europe to move, say, from a cramped and under-serviced 30,000-seater to a sleek new arena with room for 60,000 people and all the other assorted nonsense represents a massive step up in economic power, with the security to lock in chunky revenue streams for decades to come. In England, the economic incentives for stadium construction are even more powerful given that infrastructure expenses are exempt from the Premier League’s new profitability rules: for top clubs, building big has become something akin to a financial free kick.But however much economic sense they may make, at least in theory, new stadiums rarely (probably never) attract the same type of affection from fans commanded by the ramshackle, lived-in old grounds of team lore. As Arsenal’s experience of the past two decades shows, the financial lift of a new arena sometimes comes with a far more damaging psychological and cultural drain. Nor do the economics always work out. In some cases these stadiums can become a potentially lethal albatross, not only because servicing the debt that’s often incurred to build them is prohibitive but also because they sometimes spur overreach. Lyon, for instance, moved in to Groupama Stadium in 2016, but satisfying the repayments on their razzmatazz new 59,000-seat, Populous-designed home, amid broader Covid-authored financial distress and poor player recruitment, has become so burdensome that the club is now sinking in debt and on thebrinkof administrative relegation to France’s second tier.View image in fullscreenLyon’s Groupama stadium has been a financial burden on the club.Photograph: Manon Cruz/ReutersA simple solution to the problem of payment, of course, is to get someone else to take care of it. This is the financial relief line that franchises in the US have become particularly adept at tapping, with federal law allowing local governments to issue tax-exempt bonds to build sports facilities.The heavy reliance on public money to fund construction costs in the US is partly a product of necessity. It’s striking how much more expensive it now is to build a modern 60,000-seater in America than it is in Europe, the symptom of a broader infrastructural blockage that has become the focus of muchrecent writing: while Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, for instance, came in well over budget at £1.2bn ($1.5bn), the Chicago Bears’ new colosseum, which is projected to be around the same size as Spurs’ home ground, has beenbudgetedat a cost of $3.2bn. Public contributions for the newTitansandBillsgrounds represent the two biggest stadium subsidies in US history.The motivations that drive governments, not only in the US but also in Europe, to offer financial and political support to these projects are a mix of vanity (the prestige and magnetism of an architectural marvel), fear (the threat of defection by the home team to a different location, which is especially powerful in the US, with its long history of team-to-city betrayal and seduction), and ambition. Of these, it’s ambition that gets all the headlines; throughout the planning approval, construction, and unveiling of every new stadium there is constant rhetoric about all the good the stadium is doing and will do to revitalize, regenerate, and reboot the surrounding economy. Just the other day Everton’s owners were on the phone to the UK government, asking for more money on the basis that the club’s new ground “will accelerate Liverpool’s regeneration”, as the headline in the Financial Timesput it. From taxes to regulation and even interest rates, the risk of capital flight is the great threat hanging over modern economic policy. Stadiums literalize this drama in striking, if not always obvious, ways, offering local governments a handy visual metaphor to satisfy themselves they are doing their bit to inject life into the local economy and attract outside investment while tying important cultural assets in place.There’s one small problem with the urban regeneration argument: it doesn’t hold up against the evidence. Stadium-led revitalization is the myth that will survive the apocalypse. New stadiums, as a vast body of academic literatureshows, bring few of the economic benefits that developers, team owners, and local politicians promise. Whatever stimulus they offer to economic activity in their immediate vicinity is invariably offset by a corresponding depression in spending and investment in other areas of the same city.NFL’s Commanders, Washington DC agree near-$4bn stadium dealRead moreNew stadiums facilitate a transfer of wealth, within geographies and across classes. In many cases they may do more harm than good, saddling local communities with the costs of construction and diverting public funds from education and housing while siphoning off all the stadium’s future wealth for the team itself, which mostly means the team owners: a classic case of privatizing the profits while socializing the risks. Building new stadiums is great business for stadium architects, developers, facilities businesses, and team investors, and a lousy deal for everyone else. The financial flows involved – from the local community into the pockets of team owners – are as predictable as the designs of the stadiums themselves.Even where public subsidies are modest the financial effects of new construction ripple out to supporters via higher ticket prices and more expensive amenities; eventually a day at the stadium becomes an occasional luxury rather than a regular pleasure. Tradition, community, rootedness are, we’re always told, at the heart of any new stadium project, but inevitably they become diluted once the fresh concrete stands are filled. New stadiums don’t just transform the physical reality in which a team plays; they change the team’s fan base too, and the culture attached to it. And perhaps that’s the real point inherent in the uniformity of modern stadium design: to eradicate the gnarly, unruly, difficult, and – let’s be honest – poor supporters, to kick out the kooks and the crazies, and replace them all with docile, obedient consumers ready to stand, sing, and spend on cue.The arrival of a new stadium heralds, in many ways, the birth of a new club, unburdened by whatever has come before.From a distance Everton’s new 52,000-seat home, a steel and glass bubble plopped on top of a sturdy brick base, has the aspect of a giant escape pod ready for launch. The more buffed, dazzling, screen-stuffed and hyperactive these new stadiums appear, the more they seem to embody not reinvestment in the communities they represent but liftoff from them.This article was amended on 29 April 2025 to correct the name of the architect behind the Everton and Roma stadiums.Explore more on these topicsFootballBusiness of soccerPremier LeagueNFLUS sportsEvertonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I think a lot of people say a lot of bad things when they are full of adrenaline in other sports. It just doesn’t get picked up.”Verstappen suggested it should be a problem for broadcasters, not drivers. The four-time champion said last year that TV includes drivers swearing “probably also for entertainment purposes”, adding: “I think it already just starts with not broadcasting it.”Whether there is significant progress will depend on the substance of any changes Ben Sulayem introduces.

There has already been one sign of a more flexible approach when Carlos Sainz wasn’t fined for using an expletive in a news conference while he protested another fine for being late for a national anthem.Ben Sulayem’s four years in office have been marked by repeated confrontations with drivers and senior officials.

No matter the race, weather, or competition, she always showed up with her best – and the results back it up. A two-time Olympian, winner of the 2018 Boston Marathon,and world record-holder in the 50k, Linden is one of America’s greatest ever distance runners. But like any good thing, her career can’t last for ever.“This will be my last time racing Boston in the professional field,” Linden said a few weeks before this year’s race. Despite countless accolades, Linden wanted her final pro marathon to be about the competition, not a farewell tour that could get in the way of her goal of “leaving it all out there one last time.”A few weeks before her final 26.2, Linden shared how her identity as a pro marathoner is evolving and what may come next – a process that is not easy or straightforward, especially if you’ve been defined by one job for nearly half your life.“It’s time, it’s necessary. I want this to be my last Boston because I want to give it everything,” said Linden. “I want to get to the finish and be like, I suffered all day and never took the easy way out. The end point gives me extra motivation to do it right, to not make excuses or keep running to just cash a check. I feel satisfied, there’s nothing else to achieve.”As to what comes next, Linden isn’t sure, but didn’t want attention on her future to distract from her goal, racing Boston to her best. To stay focused, she kept the news a secret until the morning of the race, sharing her retirement in a full page ad in the Boston Globe. This didn’t make stepping away any easier, though.“Retiring is like having your favorite dog get near the end,” says Linden, “it’s hard to know when to make that call and how to do it with dignity, but I wouldn’t ask someone else to come in and tell me when to put my dog down, so I’m not going to ask anyone when I should stop my professional career.”For Linden, retirement is part of a natural process. “It’s a universal human experience to have things come to an end,” Linden says “but to have had my big moment is incredible. That was really, really special. Some athletes get worried about who they will be once they’re done, but I think maybe not defining ourselves as our careers is a little more healthy.”‘The secret is trusting the process’: Sawe wins London Marathon as Assefa digs inRead moreAs a coffee and bourbon aficionado, podcast host, and New York Times bestselling author, Liden has her hands in many different pots already, so more dabbling seems likely. “Now I can say yes to more things. I’m a runner and always will be, but this step away from professional marathoning will give me more balance. Maybe I will try ultras next.”Linden grew up in San Diego, playing soccer and softball with her older sister, Natalie. Her parents encouraged the pair to spend time outside and “not sit in front of the TV,” says Linden. Her first race was the Junior Carlsbad mile, which she finished before most of the boys, an early barometer for her potential.“I beat a lot of kids who had singlets, shorts, and proper running shoes,” Linden laughed. “My dad sent me out there in sweat pants and I can’t even imagine what kind of shoes.”Linden fell for running quickly, finding purpose and clarity racing the clock and competing for the podium. “Competition was what kept me in the sport for so long. I love testing myself against others and finding out how good I can be,” said Linden.As a high school freshman she ran a sub-five minute mile and was a finalist at the California state meet all four years of high school. She went on to be a two time All-American at Arizona State University, showing potential despite never winning a conference or national championship. Acknowledging a risk of failure, Linden moved to Michigan to try her hand at a pro career.Her first marathon was Boston in 2007, where she placed 19th. A year later she finished fifth at the Chicago Marathon and in 2009 set her personal best by three minutes at the World Championships. She kept improving, notching the top American at Chicago in 2010 before her major breakthrough in 2011, placing second overall by a heartbreaking two seconds at theBoston Marathon.Linden’s consistent progression is easy to map looking backwards, but wasn’t her vision at the time. “The goal is results. Even though many professional athletes tell the outside world that it’s about the process, that’s a lie. I always wanted to win and so do most pros.”Despite her fierce competitiveness, Linden is simultaneously as selfless as pros come. Her bestseller book,Choosing To Run, is dedicated to “everyone who’s brave enough to lace it up and take the first step,” emblematic of her core values. Instead of a biography that waxes poetic about her achievements, the book is an ode to first time runners.“I think about these people a lot,” says Linden. “At this point it’s easy for me to go run because my life is built around running, but to take that first step is so brave. It’s hard and humbling and tough to be a beginner, but I know how great running can be.”Marathoning stands out in that amateurs and pros run the same course on the same day, even if their experiences are quite different. While most amateurs work a full-time job, most pros focus on training and recovery. Being the best marathoner means sacrificing a lot, while resting for the next session.“I don’t like the word sacrifice because it was an intentional choice for me,” says Linden. “In some ways it’s the most cushy job in the world, even if travel and social events are hard, but it’s all worth it when you’ve done everything you can and you didn’t leave anything on the table.”Linden has run at the highest level for nearly two decades without letting outside noise drag her down, because of who she surrounds herself with.“You’ll find lots of people who will tell you why you can’t, or little excuses so you don’t scrap for every second” says Linden. “If you want to reason, you don’t even have to self-sabotage, just ask somebody who doesn’t have your best interest in mind. I was more interested in what I could do. If I failed, at least I would know my limits.”The Boston Marathon is different from the other six Majors due to its course and rules. It passes eight small towns on its way from Hopkinton to Copley Square in the center of Boston, with many of the roads dating back centuries. This brings athletes closer to the crowds, as they run over a series of rolling hills.Also, pacers are not allowed, changing the style of the race. “You don’t train for 26.2, you train for Boston,” says Linden. “You have to be ready for any scenario. It’s less about splits and more about pure racing, with a crescendo as you get into the city and the greatest finishing stretch in the world.”Linden has had her personal ups and downs at Boston, breaking through in 2011 only to scratch before the start in 2013 while recovering from a femur fracture, which forced her to consider early retirement. She refound a love for running and returned, before another low in 2017 when the first super shoes dominated the race.“That crushed me in a really big way,” said Linden. “The shoes took away the core meaning of the sport, the competition. It was immediately clear how much they impacted the results.”The next year, in freezing Nor’easter that forced many athletes to drop out,Linden won. “There have been so many incredible moments in racing history at Boston and I was lucky to put my name in that story. In a small way, I am a part of history,” said Linden.Over the last seven years, the field has gotten deeper and winning times have dropped significantly, while Linden has moved from her prime into the masters division. “The last couple years I’ve lost the pack earlier than I would have liked and still run 2:29, but that’s not competing anymore. I’m not here to go through the motions, I’m here to compete.”This year, Linden covered the first big move and stayed in touch with the lead pack longer, hitting the halfway mark at 1:11 and finishing in 2:26 – the fastest she had completed the course since 2017. With a gutsy last dance, Linden was the first master’s woman and 17th overall, a clear sign that even her best day wasn’t close to the podium. This was a best case scenario – leaving it all other there one last time, while leaving Linden confident she had made the right decision.“I’m going to find the next thing. I want to push myself and if it’s not here, I need to figure out where.” Without all the answers, Linden is excited for the next chapter and the opportunity for “a second prime or a third prime.”“I’m not choosing to stop running,” says Linden. “I’ll keep running and competing, but do it in new ways. Reinventing yourself and finding new challenges is a good thing. I’m choosing to redefine how I run.”Explore more on these topicsMarathonBoston MarathonMarathon runningRunningUS sportsAthleticsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Dubois, the IBF champion, shook his head when asked if his actions had been premeditated. “No, it was just one of them things,” he said.“If you get angry or ­something, it just happens in boxing. I want to put my hands on him properly on the 19th and show everyone.”Dubois said that when Usyk laughed “I didn’t expect that from him. But you know the Ukrainians – they do all this mind work and mind control stuff. But I just need to be right, physically and ­spiritually, and that will be enough on the night.”Usyk’s mental strength is such that even Dubois conceded he will not be able to find a weakness in the ­psychological armour of the WBA, WBC and WBO champion. “But he’s always into psychological warfare,” he said. “I think he’s a boring guy. He’s just at home with his mind shit. It’s all psychological, but when those guys feel the real pain and the heat, then you can break through that.“If you’ve got power on your side, you can do anything. I don’t think he can handle the pain or the heat that I’m going to bring. I’m going to just step up and win.”When Duboischallenged Usyk for his world titlesin August 2023 he struggled initially to match the ringcraft of the Ukrainian master. But the fight changed course ­dramatically when, in the fifth round, Dubois landed a withering punch on the ­beltline that was ruled a low blow. Usyk was in considerable distress as he slumped to the canvas. He was given almost four minutes to recover by the referee who, despite ­considering it an illegal blow, did not deduct a point from Dubois.Usyk was canny enough to weather the turbulent storm that followed and he re-established his authority and dropped Dubois twice before the fight was stopped in the ninth round.View image in fullscreenOleksandr Usyk holds up a ‘Boxing Lesson’ booklet.Photograph: Alex Davidson/Getty Images“I got through with that shot,” Dubois said as he remembered the impact of that borderline blow before Usyk found a way to beat him. “It was like a punch from the gods, though. But that’s in the past now. I’m a man of the future.”When told about that “punch from the gods” comment, Usyk paused for a long time before, in his typically ­languid way, he said: “God bless ­Daniel.

I’ve watched his fights, going back to his amateur days, and he doesn’t like it to the body at all.”Warren predicted that Dubois would break him down with a remorseless body attack and win by knockout.Such talk tickled Usyk. He rocked back in his chair, grinned, and produced a suitably cryptic response: “I do have a weakness, but no one will ever know about this weakness apart from me,” he said. “I will never talk about it because this weakness is ­hidden in an egg and the egg is ­hidden in a dog and the dog is hidden in a safe which is hidden in a dragon. So it’s impossible to find.”Usyk cackled with laughter as the contrast between him and Dubois was made even more obvious. The battle between two such opposites has only just begun.Explore more on these topicsOleksandr UsykBoxingnewsShareReuse this content"

We had high hopes, but no one knew that he would become the player that he is today,” Lynch said in a statement. “George’s leadership, enthusiasm for the game, for his teammates, and the faithful are truly unique and special. He is an outstanding representation for the 49ers on the field and is an outstanding representative for the organization off the field with his investment in the local and military communities. He has a great sense of pride in his role and has put in the work to be one of the best tight ends in theNFL.”The 31-year-old Kittle was entering the final year of a five-year, $75m extension that he signed in 2020. Kittle didn’t show up for the first few days of the team’s voluntary offseason program last week but arrived later in the week in a sign that a deal could get done soon.The $19.1m average annual value of the extension tops the previous record for a tight end of $19m set earlier this offseason when Trey McBride signed an extension with Arizona. The $35m guaranteed to Kittle at the signing of the deal is also the most for any tight end.After having several recent contract negotiations run deep into the summer, causing players like Deebo Samuel, Nick Bosa, Brandon Aiyuk and Trent Williams to miss at least some time in training camp, the Niners got this deal done with Kittle quickly.NFL draft 2025 winners and losers: bold Jags to a very weird Falcons weekendRead moreThey still have one more big contract extension to finalize this offseason: They are in talks with quarterback Brock Purdy about a deal that is expected to pay him more than $50m a year.Kittle has been one of the best all-around tight ends since entering the league; he thrives as a receiver, a blocker and is one of the best at making big plays after the catch.Kittle has been a first or second-team All-Pro five times in eight seasons and has made six Pro Bowls. His four seasons with at least 1,000 yards receiving ranks tied for the second most of all time for a tight end, trailing only the seven for Kansas City’s Travis Kelce.Kittle was a second-team All-Pro last season when he had 78 catches for 1,106 yards and eight TDs. Since being drafted in the fifth round in 2017, Kittle has had 538 catches for 7,380 yards and 45 TDs.

The Panthers described the incident at the time as a “freak accident”. CPR was administered on the ice at the Sheffield Arena, but ­Johnson died from his injuries.Petgrave was put on police bail, but after an 18-month investigation the CPS said it had now closed the case. “This was a shocking and deeply upsetting incident,” said Michael Quinn, the deputy chief crown prosecutor. “The CPS and South Yorkshire police have worked closely together to determine whether any criminal charges should be brought against the other ice hockey player involved.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“Following a thorough police investigation and a comprehensive review of all the evidence by the CPS, we have concluded that there is not a realistic prospect of conviction for any criminal offence and so there will not be a prosecution,” he added.“Our thoughts remain with the family and friends of Adam Johnson.”Johnson had previously played in the National Hockey League, where he made 13 appearances for the Pittsburgh Penguins, before ­moving to Canada and Germany and then switching to the UK to join the Panthers.Although Petgrave has never been named by South Yorkshire police, he went public about his arrest in December 2024, in afundraising appealon the website­CrowdJustice.com, where he has raised more than £18,000. “I am seeking help to cover some of my legal costs whilst I am subject to police bail, as well as additional costs if the matter proceeds to criminal court,” wrote Petgrave. “Any remaining funds will be donated to initiatives that promote safety in hockey.”Ice hockey’s global governing body, the IIHF, has since made neck guards mandatory for all its affiliated leagues from the 2024-25 season. However, they still are not compulsory in the NHL.After Johnson’s death the Panthers also retired his No 47 jersey – the seventh time they have retired a shirt in the club’s history.Explore more on these topicsIce hockeynewsShareReuse this content"

Hmm. Let’s see.Well, it’s only 1-0. There’s that. And this is a significant achievement given Arsenal were basically suffocated in the opening 20 minutes of this semi-final first leg, unable to breathe in their own stadium, stretched thin, starved of air and light by the deep blue machine of the Paris Saint-Germain press.In those moments PSG just seemed to have more players in every sector, to be self replicating, João Neves appearing at the shoulder of every teammate like a ghostly butler. In the process Arsenal’s own aggressive approach was entirely disrupted by PSG’s combination of physical pressure and just making you chase, filling your legs with lactic acid, fogging the brain.There is no shame in this. PSG are a seriously good team, stacked with perfectly-pitched players for Luis Enrique’s system. And they really should be this good, to the extent the opening act of Qatari ownership already feels like a case of mucking about, a Brewster’s Millions approach to team building.Mikel Arteta tells Arsenal players ‘do something special’ to beat PSGRead moreArsenal had never lost in five previous meetings with these opponents. But they also hadn’t played this version, the new, serious, long-hard-look-in-the-mirror iteration. This is a PSG that say, yes, we’re still a project club. But the project here is work, graft, soulfulness, elite humility, like Prince William in shirt sleeves at a homeless shelter.It works too. When they play like this PSG already look like the best team in Europe. Here the most interesting part was the way they took away Arsenal’s own superpower, intensity, work and will, out-Arsenaling Arsenal on their own turf.The Emirates had been a lovely soft place at kick-off, the sky above the lip of the stand a cool powder blue. Hailstones might have worked better. Arteta had called for Big Energy from the home crowd. He always calls for Big Energy. Unless specifically stated otherwise, it is safe to assume Big Energy is required. Here Arteta even appeared on the big screen saying “I need that connection”, coming on like a cross between a world war one recruitment poster and a slightly disturbing dating app reel.Big Energy! In the pre-match huddle Declan Rice was caught on the TV feed saying: “If we don’t have the ball we die.” In the event PSG scored inside four minutes, and it was more a kind of euthanasia, a goal that came from keeping the ball, making Arsenal drift and become a little slack, cue for a swift pass to Ousmane Dembélé, who turned and just kept running, finding no resistance, a relax of air in front of him.The ball was fed to Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, then back to Dembélé, who shot low into the corner. At that point Arsenal had made a total of three passes. Martin Ødegaard, Rice and Mikel Merino were all yet to touch the ball.Rice will be will be criticised for the space Dembélé found. He was doubling up on Kvaratskhelia when he should have held his position. The wrong choice, but still a choice. And there is danger everywhere in these opponents.View image in fullscreenLuis Enrique enjoyed himself on the touchline as PSG dominated the opening exchanges.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe real problem came in the minutes that followed as Rice just couldn’t use his running power from a deeper position, and as PSG’s hyper-drilled midfield made every passing sequence feel like it was being dug out of some unforgiving rock.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is PSG’s superpower now, the pre-drilled swarm whenever possession is lost, a tactic that is impossible unless every player is programmed to carry it out, and which simply wasn’t going to wash while the defining image of the club was Neymar in a leopard fur thong staging his own 72-hour pre-match ice dance disco party inside a palace built entirely from marshmallows.Neves is the embodiment of the new pressure, a player who seems to be always in contact, wound up to a kind of tackle-fever by his manager. Luis Enrique had appeared on his touchline in a de luxe black windcheater and white trainers, looking like the bass player from a seminal New York punk band here to give a talk on male wellbeing. Most disconcerting for Arteta was how much he seemed to be enjoying those early exchanges.PSG aren’t a good team to go 1-0 down to in the fourth minute. They will simply suck the ball away from you. Counterpunches have to be stored away, adrenaline swallowed. Arsenal did get a foothold via the legitimate tactic of loading the ball into the box, and from Myles Lewis-Skelly stepping into midfield and giving what was an outstanding performance in context.Otherwise this was just a night when the stitches began to show. Arsenal missed Gabriel because of course you miss Gabriel and all the football he stops happening. They missed players they never signed, the bullocking central presence who might have headed Bukayo Saka’s cross into the net just before half-time.Mainly they missed Thomas Partey’s ability to break a midfield press, and his related liberating effect on Rice. This isn’t over. PSG have their own frailties. They also have super strengths, a supremely loaded squad and a Big Energy intensity that outmatched Arsenal’s own here.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueArsenalParis Saint-GermainanalysisShareReuse this content"

A decision was taken to change that policy at an SFA board meeting last Thursday and steps including legal and governance compliance are being worked through by the organisation.There are no trans women footballers registered in the women’s game in Scotland and the SFA is understood also to be developing new plans for increasing LGBTQ+ participation.The change comes a week after theUK supreme court ruledthat the term “woman” in the Equality Act refers only to a biological woman. The SFA’s decision is likely to prove controversial, with the supreme court ruling a response to a decision by the Scottish government to extend the definition of “woman” to include trans women. The Scottish first minister, John Swinney, this week urged sporting bodies to wait for guidance from the Equality and Human Rights Commission before revisiting their policies on inclusion.This month, before the supreme court verdict, the English FA confirmed it would continue to allow trans women to play in the women’s game provided they exhibited low levels of testosterone for 12 months. This decision is understood to affect 20 registered transgender players in England, with the FA reserving the right to consult a transgender and nonbinary eligibility committee should there be concerns over eligibility.An FA spokeswoman said on Tuesday: “We are carefully reviewing our policy and taking legal advice.”Explore more on these topicsFootballScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

Last Wednesday, Aluko said Wright “should be aware of” how much punditry work he was doing in women’s football and that it was important “women are not being blocked from having a pathway into broadcasting in the women’s game”.The former England and ­Chelsea forwardissued an apologyon ­Friday on Instagram, to which Wright responded on the same platform on Saturday by sayinghe could not accept it.Ian Wright rejects apology from Eni Aluko after punditry commentsRead moreThe pair have worked together as pundits covering England men’s and women’s matches onITVfor years. An ITV spokesperson said: “Ian’s standing in the sport is beyond question. As one of the UK’s most respected and much-loved footballers and sporting broadcasters, with a career spanning nearly four decades, Ian is an incredible advocate, ally and brilliant broadcaster of women’s football from a grassroots level as well as at the highest international competitions.”ITV’s remark will raise further questions about Aluko’s future in its punditry ranks. The broadcaster has a big summer of football, with exclusive live rights to England men’s World Cup qualifiers in June and joint live rights with the BBC for the Lionesses’ defence of the European Championship in Switzerland the following month.Although ITV has not announced its presenting team for the tournament Wright will be involved, as he was throughout its coverage of the qualifiers.ITV has confirmed Wright will be part of its FA Cup final team next month when his former club Crystal Palace meet Manchester City, 35 years after he came off the bench to score twice for Palace in a 3-3 draw in the final against Manchester United.Aluko wrote in her social media apology to Wright: “It was wrong for Ian’s name to be raised in that conversation, and for that I sincerely apologise. I’ve known and worked with Ian for many years and have nothing but love and respect for him.”Wright’s Instagram post in response was “liked” by several England players, including Alessia Russo, Mary Earps, Lauren Hemp and Alex Greenwood, as well as by the former international turned pundit Izzy Christiansen.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The most decorated player in Real Madrid’s history, a six-time Champions League winner and one of the greatest midfielders of his generation pitching up as a co-owner at a mid-table Championship club was certainly an unforeseen end-of-season development. A Ballon d’Or winner and Bernabéu star walking into the Swansea boardroom or exploring the Mumbles?The sight of Modric cradling a Swansea-branded football in the accompanying press release prompted a few double-takes and sent a jolt across the game. “Hi Swansea fans, I’mLuka Modricand I’m excited to be part of the journey,” came his message.The 39-year-old Croatia captain is in the twilight of his career, but Swansea hope those words mark just the start of his involvement. “My goal is to support the club’s growth in a positive way and to help to build an exciting future.”How did it happen?Swansea’s US-based owners put the feelers out with the aim of adding a high-profile investor and Modric, via his long-term agent, Borja Couce, made clear it was an opportunity he was keen to pursue as he began to think about retirement. For Swansea, it was a no-brainer before even thinking about tapping into his knowledge and commercial pulling power. Conversations ramped up before Christmas after Brett Cravatt, one of Swansea’s controlling owners, who is based in Los Angeles, met Modric’s adviser via a mutual contact.Swansea’s hierarchy have been to Madrid to meet Modric and his team, and Couce attended Swansea’s victory over Middlesbrough in March and spent a couple of days in south Wales, shown around the Fairwood training base and the surrounding area by the director of football, Richard Montague, and chief executive, Tom Gorringe. The deal was agreed long before it was announced this month, with all parties mindful of timing. Modric’s shareholding has not been disclosed, but it is understood to be similar to the seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady’s 3.3% stake at Birmingham, who Swansea will face in the second tier next season.Why Swansea?Modric was taken by the idea of pushing Swansea forward. He has an awareness of the club from his time in the Premier League – he twice played against Swansea for Tottenham in 2011‑12 – and an understanding of the club’s identity. He has been staying abreast of recent Swansea matches, tuning into games and even discussing the strength of the opposition. Madrid’s next match is against Celta Vigo on Sunday, giving Modric scope to watch Swansea’s final game of the season, Saturday’s meeting with Oxford. The fact Modric played with the long-serving Swansea defender Kyle Naughton at Spurs had no bearing.View image in fullscreenLuka Modric played for Spurs against Swansea in 2011.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/ReutersHow involved will he be?For now, not very. Modric’s immediate priority is on finishing the season with Real, a fifth La Liga title and a 29th trophy with the club in his sights. He is out of contract this summer, but could sign another 12-month extension, as he has in recent years, to take him past his 40th birthday. His intention is carry on playing at least until the 2026 World Cup. Modric is not one for the limelight and he and Swansea want to remain respectful to Real.He is, however, keen to open his eyes and ears to the business of the game, already taking an interest in the operation of the club, including revenues and strategy. Swansea have shared detailed numbers in terms of their business model and structure. Perhaps most significantly he has volunteered to have conversations with potential Swansea signings – a useful sales pitch this summer?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionWhat happens next?There is naturally a keenness from everybody of a Swansea persuasion to see Modric in south Wales. At some point in the next few months he is expected to visit but the ownership’s first priority is finalising their next head coach. Swansea have spoken to several candidates about succeeding Luke Williams, but in recent weeks have pressed ahead with plans to give the caretaker manager, Alan Sheehan, who joined as an assistant to Michael Duff two years ago, the role on a permanent basis. The 38-year-old former Luton midfielder, who has won five of his seven matches in interim charge this season, expects talks on a long-term contract to conclude this week. Modric’s investment means he and his kids are kitted out with Swansea shirts.Is this becoming a trend?The words of Cristiano Ronaldo, Modric’s former Real teammate, spring to mind: “If I can be a club owner, why would I be a manager, sporting director or CEO?” Kylian Mbappé, a current teammate, bought 80% of Ligue 2 club Caen last year, and David Beckham (Inter Miami), Didier Drogba (Phoenix Rising), Paolo Maldini (Miami FC) and Gary Neville (Salford City) are among the former high-profile players to have acquired stakes in clubs.Modric’s first step into football ownership feels closer to Brady’s involvement at Birmingham or the Hollywood actor Michael B Jordan’s association with Bournemouth. Jordan’s presence as a minority owner is a key marketing driver – he designed a special-edition kit last year. News of Modric’s involvement with Swansea caused an instant rise in followers on the club’s social media channels and the commercial pluses of a deal of this kind should not be overlooked. For example, Modric has 37.2m Instagram followers, more than most Premier League clubs.Explore more on these topicsSwansea CityLuka ModricReal MadridexplainersShareReuse this content"

After shocking revelations made by Shiva “Star” Nzigou – a former striker who played for the French club Nantes and won 24 caps – that a network of paedophiles had been operating in the country for more than two decades, the president of theGabonfootball association (Fegafoot) since 2014 felt obliged to comment.“Before Shiva Star Nzigou’s statements, we knew that in Gabon there were similar signs and other indications,” Mounguengui said. “In the past, without naming names, we had people in certain clubs and sports venues who were hired to coach young people, but the education of a child begins at the grassroots. If they are deformed at the root, it is sometimes difficult to straighten them out. If we can have adults [coaches] of good moral character, I think it’s possible to stem this phenomenon.”It does not reflect well on Mounguengui’s comments that in March, more than six years on, Fifa handed Patrick Assoumou Eyi, the former head coach of Gabon’s under-17 team,a lifetime banfrom football after an investigation into complaints that he sexually abused boys over a 15-year period that ended in 2021.Aninvestigationin 2021 detailed allegations that Eyi, known as “Capello”, would lure alleged victims to his home, which he called the “Garden of Eden”, and that he provided boys for other senior figures in football to abuse. Those senior figures remain at large. The international players’ union Fifpro and several of the alleged victims have warned that Eyi was just the tip of the iceberg. Eyi has admitted to charges of raping, grooming and exploiting players.“Capello isn’t the only predator in Gabonese football,” says Brice Makaya,a former player who was assistant coach to the under-17s. “I still don’t get why some people have not been banned. They need to be brought to justice and banned from football.”Mounguengui remains under investigation byFifaover claims that he failed to report alleged sexual abuse to the Gabonese authorities. He is also awaiting trial in Gabon after spending almost six months in police custody in 2022 and could face up to three years in prison if found guilty of not reporting the abuse to the Gabonese authorities. There is no suggestion he has been accused of sexual abuse and Mounguengui has denied the allegations made against him and said appropriate action was taken as soon as allegations of sexual abuse in Gabonese football were made public. Parfait Ndong, a former Gabon defender who says that he has received death threats after speaking publicly about the alleged abuse in the game, has called on Fifa to suspend Mounguengui immediately.View image in fullscreenPierre-Alain Mounguengui, the president of the Gabon football association.Photograph: FegafootFifa has yet to act on anindependent investigator’s recommendationin 2023 that he should be suspended immediately. The governing body said last year it was continuing to investigate and rejected any claim that it was not acting on allegations or information. It can be revealed that Fifa is looking into comments made by Mounguengui in November 2023 when he suggested the investigation into Eyi had been part of a plot to destabilise his presidency after he was re-elected for a third term in April 2022 – a few days before Mounguengui was arrested.“It always coincides with the federation’s election,” he said at another press conference. “Here we are no longer in 2018 – between 2018 and 2021 nothing was said. And then afterwards, a ‘Capello’ affair is brought up. People were used to give testimonies … these are the artificial scandals just to hinder Mounguengui’s candidacy.”Mounguengui, a former international referee who was elected as a vice-president of the Confederation of African Football last week having served on its executive committee from February 2018 until last year, did not respond to questions asking him to explain his comments. A Fifa spokesperson said that, as part of a general policy covering its independent Ethics Committee, they could not comment on whether investigations were under way into alleged cases.“Our younger generations need to play in a safe environment,” Ndong said. “I’ve made this promise to myself, my kids and all the players I coached. We’re going till the end of this process but sometimes it’s very hard … I hoped Fifa could help us in order to clean our football from sexual abuses.

It is the heads at the top that should be rolling.”Fifpro has saidthe case “illustrates the systemic nature of this grave problem, where an individual may be sanctioned, but the same governance system that allowed it to occur in the first place remains. Under the current system, national and international football authorities mutually protect each other to the detriment of players.”Remy Ebanega, president of the Gabonese player union, said players had experienced “horrific abuse” and that he expected “a full review of the Gabonese FA’s suitability to govern football in Gabon”.It is understood that the police have dropped charges of sexual abuse against Orphee Mickala which were brought against him in respect of his work at the Libreville club Tout Puissant Akwembé. He is back working in football at a junior club. Fifa’s ethics committee has not announced the outcome of its investigations against Triphel Mabicka from Moussavou FC, who was provisionally suspended for 90 days in May 2022 after being accused of sexual abuse. He has subsequently been charged with rape and sexual abuse of minors and pleaded guilty. The ethics committee is understood still to be investigating other individuals over alleged sexual abuse in Gabon.Explore more on these topicsFootballFifaGabonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Arsenal were disappointing in defeat, going behind early on and squandering good chances to equalise. But Arteta emphasised the “small ­margins” that would decide this tie, and urged his side to put in an improved display next Wednesday.“I don’t know the percentage, but we have a lot of chances to be in that final,” Arteta said. “The time to do it is going to be in Paris. We are at half-time. My message is exactly the same as when we beat Real Madrid at home 3-0. We have to go to Paris and win the game and we are more than capable of doing it. You have two teams where the margins are so small.Ousmane Dembélé, last matinee idol in Paris, finally delivers on big stageRead more“I think we need to be better. We know that there was not that much in it. It could have gone either way and we need to pull things to our side. We needed to be a little bit more ­accurate, but we have whetted our appetite and we want to go to Paris and do what we need to do. If you want to win theChampions Leaguefinal, you have to do something special, and now we have to do something special in Paris.”Arteta revealed he made a tactical tweak after around 20 minutes that redressed the balance of the game after a dominant opening period forParis Saint-Germain, although he was coy on what it actually was.“It was an issue with the ball,” he said, “and if you don’t correct that the midfield has to come back. It was something that was very ­specific and very ­important, and we ­corrected it. This is the difference in the ­Champions League, the margins are so small.”The PSG manager, Luis Enrique, offered a similar analysis, declaring himself satisfied with the win but promising more hard work and ­suffering next week. “Mission ­accomplished this evening, but we could have come out with a draw and it would have been fine as well,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With Dimitrov leading 6-4, 5-4 in Manolo Santana Stadium, both players were sent off the court as it became clear that Monday’s power outage that left Spain and Portugal without electricity would force the tournament to suspend all matches for the day. For Fearnley, this meant he had over 24 hours to ponder how exactly that crucial service game would pan out: “It’s impossible not to overthink it,” he said.After about 10 hours without ­electricity and mobile internet for most people in Madrid, power to homes and phones returned late on Monday night, prompting cheers in the streets. At the Caja Mágica, which is situated in the southern neighbourhood of San Fermín, power returned at around 8am on Tuesday, just enough time for play to resume at noon. In the end, Fearnley managed to avoid the worst case scenario – immediately losing his service game upon the restart – but he never quite settled down. His superb run from qualifying, which included a first career top-20 win against Tomas Machac in just his second clay-court event, ended with a hard fought 6-4, 7-6 (3) defeat by Dimitrov: “I was pleased with the way I handled the situation. Maybe I played that game a little bit too much in my head, and didn’t really think about if I was actually capable of ­winning the second set,” he said.Across the tournament grounds, nobody will forget the day the lights went out. Frances Tiafoe was waiting patiently for his match in the player restaurant. “We were thinking it’s gonna be like a 30-minute, hour thing,” he said. “[Tournament staff] were putting candles on our table and [it was] like: ‘Oh, now the whole ofSpainis out of power.’ [I responded:] ‘OK, that’s cool.’ They put another candle on the table: ‘France is out of power too.’ ‘OK, that’s cool.’ Then: ‘Italy’s out of power.’ I’m like: ‘Well, stop putting candles on the table.’”View image in fullscreenFrances Tiafoe said he would tell his grandchildren about the events in Madrid.Photograph: Julian Finney/Getty ImagesSince some players were not scheduled until much later, not everyone had yet made the trip to Madrid. Alex de Minaur took several leisurely walks during the day and opted not to travel to the tournament. Jack Draper, who reached the fourth round with a retirement win against Matteo Berrettini after taking the first set 7-6 (2), had also been out on a ­leisurely walk before his match, which was scheduled for the evening, when the power cut.“I came back to the hotel [and] all of a sudden the lights were off and everything,” he said. “I had to walk up 15 flights of stairs. So I was cramping in the legs, going up there, and then I came down. Took an hour and a half to get here in the car, trained a little bit and went back. Had a sandwich for dinner. It wasn’t that bad, actually, to just take everything off my mind, no phone.”As players attempted to leave the venue after play had been cancelled, the player restaurant and bar area was filled to the brim as players waited for a lift to their hotels, some of which were 15km away. Some opted to walk home, while others waited patiently. ew enjoyed a dinner typical of an athlete: “They still had bread here. So I had a lot of bread,” said Fearnley. Tiafoe, who defeated Alexandre Müller in straight sets, was slightly more blunt: “I ate complete bullshit,” he said. “Just a lot of chocolate.”Most players in Madrid noted that they were simply happy to be in good health and there was no reason to stress: “Honestly, at this point, I just added to the list of random things that have happened that delay a tennis match,” said Madison Keys. “There’s nothing that you can do. So just I took a nap, I laid down, I used my phone while I still had service. Then it stopped working, and I was like: ‘OK, I’ll take another nap.’”For Tiafoe, it is important to look at the glass half -full and to accept the circumstances without complaint. His experience on Monday, however, will also be a source of humour for years to come.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He broke in the fifth game of the first set after Shapovalov double-faulted on break point, and again in the ninth, closing out the set with a love game.The second set went to a tie-break, but De Minaur took that easily to draw level with Carlos Alcaraz with a tour-leading 24th win of the season.“He’s got tremendous firepower from every part of the court, and I had to do my best to neutralise it, and not let him dictate as much as he could,” said De Minaur, who has won all five matches with Shapovalov.De Minaur is now into his fifth consecutive Masters 1000 last-16 and will face Lorenzo Musetti as he seeks his third claycourt quarter-final this season.Grigor Dimitrov also advanced. He had been 6-4 5-4 up against Jacob Fearnley when the power went out with the Briton about to serve to stay in the set.He did so successfully when play resumed but the Bulgarian won the tie-break for a 6-4 7-6 (7-3) victory.Americans Tommy Paul and Frances Tiafoe also won on a morning when there were a few teething problems following the power outage.The 11th-seeded Paul defeated Karen Khachanov 6-3 3-6 6-2, while the 16th-seeded Tiafoe beat Alexandre Muller 6-3 6-3.Teenager Jakub Mensic defeated Alexander Bublik 6-3 6-2 while Britain’s Cameron Norrie was upset by Canada’s Gabriel Diallo 2-6 6-4 6-4.The blackout brought much of Spain and Portugal to a standstill, knocking out subway networks, phone lines, traffic lights and ATM machines.At the Madrid Open players had to eat by candlelight and Brazilian doubles player Fernando Romboli, who is partnering Australia’s John-Patrick Smith, had to be rescued after getting stuck in a lift.Explore more on these topicsAlex de MinaurTennisAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

The trio have 14 world titles between them and few would bet against that number increasing as they continue to cut a swathe through the draw in Sheffield.“There was a big element of [competition] in the early part of our careers,” said O’Sullivan. “If one did well the others wanted to do better. John was the first to win a world championship, then it was Mark, then me. You’re always wanting to keep up with them.“I think that stopped a long time ago. We keep going as it is. I’m not sure how much longer we can keep going on for, though. There are so many young players coming through. I think we just love the game. We love playing, we love competing. Without it, you think, what would I do with my time? A lot of it is that as well.”O’Sullivan found it all too easy to build up a commanding lead over Si, who showed few signs of the form that had swept him to the semi-finals on his Crucible debut two years ago. Si did fashion a century to pull level at 1-1 and rallied again from 4-1 down, but a missed black off its spot when he stood on the verge of reducing the deficit to a single frame cost him dearly, as O’Sullivan cleared up and finished the session with a quickfire 121 to put himself firmly in control.Higgins and Williams, who number seven world titles between them, are taking part in the oldest last-eight clash since Eddie Charlton beat a 65-year-old Fred Davis in 1979. Higgins, whose 50th birthday is two weeks after this year’s final, led 5-3 at the end of the first session.But Williams, who turned 50 in March, had claimed the last two frames, including a break of 104, and the Welshman went on to take four of the first five when the action resumed to move ahead, opening with a run of 92. Scotland’s Higgins subsequently hit back, claiming the next two frames, before Williams claimed the final one of the evening to bring the match back all square.Former champion Luca Brecel clung on to Judd Trump’s coat-tails by winning the last two frames of the opening session – including a break of 128 – to reduce the deficit to 5-3 in their last-eight contest. Trump fired consecutive breaks of 106 and 110 in the fourth and fifth frames, moving him within one of matching Neil Robertson’s record of 103 centuries in a single season.Zhao Xintong is one frame away from the semi-finals as he dominated the first two sessions of his clash with fellow qualifier Chris Wakelin. The Chinese player, who is playing as an amateur as he continues his comeback from a 20-month ban for involvement in a betting scandal, was 6-2 up after the first and ended the second 12-4 ahead.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The RFU chief executive, Bill Sweeney, revealed that there is the possibility of expanding for the start of next season.Relegation would be officially done away with, however. No side has been demoted since Saracens had it forced upon them for salary cap breaches in 2020 and though there was the potential for a playoff between the side who finished bottom of the Premiership and top of the Championship this summer, only Doncaster met the necessary criteria and they are out of the second tier title race.RFU opens door to hosting Chelsea if they need temporary homeRead moreStating the case for an expansion league, this week Sweeney said: “The old traditional one-up, one-down promotion and relegation system doesn’t currently work in England.” He added: “We need to get new investment into the game.”Newcastle are bottom of the Premiership and may require a loan from the other top-flight clubs in order to ensure their place next season in the latest example of a club in jeopardy. In 2022,Worcester and Wasps went bustwhile London Irish and Championship side Jersey met the same fate a year later. Dowson believes removing relegation would encourage more investment into the game.“My concern is more the financial stability of the clubs and the unions,” said Dowson, who played for Worcester and Newcastle, who have both played in the Championship in the last 10 years. “Every single financial report is on huge losses.Australia lost $36m, the RFU lost £35m, Gloucester lost X, Bath lost X, Saints lost X. [Former chief executive Mark Darbon] last year said we’d lost £1.7m. He said that’s good, we were forecast to lose £2.7m. Rugby is nuts. That’s what frightens me, I feel like we’re sleepwalking into more Jerseys, more London Irishs, more Worcesters – it frightens me.“If you can get a model where people are a bit more confident in investing money because we can either run it as a sport or run it as a business and we’ve got to start thinking about the financial implications of relegation and it puts people off. You look at football, the last three clubs who got promoted got relegated, that’s a huge factor there.”View image in fullscreenGeorge Furbank has been ruled out of Northampton’s Champions Cup semi-final against Leinster.Photograph: Ashley Western/Colorsport/REX/ShutterstockAsked if that outweighs the ideals behind promotion and relegation, Dowson added: “It would be great if you could get to that point. But in the short term we’re putting fingers in holes, trying to make sure ends meet and it worries me.”Meanwhile, George Furbank’s hopes of being named in this summer’s British & Irish Lions squad have been dealt a blow with Dowson confirming the fullback will miss Northampton’s Champions Cup semi-final against Leinster in Dublin on Saturday.Furbank missed the Six Nations with a broken arm before making his comeback in Northampton’s quarter-final against Castres this month. He impressed after coming on after just three minutes, but was seen in obvious pain, replaced before full-time and may not appear again this season.Andy Farrell names his Lions squad next Thursday for the summer tour of Australia while England face July Tests against Argentina and the US. Dowson added: “George won’t play this weekend. He’s struggling to get over that arm break and getting back into contact is hard for him. It’s week by week really. He’s not a soft lad but it’s clearly very painful and we don’t want to make it any worse. I couldn’t tell you what’s going to happen [with the summer tours]. I’ve asked the physio about 485 times if he can play and the physio has said no every time. I’ll ask again next week.”Explore more on these topicsNorthamptonRugby Football UnionPremiershipRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

A quintessentially American event, defined by hopes and dreams being on public display while teams trade players into the professional leagues without their explicit input, was scrapped by a collective bargaining agreement negotiated between theNWSLand the NWSL Players Association in August.In so doing, a league unafraid of reinvention became the first major professional sports league in the United States to forgo the draft. That’s a seismic shift by any measure, and while the move puts the NWSL in line with global football standards the long-term implications will take much longer to assess. After all, the draft was not simply an entertaining way to distribute talent while introducing them to the public on a celebratory stage; it was also a useful means of ensuring parity in a league proud of its competitiveness. In the words of the NWSL’s commissioner, Jessica Berman: “There actually is nothing to point to as a case study of how to make this transition, because there is no league that has gone from a world of a draft and having years of service, to being able to earn free agency and just having that melt away overnight.”Berman has emphasised that in scrapping the draft, the league was in part motivated to meet global standards in the game surrounding recruitment and free agency in order to attract, or retain, the world’s elite talent. In aninterview with The Guardianin August, she noted: “It was really clear that there is a global labour market for talent, and it was also clear that we weren’t operating in ways consistent with global standards around player movement in particular, and player agency.”Quietly, or so it seems compared to the adrenaline rush and media blitz of a draft night, former collegiate athletes have spread out across the country, signing for clubs by mutual consent as free agents. The breadth of their impact varies by team and player, but notable members of this historic new rookie class have undeniably begun to make their mark. For instance, Duke University alumna Maggie Graham, a 22-year-old raised in Atlanta, collected the year’s first rookie of the month after a blistering debut for Houston Dash. Graham is the first collegiate player to sign for the Dash in the post-draft era and scored back-to-back goals in her first two games in NWSL, becoming only the third rookie to do so.View image in fullscreenAlyssa Thompson breaks away for the USA against Brazil earlier this month.Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty ImagesAngel City FC were undefeated in their first four games of the season, thanks in large part to a squad rife with young talent. That includes the Thompson sisters: 19-year-old Gisele and 20-year-old Alyssa, both of whom signed for ACFC straight out of high school, in addition to 18-year-old Kennedy Fuller, who signed as a 16-year-old through the under-18 entry mechanism, as well as a cadre of collegiate players who turned professional in the post-draft era. One of Angel City’s notable rookies is 22-year-old New Jersey native and Rutgers graduate Riley Tiernan, who has scored three goals for the LA club and is their joint top-corer alongside Alyssa Thompson.Maddie Dahlien has turned heads with Seattle Reign after signing for Laura Harvey’s squad directly from the University of North Carolina, where the 20-year-old helped the Tar Heels to their 23rd NCAA National Championship in her third season there. Dahlien has made an impact for the United States at youth national team levels and took part in Emma Hayes’ Young Futures Camp in January, with her Seattle contract announced the same day as Hayes’ Futures roster. Dahlien scored her first NWSL goal in style, sealing a 1-0 victory in the Battle of Cascadia against Portland Thorns.There has also been a handful of exciting defenders in this year’s rookie class, including Portland Thorns and UCLA graduate Jayden Perry, who signed for the three-time champs on 22 January. Speaking about the player, Thorns head coach, Rob Gale, said: “Jayden has been on our radar for some time now as an exciting young, natural left-footed defender at the college level where she was part of a record breaking defence.” That back-line included 21-year-old Boston-born defender Lilly Reale, who signed for Gotham on 3 January after collecting a cabinet full of trophies at UCLA.We are only six games into a regular 26-game NWSL season and only a few months into NWSL’s first year without the draft. The long-term implications on parity, recruitment structures and much more will take time to come to fruition. For now, the league’s quiet transition into a vastly different era has got off to a solid start, with global standards taking shape and a spate of exciting rookie talent grasping a bold opportunity.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In response, the company haspressured its third-party sellersto shoulder the burden of the extra import costs rather than pass them on to customers. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.“This is another reason why Americans should buy American,” Leavitt continued, though Amazon is headquartered in Seattle.Amazon moved to distance itself from the report, saying the idea had been considered by Amazon Haul, the company’s recently launched low-cost shopping hub, but had been rejected.“The team that runs our ultra-low-cost Amazon Haul store considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products. This was never approved and is not going to happen,” said Tim Doyle, Amazon spokesperson.Online shopping has been upended by Trump’s trade policies. The day before the White House took aim at Amazon, discount retailers Temu and Shein, which ship from China, began displaying 145% “import charges” in customers’ totals to reflect the surcharge on Chinese goods.Asked if the strident statement from the White House signaled a rift between Trump and Bezos, who stepped down as CEO in 2021 and donated $1m to Trump’s inauguration fund earlier this year, Leavitt said: “I will not speak to the president’s relationships withJeff Bezos.”Bezos and Trump endured a strained relationship during the president’s initial run for the White House. During the 2016 campaign, the Amazon founder publicly argued that some of Trump’s rhetoric, including threats to lock up his political opponents, damaged democracy, while Trump accused the tech giant of failing to pay enough taxes.Scrutiny of Trump’s first term by the Washington Post, which is owned by Bezos, angered the US president. He was further infuriated by Bezos’s apparent refusal to intervene. In a bid to pile pressure on Amazon, Trump threatened to block federal aid for the US Postal Service unless it hiked shipping rates for online firms.Since Trump’s return to power, however, Bezos has taken a noticeably different approach to the president. He attended Trump’s inauguration, alongside astring of other big tech founders, and Amazon donated $1m to Trump’s inauguration fund.Days before last November’s presidential election, the Washington Post announced its editorial boardwould not endorse a candidatefor the first time in more than three decades – prompting an exodus of subscribers. Bezos insisted the move was a “principled decision” and claimed that “inadequate planning” had led to the last-minute call.The Post went a step further in February, announcing anoverhaul of the newspaper’s opinion sectionto focus its output “in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets”, Bezos said. The decision angered readers and staff and prompted the resignation of the opinions editor, David Shipley.His actions drew a sharp rebuke from Marty Baron, the highly regarded former editor of the Washington Post, whotold the Guardianthat Bezos’s plan for the newspaper’s opinion section amounted to a “betrayal of the very idea of free expression” that had left him “appalled”.Amazon, meanwhile, is reportedly paying some $40m to license a documentary on the life of the first lady, Melania Trump.Explore more on these topicsAmazonE-commerceTrump tariffsTrump administrationTariffsDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Plus, Musk’s Doge time is up amid abysmal Tesla earningsBlake MontgomeryTue 29 Apr 2025 08.52 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Apr 2025 08.53 EDTShareThe European Union finedAppleandMetahundreds of millions of dollars last week.My colleague Jennifer Rankinreports:The European Commission has finedApple€500m (£429m) and Meta €200m for breaking rules on fair competition and user choice, in the first penalties issued under one of the EU’s landmark internet laws.The fines under the EU Digital Markets Act (DMA), which is intended to ensure fair business practices by tech companies, are likely to provide another flashpoint with Donald Trump’s administration, which has fiercely attacked Europe’s internet regulation.TheTrump administrationwas indeed quick to rebuke the fines: a national security council spokesperson toldPoliticothat the EU’s moves were a “novel form of economic extortion” that “will not be tolerated by the United States”.Interesting, too, is that while the penalties are no small amount of money, their impact likely pales in comparison to the scrutiny the tech companies are facing in the US. Though the EU boasts more robust consumer protections when it comes to tech, the cases against these companies on their home turf, where they have enjoyed great latitude in the past, threaten their core corporate structure, which has been key to integrating their products with one another and creating the walled gardens that have earned them hundreds of billions of dollars.Before Donald Trump ascended to the US presidency a second time, I would have predicted that little regulation of tech giants would emerge from his administration and that if there were any authority that would provide a check on Silicon Valley’s humongous and still growing influence, it would be Europe. That is not the regulatory landscape we find ourselves in, though. The US Department of Justice is engaged in serious pursuit of nearly every major American tech company for alleged monopolistic conduct. The bureau has filed suits against Apple, Amazon, Meta andGooglewithin the past two years. Meta’s trial began two weeks ago and threatens to unwind its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.Most severe – Google faces the consequences of losing two major antitrust cases in quick succession. The US has petitioned a judge to force the nearly $2tn company to divest one of its crown jewels, Chrome, the most popular web browser in the world.The US wields the sharper sword here since the tech giants are headquartered there. Unlike the EU’s fines, the antitrust cases in the US threaten the corporate organization of the tech giants, which, if altered, would redirect the profits and change consumers’ experiences with their products. These massively profitable businesses have rolled over far larger fines like speed bumps – recall when the US Federal Trade CommissionfinedFacebook $5bn for privacy violations, which Mark Zuckerberg mentioned during a few subsequent earnings calls and then never again. Facebook continued operating largely as it did before. The EUfinedGoogle fined €4.3bn in 2018 over Android’s preference for Google search. Apple wasfined€1.8 just last year over music streaming payments.A Chrome-less Google, on the other hand, would make for a less personalized experience of using the internet, I think, perhaps even for my fellow Safari users. YouTube and Google search could draw on less of your history. No other company serves ads in so many corners of the web, so the ads that follow you around would become quite different.Read morehere.Two good essays on techGoodbye, Skype.

The company brought in $19.3bn in revenue, well below Wall Street expectations of $21.45bn. The company reported an earnings per share of 27 cents, also well under investor expectations of 43 cents in earnings per share.Tesla profits also slid 71% to $409m compared with $1.39bn in net income the previous year.The company suffered a 13% drop in vehicle deliveries, making it the company’s worst quarter since 2022. Tesla closed the quarter with 336,681 vehicles delivered.The majority of Musk’s enormous net worth – he remains the world’s richest person despite a nearly$100bn declinein his fortune since the year began – consists of his partial ownership of Tesla. His shares in the company are worth quite a lot less than they were when Trump was inaugurated.During a call with disappointed Wall Street investors after Thursday’s earnings figures, Musk said his work to get the US government’s “financial house in order is mostly done”. “Starting probably next month, May, my time allocation to Doge will drop significantly,”he added. He is scheduled to leave Doge on 30 May, amid a strict130-day capon his service as a special government employee.The statement reminds me of the premature “Mission Accomplished” banner flown by former US president George W Bush soon after the disastrous Iraq war began: a declaration of victory that papers over a tumultuous reality very much still in flux. The success of Musk’s cost-cutting has yet to be determined. Four days before the earnings call, a federal judge in the USblocked his team’s effortsto shutter a top consumer financial protection agency. We do not yet know how much of his scything of the US federal government will remain in place.Read more about Elon MuskElon Musk to pull back in Doge role starting May amid 71% dip in Tesla profitsElon Musk’s xAI accused of pollution over Memphis supercomputerThe wider TechScapeAI images of child sexual abuse getting ‘significantly more realistic’, says watchdogMeta faces Ghana lawsuits over impact of extreme content on moderatorsTrump’s meme coin soars after he asks top 220 holders to dinnerApple ‘aims to source all US iPhones from India’, reducing reliance on ChinaUS food delivery app DoorDash offers to buy UK rival Deliveroo for $3.6bnWhat to do if your phone is lost or stolen: practical steps to restore peace of mindExplore more on these topicsMetaTechScape newsletterAppleTrump administrationEuropean UnionTechnology sectorElon MuskTeslanewslettersShareReuse this content"

This, allied with the Chinese state’s use ofcyber-espionage, makes those cars a source of potential concern. China’s National Intelligence Law of 2017, for instance, states that all organisations and citizens shall “support, assist and cooperate” withnational intelligence efforts.“Chinese law obliges Chinese companies to cooperate with state security, so one has to assume that if a car is capable of spying on you it may be misused to do so,” says Prof Alan Woodward, a computer security expert at the University of Surrey. There is “no evidence” in the public domain to point to use of Chinese vehicles in such a way, he adds.However, experts also wonder if China would risk causing serious damage to a key export sector such as EVs by making it a vector for intelligence gathering. Mobile phones, smart watches and other wearable devices are more likely targets for espionage.What does the UK government say?A government spokesperson would not comment on specific security measures, but said: “Protecting national security is our top priority and we have strict procedures in place to ensure that government sites and information are appropriately protected.”A more detailed statementwas made last monthby the defence minister Lord Coaker, who said the Ministry of Defence (MoD) was “working with other government departments to understand and mitigate any potential threats to national security from vehicles”. He said the work related to all types of vehicle and “not just those manufactured in China”.Referring to ani reportthat the MoD had banned EVs with Chinese components from sensitive sites and military training bases, he said there were “no centrally mandated policy restrictions on the movement of Chinese manufactured vehicles”.However, he said individual defence organisations – a reference to public and private entities – may have stricter EV requirements on certain sites.BYD has been contacted for comment. XPeng said it was “committed to continuously adhering to and complying with the applicable UK and EU privacy laws and regulations”.The SMMT, the trade body for UK carmakers and traders, told the i: “All manufacturers with cars on sale in the UK must adhere to relevant regulations on data privacy, and EVs are no different.“The industry is committed to upholding a high level of customer data protection, including proportionate use of data, including apps and paired mobile phones, which can be removed from cars according to individual manufacturer instructions, giving peace of mind to motorists.”Explore more on these topicsElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsMotoringData and computer securityCybercrimeInternetChinaexplainersShareReuse this content"

Bad weather scrubbed an initial launch attempt on 9 April.Kuiper is arguably Amazon’s biggest bet under way, pitting it against Starlink as well as global telecommunications providers like AT&T and T-Mobile. The company has positioned the service as a boon to rural areas where connectivity is sparse or nonexistent.The mission to deploy the first operational satellites has been delayed more than a year – Amazon once hoped it could launch the inaugural batch in early 2024. The company faces a deadline set by the US Federal Communications Commission to deploy half its constellation, 1,618 satellites, by mid-2026, but its slower start means Amazon is likely to seek an extension, analysts say.Hours or possibly days after the launch, Amazon is expected to publicly confirm initial contact with all of the satellites from its mission operations center in Redmond, Washington. If all goes as planned, the company said it expects to “begin delivering service to customers later this year”.ULA could launch up to five more Kuiper missions this year, the ULA CEO, Tory Bruno, told Reuters in an interview this month. Amazon said in a 2020 FCC filing that it could begin service in some northern and southern regions at 578 satellites, with coverage expanding toward Earth’s equator as the company launches more satellites.The web services and e-commerce giant’s Project Kuiper is an ambitious foray into space, with a late start in a market dominated by SpaceX. But Amazon executives see the company’s deep consumer product experience and established cloud computing business that Kuiper will connect with as an edge over Starlink.Amazon launched two prototype satellites in 2023 in tests it said were successful, before de-orbiting them in 2024. It had been relatively quiet about the program’s development until announcing its first Kuiper launch plans earlier this month.Elon Musk’s SpaceX, with a unique edge as both a satellite operator and launch company with its reusable Falcon 9, has put more than 8,000 Starlink satellites in orbit since 2019, marking its 250th dedicated Starlink launch on Monday. Its deployment pace has hastened to at least one Starlink mission a week, each rocket with roughly two dozen satellites on board to expand the network’s bandwidth and replace outdated satellites.That quick pace has helped Musk’s company amass more than 5 million internet users across 125 countries, upend the global satellite communications market and woo military and intelligence agencies that have sought to use Starlink and its manufacturing line for sensitive national security programs.The Amazon executive chair, Jeff Bezos, has voiced confidence that Kuiper can compete with Starlink, telling Reuters in a January interview “there’s insatiable demand” for internet.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I predict Starlink will continue to be successful, and I predict Kuiper will be successful as well,” he said.“It will be a primarily commercial system, but there will be defense uses for these LEO constellations, no doubt,” he added, referring to low-Earth orbit.Amazon in 2023 revealed its Kuiper consumer terminals, an LP vinyl record-sized antenna that communicates with Kuiper satellites overhead, as well as a smaller terminal whose size it compares to its e-book Kindle device. The company expects to make tens of millions of the devices for under $400 each.Amazon in 2022 booked 83 rocket launches from ULA, France’s Arianespace and Blue Origin, Bezos’s space company, snagging the industry’s biggest-ever launch deal as it prepared to begin Kuiper deployment.Explore more on these topicsAmazonSpaceSpaceXInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

But the combination of the useful tools in the box and an informative, helpful manual means that even beginners will soon find their feet.Once you’ve done your bit – brewing an espresso to the best of your ability – the Bambino Plus is happy to take over. Fill the supplied stainless steel jug with a little milk, place it on the drip tray and submerge the steam wand, then all that’s required is to press one of the little buttons on the machine’s front and wait. The quiet rumble and splutter turn to a rhythmic pulse, and after a minute or so, your jug of cold milk is steamed to a hot, silken froth. Pour the milk into your espresso, and voilà – you’re now a barista. Congratulations. I’ll have a cappuccino, please. No sprinkles.View at CurrysView at AmazonWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreen‘Almost everything you need comes in the box.’Photograph: Sasha MullerThe Bambino Plus’s silver exterior evokes the polished metal of far pricier machines, but its compact footprint tiptoes more daintily on the kitchen surface, making it perfect for slotting in neatly between microwave and food mixer. And its price, while hardly pocket money, puts it firmly in the realms of the affordable runaround when compared with the four- and five-figure tags of turbocharged enthusiast machines.Almost everything you need comes in the box. There’s a stainless steel milk jug, a light plastic tamper, a razor tool for getting the pucks of ground coffee just so. There’s also a little pin mounted on a plastic fob for clearing the steam wand’s nozzles when they inevitably get blocked with dried milk. You get a light metal portafilter, which is helpfully accompanied by a range of baskets for single and double shots.The reason I sayalmosteverything is because the one essential missing is a coffee grinder. I’d recommend something likeKingrinder’s K6 (£99), if you can put up with a hand grinder, orBaratza’s Encore ESP (£159.94), if you can stretch to it. A pair of scales to measure out your dosage of beans would also come in handy. I’d recommend buying some that are accurate to at least 0.1g.Everything you need to make great coffee – and the kit that’s not worth your moneyRead moreThe selection of filter baskets is useful, especially for those just starting out. The single- and double-shot pressurised baskets are ideal if you want to make espresso from supermarket ground coffee: the dual-wall construction aims to increase the brew pressure to create a frothy, richcremafrom coffee that’s neither ground finely enough nor as fresh as it could be. If you do have access to fresh, good-quality coffee and a grinder, then you can use the unpressurised baskets instead. That’s what I’d recommend doing.SpecificationsType:manual espresso machine with automatic milk frothingDimensions:19 x 36 x 30cm (WDH)Water tank:removable 1.9lReplaceable water filter:yesAccessories supplied:54mm portafilter (3 ear),tamper, razor dosing tool, water filter, 480ml milk jug, pressurised baskets (single and double), unpressurised baskets (single and double), cleaning tool, back flush discTime to heat up:6secsTime to steam milk:56secsGrinder included:noNoise:46dB (brew), 59dB (steam)Weight:5.9kgWarranty:two-year repair, replace or refund at Sage’s discretionWhat we loveView image in fullscreenSimple buttons mean the Sage Bambino Plus is easy to use.Photograph: Sasha MullerView at CurrysView at AmazonThe Bambino Plus is easy to get to grips with. The front fascia is simply laid out, with a couple of bigger buttons for pouring single or double shots. There’s a button to start the milk frothing and two smaller buttons to tailor the milk temperature and frothing level – each of which is adjustable through three preset amounts. It doesn’t hurt that the user manual is written to be read and referred to rather than flung immediately into the recycling bin.Around the back, the removable 1.9-litre water tank feels sturdy and clips home with a reassuring thunk. There’s a single ClaroSwiss water filter in the box, which slots into the bottom of the tank and provides up to three months of filtration.Replacement filters cost £14.95.That water is heated by a Thermoblock boiler, which takes only three seconds to heat up, unlike traditional boilers. Turn on the machine, and the buttons flash for a few seconds, then illuminate constantly once the brew temperature is reached. Unlike most sub-£500 machines, that brew temperature is managed by a PID temperature controller to maintain the right degree of heat, crucial for creating a consistently rich, flavourful espresso. There’s even low-pressure pre-infusion, a feature generally found only on pricier machines, which saturates the coffee puck with water for a more even extraction.Pouring a perfect espresso still requires trial and error – par for the course with any manual espresso machine – but Sage’s user manual andcatalogue of YouTube videosmake it as undaunting as possible for beginners. Even if you don’t have accurate scales, the razor tool ensures you don’t overfill the filter baskets, and getting that unctuous texture of espresso – almost slowing to a drip but just barely flowing into the cup – is a fairly simple case of adjusting the grind size and dosage. As with most things, a little patience reaps rewards.Those rewards are uniformly lovely indeed. I tried various medium- and dark-roast beans from my usual roaster,Craft House Coffee, and the Bambino Plus did a good job with all of them. The only potential shortfall is that the preset brew temperature isn’t hot enough to get the best from light roasts, so it’s tricky to get a balanced-tasting shot – they tend towards sourness. If light roasts are your thing, you’ll need to look for a pricier machine with an adjustable brewing temperature.For anyone wondering why they can’t just save a few bob and opt for the standard Sage Bambino instead, well, you can – but I’d advise against it. The Bambino omits the automatic milk frothing and lacks the pressure-relief valve of the Plus. The utility of the latter shouldn’t be underestimated: if you grind so fine that the machine chokes and espresso slows to a drip, the Plus will release that pressure into the drip tray. Do the same on the standard Bambino, and your only option is to remove the portafilter, at which point the pressure will escape suddenly and sneeze coffee grounds and brown water in every direction.Scientia potentia est-presso.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

For instance, pouring a few shots of hot water through the empty pressurised portafilter gets everything nice and hot, making it easier to get consistent-tasting shots. You can use that water to preheat your cups – the top of the Bambino Plus has a ridged area for cups, but it doesn’t get usefully hot enough.If you’re wondering why there isn’t a hot water button for americanos and the like, then you’ll find the answer on page 14 of the manual. Press the single-shot and milk-foam buttons simultaneously, and the steam wand will do exactly that. Frankly, though, a dedicated button wouldn’t have gone amiss – hopefully Sage will add one for the Bambino Plus’s eventual successor.If you’re a fan of fast, hassle-free coffee and you’ve managed to read this far, then I’d still strongly advise that you consider this purchase carefully. The theatrics of grinding, measuring, tamping and brewing are all part of the appeal of manual espresso, but this is still nowhere near as immediate as a capsule or bean-to-cup machine, despite the Bambino Plus’s rapid warmup and automatic milk frothing. I’d keep a less involved brewing method – a cafetiere, AeroPress or perhaps even a basic capsule machine – close to hand for when you want a less involved brewing process.My final quibble is that the price could be more competitive. Pre-pandemic, the Bambino Plus used to retail for about £250 – the price soared during the appliance shortages of lockdown and never came back down. If its current price of £349.95 is too spendy for your liking, then patience will reap rewards: you’ll regularly find it discounted during sale periods.Warranty and repairabilityView image in fullscreenRepairing the most common problems costs between £80 and £120.Photograph: Sasha MullerSage provides a two-year repair or replace warranty against faulty workmanship and materials – as you’d expect, anything deemed to be standard wear and tear isn’t included. If a replacement machine is warranted, it’s worth noting that the original warranty period is not extended.Should issues arise outside the warranty, however, most of us would rather avoid retiring a coffee machine to landfill. I spoke with Radu Bria, the owner ofespressorepairshop.co.uk, a coffee and espresso machine repair business in Stockport, to get his opinion on the Bambino Plus’s repairability.It gets off to a good start: Bria indicated that it was easy to disassemble the machine to access the internal parts, which isn’t always a given on more affordable machines. He did raise that sourcingreplacement partscan take time, as there’s only one official supplier in the UK, and restocking takes several weeks.Going by the Bambino and Bambino Plus machines that pass through his workshop, the most common problems are a faulty solenoid coil, a faulty temperature probe/sensor or a blocked thermojet due to hard water – and repairing these costs from about £80 to £120. If you’re hoping to keep the Bambino Plus brewing beyond its warranty period, it should be possible to maintain it for a good few years. However, when it comes to a blocked thermojet, don’t think that the included filter – or a simple water-filter jug – will prevent limescale. It won’t: you’ll need an under-sink water softener or reverse osmosis filter to achieve that.Sage Bambino Plus: should I buy it?Quibbles aside, the Bambino Plus is quite possibly the most perfect beginner machine. Over the several years that I’ve owned one, it’s been one of my favourites for its ease of use, small footprint and quality brews – and that’s despite a multitude of pricier pretenders having attempted to usurp its place in the kitchen. The only question that remains is whether I really need a fourth cappuccino before lunchtime. Thank heavens there are some decaffeinated beans in the cupboard.View at CurrysView at AmazonSasha Muller is a freelance tech and consumer journalist, avid coffee drinker and craft beer enthusiast with more than two decades of experience in testing products and avoiding deadlines.

The governing party’s Lazarus moment was sparked by a man who was not on the ballot – though he took the chance to reiterate that the country should become the 51st US state, implying thatvoters could then elect him.By then it wasalready clearthat Donald Trump’s threats had backfired. Monday’s result was a clear repudiation of his agenda. For two years, the Conservatives’ Pierre Poilievre looked like a dead cert as the next prime minister, assailing Justin Trudeau’s government on issues including the cost of living, housing and immigration. His partybuilt a 25-point lead. But within four months, Mr Trudeau’s resignation, his warning that Mr Trump’s “51st state” remarks were no joke, and the imposition of swingeing US tariffs, transformed the contest. Mr Poilievre lost his seat. The Liberals are embarking on a fourth term, though this time perhaps as a minority, under Mr Trudeau’s replacement Mark Carney.Mr Trump made Canada’s political and economic sovereignty the central issue. Mr Carney, a member of Mr Trump’s despised global liberal elite, pitched himself as the man for a crisis: an experienced technocrat from outside politics who guided Canada’s central bank through the great recession, and the UK’s through Brexit.Both Mr Poilievre and Mr Trump said that the Conservative leader was not Maga material. But he certainly appeared Maga-adjacent,moving further rightand building an energetic base by embracing culture wars and attacking “wokeism”, pledging “jail not bail” and promising to cut international aid and defund the national broadcaster.His defeat was effected primarily by other parties’ supporters resolving to unite around the Liberals. The leftwing New Democrats lost around two-thirds of their seats, including that of their leader Jagmeet Singh, who has resigned – though they have retained enough to ensure a progressive majority in parliament. TheBloc Québécoissaw a smaller fall, as Mr Trump’s aggression overshadowed separatist aspirations. But Conservative support actually rose. For the first time in almost a century, Canada’s two main parties eachgot over 40% of the vote.Mr Carney has plenty to celebrate, but limited room for manoeuvre over difficult terrain: “President Trump is trying to break us so America can own us,” he warned in his victory speech. He knows that Mr Trump takes advantage of perceived weakness. But the US president also nurses grievances. Mr Carney has promised to work more closely with allies in Europe and Asia. Hisdiplomatic experienceand international contact book will help.The external economic threat and internal cost of living crisis are inseparable. This campaign, thanks to Mr Trump, put the nation centre stage. But as prime minister, Mr Carney will also need to address society, and tackle the kind of underlying problems that have led to the triumph of Mr Trump and like-minded politicians elsewhere. He has promised to double housebuilding and create hundreds of thousands of skilled jobs, and wants to eliminate internal trade barriers. Opponents may well retort that Liberals have had three terms to realise their vision.Other politicians should be cautious about drawing lessons from this very particular contest. Canada faces a unique threat from the US, though it has economic leverage as well as vulnerability. This is, nonetheless, a welcome rebuff to American bellicosity and rejection of rightwing populism.Explore more on these topicsMark CarneyOpinionCanadaDonald TrumpUS politicsRepublicanseditorialsShareReuse this content"

IneptitudeRobert ReichFrom deportations to human rights to the economy, the president’s actions have resulted in mayhem. Here’s a samplingTue 29 Apr 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Apr 2025 14.22 EDTShareSome Democrats fear they’re playing intoDonald Trump’s hands by fighting his mass deportations rather than focusing on his failures on bread-and-butter issues like the cost of living.But it’s not either-or.The theme that unites Trump’s inept handling of deportations, his trampling on human and civil rights, his rejection of the rule of law, his dictatorial centralization of power,andhis utterly inept handling of the economy is theineptnessitself.In his first term, not only did his advisers and cabinet officials put guardrails around his crazier tendencies, but they also provided his first administration a degree of stability and focus. Now, it’s mayhem.A sampling from recent weeks:1. The Pete Hegseth disaster.The defense secretary didn’t just mistakenly share the military’s plans with the editor of the Atlantic; we now know he shared them with asecondSignal group, including his wife, brother and personal lawyer.He’s a walking disaster. John Ullyot, who resigned last week as Pentagon spokesperson, penned anop-ed in Politicothat began: “It’s been a month of total chaos at the Pentagon.” Last Friday, Hegseth fired three of his senior staffers. His chief of staff is leaving. As Ullyot wrote, it’s “very likely” that “even bigger bombshell stories” will come soon. The defense department “is in disarray under Hegseth’s leadership”.It’s not just the defense department. Much of the federal government is in disarray.2. The Harvard debacle.ATrump official isnow claimingthat a letter full of demands about university policy sent to Harvard on 11 April was “unauthorized”. What does this even mean?As Harvard pointed out, the letter “was signed by three federal officials, placed on official letterhead, was sent from the email inbox of a senior federal official and was sent on April 11 as promised. Recipients of such correspondence from the US government – even when it contains sweeping demands that are astonishing in their overreach – do not question its authenticity or seriousness.”Even though it was “unauthorized”, the Trump regime isstanding by the letter, which has now prompted Harvard to sue.3. The tariff travesty.No sooner had Trump imposed “retaliatory” tariffs on almost all of the US’s trading partners – based on a formula that has made no sense to anyone – than the US stock and bond markets began crashing.To stop the selloff, Trump declared a 90-day pause on the retaliatory tariffs but raised his tariffs on China to 145% – causing markets to plummet once again.Presumably to stem the impending economic crisis, he declared anexemptionto the China tariffs for smartphones and computer equipment. By doing so, Trump essentially admitted what he had before denied: that importers and consumers bear the cost of tariffs.Now, Trump is saying that even his China tariffs aren’t really real. Following warnings from Walmart, Target and Home Depot that the tariffs would spike prices, Trump termed the tariffs he imposed on China “very high” and promised they “will come down substantially. But it won’t be zero.”Markets soared on the news. But where in the world are we heading?4. The attack on the Fed chair fiasco.When Trump renewed his attacks on Jerome H Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve – calling him “a major loser” and demanding that the Fed cut interest rates – Trump unnerved already anxious investors who understand the importance of the Fed’s independence and feared that a politicized Fed wouldn’t be able to credibly fight inflation.Then, in another about-face, Trump said on Wednesday he had “no intention” of firing Powell, which also helped lift markets.An economy needs predictability. Investors won’t invest, consumers won’t buy, and producers won’t produce if everything continues to change. But Trump doesn’t think ahead. He responds only to immediate threats and problems.Who’s profiting from all this tumult? Anyone with inside knowledge of what Trump is about to do: most likely, Trump and his family.5. The KilmarÁbrego García calamity.After the Trump regime admitted an “administrative error” in sendingÁbrego Garcíato a brutal Salvadoran torture prison, in violation of a federal court order, Trump then virtually ignored a 9-0 supreme court order to facilitate his return.To the contrary, with cameras rolling in the Oval Office, Trump embraced Nayib Bukele – who governs El Salvador in a permanent state of emergency and has himself imprisoned83,000 people in brutal dungeons, mostly without due process. Trump then speculated about using Bukele’s prisons for “homegrown” (ie, American-born) criminals or dissidents.Meanwhile, after the Trump regime deported another group of immigrants to the Salvadoran prison under a rarely invoked 18th-century wartime law, the supreme courtblocked it from deporting any more peopleunder the measure.6. Ice’s blunderbuss.Further illustrating the chaos of the Trump regime, immigration officials have been detainingUS citizens. One American was held by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) in Arizona for10 daysuntil his relatives produced papers proving his citizenship, because, according to his girlfriend’s aunt, Ice didn’tbelievehe was American.Last week,the Trump regime abruptly took action to restorethe legal status of thousands of international students who had been told in recent weeks that their right to study in the United States had been rescinded, but officials reserved the right to terminate their legal status at any time. What?Freedom depends on the rule of law. The rule of law depends on predictability. Just like Trump’s wildly inconsistent economic policies, his policies on immigration are threatening everyone.7.

This was supposed to be the first big “gotcha” from the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), but as we know now, it was a lie. The US government buys condoms for about 5 cents apiece, which means $50m would buy 1bn condoms or roughly 467 for every resident of Gaza. Besides, according to afederal 2024 report, the US Agency for International Development (USAID) didn’t provide or fund anycondoms in the entire Middle Eastin the 2021, 2022 or 2023 fiscal years.Then there have been the frantic callbacks of fired federal workers, such asup to 350 employees at the National Nuclear Security Administrationwho work on sensitive jobs such as reassembling warheads. Four days after Doge fired them, the agency’s acting director rescinded the firings and asked them back. Similarcallbacks have occurredthroughout the government.Trump and Musk are threatening the safety and security of Americans – for almost no real savings.8. Measles mayhem.As measles breaks out across the country, sickening hundreds and killing at least two children so far, Trump’s secretary for health and human services, Robert F Kennedy Jr, continues toclaimthat the measles vaccine “causes deaths every year … and all the illnesses that measles itself causes, encephalitis and blindness, et cetera”.In fact, the measles vaccine is safe, and its risks are lower than the risks of complications from measles. Most people who get the measles vaccine have no serious problems from it, theCDC says. There have been no documented deaths from the vaccine in healthy, non-immunocompromised people, according to theInfectious Diseases Society of America.Kennedy also says: “We’re always going to have measles, no matter what happens, as the [measles] vaccine wanes very quickly.” In fact, the measles vaccine is highly protective and lasts a lifetime for most people. Two doses of the vaccine are 97% effective against the virus,according to the CDC and medical experts worldwide. The US saw3m to 4m casesa year before the vaccine. Today it’s typically fewer than 200.9. Student debt snafu.After a five-year pause on penalizing borrowers for not making student loan payments, theTrump regime is about to requirehouseholds to resume payments. This could cause credit scores to plunge andslow the economy.Many of the households required to resume paying on their student loans are also struggling with credit card debt at near-record interest rates and high-rate mortgages they thought they would be able to refinance at a lower rate but haven’t. Instead of increasing education department staffing to handle a work surge and clarifying the often shifting rules of its many repayment programs, the Trump regime has done the opposite and cut staff.10.Who’s in charge?In the span of a single week, the IRS hadthree different leaders. Three days after Gary Shapley was named acting commissioner, it was announced that the deputy treasury secretary, Michael Faulkender, would replace Shapley. That wasthe same day, not incidentally, that the IRS cut access to the agency for Doge’s top representative.What happened? The treasury secretary, Scott Bessent,told Trumpthat Musk had evaded him to install Shapley.Meanwhile, the Trump regime is cutting the IRS in half – starting with6,700 layoffsand gutting the division that audits people with excessive wealth. These are the people meant to keep billionaires accountable. Without them, the federal government will not take in billions of dollars owed.At the same time, the trade adviser Peter Navarro has entered into a public spat with Musk, accusing him of not being a “car manufacturer” but a “car assembler” because Tesla relies on parts from around the world. This prompted Musk to call Navarro a “moron” and “dumber than a sack of bricks” in a post on X, later posting that he wanted to “apologize to bricks”.The state department has been torn apart by thefiring of Peter Marocco, the official who was dismantling USAID, by Marco Rubio, the secretary of state. Career officials charged that Marocco, a Maga loyalist, was destroying the agency; Trump’s Maga followers view Marocco’s firing as a sign that Rubio is part of the establishment they want to destroy.Worse yet, Trump hasfired more than a half-dozen national security officialsafter meeting with thefar-right agitator Lara Loomer, who was granted access to the Oval Office and gave Trump a list of officials she deemed disloyal.Bottom line: no one is in charge. Trump is holding court but has the attention span of a fruit fly. This is causing chaos across the federal government, as rival sycophants compete for his limited attention.Incompetence is everywhere. The regime can’t keep military secrets. It can’t maintain financial stability. It can’t protect children from measles. It cannot protect America.While we need to continue to resist Trump’s authoritarianism, we also need to highlight his utter inability to govern America.Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.

Now he’s pulling up the ladder behind himChristopher MarquisFederal funding was critical to Tesla’s survival, yet the Doge boss now derides subsidies as government overreachTue 29 Apr 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Apr 2025 14.10 EDTShare“Pulling up the ladder after you’ve climbed it” refers to a familiar social pattern: achieving success thanks to certain advantages – then working to dismantle those very structures, denying others the same opportunities. Many have cited immigrant Trump voters as an example; some who have benefited from relatively open immigration policies now advocate for stricter border controls and cuts to legal immigration. The American upper middle class have been dubbed “dream hoarders” who, after achieving success, work to keep the bottom 80% down with a variety of subtle barriers, such as legacy college admissions and exclusionary zoning.Few individuals embody ladder-pulling more starkly than Elon Musk. Though he has been lauded as a self-made innovator and visionary entrepreneur, Musk’s empire only exists thanks to the support of massive public investment. Yet as leader of the “department of government efficiency” (Doge), he has directed and overseen the dismantling of the very government programs, regulations and subsidies that enabled his rise.Musk’s companies, particularly Tesla, SpaceX and SolarCity, have benefited from an estimated$38bn in public support, including government loans, tax credits and federal contracts. In 2010, Tesla received a $465m low-interest loan from the Department of Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) program. That funding was critical to keeping Tesla alive – without it,insiderslater told the Washington Post, the company would have gone under. The success of Tesla’s flagship Model S, the expansion of its manufacturing base, and even the illusion of its early profitability were all bolstered by public money.Zero-emission vehicle credits and the $7,500 federal EV tax credit were equally pivotal. Tesla earned billions by selling regulatory credits to legacy automakers struggling to meet emissions standards. In the first nine months of 2024 alone,43% of Tesla’s net income came from these credits. The company also profited from California’s emissions credit system through a scheme involvingphantom battery-swapping infrastructure– credits that provided hundreds of millions in additional income.Despite this, Musk now derides subsidies and regulations as government overreach and has used Doge to slash many of the same types of programs – such as renewable energy incentives and federal climate investments – that once saved his own companies from bankruptcy. These were essential to Tesla’s success, and now he wants to limit other entrepreneurs and businesses from the same opportunities.While Musk claims he aims to eliminate “waste”, his companies continue to benefit from government contracts. SpaceX has received more than$17bn in federal awards since 2015, including lucrative Nasa contracts and taxpayer-funded Starlink deployments in Ukraine. The irony could not be more profound: Musk attacks the legitimacy of public spending even as his empire remains one of its top beneficiaries.The craven self-interest that drives this behavior is particularly on display when considering Musk’s newfound advocacy for policy built on climate denial. Tesla was conceived in the shadow of climate change – and succeeded largely because US federal and state governments treated climate as an emergency. Regulatory frameworks created demand for EVs. Emissions credit markets made Tesla profitable. Yet Musk has now aligned himself with climate deniers like Vivek Ramaswamy and Donald Trump,dismissed environmental, social and governance(ESG) concerns as “the devil”, and supported deregulation plans that could allow polluting industries to ignore environmental rules altogether and make it harder for other EV companies to grow. This is not just hypocrisy – it’s a calculated repositioning: he made his fortune as a climate-focused entrepreneur, and now he aims to protect his personal and political power through climate skepticism.Elon Musk did not succeed in a vacuum. In America, we are inclined to celebrate the heroic individual entrepreneur while ignoring – and even downplaying – that massive public support was the foundation of their success. Consider the iPhone: nearly all of its core technologies, from GPS and touchscreen displays to the internet itself, were publicly funded. Covid vaccines and the pharmaceutical industry, too, have relied heavily on NIH-funded research.And yet, Musk, Steve Jobs and other tech titans are cast as heroic innovators, while the state is derided as inefficient or meddlesome – even as it continues to underwrite the very innovations that fuel the economy. Further, while the risks of developing these innovations are mitigated by public funding, the profits they create are almost entirely privatized. If American taxpayers had taken equity in Tesla for their $465m investment,it is estimatedsuch a stake would be worth over $300bn today. Instead, it is Musk alone who has enjoyed such wealth.To deny that is to erase the role of taxpayers, government scientists and policy architects who built the foundation upon which Tesla, SpaceX and many innovative industries rest. But Musk’s recent efforts – whether gutting climate policy, leading anti-regulatory initiatives, or supporting anti-democratic actors – represent not just a betrayal of that legacy, but a systemic effort to pull up the ladder and rewrite the rules to benefit only himself.Ultimately Musk’s story is a warning: those who climb the ladder with public help are inclined to later destroy the mechanisms that led to their success. For Musk to admit that he had substantial help to become the world’s richest man would undermine the lone genius narrative that has granted him astonishing power with impunity. By pulling up the ladder, “lone geniuses” don’t just block others from the same opportunities, but also undermine the very idea of collective progress and investment in the public good. The outcome will be the erosion of future innovation and, ultimately, a well-functioning society.Christopher Marquis is theSinyi professor of management at the University of Cambridge and author of The Profiteers: How Business Privatizes Profits and Socializes Costs.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskOpinionUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

When I started to answer, she corrected me and said: “No, no, I’m talking about college presidents and law firms. Where the heck are they?”Where indeed? From all observations, most have been asleep as the US president dismantles democracy piece by jeweled piece. They are either cutting sweet little deals on their knees, or just remaining silent as the fruits of 250 years of national labor and life are strangled by Trump’s tentacles. From the cowering of major media companies to the shameful capitulation of some law firms, and oppressive silence from virtually all of them, the nation is sleepwalking into a slow but ever encroaching totalitarian state.As the woman continued her outpouring of anger and grief, I thought of John F Kennedy’s Pulitzer prize-winning book, Why England Slept, his brilliant exposition of why a proud and resilient nation ignored Germany’s mounting threat to their democracy when it was so obvious and imminent. Kennedy recognized the centrality of moments we now face, writing: “Any system of government will work when everything is going well. It’s the system that functions in the pinches that survives.” We are now being pinched by an autocrat who eats laws for breakfast and will not be stopped by any internal restraint.Trump disdains conservatism. His governing philosophy is absolute power | Sidney BlumenthalRead moreWhether our democracy survives to preserve the rule of law depends on so much more than senators and representatives. In a way, they are merely personal reflections of the public’s will. Depending exclusively on their personal commitment to the constitution is a good bet for the party now in the minority, but a sore loser for the majority party, or more accurately, the majority cult. The moment demands so much more than eloquence on the floor of the House and the Senate – it demands full-throated, continuous and united rebellion against the perverse oppression and malignant illegality of this authoritarian in the White House.Unfortunately, we are not seeing the necessary courage, not in the east, not in the west, not in large law firms, not in boardrooms, not in school district superintendents, not in chambers of commerce. The silence is deafening.Where was the united voice of major law firms when Trump maliciouslybegan to target several of them? They were hiding. Where are the concerted voices of college presidents as their colleagues are being hung out to dry? Do they not teach history at these colleges, where any freshman could tell you that the Trump plan is right out of every autocrat’s playbook? First you tame the press, then you tame the colleges, then you tame the law firms so that no one can even get to court, then you eventually ignore the orders of the supreme court.We are well on our way to that final death knell of democracy, as we advance through the first three steps.My motivation to rally for our country is not driven solely by my love for democracy. Like millions of Americans, I see my own family being jeopardized by Trump’s callousness. I have seen first-hand the power of special education teachers to raise the prospects of special needs kids in my clan. I rebel at the Musk-Trump administration’s chainsaw attackeliminating the one agencythat safeguards our kids’ access to special education investments, the US Department of Education. ToElon Musk, the department may be just a bureaucracy – to our family, it is a guardian angel.Is this passivity and lack of resistance understandable? Of course it is. That’s why the old saw “first they come for the … then they come for you” was invented.But we should call upon our college presidents, law firms, leaders of civil society, to get in touch with their responsibility to democracy itself, as well as their own institutions, which surely will end up on the firing line someday if Trump continues to be emboldened by his victims’ servility.Perhaps it is too strong to refer to these organizations as collaborators. Perhaps. But this wholesale timidity and collapse must be considered rank appeasement at best, modest complicity at worst.Kudos toHarvard University,Perkins Coieand others who have stood up, butsome of the finesthigher educational institutions in world history are now ignoring the well-trod path of autocracy in world history. Some of the best and brightest law firms in the nation are nowproviding free legal servicesto the very administration that has broken laws beyond counting the very legal codes the law firms purport to defend.Certainly, these silent aiders and abettors can explain their individual decision making, but their cumulative damage to the very fabric of democracy calls us to heed Benjamin Franklin when he said we must “all hang together, or all hang separately”. Is it asking too much for the college presidents of the US to band together and say this choking of research funds is unacceptable? Are the law firms just too busy to all say they are not going to yield to Trump’s perverse bullying and say what any good lawyer ought to say: “We’ll see you in court”?In fighting Trump’s assaults on democracy, I speak from experience. As the first governor to come out against his Muslim ban, one of the most vocal in speaking out against his Covid negligence, and telling him to his face to stop tweeting and start protecting our children, earning me the honor of being called a “snake”, I know standing up brings the heat. So be it.But my more important experience is decades watching a courageous citizenry force its federal government to change course. In the 50s and 60s, the government was forced to change, thanks in large part to a woman refusing to sit in the back of the bus. In the 70s, the Vietnam war ended only because thousands marched, including myself, proving the ability of committed people, though unelected, to compel change. In the 80s it was private citizens who forced the federal government to start treating HIV patients like humans.Tyrants like Trump always fall – and we can already predict how he will be dethroned | Simon TisdallRead moreIn each of these decades, small acts of defiance led to national change as courage rippled outwards. The benefit of having lived these decades during the American experiment is learning that leaders in civil society who resist should be exalted, joined, and followed.Those who believe that this call to action is an overstatement of the threat understand neither the nature of the tyrant-in-chief nor the slow but inexorable nature of how democracies are lost. I witnessed Trump’s cruelty and lack of empathy as I dealt with him during the Covid pandemic, as he willfully withheld help and then consciously spread misinformation that caused so many needless deaths. Anyone who saw this up close would make the call for resistance I am making today. How can anyone not understand that the refusal to follow the law on January 6 continues in full force today? Why would it stop unless it is made to stop?More importantly, we should listen to the late Justice William O Douglas, who said: “As nightfall does not come at once, neither does oppression. In both instances, there is a twilight when everything remains seemingly unchanged, and it is in such twilight that we all must be most aware of change in the air – however slight – lest we become unwitting victims of the darkness.” It is past time for all our leaders in civil society to wake up, stand up and speak up. We are right in calling them to do so.

We can only guess what’s nextTue 29 Apr 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Apr 2025 13.00 EDTShareIn nearly 100 days on the job, Donald Trump has outlasted Liz Truss and afabled head of lettuce. That’s a fact, not an achievement. Like the hapless British prime minister, the 47th president blazes a trail of wreckage. Chaos is his calling card. If, when and how the carnage ends is anyone’s guess.The US simultaneously wages economic war on its allies and China. Tariffs soar. It’s as if Trump forgot the words “Smoot-Hawley” and “Great Depression”. The president risks higher inflation and a recession for an idealized yesteryear that never quite was. Back on Earth, markets signal potential capital flight and stagflation.Meanwhile, the possibility of China invading Taiwan has moved beyond speculation. The US loses Asia. During his first term, Trump’s team included seasoned China hawks. They grasped the magnitude of the threat Beijing posed to the US. They also understood that resistance necessitated building relationships, steadily and strategically. Not any more.Instead,Peter Navarro, convicted of contempt of Congress, helps his bossshape US trade policy. Together, they damage America’s global standing. Meanwhile Scott Bessent, the treasury secretary, acts like a nine-figure bystander instead of the hedge fund god he once was. Marco Rubio, Trump’s secretary of state, looks like a prisoner in a hostage video.Reality bites. The US dollar sinks while interest rates rise, a phenomenon generally associated with developing-world economies, not with the home of Wall Street and Silicon Valley. Trump brings his own systemic risk.The stock market gyrated downward when he attacked the independence of the Federal Reserve and demanded theouster of its chairman, Jerome Powell. Trump branded him a “major loser” and as “Mr Too Late”. Along the way, Trump jeopardizes the reserve currency status of the US dollar. Russia and China could not have asked for a better friend.Trump also threatens Canada, Denmark and Greenland with invasion or annexation.Backlash from across the border is real. “There is no going back,” the Liberal leader, Mark Carney, concedes. “President Trump is trying to fundamentally restructure the international trading system and, in the process, he’s rupturing the global economy.” Fewer Canadians travel southward. “Elbows up,” a hockey metaphor, morphs into a rallying cry.Trump’s latest tenure is already consequential. Almost daily, the administration takes a sledgehammer to America’s institutions and constitution. When Trump is only left withClarence Thomas and Samuel Alito in his corner, as he was over a planned mass deportation, he has gone too far. By contrast, the Trump appointees Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett knew better.Likewise, when Trump loses J Harvie Wilkinson – a Reagan-appointed appellate judge and staunch conservative – over “due process” concerns, America stands in uncharted territory. “This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear,” Wilkinson wrote.During the 2016 campaign, Paul LePage, then governor of Maine, thought Trump might need to show some “authoritarian power”. Joe Sitt, a major player in New York real estate and an early Trump backer,chimed in: “We don’t have a president. We have a king.”Nine years later, Trump and his minions don’t mind the analogies. The president speaks of deporting US citizens and bludgeons major research universities. Much of his base eagerly nods.Trump’s current cabinet and White House staff are more sycophantic than in his first term. Fewer guardrails inhibit him. Generals John Kelly and HR McMaster no longer inhabit the West Wing. Rather, acolytes, novitiates and lackeys surround him.Loyalty über alles.Peter Hegseth, the current defense secretary, is exhibit A. In 2016 he lambasted Hillary Clinton for her email. “Any security professional, military, government or otherwise, would be fired on the spot … and criminally prosecuted for being so reckless with this kind of information,”he told Fox News.Nine years later, Hegseth shares US war plans with friends and family over less than secure channels and resents the resulting scrutiny.Trump offers his endorsement: “He’s doing a great job.” Or not. John Ullyot, who resigned after serving as a defense department spokesperson,called the situation at the Pentagona “full-blown meltdown”.“It’s been a month of total chaos at the Pentagon,” Ullyot explained. “From leaks of sensitive operational plans to mass firings, the dysfunction is now a major distraction for the president – who deserves better from his senior leadership.”Years back, Steve Bannon, Trump one-time campaign guru and pardon recipient, mused to the author Jeremy Peters that Trump would “end up going down in history as one of the two or three worst presidents ever”.“It’ll be James Buchanan, Donald Trump and Millard Fillmore,”Bannon is quoted as saying, in reference to two presidents of the 1850s who failed to stop the slide to civil war.The other day, Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska confessed to being scared of Trumpian retaliation. “We are all afraid,”she said.“It’s quite a statement. But we are in a time and a place where I certainly have not been here before. And I’ll tell ya, I’m oftentimes very anxious myself about using my voice, because retaliation is real. And that’s not right.”Come 4 July 2026, the US will mark its 250th birthday. By then, Trump will have been in office for almost 18 months. Imagine how much more he will have accomplished. And destroyed.Lloyd Green is an attorney in New York and served in the US Department of Justice from 1990 to 1992Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

At these gatherings I almost always ask a very simple question: is our healthcare system broken? And the answer I always receive is: Yes! The American healthcare system is broken. It is outrageously expensive. It is horrifically cruel.Today, we spend almost twice as much per capita on healthcare as any other country on Earth. According to the most recent data, the United States spends $14,570 per person on healthcare compared with just $5,640 in Japan, $6,023 in the United Kingdom, $6,931 in Australia, $7,013 in Canada and $7,136 in France. And yet, despite our huge expenditures, we remain the only major country on Earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right.This is some of what we must do to reform our dysfunctional healthcare system | Bernie SandersRead moreWhile the insurance companies and drug companies continue to make huge profits, over 85 million Americans are either uninsured or under-insured. The result: some 68,000 people in our country die each year because they can’t afford to go to a doctor when they should, and more than half a million Americans go bankrupt due to medically related debt. In the US today, 42% of cancer patients deplete their entire life savings within the first two years of their diagnosis while one out of every four declared bankruptcy or lost their homes to foreclosure or eviction in 2022.That is insane and unspeakable. Getting cancer in the US should not lead to financial ruin.In terms of life expectancy, we live four years shorter, on average, than people in other wealthy countries, while the typical working-class person in the US lives seven fewer years than the wealthy. We also have the dubious distinction of having, by far, the highest infant mortality rate of any other wealthy country on Earth.As bad as our overall healthcare system is, our primary care system is even worse. Today, tens of millions of people live in communities where they cannot find a doctor, a dentist or a psychologist even when they have insurance, while others have to wait months to get seen. Despite our massive healthcare expenditures, we don’t have enough doctors, dentists, nurses, mental health practitioners, pharmacists or home healthcare workers – and one out of four Americans cannot afford to purchase the medicine their doctors prescribe.For all of these reasons and many more, I am proud to be re-introducing Medicare for All in the Senate. My colleague, the representative Pramila Jayapal, is introducing this same bill in the House.Our legislation would provide comprehensive healthcare coverage to all without out-of-pocket expenses and, unlike the current system, it would provide full freedom of choice regarding healthcare providers.No more insurance premiums, no more deductibles, no more co-payments, no more filling out endless forms and fighting with insurance companies.And comprehensive means the coverage of dental care, vision, hearing aids, prescription drugs and home and community-based healthcare.Importantly, Medicare for All would give Americans the freedom to switch jobs without losing their health insurance. Under our legislation, healthcare becomes a human right, guaranteed to all, and not a job benefit.Would a Medicare-for-all healthcare system be expensive? Yes. But, while providing comprehensive healthcare for all, it would be significantly LESS expensive than our current dysfunctional system because it would eliminate an enormous amount of the bureaucracy, profiteering, administrative costs and misplaced priorities inherent in our current for-profit system. In fact, the congressional budget office has estimated that Medicare for All would save Americans $650bn a year.Under Medicare for All there would no longer be armies of insurance employees billing us, telling us what is covered and what is not covered and hounding us to pay our hospital bills. This simplicity not only substantially reduces administrative costs, but it would make life a lot easier for patients, doctors and nurses who would never again have to fight their way through the nightmare of insurance company bureaucracy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They want to pass a “reconciliation bill” that would decimate Medicaid and throw millions of Americans off the healthcare they have in order to give huge tax breaks to billionaires.Obviously, we must defeat that terrible legislation. But we must do much more. We cannot simply defend the status quo in healthcare and the Affordable Care Act – legislation that has provided massive amounts of corporate welfare to the big insurance companies and big drug companies – while premiums, deductibles, co-payments and the price of medicine has soared.The time is NOW to rethink healthcare in America. The time is NOW to declare that healthcare in our country is a right and not a privilege. The time is NOW to stand up to the greed and power of special interests who make huge profits off of a cruel and broken system. The time is NOW to pass Medicare for All.Enacting Medicare for All would be a transformative moment for our country.It would not only keep people healthier, happier and increase life expectancy, it would be a major step forward in creating a more vibrant democracy.

But in truth, Canada becoming the 51st state wasn’t a prerequisite for Canadians to vote on Trump. It was Trump who set the stakes of this election anyway, beginning almost as soon as he took office. Histhreats against Canada, economic and existential, were the backdrop of this campaign. An unexpected crisis on our doorstep.And now the Liberal party, led by Mark Carney, has won afourth term in office, a result that would have seemed unthinkable just a few months ago, before Trump’s unprecedented intervention.Carney placed this issue at the centre of his campaign, painting himself as a reluctant but competent anti-Trump saviour. “If there’s not a crisis, you wouldn’t be seeing me,” he told supporters during the campaign. Which is only true if you ignore that it was a crisis within the Liberal party itself, languishing under former prime minister Justin Trudeau and heading for an electoral abyss, that gave Carney his chance. But political memories are short, and Trudeau almost immediately seemed like a distant one.For his part, Carney parlayed his central banking experience directly into a message of stoic stability aimed at a country looking for something solid they could lean on with theirraised elbows. It worked – sort of. His victory wasfar from total, and well below the majority figures that some Liberals had been quietly predicting. Into the early hours today, Carney’s Liberals were pacing toward a minority government, even as they captured more than 40% of the vote share.As for the Conservative party, Monday’s results are even more of a mixed bag. No other party in recent memory has seen such a drastic reversal of polling fortune as an election got under way.Up by more than 20 pointsnationally months ago, going into Monday, the Conservatives trailed the Liberals by about three. Unbelievable was certainly one way to describe it,though not literallyby questioning polls, as some supporters did.Amid Monday night’s general chaos of incoming results, the Conservative party leader, Pierre Poilievrelost his own seatto a Liberal opponent. At the same time, his party actually increased its overall seat count in the House of Commons, and it snagged the party’s highest share of the vote since 2011 – also at about 40%.All of which means, despite the loss, Poilievre and his message still resonated with a lot of people. “While many have chosen to place your trust in me, trust in the Liberal party, millions of our fellow citizens wanted a different outcome,” Carney acknowledged early Tuesday morning in an address to supporters. It is indeed something Carney must consider as he looks to help shape Canada’s future.And plenty of issues beyond the border persist – the cost of living and housing, immigration, the climate crisis, healthcare, grocery and telecommunication oligopolies, the Arctic, public sector efficiency, innovation and productivity. To name a few. It may be that Carney will seek to solve these problems in much the same way his predecessors did. But on Tuesday, he hinted at a new approach. “We will need to think big and act bigger,” he said. “We will need to do things previously thought impossible at speeds we haven’t seen in generations.”Take the rather staid issue of highinterprovincial trade barriers, for one – a wonky pet grievance typically limited to the manifestos of the reformist free marketers that’s gone largely unaddressed for much of the past 30 or 40 years. The problem is that, as part of a federation, Canada’s provincial jurisdictions have long been misaligned on regulations, certifications and licensing. This is partly due to differences in need, but also because of inherent protectionism and competition (freedom of movement and goods sounds great until everyone leaves your province for better jobs or buys stuff from somewhere else).For generations, Canadians have more or less accepted the inherent janky-ness of the domestic setup because it has worked well in service of our biggest economic market, the US. Not only has it not mattered that provincial economies have been set up in service to the states directly to their south rather than the other provinces to their east or west – it’s been an advantage. Canada may be a country that runs horizontally across the continent, but its many subsections have been oriented entirely perpendicular to that line.Since January, reducing interprovincial barriers has suddenly become the policy du jour. People bring it up in conversation. More importantly, provinces are talking about it – publicly – more than ever. And Carney has ambitiously pledged to have the whole thing sortedby 1 July, Canada Day. It’s the kind of thing that would significantly alter the way Canada functions, and it speaks to the question Carney must now help Canadians answer. That is: what might Canada be if we were to define ourselves entirely on our own terms? If Trump is responsible for permanently reorienting anything, it will be this: Canada’s sense of self-determination. Canada may not be “broken”, as Poilievre once declared. Carney’s job now is nothing short of helping Canada ensure that it can’t, or won’t, ever be.Colin Horgan is a Toronto-based writer and a former speechwriter for Justin TrudeauThis piece was updated on 29 April to reflect the fact that the Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, has lost his seatExplore more on these topicsCanadaOpinionMark CarneyAmericasDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

I am hoping he has also unwittingly injected new life into the EU’s struggle to wean itself off overreliance on Washington.A vast network oftradeandaidagreements connects the EU with more than 70 countries. The union could become an important standalone global actor and even thrive in a multipolar world. But it must first shed its Eurocentric worldviews, complacent policymaking anddouble standards.The omens are mixed. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, hasannounced plansto build a “new EU” that can actively shape a different world order. She hasacknowledgedthat the “west as we knew it no longer exists”, and so the EU must get used to a more complex global system.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, advocates for European “strategic autonomy”, and Germany’s new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, although a staunch Atlanticist, says Europe must regain itsindependence from the US. Amid geopolitical chaos, it is good news that there is an increase inpublic supportfor the EU and that many in the global southsee the blocas an important geopolitical actor.But some countries, such as Italy, Hungary, Poland and the three Baltic states, still hanker for life under US protection. Moreover, Brussels has yet to disprove acomplaintabout the EU’s mindset by the Indian foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar. After Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, he said Europe thinks “its problems are the world’s problems, but the world’s problems are not Europe’s problems”.Many in the global southare outraged, for instance, at the EU’s failure to condemn Israel’sgenocide in Gazaeven as it talks up its commitment to human rights in Ukraine. As the South Africa-based academicCarlos Lopes, author of a recent book on EU-Africa relations, told me, the EU retains such a deep-rooted “colonial attitude of superiority that it translates into a sort of patronising charity and altruism”.Yet the EU remains attached to global trade rules, has an economy that is postingmodest growthand an attractive and vibrant single internal market. The time is right for an upgrade in EU relations with the global south, but the old rules of engagement need an urgent overhaul.Von der Leyen claims the world is “lining up” to find safe business opportunities with a Europe that upholds the rule of law as Trump sows chaos on global markets. But having reported on EU relations with the global south for most of my professional life, it is clear to me that EU policymakers must stop lecturing and start listening. In addition to protecting trade, the EU has a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to re-evaluate its soft-power credentials, which are now tarnished byracism, Islamophobia, antisemitism and attacks on women’s rights and the gay community.View image in fullscreenThe then president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, welcomes Ursula von der Leyen during a G20 event in Bali, November 2022.Photograph: Anadolu/Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesAfter years of negotiations, prospects for new EU free-trade agreements with Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and India appear upbeat. But only if European negotiators heed figures such as the former Indonesian president Joko Widodo when theystand up againstperceived EU coercion and an assumption in Brussels that “my standards are better than yours”. The EU, for instance, has clinched or is pursuing criticalraw-material dealswith resource-rich countries such as Rwanda, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Europe needs to protect its green and digital transition, but these deals risk turning into little more than neocolonial resource grabs: no wonder Indonesia and some African countries arepushing back.Since Trumpdismantled USAid, European activists are also fighting to maintain EU funding for the world’s most fragile nations. But what hope is there when EU governments, including France and Germany, areslashingtheir development budgets.As efforts continue to limit migration to Fortress Europe in all itsharsh manifestations, the EU’s strategy of relying on neighbouring strongmen who are paid to deter migrant crossings is provoking seriousracial strife. Yasmine Akrimi, an expert in Europe-north Africa relations, tells me:“The Tunisian president hasaccused African migrantsof being part of a scheme to change the demographic composition of Tunisia. It is a ‘great replacement’ argument that has never before been heard in north Africa.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But while Hadja Lahbib, the EU’s equality commissioner, is seeking to strengthen women’s rights, no action has been taken so far to revive an important antidiscrimination law that wasabruptly withdrawnearlier this year. The EU’s moral authority has been undermined by Germany and other statescracking downon pro-Palestine protesters.In many ways, Trump provides European policymakers with an opportunity. They have a chance now to revise some of the EU’s more egregious policies and to truly reinvent the bloc as a credible, relevant presence on the global stage.I am confident that stronger EU engagement with the global south could help bring geopolitical stability to an unsettled world. It would also offer a compelling alternative to Trump’s dystopia. But it will require more than von der Leyen’s rhetoric and wishful thinking.Shada Islam is a Brussels-based commentator on EU affairs.

This cycle must endMirza Waheed was born in Srinigar, Kashmir. His novels include Tell Her Everything and The CollaboratorTue 29 Apr 2025 11.27 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Apr 2025 12.08 EDTShareBy all accounts, the26 people killedlast week in a picturesque meadow in Pahalgam in Kashmir were selected for slaughter by the militants on the basis of their religion. We’ve readheart-rending testimonyof how the families watched as the men, almost all Hindu, were shot from close range. These wereunconscionable killings. We’ve also read how Kashmiri tourist guides and pony operators rescued many Indian tourists, at great risk to their own lives.Whether this attack was carried out by Pakistani militants, local Kashmiris, or both, is immaterial to the families of the dead. Their lives are destroyed, along with the Indian state’s carefully constructed facade of normality in the region – a facade sustained by the tourism boom of recent years.We have been here many times before. For nearly four decades, Kashmir has gone through cycles of bloodletting, periods of relative calm, triumphant declarations of normality and wilful conflations of silence with peace – for it to start all over again. In 2019, too, we were told about the return of normality, that the conflict was over. But that image was shattered that February when Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammedattacked a paramilitary convoy, killing 40 Indian soldiers and bringing the two countriesto the brink of war. In many ways, in addition to the three warsthey’ve actually foughtsince 1948, the two countries have always been on the brink of war – they hover around it for periods of time, then come back, arms and rhetoric raised.A generation has grown old with this catastrophic binary, thecost mostly borne by Kashmiris, more than 70,000 of whom have been killed, about 10,000 disappeared, and over 200,000 Kashmiri Pandits (Hindus) displaced since the uprising against Indian rule in 1989, and by Indian citizens killed in bomb blasts or attacks such as the one in Pahalgam. It would be absurd to suggest that violence of this kind emerges from a vacuum, for the origins of lethal violence lie both in our history and politics: in the still-festering wound of partition in 1947 on religious lines and the unresolved nature of the dispute over Kashmir.How has India reacted to attack in Kashmir and why are tensions in region so high?Read moreSince 2018, India has ruled the region directly via a governor appointed by Delhi; the following year Narendra Modi’s government formallyerased Muslim-majority Kashmir’s limited self-rule. Although there’s now an elected chief minister in place, the position has been effectively rendered titular – so defanged that in a high-level security meeting earlier this month, the current incumbent, who is a Kashmiri, was left out. To exercise control over the territory, India maintains a huge military force, estimated to bearound half a million soldiers, both inside Kashmir and on the de-facto border with Pakistan.The people ofKashmirhave had little or no say in their future for as long as I can remember. In seasons of normality, they are allowed a semblance of localised power and an increase in economic activity, but it’s often short-lived, because every few years, the tensions bubbling under the surface burst into the open.Pakistan, which rules the other half of Kashmir, is saddled with multiple problems, mostly emerging from the military’s hubristic hold over power, which has crippled the country economically and politically. Its forever-fledgling democracy was dealt a body blow when the country’s most popular political leader of the last decade, Imran Khan, wassent to prison in 2023rather than being allowed to lead his party in elections the following year.The country’s status as a leveraging player in regional geopolitics has diminished considerably since the US withdrawal from Afghanistan and the Taliban takeover. It is no longer a partner in the “war on terror” because the US has lost interest in that war. For the military to justify its monopoly over the state, it has historically used Kashmir as a chip: Pakistan needs a strong and well-financed army because, one day, we will liberate Kashmir fromIndia. So far, it has failed spectacularly in this mission – it was left watching from the sidelines when a resurgent Hindu nationalist India fully annexed its half of Kashmir.Pakistan accuses Indian agenciesof sponsoring the rising insurgency in Balochistan; in particular, the hijacking inMarch of a train by Baloch militants. India has historically accused Pakistan of arming and sending militants into Kashmir. In the late 80s and early 90s, thousands of Kashmiris went across to Pakistan-administered Kashmir forarms and training.Now, in the wake of the recent attack, the two countries are again close to a dangerous conflagration.I will stop your water, says India. I willsuspend our peace treaty, retorts Pakistan. Kashmiris have never wanted to be a bone of contention between the two states; they have paid a staggeringly steep price for this 75-year relationship of attrition.Internally, Kashmir has never really been normal, despite the narrative push and despite the appearance of normality, scripted elsewhere and executed on the ground through a security-administrative complex. Underneath the quiet, there is growing resentment at what Kashmiris see as their incremental and cumulative dispossession and disempowerment, in the form of newdomicile and land laws, and in the absence of any real representational politics. Human rights activists, journalists and politiciansremain in jailunder harsh anti-terror laws.Nobody is allowed to speak; surveillance is probably at its highest since the start of the armed insurgency in the late 1980s; a previously independent and robust press has almost entirely been forced into a supine, compliant role. Most accounts from Kashmir speak of suppressed anger at the growing powerlessness and the humiliating deprivation of agency. Many Kashmiris talk aboutdham, a quiet, bruising suffocation, with no space to breathe. That all this is fertile ground for militancy is hardly a surprise, whether local or Pakistan-sponsored.Most accounts in the press suggest that a strike by India is imminent, which will most likely be followed by a tit-for-tat response by Pakistan. Though analysts speak of minimum or “managed hostility”, wars have a way of getting out of hand. Tensions can spiral, and the consequences for Kashmir and the subcontinent would be devastating. Despite pressures for a strike for revenge, especially as such a display of power would translate into political capital, India should begin the long-overdue process of consultation with the Kashmiri people; in other words, to go to the heart of the matter. Pakistan should then have no option but to support such an initiative.Far too many people have already perished, in Kashmir, in India and in Pakistan. Rather than exchange fire, as they have done every day since the attack in Pahalgam, and on and off for decades, the countries could do well, for the sake of their peoples and for Kashmiris, to break this cycle of forever war over this earthly paradise.Mirza Waheed was born in Srinigar, Kashmir.

Not so fastNatasha MaySome changes being promoted as part of a ‘detox’ are good advice, but not everything will work for everyone – and some tips could actually be harmfulTue 29 Apr 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Apr 2025 17.41 EDTShareAs a psychologist, Carly Dober’s clients often come in talking about their cortisol levels as the reason things are hard for them.When Dober asks them where they came across that information, the answer is often the online wellness space, where the idea of a “cortisol detox” is promoted as an antidote to stress and exhaustion.Excess amounts of the hormone is also being blamed for everything from increased belly fat to disrupted sleep and the advice to “detox” often involves influencers recommending programs spanning meditation, spending time in the sunshine, changes to diet, ice baths and specific supplements such as ginseng.Shilajit: male influencers claim it boosts testosterone and libido, but what does the science say? | AntiviralRead moreDober says these online influencers advocating a cortisol detox are “hijacking attention” using a medicalised name to give themselves an air of legitimacy that can translate to followers, engagement, money and customers.“It sounds like an easy fix to whatever issues might be happening in your life to target one particular chemical [but] the framing of this as a dangerous chemical is really problematic because it’s necessary,” Dober says.What is cortisol and can you have too much of it?Cortisol is the body’s main stress hormone, produced by the adrenal glands, and your body usually produces the right amount of cortisol to keep you healthy. Prof Creswell Eastman, an endocrinologist and clinical professor of medicine at the University of Sydney, says cortisol is an “essential hormone for life” which regulates blood pressure and the metabolism.Cortisol levels do increase with everyday stresses – and cause blood pressure, heart rate and blood sugar levels to rise with them – but that process is actually protective to help you solve problems and overcome that source of stress, Eastman says.“It’s our physiological response to the flight and fight mechanism, ensuring that we can survive some threat to our wellbeing. That’s why we make cortisol.”If someone’s adrenal glands were to be taken out and they were no longer able to produce the cortisol hormone, when they were confronted with a stress they would not be able to respond to it, he says.The only people who have too much cortisol have the rare Cushing’s disease – when the body makes too much cortisol – or Cushing’s syndrome, which occurs when a person takes too manymedicines that are similar to cortisol, Eastman says. “There’s no way you can detox from that.”“There’s no such thing as detoxing from cortisol excess.”Isn’t stress bad?Dober says “we need a healthy ‘Goldilocks’ amount of stress to thrive and grow and to learn. As humans, we don’t want to have no stress in our lives. It’s not realistic.”Chronic stress, which lasts longer than three months, doesimpact health, wellbeing and immune system, she says.Stress management should be part of people’s everyday self-care, but Dober says the focus on the cortisol levels themselves is unhelpful and there are no ways to quantify them for the average person.She warns some “cortisol detox” tips being given could be harmful, especially when it is assumed the tips will work for everyone. As just one example: cold plunges or cold water immersion therapy can be dangerous for those with pre-existing heart conditions.What do experts recommend instead?Prof Karena Burke, the head of the school of psychology at the University of Wollongong, says “just focusing on cortisol reduction can be problematic, and not having enough is just as problematic as having too much”.“There are aspects of the ‘detox’ process that is really great advice, but honestly the focus people should have is on changes to their lifestyle overall and sustaining those changes over time,” Burke says.“It is possible to ‘feel better’ after two to three weeks on these sorts of programs, but that’s because they also focus on dietary changes, stress management techniques and factors like reducing alcohol, spending time outside in nature and on increasing social connection.”If someone is feeling that they are constantly stressed, they can try techniques such as relaxation, deep breathing and journalling, or increasing their physical activity – walking outside or along the beach is just as good as going to the gym – and working on their sleep hygiene, Burke recommends.It is important to consult a doctor, counsellor, psychologist or another healthcare professional, especially if someone is feeling really stressed or if they are planning major lifestyle changes (including dietary changes). A professional can assist to monitor the impacts and adaptations taking place.Burke says: “We’ve all heard it before, but there are few (if any) quick fixes, and there needs to be an individualised approach taken – that may mean experimenting with different things to see what works best.”Dober says if people have genuine concerns around their cortisol levels, they should see their GP or an endocrinologist, but if we are thinking about general life stress, “trying to learn how to best manage stress at different points of your life can be very, very helpful”.Natasha May is Guardian Australia’s health reporterAntiviralis a fortnightly column that interrogates the evidence behind the health headlines and factchecks popular wellness claimsAsk AntiviralShare your experienceWhat health trend do you want examined?Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

We had no light, no power, no phone signal, not even water in some apartment buildings.Traffic lights were out across the capital. Police officers and volunteers could direct traffic on only a few of the major avenues, but pedestrians still managed to cross the streets, with most drivers stopping or slowing down of their own accord.Not every supermarket was open, but many were still selling food in an orderly manner. People shared tips on which stores were accepting credit cards. At a small bazaar in my neighbourhood, customers were asking how many torches were left so others behind them in the queue could also buy one.Hospitals continued working on backup generators, but non-urgent operations were cancelled. Home care became a major challenge: elderly neighbours had to climb eight or nine flights of stairs in some buildings, mechanical lifts for bedridden patients stopped working and insulin supplies in people’s homes were at risk as fridges lost power.View image in fullscreenA street in Madrid in darkness, 28 April 2025.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesMadrid’s subway was quickly evacuated, but thousands of passengers were stranded for hours in high-speed trains acrossSpain, never reaching their destinations. Drivers queued for fuel in petrol stations, many unable to pay without cash. Some people walked to get home, while others waited it out in bars and outdoor cafes –luckily the outage struck on a warm spring day.As I walked through Madrid, I joined crowds gathered around the few available radios. One driver had parked their car, rolled down the windows and had the radio on loud so others could listen. It made a street in my district one of the best places in the city to follow the news. A group of young people took some chairs out. Many listened attentively. People were worried, but there were laughs too and cheers for the communal radio.At elDiario.es, the Spanish newsroom I work for, breaking news coverage was managed by our teams in the Canary and Balearic Islands, which were unaffected by the outage, and by the deputy editor, who had been sent to Rome to cover the pope’s funeral and the conclave. At around sunset, I finally managed to send a few messages, standing on a street corner in front of a closed bank where the wifi was miraculously still working.View image in fullscreenPeople walk up steps in Lisbon next to an inactive escalator, 28 April 2025.Photograph: Armando França/APWithin about 12 hours, power had been restored to most of Spain, a remarkable turnaround given the severity of the outage. The Iberian blackout showed the resilience of basic services – and for me, the calm with which most people reacted was remarkable.But this extraordinary event has also exposed our many vulnerabilities in a power-dependent and internet-reliant world. Few had conventional radios, offline phone alternatives, or even emergency supplies. Most of us live in small apartments, so stockpiling is uncommon. Above all, we had little idea of where to go in case of an emergency other than home or work. Civil protection infrastructure and preparedness are not part of our collective thinking.I recalled the words of Keir Giles, a defence expert, who told me a few weeks ago in relation to the risks of hybrid war and other emergencies in Europe: “The farther west inEuropeyou go, the less idea people have of where they can go for help, support, shelter, food and evacuation in the event of a crisis.”When the European Commission recently recommended that every household prepare asurvival kit, the typical reaction among Spanish citizens and politicians was laughter and disbelief. The Spanish foreign minister said the kit was a way to “worry citizens needlessly”. Even Spain’s European commissioner, Teresa Ribera, a vice-president of the EU executive, said she was “surprised” by the way the initiative had been introduced.Spain went through an especially brutal Covid pandemic and has endured several big climate-related emergencies, includingsevere flooding in Valenciajust six months ago. But even after these crises, many Spaniards still view emergencies as things that happen elsewhere, in other parts of Europe, to other people in the world.The war at the heart of Europe still feels distant, despite copious evidence of hybrid attacks originating in Russia, including the killing of a former Russian pilotwho had defectedto Spain. Europe’s critical infrastructure must be vulnerable in the current geopolitical climate.It’s still too early to know what caused this historic blackout in the Iberian peninsula. Opposition parties are already attacking the government for supposedly acting too slowly in keeping the public informed or identifying the cause, but this was frankly impossible in such a short timeframe. What is clear is that governments and citizens need to be better prepared for these uncertain and dangerous times. Monday was a jolt; a reminder that civil emergencies don’t just happen to someone else.María Ramírez is a journalist and deputy managing editor of elDiario.es, a news outlet in SpainExplore more on these topicsSpainOpinionEuropeEnergy industrycommentShareReuse this content"

Several weeks ago, along with 17 other colleagues who have also dedicated their lives to Israel’s security and welfare, I made a decision that the future of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state is so under threat that it is not just my responsibility, but obligation, to sound the alarm.The 18 of us took out a full-page advert in two major Israeli broadsheet papers. In it, we made clear that the very fabric of the state of Israel and the values on which it was founded are being eroded. The truth is that our hostages in Gazahave been abandoned in favour of the government’s messianic ideology and by a prime minister inBenjamin Netanyahuwho is desperate to cling to power for his own personal gain. Our government is undermining the democratic functions of the state to shore up and protect its own power. It is forcing us into a perpetual war with no achievable military objectives and which can only result in more loss of life and hatred.And we are not the minority. The overwhelming majority of the Israeli public agree with us –70% believethere needs to be a comprehensive end to the war in return for bringing our hostages home, and an election as soon as possible so that this government can be replaced. Since we took out our advert, we havebeen joined by thousandsof pilots, navy officers, members of the intelligence and reservists, all of whom, in their own letters to the government, have expressed the same sentiments as our advert did.Netanyahu is waging war on Gaza and on us – his ‘enemies within’. It’s the path to autocracy | Aluf BennRead moreConcerned for the future of our beloved country, I supported the publication of our advert in translation in the UK Times newspaper on 17 April. It is no longer enough to keep this discussion solely within the borders of Israel. We need to make sure that our allies abroad understand how grave the danger is. We need our friends from outside Israel to express their support for the Israeli people and not an extremist government committed to unravelling the fabric of the state.This applies to governments who are Israel’s allies and Jewish communities around the world who we regard as our greatest friends. It is for this reason that I and many others embroiled in the struggle for Israel’s future were so pleased to see members of The Board of Deputies of British Jews – the UK Jewish community’s largest representative community body –speak outin solidarity with us and in support of this existential battle we are waging. The 36 individuals who wrote a public letter expressed the exact concerns and sentiments that we have been articulating on the streets, week in, week out.These people are true friends of Israel. It is not easy to speak out and I commend them for their bravery. I know that they will now face a backlash. However, so many of us leading the struggle in Israel wish that more of our friends in the diaspora would follow their lead. To be a supporter of Israel today means to speak out against this extremist government, not to sit on the sidelines in silence or, worse still, conduct a business-as-usual relationship, meeting government officials and presenting an image of a global Jewry united behind the Israeli government.The crisis we are facing is existential. If we cannot build enough momentum to create a course correction, the very existence of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state is under threat. Silence is a show of support for the Israeli government. Punishing and berating friends that speak out is undermining our struggle.I call on our allies – governments and diaspora Jewish communities – to hear the plea of the Israeli public and in particular the hostage families, who are demanding an end to the war and a new dawn for Israel. We all share the same commitment to Israel’s future safety and security, but to be a true friend is to be a friend of the Israeli people – and not its disastrous government.Ami Ayalon is a former director of Israel Security Agency (the Shin Bet) and a former commander-in-chief of Israel’s navyDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Leavers have moved on to the point where only 11%of British votersstill kid themselvesthat it’s turned out brilliantly. It’s remain politicians who had started to look strangely stuck in the past, still frightened of sounding too pro-European in case they somehow woke the monster. But joyfully – now there’s a word I haven’t typed much lately – it looks like something is finally shifting.A youth visa deal with the EU, giving 18- to 30-year-olds a chance towork or study abroadin member states for at least a year, is now on the table after months of ministers furiously insisting it wouldn’t be. It’s not the return of freedom of movement, but it’s the least gen Z deserve: a chance for the kids whose horizons were sowretchedly shrunk by Covidto broaden them and have a few adventures, instead of staying home hunched over their phones. How miserable do you have to be to deny them that?And even for the over-30s it’s strangely exhilarating to hear something other than a terrified, clenched-buttock “no” to any vaguely pro-European proposal, just as it’s a relief to hear Rachel Reeves publicly acknowledge that a good “reset” deal with the EU in May ispotentially biggerthan a trade deal with the US (though for a British car industryfacing a 25% Trump tariff, of course the latter matters).What’s changed? An intriguing new deep dive into Labour leavers’ and Labour-to-Reform switchers’ attitudes to Europe, published this week by theGood Growth Foundationthinktank, underlines both why Labour has been so cautious for so long and why it may now be getting slightly bolder.First the bad news: perhaps partlybecausesome now feel they were conned over Brexit,Labourleavers remain very wary of being fooled again. Though most now see the EU as more trustworthy allies than Trump’s US, that confidence is easily knocked: support for a rapprochement with Europe drops quickly when focus groups are shown the kind of rightwing attack messages – charges of surrender and sellout – that would inevitably follow. They still tend to want the good bits of a deal (cheaper energy, lower food prices) without giving much up in return.But if they’re only slowly warming to Europe, they are clear-eyed about the alternatives: Trump’s US and Putin’s Russia are both seen as greater threats to British interests than terrorism. The most compelling case for a “reset”, according to the Good Growth Foundation’s director Praful Nargund, is therefore not an economic one about closer trade links making us better off – though we would be – but an emotional one about security. In a dangerous world, you huddle closer together, burying past differences. Surprisingly for anyone whoremembers the daysof frothing outrage over a“common EU army”, 47% of Labour leave voters now want “a lot of” cooperation with the EU on defence and security (though they’ll also want to see the British defence industry get access to a new EU fundestablished for re-arming Europe, to help create defence jobs back home).In this new climate of willingness to work with people we trust, a youth mobility deal could be acceptable if numbers were capped and travellers didn’t get free access to services such as the NHS, the Foundation concludes. And though a quarter of Labour-to-Reform switchers still don’t want the European court of justice having powers to enforce any new deal, there are potential fudges around that. If anything, the biggest red line turns out to be granting EU trawlers greater access to our waters, which is puzzling given how tiny the British fishing industry now is. But unpicking that in focus groups, it turns out that what people most fear is losing control. It’s not really about fish but about a sense of keeping what’s ours, not being pushed around. They need to see practical benefits from any EU deal but they also need what they didn’t get from the 2016 remain campaign, which is an understanding of the gut emotionsEuropeevokes and what it symbolises to them. Pitch it right, and there’s a deal to be done.Will Labour’s courage falter at the last minuteif Reform sweeps the boardin this Thursday’s local elections? Maybe, but the price ofnotbeing braver is also becoming clearer. Aseparate analysisthis week from the research group Persuasion UK of where Labour’s now crumbling 2024 vote has gone finds they’re flaking away faster from the left than the right. Even in “red wall” seats, Labour waverers are now three times more likely to switch to the Liberal Democrats and twice as likely to move to the Greens – bothmore explicitly pro-Europeanparties – than to Reform.A deal to let young Europeans travel, plus a bit of realism about a Trump trade deal, isn’t exactly the dramatic pivot back to Europe that some have longed to see. It certainly won’t be enough for militant rejoiners. But remain voters tend to be pragmatic by nature – it’s why we voted remain, for heaven’s sake – and even these baby steps beat years of Labourjumping nervouslyat its own shadow. Like the spring sunshine, maybe this unexpected warmth towards our neighbours won’t last. But if there’s one thing to be learned from living on a cold, rainy island, it’s to enjoy the sun while you can.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPoliticsOpinionBrexitEuropeEuropean UnionYoung peopleLabourForeign policycommentShareReuse this content"

It’s not just that his hardline chickens have come home to roost; it’s the lack of thought and discipline behind his offer to voters.Make no mistake, economic conditions suggest this should be a change-of-government election. A majority think we areheading down the wrong track,cost-of-living pressure is palpable, disappointment at the pace of change is real.Over the summer Dutton had the opportunity to mount a serious challenge with his three core propositions: you have gone backwards under Labor; Albo is a weak leader; theCoalitionare always better economic managers.All he needed was a bit of passion from his troops, pepped with some Trump-inspired culture wars on public servants, marginalised communities and renewables, and it would be all over, Labor consigned to the first one-term government in a century.Instead, Trump dropped his“liberation day” chaosbomb on the world and what seemed like “the vibe” became a vice.Dutton continued to be drawn to easy hits but Jane Hume’swar on work from homebecame his Achilles heel. The subsequent reversal was not just bad policy but also a proof point he wasall over the shop.The backflips and mistakes have piled up though the campaign:measuring the Kirribilli curtains, reversing 40,000jobs cuts, knee-jerk attacks on school curriculumand welcomes to country, verballing the Indonesian president, guaranteeing support for EVs which he was about to take away, sitting mum while his star culture warriordefiantly embraced the Maga creed.Against this messy counterpoint, Albanese has plodded on, not flash but battle-hardened by the difficult 2022 campaign. His has been a disciplined campaign, focused on Labor’s strengths (Medicare) and its long-term plans for renewables and targeted cost-of-living support.Now with just a few days to go, the contrasts appear to have taken root. A second questionin this week’s reportshows that over the campaign’s journey, the vote for Labor has hardened at double the rate among younger voters.Since the election campaign launched in late March, have you become more likely to vote for the following parties or has the election campaign had no impact on your vote?This is where the parallels betweenJohn Howardand his ability to retain power from unlikely positions on multiple occasions through ruthlessly disciplined campaigns take form.First there’s the personal arc: both served long apprenticeships; both had substantial roles as ministers; both saw up close how governments fail when they lose sight of the fundamentals. (Fun fact: Albo entered parliament at the election in which Howard became PM.)As opposition leaders they both offered bipartisan support when they determined it to be in the national interest: Howard backed the Hawke-Keating economic reforms; Albanese chose not to play politics with the pandemic.Like Howard, who Keating belittled as “Little Johnny”, the ongoing attacks for “weakness” by Dutton and his cheer squad have had a real bullying edge to them. Yet by shrugging them off both emerged stronger.Australia’s two-party system is in long-term decline: what does it mean for how we view elections?Read moreAnd like Howard, Albanese didn’t win power through flashy inspiration but via the national rejection of his opponent and a government that had run out of steam.Behind the blandishments of retail politics, both have used their mandate to pursue a bigger picture. Howard took on the unions and upended the tax system to create a nation of shareholders. Albanese too has introduced new work rights, locked in the energy transition to renewables after a decade of inertia and developed an ambitious manufacturing agenda.Most significantly, both recognised that to make change enduring, you need to hold power for multiple terms and that means winning elections.This campaign feels like an amalgam of Howard’s 2001 and 2004 triumphs. In 2001, Howard harnessed anxiety about an external threat of terrorism following 9/11 into a patriotic call for security. In 2004 he homed in on the obvious flaws of his opponent to seize a debate around trust that had been hitherto thrown overboard.Now Albanese is on the verge of becoming the John Howard of his era. While this is a terrible thing to say to about someone who entered politics to “fight Tories”, here’s the thing: a look at the attitudes of voters towards our leaders suggests it might not be the worst thing he’s called this campaign.Since 1972, who have been the best Australian Prime Ministers?Of all the leaders in the last 50 years, Howard is most revered by his side but also respected by his opponents. In fact, Labor voters rate him as a better leader than any prime minister apart from their beloved Bob Hawke and Albo. A surprising number of Greens voters too rate Howard highly.Look at the league table and it is not the flashy or the expansive who are remembered as the best leaders; it’s those who succeed in convincing the people on multiple occasions to trust them with power. Howard then Hawke then daylight.Australia election 2025: interactive map, federal seat explorer and electorates guide – from safe to marginalRead moreAs election day approaches, the final voter choice is crystallising into one between a sober, tradesman-like government seeking to build on the foundations of a solid first term and a chaotic opposition not ready to govern.Stability versus chaos is also an argument that makes majority government feel like a more rational response to the times, notwithstanding the historically high number of voters sending their first preference to a minor party or an independent.There is every chance I’ll wake up Sunday morning with egg on my face – a late surge behind the Dutton Coalition or a line ball free-for-all where both sides are desperately trying to cobble together a working majority.But if election predictions are a fool’s game, the one thing I’ve learned is that the result always feels obvious with the gift of hindsight.On this measure I think the most credible story on Sunday is that Australians weighed up the instability in the world and decided to give Labor the chance of a second term in its own right under a leader who has been too easily underestimated.Peter Lewis is an executive director of Essential, a progressive strategic communications and research company.

Not just the movie, with its clumsily forced narrative beats and whiplash tonal shifts. But also, its title characters, the broken and lonely souls who ditch the colourful costumes and wear their emotions on their sleeves, as if it’s their brand.Havoc review – Tom Hardy’s gonzo gun mayhem misses the pointRead moreThese reluctant heroes, led by Florence Pugh’s Yelena Belova, the troubled sister to Scarlett Johansson’s late Black Widow, are defined by how much they need therapy. They wrestle with themselves more than the bad guys, in a way that’s more pronounced than the most unstable among Marvel’s stable of wisecracking world saviors. They’re endearingly vulnerable, at times devastatingly so, and yet still fun and exciting enough to save Marvel.The globe-dominating franchise, biding its time until the next wave of Avengers movies, has been in desperate need of saving, what with recent misfires like The Marvels and Captain America: Brave New World. And Thunderbolts, which happens to be the best thing to come from the brand since WandaVision (still the high watermark), gets the job done.You would be forgiven if you’re wondering who the hell the Thunderbolts* even are. The title stylized with an asterisk playfully winks at the general air of uncertainty around them. In the comic books, Thunderbolts started out as a series where, in the Avengers absence, villains disguise themselves as heroes. Here they’re a Suicide Squad-like team up consisting of villains and antiheroes, repurposed supporting figures from some of Marvel’s more forgettable movies and TV shows.David Harbour returns as Yelena’s dad Alexei Shostakov aka Red Guardian, who has been slumming it as a limo driver ever since the events in Black Widow, while readily on-call for hero duty. Wyatt Russell’s John Walker, the disgraced Captain American replacement, who was fired after he murdered an unarmed insurgent in The Falcon and The Winter Soldier, also checks in for duty. There’s also Ant-Man and The Wasp’s villain Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen) and, the most popular among them, Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), the former Winter Soldier. He’s all too familiar with the redemption journey the Thunderbolts, all haunted by sins from their past, are embarking on. But this time, the redemption is two-fold. It belongs to Marvel too.I would be remiss not to point out that this franchise has a pretty good track record with B-teams like this. The whole MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) got off the ground with leftovers like Iron Man, Captain America and Thor, after all – when more popular heroes like Spider-Man and the X-Men had been loaned out to other studios. And when these would-be Avengers became the dominant force in entertainment, the Guardians of the Galaxy, complete with a machine gun toting raccoon and a tree voiced by Vin Diesel, came out of left field to grow into fan favourites. It’s as if, when Marvel is unburdened by familiarity and the entitled demands of fans, they can approach something, dare I say, original.OK, maybe original is too much, then and now. Thunderbolts is more like a fresh spin on the familiar Avengers formula, one that, as Pugh inferred in an interview with Empire Magazine, borrows some trendy touches from indie A24 movies. The latter studio is behind Midsommar, the gruesome thriller where Pugh came on hard with the trauma, and Oscar-winner Everything Everywhere All At Once, which casts a large shadow over the plot and climactic action in Thunderbolts.The action, so often imbued with and even led by personality, immediately feels different from its opening frames, which actually boasts captivating aesthetics – a rarity in the Marvel universe. “There is something wrong with me,” are the first words we hear from Pugh’s Yelena, as she teeters over the edge of Merdeka 18, one of the world’s the tallest building. She takes a deep and meaningful breath, as if she’s comfortably embracing death (and this won’t be the first time she does that), before leaping off the ledge.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Marvel Studios. © 2025 MARVEL/PAShe’s not taking her own life, but throwing herself into combat, engaged in impressive acrobatic choreography that’s often shot from a distance or even overhead, as if disembodied, giving us the space to observe its thrills while also reflecting where she’s at emotionally. She’s talking about her feelings while throwing roundhouses. Her dry internal monologue riddled with flip gallows humour that fits the mood, as if she’s detached from those emotions she identifies in comical though not necessarily healthy ways.Her mission is to destroy evidence, covering the tracks for Julia Louis-Dreyfus’s scheming CIA director Valentina Allegra de Fontaine, who Congress has in the hot seat for her questionable tactics. On another such mission, Yelena, along with fellow covert operators Ghost and John Walker, are themselves the targets. They’re sent to take each other out. After a nifty little brawl, they decide, despite their antisocial behaviour, to work together instead.They also happen upon Bob, who Lewis Pullman plays as an undefined mass of anxieties and yearning. He’s a top-secret human guinea pig, genetically engineered with cataclysmic superhuman abilities, which, as you would expect, goes bad. Here, Thunderbolts borrows a little from Josh Trank’s Chronicle, which was also about giving superpowers to someone in crisis.‘I was being a sassy Karen’: Florence Pugh’s skyscraper stunt positions her as the new Tom CruiseRead moreThe eventual showdown between the Thunderbolts and Bob’s supervillain side the Void, who consumes humans in dark shadows, is ambitious if also ungainly, taking place largely in surreal internal spaces that Yelena amusingly dubs “interconnected shame rooms”. The characters battle their emotions, fighting for healing, as the movie tries Everything Everywhere-style to wrestle some theatricality out of all this. That climax makes for an admirable attempt at doing right by the movie’s mental health themes, which Thunderbolts, more often than not, doesn’t earn.It’s already hard to take this stuff seriously in a franchise trying to earn some goodwill as it nudges our attention towards upcoming Avengers movies. Thunderbolts often irritates because the depression and trauma the movie supposedly grapples with so often lives on the surface, like easy characters traits that are spoken out loud or worn like another costume fitting.But if it ultimately works, it’s all due to Pugh, who can wrestle sincerity out of a screenplay (and a franchise) that has so little, capturing a whole emotional arc in just her moments of silence. She’s a superhero performer, easily navigating the tricky balance between cheeky Marvel-brand humour and genuine pathos.Thunderbolts can be messy, sure. Pugh is the kind of star who can thrive in such mess.Thunderbolts is out in US and UK cinemas on 2 May and showing in Australian cinemas nowExplore more on these topicsSuperhero moviesMarvelFlorence PughAction and adventure filmsJulia Louis-DreyfusSebastian StanComics and graphic novelsreviewsShareReuse this content"

But can she attract newcomers while keeping diehards happy? And is she having sleepless nights?Arifa AkbarTue 29 Apr 2025 14.30 EDTShareIndhu Rubasingham is starting her tenure at the National Theatre with a blast of bloody anarchy – of the ancient Greek variety. The opening play in her inaugural programme is a part verse, part spoken-word reworking of The Bacchae, which features orgiastic delirium and violent frenzy as a group of women tear a king to bits.Rubasingham will direct Bacchae (without its definite article) herself. This reimagining of the Euripides drama is the work of first-time playwright Nima Taleghani, better known as an actor (he featured inJamie Lloyd’s rapping Cyrano). There is a certain anarchic spirit to this kicking-off point: Rubasingham is putting a debut writer’s play on the NT’s biggest stage, the Olivier, which has never before showcased a first work.Bacchae’s trailer cuts between the glossy, blood-smeared lips of different members of the female chorus who coolly rap about the terror they have wreaked. “Chewed his face off,” they say, while a pair of lips suck a dismembered thumb as if it were a lollipop. Another trailer, for a forthcoming Hamlet directed by NT deputy artistic director Robert Hastie, shows Hiran Abeysekera as the Dane in dark shades and mischievous grin. “To be or not to be, innit,” he says with a glint. Hamlet is another symbolic choice: it was the first play Laurence Olivier staged when he founded the NT.Rubasingham is sitting cross-legged at one end of a sofa at the NT with Kate Varah, co-chief executive of the theatre with Rubasingham, on the other. Rubasingham thinks Bacchae is an apt way to launch her first season: the play revolves around Dionysus, who is the god of theatre – and the Olivier’s auditorium was architecturally inspired by the amphitheatre at Epidaurus, where The Bacchae was staged in the fifth century BC. “I think it’s an important statement,” she says. “I’m really excited about it. The Bacchae is one of our oldest plays. It harks back to the roots of western theatre, and Nima’s voice, language and skill are so refreshing. It’s contemporary to the point that a dear colleague, when he first read it, went, ‘Do you think you’re cool enough to direct this?’”Young and punkish it may be, but what will the purists say? “Well, The Bacchae has always been about disruption,” says Rubasingham. “It was traditionally staged around festival time so it had an anarchic quality. And if we’re going to do Hamlet, too, we’d better do something interesting, otherwise why would we want to see the play again and again and again?”You do pore over your first show and get angst-riddenIndhu RubasinghamSo far, so bold. Disruption is in fact a key theme of Rubasingham’s first season, alongside celebration, reinvention and internationalism. And music will apparently play a vital part in this programme, with one forthcoming collaboration between Rubasingham and none other than the rapperStormzy. Staging Bacchae in the Olivier is about challenging the idea of what gets played where, she says, and who gets the biggest platform. “For me, new writing sits in all three NT spaces, just as musicals sit in all three. One of the things we’re exploring is musicals in the Dorfman.” To that end, there is an adaptation of the 2014 film Pride,based on a true storyabout the LGBTQ+ community’s support for the 1984 miners’ strike.This does not necessarily herald an erosion of the established boundaries between the NT’s three stages, she says, more that decisions may be made on a case-by-case basis. “Bacchae,” she reflects, “is totally made for the Olivier.”Varah, who has been at the NT since 2022, adds: “It’s the right kind of risk.” She points out the juxtaposition of heritage and renewal in Rubasingham’s programme. “So taking something that has depth, rigour and legibility with an audience, and giving it a completely new take, renews people’s contract with the piece.”Might it also be about getting a different demographic through the doors – especially the longed-for younger generation? “What’s really important,” says Rubasingham, “is that thisNational Theatreis welcoming to the audiences that have loved it for decades, as well as new audiences. I hope it hits that sweet spot in appealing to younger audiences and people who love classical theatre.”View image in fullscreen‘Zadie Smith talking to Chaucer’ … The Wife of Willesden, directed by Rubasingham, at London’s Kiln theatre.Photograph: Marc BrennerShe has even coined a term for her blend of canonical and contemporary: the “modern mainstream”, which she hopes will redefine what people think of as mainstream. She recalls doingThe Wife of Willesdenwhen she was at the Kiln theatre. “It was Zadie Smith talking to Chaucer. I love these relationships between exciting, contemporary playwrights and the original author. That dialogue feels very alive.”Meanwhile, in a move thatwillappeal to traditionalists, the repertory system is to return, banner-headed by the mega-wattage of Paul Mescal. The Gladiator II star will perform in the first of two rep seasons: in A Whistle in the Dark, directed by Caitríona McLaughlin,and Death of a Salesman, directed by Rebecca Frecknall.Rep has been missing from the NT since 2019, a factbemoaned by playwright David Harein recent years. Is this connected to his very public protest? “No, not at all,” says Rubasingham. “I’m very fond of David but that’s not it.” It was halted due to Covid, adds Varah, out of survival instincts: putting on two shows featuring the same actors is much more costly and complicated than it was a decade or two ago.Rep will be tried out on the Lyttelton stage for a season. “This is an opportunity to think about a hybrid model we could bring back, in some of the stages in some of the seasons. It enables those who want to play with it, but won’t be a structural barrier to everything else we want to programme. One actor might say, ‘I can’t do it because I’m contracted to X.’ And then we’ll do a straight run. But if there’s another who says, ‘I’m energised and excited and will keep myself free’ then we can plan. It’s all about being agile and allowing the artist and audience to come first.”Mescal practically bit Rubasingham’s hand off when she offered him the chance to rep. “We were talking about a particular play,’ she says, “and then, when we started talking about rep, he gotsoexcited.” Mescal has won plaudits for his stage work but is still more of a screen A-lister. Does this trend towards “celebrity casting”, prevalent on Broadway and in the West End, make for a healthy theatre ecology?View image in fullscreenPractically bit off Rubasingham’s hand … Gladiator II star Paul Mescal will try rep.Photograph: Aidan Monaghan/AP“It’s lovely to get Paul Mescal in a rep season,” she simply says. “That’s exciting and he’s a brilliant stage actor. It’s always going to be about the quality – and it’ll make people excited about coming.” What about farther afield? Is it not a danger to keep going down this road? “I don’t think it’s a danger at all,” says Rubasingham. “I think where it goes crazy is in America as ticket prices become $900.”But in London, I point out, the tickets for some of Jamie Lloyd’s shows have jumped to several hundreds, likewise for Rebecca Frecknall’s Cabaret. “It’s hard because it’s a different model. If I were a commercial producer in the West End, I’d probably do the same thing. That’s why I’m so excited about being here – I don’t have to put myself in that position.”After a thoughtful pause, she adds: “I think those shows that have really expensive tickets allow producers to take a risk on something else. That’s the balancing act.”View image in fullscreenWatch this space … Stormzy is announced as one of Rubasingham’s forthcoming collaborators.Either way, says Varah, celebrity casting means something different at the National, where the average price of a ticket is £33, with a quarter of all tickets costing under £25. “There’s joy for a teenager or school student coming in to see an actor they might have seen on screen,” she continues. “A teenager may think, ‘I’ve seen them on telly so I trust going into this place I might not have walked into before.’ We would never want the commercial to subjugate the art. But there is actually a valid audience development point. We’re the gateway to theatre for young people.”The theatre, they point out, has also democratised access via its digital schemes such as NT Live, allowing audiences to see Andrew Scott in Vanya at the cinema for cinema prices, or at homewith NT at Home, accessible in 184 countries and free to schools.Rubasingham looks eminently at home here on the sofa, and in talking about programming. After a long handover period, when outgoing directorRufus Norrisfinally left the building, he wrote her a card. “It was very, very, very sweet,” she says. “I didn’t find it until a few days later. He’d just written, ‘You’ve got this.’”She certainly sounds as if she has. Does she feel this is the case? “Because I’ve been an artistic director before, and I’ve worked here numerous times before, there’s a familiarity. It’s big, 10 times bigger than the Kiln, but all the principles are the same. It wasn’t a shock to the system.”So no sleepless nights over this first big reveal? “I haven’t had sleepless nights – but you pore over what’s going to be the first show and get really angst-ridden. Everyone’s going to have an opinion about it. I wanted to find the right thing that says the right thing. And it’s been wonderful asking writers what they want to write about, meeting actors, musicians, composers, choreographers. It’s a world of possibilities. That’s thrilling.”Explore more on these topicsNational TheatreIndhu RubasinghamTheatreRufus NorrisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On opening night of her Cowboy Carter world tour at the four-year-old SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, she brings forth a sweeping, theatrical spectacle that reclaims country music, reframes American identity and reminds everyone who’s still driving pop’s evolution after all these years. Her nearly three-hour, seven-act performance draws heavily from Cowboy Carter – her Grammy-winning country epic – and threads in nods to Renaissance, the ballroom-infused predecessor that lit up stadiums barely two years ago. Rather than stake a claim in country, Beyoncé goes deeper: celebrating the Black roots of the genre and exploding its boundaries with precision, power and polish.Country music is cool now – even the pop girlies are leaning into it. I’ve finally been vindicated | Rebecca ShawRead moreOutside SoFi, vendors hawk more cowboy hats than you’d see at a Los Tigres del Norte show. Inside, anticipation sizzles. Projected across the massive stage-length screen: CHITLIN’ CIRCUIT – a nod to the historic Black music venues where blues, country and rock took shape. The show begins with American Requiem – the Sign o’ the Times-drizzled opener from Cowboy Carter – followed by a haunting Blackbiird. Then comes a defining moment: a Hendrix-inspired Star-Spangled Banner, laced with the thunder of Freedom, flashing red, white and blue. The screen reads: “Never ask permission for something that already belongs to you.”Images of Linda Martell and other Black country pioneers flash behind her asBeyoncé– in a white Mugler leather set and matching cowboy hat – thanks “those who came before me” and praises fans for “giving me the creative liberty to challenge myself”. Ya Ya kicks the tempo up, Blue Ivy joining the dancers as Beyoncé shakes off her cowboy hat and flips her hair like it’s 2003. By the time she reclines on a throne and a robotic arm pours her a whiskey, the crowd is all in.Act two opens with a sharp-shouldered, Janet Jackson-flecked America Has a Problem, delivered behind a press podium. Then come Spaghettii, Formation and Diva, the last complete with a deadpan TikTok-inspired bit. The band rises on three-story platforms as horns blast and dancers swarm. Blue Ivy returns, nailing the Déjà Vu choreography and earning a roar from the crowd.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Parkwood EntertainmentAct three softens. Alliigator Tears and Just for Fun give way to Protector. “This is my first time singing these songs,” Beyoncé says. “I’m so happy to be singing them with you.” Her seven-year-old daughter, Rumi, joins her onstage, beaming and waving mid-song. Behind them appears a tribute: “I once had a thousand desires / But in my one desire to know you / all else melted away.” Throughout, Beyoncé’s attention to detail is unmatched. Every movement and frame is measured. Her team – a small city of dancers, designers, stylists and crew – maintains astonishing cohesion. The show is genreless in the best sense: fiddles accompany gospel vocals, a robotic arm shares space with a golden mechanical bull.Visuals and interludes deepen the themes. Western vignettes cast Beyoncé as an outsider. In one stylized duel, an older white cowboy unloads bullets – they bounce off her body. She is, as ever, bulletproof. Desert Eagle, Riiverdance and II Hands II Heaven follow under warm, glowing lights. During Sweet Honey Buckiin’, Beyoncé and her dancers groove in chaps and belts while Blue Ivy takes center stage again.The Renaissance era still pulses: she rides a mechanical bull during Tyrant, just as she once rode Reneigh, her disco horse. “Welcome back to the Renaissance, y’all,” she says, as I’m That Girl, Cozy and Alien Superstar unfold with the same crisp choreography and glittering, refashioned props. Then comes Daddy Lessons, performed live for the first time since 2016’s Lemonade tour, as Beyoncé flies across the stadium on a massive pink horseshoe. Cuff It gets a sweaty, slowed-down treatment on a satellite stage. Later, she nods to Destiny’s Child with elements of Bills, Bills, Bills in Thique, images of the group playing onscreen.As the show stretches toward its final act, the transitions grow looser but no less captivating. A remix of Texas Hold ’Em melts into Crazy in Love and Heated, before Before I Let Go lifts the crowd to a final release. The songs still come fast – 36 in total – but there’s space for moments, too. For 16 Carriages, Beyoncé boards a glowing red convertible and soars above the stadium, leading a massive singalong. She closes with Amen – the bookend that concludes Cowboy Carter – draped in a US flag gown in front of a masked Statue of Liberty head with braided hair: a final image both symbolic and searing.At 43, Beyoncé isn’t circling the globe like she did for Renaissance – but her 10th concert tour is a theatrical, tightly executed masterwork. She isn’t here to prove she belongs. She’s here to remind us she already owns it. And if this is only Act II, the real takeaway might be just how powerful Act III will be when it finally lands.Explore more on these topicsBeyoncéCountryPop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

This philosophical question was a catalyst for film-maker and artist Joshua Bonnetta, who has distilled a year of recordings from a single tree in upstate New York – that’s 8,760 hours – into a four-hour album, The Pines. As Robert Macfarlane writes in his accompanying essay, The Pines is a reminder of the natural world’s “sheer, miraculous busyness”, its “froth of signals and noise”. It is rich with poetic meaning, and resonant amid the climate emergency.“It started as a personal thing,” Bonnetta explains from his studio in Munich, where he relocated from the US in 2022. For over 20 years he has made sonic records of places as private mementos, but recent experiments with long-form field recording led him to push himself “to document this place in the deepest way I could”. On a residency in the Outer Hebrides between 2017 and 2019, Bonnetta made the sound installationBrackish, a month-long continuous radio broadcast from a weather-resistant hydrophone – an underwater mic – by a loch. “I started to leave the recorder for a day or two, then it just got longer,” he says. “Amazing things happen when you’re not there to interfere … This allows you a different, very privileged window into the space.”I would multi-track. So maybe you’re listening to the rain falling – but that’s all the rain in JulyBack in Ithaca, New York: “Sometimes I’d be in the woods at night with friends and we would hear owls or coyotes – but it would be rare and fleeting,” he says. He decided to use his Hebrides technique to document nearby Tioga County, and strapped a recording device 10ft up a pine tree. He returned every few weeks to replace batteries and storage cards, and sometimes the fluffy mic covers that “chipmunks got obsessed with” on his otherwise hardy equipment.Bonnetta recorded his 8,760 hours of audio from May 2021 to April 2022. He approached the intimidating editing task with the help of Holger Klinck, an expert in conservation bioacoustics at Cornell University, who showed him how to identify sounds graphically with spectral analysis software. “I’m in awe of scientists,” says Bonnetta, who frequently collaborates with them.Allow Bandcamp content?This article includes content provided by Bandcamp.

To view this content,click 'Allow and continue'.Allow and continueThen his friend Josh Berger, a re-recording mixer who has worked with Oliver Stone and Steven Soderbergh, introduced him to a program he describes as “Photoshop for sound – he uses it to clean sound up, but it can also be used to dismantle and put it back together.” The editing process took three years between other jobs. “I would come home after work like, ‘OK, I’m gonna work on the tree,’” he says.Bonnetta describes The Pines as a “spectral collage”. Its four hours are not edited highlights but layered constructions, like a poetic version of a scientific chart. “When I pieced sound together, I would multi-track,” he explains. “So maybe you’re listening to the rain falling, but that’s all the rain in July.” The result gives an impressionistic idea of the life-cycles of crickets and frogs as their sounds enter and exit, but also offers up changing sounds of the trees themselves, as branches creak under snowfall and crack with growth. “You can almost hear leaves fill in on the deciduous trees,” he says, linking his palpable sense of wonder back to an early memory of a schoolfriend sharing what they claimed was a recording of wolves. “That’s what it reminded me of when I worked on it: listening in the dark, anticipating what’s going to come next.”View image in fullscreenBeware of the raccoon! … the pine tree microphone.Photograph: Joshua BonnettaAs with any recording of the natural world, The Pines comes with an undercurrent of mourning. It isn’t explicitly about the climate crisis, but Bonnetta admits that his practice is coloured by its threats. “You could always be recording something that you might not be able to record again,” he says, recalling audio he made in his old Ontario neighbourhood. “A huge highway was about to be built through it, which would change the acoustic ecology drastically because the natural soundscape would be removed.”Next, Bonnetta is documenting the inner geological sounds of the Alps. “One mountain has little earthquakes every time there’s heavy rainfall,” he says of Mount Hochstaufen, wherescientists are investigatinga phenomenon that has been occurring for centuries. There’ll also be an audiovisual portrait of the Bavarian forest at night, a film documenting the work of bioacoustic scientists on Rapa Nui (Easter Island), and he is fascinated with the sounds of Munich, his new city. “I’ve never lived in Europe before, where you can hear bells from all the different neighbourhoods and sense the distance,” he says. “It’s really beautiful to have that sense of space through local sounds.”There is a generosity in Bonnetta’s work; its offer of time to spend within a landscape, which gets infused with personal meaning. But heed his warning before listening to The Pines: “Just don’t fall asleep,” he says, because “there’s some pretty gnarly raccoon!”The Pines is out now on Shelter Press and The Dim CoastExplore more on these topicsMusicSound artTrees and forestsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The distance from home is ‘bittersweet’ – but both styles, she says, are about trusting your instinctTue 29 Apr 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Apr 2025 08.54 EDTShareGrowing up in the icy Mongolian capital of Ulaanbaatar, singing was as natural as speech for Enkhjargal Erkhembayar. “Every day after my parents came home from working in the local power factory, they would gather with a group of friends in our yurt to unwind and someone would always begin to sing,” she says. “Soon, we would all join in, singing old folk songs to keep warm and to express ourselves long into the night.”As Enji, 33-year-old Erkhembayar is now taking this music into international concert halls, having forged a beguiling hybrid of Mongolian folk music with acoustic jazz improvisation. She anchors her performances in the circular-breathing vocal style of Mongolian long song – a folk tradition where syllables are elongated through freeform vocalisations – her delivery tender and delicate, full of yearning emotion.Touring China and 11 countries across Europe last year, audiences were “applauding, laughing or crying” despite not understanding her Mongolian lyrics, she says by video call from her apartment in Munich, where she has lived for the past seven years. “It finally gave me a sense of confidence that people can hear this music without thinking it’s nonsense. I felt free to fully express who I am.”Enji performing live on KEXP – videoThat newfound self-belief takes root in Erkhembayar’s fourth album, Sonor, with confessional lyrics over some of her most wide-ranging music to date. Rather than employ long song vocals, Erkhembayar takes on a whisper-soft register on compositions such as Ulbar, singing wistfully about the beauty of sunset light over a jazz trio instrumental that wouldn’t feel amiss in Norah Jones’s repertoire. A sprightly cover of 80s Mongolian popular song Eejiinhee Hairaar rumbles through a funk-inflected groove of drums and Rhodes piano.Those evening post-work singing sessions may have been a daily part of her childhood, but Erkhembayar only began learning long song formally while training to become a kindergarten teacher. “I heard about someone who was giving lessons locally and decided to sign up for fun. She explained the techniques to sound big and hone your resonance but said it was only possible to find a real sound if I had the ‘singing gene’, a muscle memory I could tap into,” she says with a smile. “Surprisingly, my sound came within 14 days, it was so natural. I then decided to keep learning for another year, since it felt so incredible to use my voice in that way.”When bassist Martin Zenker arrived in Ulaanbaatar witha jazz education projectfrom Munich’s Goethe-Institut, one of Erkhembayar’s teaching colleagues suggested she try out for his programme. She was accepted in 2014 and over the next two years Erkhembayar abandoned her teaching career in favour of jazz, her new obsession.“There isn’t much of a jazz scene in Mongolia, as all the music I would encounter as a younger person was Mongolian artists making English-language pop, which is still largely the case there, or local hip-hop groups like Tatar,” she says. “When I began to learn about jazz with Martin, I fell in love with it because it’s so free and sophisticated – compositions last a lifetime. It’s all about being in the moment and trusting your instinct, which felt the same as singing long song to me.” She visited Munich where she met longtime collaborator Paul Brändle and recorded her 2017 debut, then moved to the city permanently the following year and put out two more acclaimed records, 2021’s Ursgal and 2023’s Ulaan.View image in fullscreenEnji performing in Hamburg in September 2024.Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/AlamySonor features two spoken-word tracks in German – a language she learned at the Goethe-Institut programme in Mongolia, at the same time as she learned English: the group “communicated mostly through music”, she says. Meanwhile the guitar ballad Ergelt express Erkhembayar’s yearning for home: “Unfamiliar yet familiar, I am forgotten but still my own,” she sings in Mongolian, in a gentle falsetto, over Brändle’s finger-picked guitar lines.“Ergelt means ‘return’ and it was written last autumn when I was back in Mongolia visiting family,” Erkhembayar says. “I had this bittersweet feeling where I realised how much I’d changed in the years since I’ve been gone. People saw me a little differently in the way I spoke but in Germany I’m also reminded that I’m foreign, since no matter how good my German is, I’m always asked where I’m from. I felt caught between cultures and unsure about where I could return to.”Yet Erkhembayar’s music draws its beauty from her broad approach. “I still see myself as a jazz singer but I’d love to collaborate with a rapper or people with different voices,” she says. “I feel at my most confident and my music is becoming like my life, something that moves and doesn’t just stay in one place.Jazz, long song, Mongolia or Germany, I don’t know where I’ll end up – but I know I won’t stop singing.”Sonor is released via Squama Recordings on 2 MayExplore more on these topicsMusicJazzPop and rockExperimental musicMongoliafeaturesShareReuse this content"

It would be more accurate to say he’s interested in things that aren’t there; or things that were once there; or perhaps things that could have been there. Protesting miners, deceased soldiers, inflatable sites of pagan worship have all been created or re-created by the Turner prize-winning artist, who has now turned his hand to a “speculative [Roman] mosaic” for Scarborough’sWild Eyecoastal art and nature trail.Created with sculptorCoralie Turpin, Deller’s mosaic is a “semi-trick” – a suggestion of a Roman masterpiece that has been uncovered on the shores of the seaside town with genuine Roman history. On the cliffs above the work sits the remains of a Roman signal station, and the mosaic is fragmented and inaccurate as if made from memory rather than a photograph, generating a sense of authenticity. “In 100 years’ time – or whenever – when this is all underwater and it is rediscovered, someone will think ‘Fuck, there was a Roman villa here,’” says Deller.It's a joyful and violent work with references to Scarborough's past visitors – from a walrus to an aukWhat is actually there is a sea-watching station. With free-to-use telescopes, it’s one of England’s best places for viewing cetaceans – a group of aquatic mammals that includes porpoises, dolphins and whales. So, when Deller was asked if he could develop a work for the location, he had the difficult task of creating something that didn’t conflict with the view. A floor-based piece was the natural solution and it depicts many of the creatures we might spot with enough patience.Roman Mosaic c2025 is at once joyful and violent; a large whale swoops under a ship, a seal snaps at a fish, an octopus tussles with a crab. There are specificScarboroughreferences, such as the walrus who made headlines when he stopped in the town in 2022, and a tiny Arctic auk spotted during a research trip out to sea. Deller’s signature playfulness is found in the smiley face flag on the ship, and the Roman god in the top corner who is doing his best to blow the whole scene away. The tiny tiles are expertly placed by Turpin to generate movement, putting the piece in motion – as if the creatures might dive back into the North Sea at any moment.View image in fullscreenUp to no good … the god blowing wind at the ship.Photograph: Jules Lister/Jules Lister PhotographyThe sea is not always a comfortable companion for art displays. Even when the tide is low and the breeze is gentle, the hiss of the waves and the vast blue constantly draws the gaze upwards and out. But all the pieces on the Wild Eye trail understand this and instead of trying to compete with the sea, or nature more broadly, they embrace it.Invisible Dust– the non-profit organisation which initiated the Wild Eye project with theYorkshire Wildlife Trust– works to unite artists and scientists to produce climate-conscious art. For them, the sea – or what’s in it – is as important as the pieces commissioned by their impressive roster of British artists.Along with Deller, Ryan Gander, Paul Morrison, Shezad Dawood with Daisy Hildyard, and Emma Smith have created site-specific works to connect the people of Scarborough with the natural world around them. The most successful ones do this overtly.Deller’s mosaic teaming with local creatures is immediately accessible, as isPaul Morrison’s marine grade stainless steelsculpture of seaweed. Sea Oak is a shimmering slice of bladderwrack seaweed with a reflective surface that absorbs the blue above and below. Seaweed is an efficient carbon sink and valuable habitat for marine wildlife, and yet it is very often an overlooked element of the British seaside. Morrison restores its value by putting it on a plinth.View image in fullscreenTentacles at the ready … another character in the fake mosaic.Photograph: Richard PonterNearby, Dawood – in collaboration with writer Hildyard – presents one of a series of augmented reality works found along Scarborough seafront that explore an imagined future for costal environments and their inhabitants. This involves scanning a QR code and pointing my phone at the sea to see various hybrid creatures emerging to Hildyard’s storytelling. It is interesting enough but there is something disconnecting about looking at the sea through my iPhone, and without much of a physical presence I wonder how many passersby will engage with this.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The large sculpture, cast in low-carbon concrete with limestone formed of shells and skeletons from prehistoric sea creatures, is based on a dolos, the hefty forms that line the seafront to prevent erosion. Up on the edge of a cliff, surrounded by greenery and wildflowers, its hardness and bright whiteness feels out of place, as if it has arrived from another place. Its jarring presence highlights the discomfort we will feel in a future world where rising sea levels have deposited a dolos on the top of a cliff.A slow stroll or cycle between the works, absorbing the local fauna and wildlife, would be the ideal way to take in all the art. Emma Smith assists us in this leisurely approach by installing several resting points along the Cinder Track – a 21-mile coastal trail linking Scarborough and Whitby. Her sculptural “seats” – made from exquisite “Swaledale fossil” limestone – place the viewer inside nature, initiating curiosity and calm, and a total appreciation of the surrounding greenery that – should we not change our ways – might not last as long as Deller’s mosaic.Wild Eyeis a series of art works influenced by and set in the coastal environment of North YorkshireExplore more on these topicsArt and designJeremy DellerSculptureExhibitionsSea levelArtClimate crisisreviewsShareReuse this content"

Thirty years on, a new play is to revisit the fierce rivalry between Blur and Oasis when both British bands put out a new single in the same week and competed to grab the No 1 spot in the charts. Some purchased both releases, many couldn’t care less, but for a few days it was a decision that defined you: whether to spend £2.99 on Oasis’s Roll With It or Blur’s Country House?The Battle is the debut stage play of novelist and screenwriter John Niven who said of the era: “Music was so central to the culture that two pop groups could dominate the entire summer, the evening news and the front page of every newspaper in the country. We’re going to take you back there.”These days, said Niven, music has “splintered into a billion different TikTok feeds”. The Official UK Singles Chart, now based on streams and downloads as well as CDs and vinyl, does not bring the nation together as its Sunday afternoon radio broadcasts once did. The play’s director, Matthew Dunster, said of the time: “Music mattered. I remember being in my 20s in 1995. What a wild time. Full of energy, naughtiness and hilarity. Just like John Niven’s play.” The Battle, said Dunster, is “a punchy, hilarious and revealing comedy about two of the best bands of all time”.The play – billed as “based (mostly) on real events” – will follow the feud between the two bands preceding the chart battle, including the 1995 Brit awards where Blur beat Oasis to the trophies for best British single, album and group of the year. A year after the chart battle, coverage of a music industry charity football match centred onLiam Gallagherand Damon Albarn tussling on the pitch as the group’s rivalry continued to be hyped by the media.View image in fullscreenBlur v Oasis on the cover of NME in 1995.Photograph: Steve Double / Camera Press/NMEThe new play will explore how music fans clashed as they picked which band to support. An allegiance to Blur or Oasis could go beyond the tunes and also open up questions about class, fashion, masculinity and the north-south divide. Producer Simon Friend said: “Throughout my sister’s teenage years, she had an enormous poster ofDamon Albarnon her wall, and I remember her falling out with friends over which band they loved more. Ever since, this story has been in the back of my mind, and I was delighted that John Niven agreed to write it because there is no more qualified or hilarious chronicler of this world. Combined with Matthew Dunster directing, we have a fearless team recreating the sweaty mid-90s carnage of the Battle of Britpop”.Niven worked in the music industry for more than a decade and drew upon some of his experiences in the Britpop novel Kill Your Friends, which was published in 2008 and then adapted as a film in 2015. Dunster is the director of the hit2:22: A Ghost Story, is currently revivingDealer’s Choice at the Donmar Warehouseand will this summer stage an adaptation ofThe Hunger Games in London.Casting for The Battle has not yet been announced. The play opens atBirmingham Repin February. Joe Murphy, the theatre’s artistic director, said: “Our audiences are going to have the time of their lives being taken back to the rivalries, the chaos and the big personalities that made it all so unforgettable.”After it finishes in Birmingham the play will go on tour and have aWest Endrun. As spoilers go, it’s not quite up there with The Mousetrap but, for the record, Blur emerged triumphant that Sunday in mid-August. Country House sold 274,000 copies while Roll With It shifted 216,000.On top of their Britpop rivalries, Oasis’s Gallagher brothers also feuded with each other for years but this summer they are reuniting for the much-anticipated Oasis 25 international tour. In a joint statement after its announcement, the band said: “The guns have fallen silent. The stars have aligned.” The Blur v Oasis battle has also long since abated. “I like them,”said Blur’s Alex James in 2024. “He’s an incredible singer, Liam, and he can’t help being a rock star.”Explore more on these topicsTheatreBlurOasisBritpopDamon AlbarnNoel GallagherLiam GallaghernewsShareReuse this content"

Her books were also nominated for the Booker prize, the Orange (now Women’s) prize and the Folio (now Writers’) prize. She remains the only person to have won the Whitbread prize (latterly the Costa) in two categories: she won the children’s book category in 1981 for The Hollow Land and the best novel category in 1991 for The Queen of the Tambourine. Old Filth was named as one of theBBC’s 100 greatest British novelsin 2015.Gardam was much admired by fellow authors, with Ian McEwan calling her “a treasure of English contemporary writing”. Describing Old Filth when it came out in 2004, fellow novelist Maggie Gee said Gardam’s writing “crackles with energy, variety, sensuous richness. It is the writing of a 25-year-old with the wisdom and subtlety of a razor-sharp 100-year-old.”Born in 1928, Gardam was raised in the seaside Yorkshire town of Redcar by a maths teacher father and a stay-at-home mother who was passionate about writing. “She wrote all the time, endlessly. She’d just say to any child in the street, excuse me, could you just take this letter to the post. And she was always writing sermons,” Gardam told the Guardianin a 2005 interview.Her 1985 novel Crusoe’s Daughter, about an isolated woman who is obsessed with books, specifically Robinson Crusoe, was partly inspired by Gardam’s mother, she said. It “has a lot to do with a girl not being educated, when if she had been a boy the money would have been found”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

After completing her degree in English, she had a number of book-related jobs, including a stint as a Red Cross travelling librarian, and then a career as a journalist, first as a subeditor on the Weldon’s Ladies’ Journal and then as assistant literary editor at Time and Tide.She married a barrister, David Gardam, whose career partially inspired her most famous novel, Old Filth, a tragicomedy about a retired judge grieving his wife. The couple had three children, and it was only when the youngest had started school that she began her first book. “I think I would have died if it hadn’t been published,” she said ina 2011 Guardian interview. “I was desperate to get started – I was possessed.”Gardam and her husband moved to Sandwich in 1987, where she remained after his death in 2010, before moving to Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire in her final years. Her last book was Last Friends, published in 2013 and shortlisted for the 2014 Folio prize. The finale to a trilogy that began with Old Filth and continued with The Man in the Wooden Hat, Last Friends was described as “exuberant and funny and dizzy and a little bit frightening” byGuardian reviewer Tessa Hadley.Gardam was one of the first novelists published by Abacus, an imprint of Little, Brown. Richard Beswick, Jane’s publisher, said the novelist was “hugely loved by us all. Her warmth, humour and wisdom are quite irreplaceable.”“I discovered that writing was very nice indeed when I was very young, and I never changed,” Gardamtold the Telegraph in 2013. “I don’t think my style has changed very much at all – though I hope what I say is a bit more interesting. It’s about getting to know a character and loving them, I think.”Explore more on these topicsBooksJane GardamFictionChildren and teenagersnewsShareReuse this content"

Many believe the character is meant to hail from a Romany or Gypsy background, which accounts for much of the prejudice against him.Most big and small screen adaptations of the novel have ignored this, with the character having been played by actors including Ralph Fiennes, Tom Hardy and Timothy Dalton. However,Andrea Arnold’s 2011 adaptationdid cast a mixed race actor, James Howson, in the role.View image in fullscreen‘It’s all art’ … Kharmel Cochrane speaking at the Sands film festival on 26 April.Photograph: Roberto Ricciuti/Getty Images for University of St AndrewsBoth Howson and his co-star, Kaya Scodelario, were also a similar age to the characters in the novel, who are in their early 20s for much of the story. Robbie is 34, while Elordi – who also hails from Australia – is 27.“There was one Instagram comment that said the casting director should be shot,” said Cochrane. “But just wait till you see it, and then you can decide whether you want to shoot me or not. But you really don’t need to be accurate. It’s just a book. That is not based on real life. It’s all art.”She continued: “There’s definitely going to be some English Lit fans that are not going to be happy. Wait until you see the set design, because that is even more shocking. And there may or may not be a dog collar in it.”Her response also met with online comebacks. “So they saw the whitewashing backlash and proceeded to ignore it,” wrote one user on X. Another flagged Wuthering Heights’ engagement with contemporary issues. “A classic book that famously talks about class politics, racism & the patriarchal system of the time.”Elordi starred in Fennell’s irreverent black comedy Saltburn, released in 2023, loosely inspired by Evelyn Waugh’s Brideshead Revisited. The director won an Oscar in 2021 for the screenplay of her debut film,Promising Young Woman.Robbie starred in and produced Barbie, the biggest film of 2023. Leaked photographs of her on set of Fennell’s film in an anachronistic wedding dress attracted ire earlier this year.Explore more on these topicsFilmEmerald FennellJacob ElordiMargot RobbieEmily BrontëWuthering HeightsnewsShareReuse this content"

Together with his brother, he received acclaim for crime dramas Good Times and Uncut Gems.“Benny wants to create, and continues to push the envelope when it comes to stories that are raw and real, characters that are authentic and at times uncomfortable and arresting,” Johnson said toVarietyin 2024. “I’m at a point in my career where I want to push myself in ways that I’ve not pushed myself in the past.

Kill your local MP.” The group have also denied allegations they have shown support for Hamas and Hezbollah.Overnight on Monday, Kneecap – Liam Óg Ó Hannaidh, Naoise Ó Cairealláin and JJ Ó Dochartaigh – posted an apology on X and suggested the condemnation had been an “effort to derail the real conversation” about Gaza.The band have previously claimed they are facing a “coordinated smear campaign” afterspeaking out about“the ongoing genocide against the Palestinian people”.“To the Amess and Cox families, we send our heartfelt apologies, we never intended to cause you hurt,” they said in the 500-word statement.They went on: “Establishment figures, desperate to silence us, have combed through hundreds of hours of footage and interviews, extracting a handful of words from months or years ago to manufacture moral hysteria.”During an urgent question about the band in the Commons on Tuesday, the Home Office minister Dan Jarvis urged the organisers of June’s Glastonbury festival to “think very carefully” about whether Kneecap should perform there.During the exchanges, which involved Mark Francois, the Conservative MP who asked the question, referring to the band as “despicable evil”, Jarvis seemingly agreed with another Labour MP who suggested Kneecap’s music should be removed from platforms such as iTunes and Spotify.Coxtold BBC Radio Ulster’s Talkback programmethat Kneecap’s most recent statement was only “half an apology”.“It’s fine to say that you’re sorry for it, but the way that they have actually spoken about it is to suggest that it’s a conspiracy, that they have been targeted unfairly, and for me, that then doesn’t come across as unfortunately particularly genuine,” he said.Jo Coxwas killed in June 2016by a far-right extremist.Kneecap said in their most recent statement they “do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah”.They added: “We also reject any suggestion that we would seek to incite violence against any MP or individual. Ever.“An extract of footage, deliberately taken out of all context, is now being exploited and weaponised, as if it were a call to action. This distortion is not only absurd – it is a transparent effort to derail the real conversation.”Keir Starmer’s official spokesperson said on Monday the prime minister believed the band’s comments were “completely unacceptable” and that he “condemns them in the strongest possible terms”.Katie Amess, whose father, David Amess, wasmurdered by an Islamic State fanaticin his Southend West constituency, said she was “gobsmacked at the stupidity of somebody or a group of people being in the public eye and saying such dangerous, violent rhetoric”, and demanded an apology.On Tuesday, she told PA Media that the group’s statement was “deflection and excuses and gaslighting”, adding that it appeared they had been “badly advised”.She said: “It was absurd, that’s not an apology. It’s deflection, it is not taking accountability, it’s making excuses.“They don’t understand what they’re talking about. They obviously aren’t educated enough in what they’re speaking about to think that they can use those excuses and everybody will be like: ‘Oh, never mind, let’s move on to something else.’”Scotland Yard is reportedly looking into the alleged call to kill MPs, along with another concert from November 2024 in which a member of the band appeared to shout: “Up Hamas, up Hezbollah” – groups that are banned as terrorist organisations in the UK.Explore more on these topicsKneecapConservativesJo CoxnewsShareReuse this content"

If I kissed some man, I would cut my lips off.”Howard went on to say that “it does not make me homophobic to not want to kiss a man,” and sought to clarify that he would have felt unable to sufficiently commit to the role.“I can’t play that character 100%. I can’t surrender myself to a place that I don’t understand.”Gaye was shot dead by his father in 1984, when the singer was 44.

The bestselling novels, which have since been adapted intoa TV seriesby the BBC, take place across a multiverse and feature “dæmons” – physical manifestations of a person’s soul that take the form of animals.The Rose Field will be the third volume in the author’s The Book of Dust series, which expands on the His Dark Materials trilogy. It began in 2017 with La Belle Sauvage, set 12 years before Northern Lights, and continued with The Secret Commonwealth in 2019, set after the events of the original trilogy. This new book will pick up where that one left off, with Lyra alone in the ruins of a deserted city, where she has gone in search of her dæmon. Another important character from the previous books, Malcolm, has travelled towards the Silk Roads to look for Lyra.“Their quests converge in the most dangerous, breathtaking and world-changing ways,” reads the publisher’s description of The Rose Field. “They must take help from spies and thieves, gryphons and witches, old friends and new”.Pullman said he thinks of the forthcoming book “as partly a thriller and partly a bildungsroman: a story of psychological, moral and emotional growth. But it’s also a vision. Lyra’s world is changing, just as ours is. The power over people’s lives once held by old institutions and governments is seeping away and reappearing in another form: that of money, capital, development, commerce, exchange.”Above all, though, Pullman hopes “that fundamentally and permanently The Rose Field will be read as a story”.“I think of myself a storyteller rather than a novelist or a writer of literary fiction, belonging among the tellers of folk tales, fairytales, ballads and myths,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Commenting on the announcement of The Rose Field, head of books at Waterstones, Bea Carvalho, said: “One would be hard pressed to dream up a publication which could be met with such anticipation.”David Fickling, Pullman’s longtime editor at David Fickling Books, which will be publishing the new novel in association with Penguin Random House, said he remembered the moment Pullman first showed him his “vision of a universe” that became His Dark Materials.“‘What do you want to write next?’ I asked Philip Pullman over a bangers-and-mash editorial lunch in 1995,” he said. “‘Well, he said, I was thinking of setting a novel in the universe of John Milton, author of Paradise Lost.’ I nodded as if that was perfectly normal and then he began quoting effortlessly, gloriously, from that great poem.”“Three thousand pages and 30 years later I realise without fear of contradiction that the publication of The Rose Field this autumn is a moment of cultural importance that reaches far beyond books,” Fickling added. Pullman “shows us a world brimming with wonder” and “gives us hope.”In a first glimpse of the text of The Rose Field, Lyra is asked: “What will you do when you find this place in the desert, the opening to the world of the roses?”“Defend it,” she replies. “Die defending it.”The Rose Field: The Book of Dust Volume 3 will be published on 23 October 2025 (Penguin £25).

For one thing, gathering the art of the prodigious Spaniard requires a lot more overhead than most shows. As Michael Cary, the resident Picasso expert at Gagosian gallery, told me: “Picasso shows are museumy. Most of them have lots of loans from museums, so these kinds of exhibitions are very costly to put on, with all the insurance and shipping and assorted costs with bringing these works to New York City.”Pablo Picasso dies at his home in France – archive, April 1973Read moreYet there are great rewards for exhibiting Picasso. It is a huge prestige boost to any gallery that manages to pull all that art together, and the celebrity factor tends to drive tons of engagement from visitors. Moreover, just selling a single piece can put the whole enterprise in the black.“I’m imagining that Larry [Gagosian] really likes Picasso’s market,” Cary laughed as we talked about Picasso: Tête-à-tête, Gagosian’s latest show for the artist. And he should – in 2016 Gagosiansoldthe sculpture Bust of a Woman for $106m.According to Cary, nobody does more Picasso shows than the storiedNew Yorkgallery. Cary himself has worked on 13 Picasso shows since joining Gagosian in 2008, and the gallery’s relationship with Picasso’s art spans back to the 1990s. Gagosian’s website lists 40 shows involving his works.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Owen Conway / Gagosian“Picasso is a high-stakes game,” Cary told me. “You don’t accidentally or casually put on a Picasso show. It takes a lot of planning, a lot of hard work. And trying to show audiences something that haven’t expected and that they don’t anticipate with Picasso is high stakes as well.”Gagosian hopes to do just that with an enormous exhibition that spans the entirety of Picasso’s creative life. Notably, Picasso’s daughter Paloma has opened up her collection of her father’s art for Tête-à-tête, exhibiting about a dozen never-before-seen pieces. She has also helped to organize the show, as she has taken on a larger and larger role with her father’s art after becoming responsible for administering Picasso’s estate two years ago. “It’s wonderful having a collaborator who trusts us and trusts us enthusiastically,” Cary said of Paloma. “It’s disarming because Paloma is so informal and so friendly. There’s an enthusiasm that’s very, very rare.”The show is centered around one of Picasso’s best-known works, the 1909 sculpture Tête de Femme (Fernande), which Cary called “arguably the most important sculpture of the 20th century”. One of about 20 such casts known to exist, it is modeled on the head of Picasso’s muse and lover Fernande Olivier. The striking bronze cast is generally considered to be Picasso’s first cubist sculpture and a pioneering moment in the development of the cubism movement.View image in fullscreenPablo Picasso – Femme au Vase de Houx (Marie-Thérèse), 1937.Photograph: Sandra Pointet/Photo: Sandra Pointet. Courtesy GagosianCary and his team have “paired” Tête de Femme with a ceramic bust that is a portrait of Paloma’s mother, which Cary humorously described as a “cookie jar”. The discordance is the point, as Tête-à-tête strives to present Picasso’s art as Gagosian imagines the Spaniard would have wanted it: free from grouping into different schools or periods, arranged thoughtfully together in surprising and unexpected ways.“We’re putting the most important sculpture of the 20th century next to something that looks like a cookie jar,” Cary told me. “We don’t make a distinction between those two things because Picasso didn’t make a distinction.”The two têtes make for one of many such pairings that Gagosian hopes will evoke “dialogues” as audiences make connections between the pieces in the show. Cary explained that the concept comes from Picasso’s first retrospective, in 1932, which he hung himself, charting his own path by completely eschewing categorization of his art. “Picasso hung very different works of very different styles next to each other so that they could talk to each other,” he said. “This is how he intended us to encounter his work. Picasso rejected this idea of breaking up his body of work into periods – that was academic, that was criticism. When I presented that to Paloma she got sparked, she said: ‘Oh, that’s a fun idea, it gives us the chance to hang things in a different way.’”There are many undiscovered treasures in Tête-à-tête. In spite of being a Picasso scholar who has worked on numerous Picasso shows for Gagosian for nearly 20 years, Cary was astonished by never-before-exhibited pieces that he had never even heard about. “It was really exciting for me because I’m such a Picasso nerd.” Cary told me. “Paloma sent us a list of pieces and it just blew our minds. Not only hadn’t I seen many of them, I didn’t know they existed.” These never-before-exhibited works include the remarkable 1958 bronze sculpture Figure, as well as a trio of portraits of Picasso’s so-called golden muse Marie-Thérèse Walter, done in surprisingly different styles.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Owen Conway / GagosianAccording to Cary, there is always something new to discover with Picasso because he was so prolific and so enormously varied in his output. “Picasso is such a vast and complex subject,” he said. “A really prolific artist might make 5,000 works, but Picasso made about 25,000. Just keeping up with the literature alone is a full-time job. The complexity is always prompting new questions – there’s always something new to look at, always something new to try.”Keith Haring, Kanagawa and Georgia O’Keeffe: highlights from NYC’s Photography Show – in picturesRead moreTête-à-tête will be Gagosian’s last show at their longtime home at 980 Madison Avenue, and because of that the gallery will be staging it for longer than usual – nearly three months total. For Cary, having the time to really be with the works for an extended duration is a special thing, one that he hopes audiences take advantage of. “This is a long show for us, and that’s another thing that feels particularly good, that we don’t have to get the works out of here at a particular time,” he said. “These works are amazing, I want to look at them every day for as long as I can. I want people to come back and see them as many times as possible. It feels like an extra gift.”Picasso: Tête-a-tête is on show at Gagosian in New York from 18 April until 3 July 2025Explore more on these topicsPablo PicassoExhibitionsArtPaintingNew YorkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Jez Butterworth’s Mojo and Patrick Marber’s Dealer’s Choice proved to be superficially dazzling calling cards rather than enduring classics. Now a pallid 30th-anniversary revival of the latter reveals its weaknesses.Set in a restaurant where the manager Stephen (the Paul Bettany-esque Daniel Lapaine) and his employees Frankie (Alfie Allen), Sweeney (Theo Barklem-Biggs) and Mugsy (Hammed Animashaun) are gearing up for a late-night card game, the play brims with bants.Mentions of the National Lottery, which was only a few months old when the play premiered, hint at an incoming gambling epidemic. There are even period-correct beer labels, though credulity is stretched when someone repeatedly gets phone reception in a basement.It is when the writing veers away from jokes and jibes that the play sags irredeemably. Two-thirds of the characters have no inner life, and half are prone to sudden outbursts which resemble artificial attempts to raise the stakes. That almost succeeds when Stephen discovers that his son Carl (Kasper Hilton-Hille) has been gambling with Ash (Brendan Coyle), a rival patriarch, and reacts like a spurned lover. But the absence of peril and gravitas in Matthew Dunster’s staging, and in his conception of character, is total. Ash is defeated rather than dangerous. Carl, a slot-machine addict, is about as troubled as Doogie Howser MD. The card games are fatally boring.View image in fullscreenDefeated not dangerous … Brendan Coyle (Ash), left, and Kasper Hilton-Hille (Carl) in Dealer’s Choice.Photograph: Helen MurrayThere are compensations. In Moi Tran’s design, the restaurant is dominated by a pebbledash wall the colour of dried blood, which hints at the premises’ butcher-shop origins. A spectacular piece of engineering makes us feel as if we are descending into the basement for the second act.This is eclipsed by the most special effect of all: Animashaun, an exuberantly geezerish geyser of charm, toweringly tall and quarterback-shouldered but with a dancer’s grace. It is fitting in a play about competitive masculinity that a single performer should emerge victorious, but the contest isn’t even close: this is practically a one-man show. “You’ve lost the plot,” someone tells Mugsy. “Iamthe plot,” he snaps back.

Maybe it takes a non-British film-maker to appreciate such intense and unfashionable Englishness; not eccentric exactly, but wayward and romantic. It is about a trio of middle-aged siblings from the Impey family who take on the overpoweringly sad duty of clearing out their enormously grand childhood home in Oxfordshire. The huge medieval manor house Cumnor Place, with its dozens of chimneys, mysterious rooms and staircases was bought by their late mother, the neuroscientist Jane Impey (née Mellanby), with the proceeds of the sale in 1966 of a postcard-sized but hugely valuable painting,Rogier van der Weyden’s Saint George and the Dragon.Impey died in 2021 and her husband, author and antiquarian Oliver Impey, died in 2005; this left their grownup children with the task of coming to terms with the memory of growing up in what is clearly an extraordinary place. It is magical and chaotic, haunted by these two dominating personalities, full of books, papers, paintings (who knows if there is another one that might be as valuable as the one Mrs Impey sold to buy the place?), huge grounds with a swimming pool, bizarre objects and items everywhere which speak of Oliver Impey’s preoccupation with the image of the dragon.The three children refer to their parents unselfconsciously as “mama” and “papa” (oddly and atypically with the accent on the first syllable in each case) and their feelings are mixed. They are in awe of how demanding and also how emotionally cold their parents were, and among the happy memories are those of cruelty and distance. The family itself could be seen as charming or twee and insufferable.

The Korean conceptualist has spent his career ruminating on and exploring the places we live in, creating ghostly, beautiful facsimiles of the houses and apartments he’s called home.And now those fragile, wispy, delicate buildings have been transported and rebuilt in the middle ofTate Modern. A traditional Koreanhanokhouse looms over you as you enter. It’s not made of bricks and mortar or wood and screws, but paper, carefully wrapped around the artist’s childhood home and rubbed with graphite, exposing the texture of the material beneath. The paper is yellowed and mildewed from months of being left exposed to the elements, but it has survived as a sort of memorial: to childhood, architecture, migration, the past.View image in fullscreenFragile building … Suh’s childhood home rendered in paper.Photograph: Museum of Contemporary Art Australia, Sydney, Australia.It’s the perfect expression of all of Do Ho Suh’s best ideas: the haunting power of memory, the loss of your past self and the way the spaces we live in act as symbols for all of it, long after we’ve moved out or migrated away.But where that huge Korean house is impenetrable and opaque, the next installation actively invites you into its series of connected rooms made of wire and coloured semi-transparent polyester. Each space is a place he lived in, every detail re-created in wire and fabric – door handles and light switches, power sockets and towel rails, cupboards and tiles. Some are grandiose and European in style, others are ornately Korean. Each space is a slice of the artist’s past that you are allowed to walk through, to live in for just a moment.A final structure, huge and transparent, is a full-scale replica of Suh’s current home in London, made of gleaming white fabric. All along its walls are brightly coloured door handles, thermostats and fuseboxes from his former homes, objects that have been touched, which bear the wear of the resident. It’s a map of his past through switches and knobs, like a portrait made in Homebase.Lots of contemporary art is about architecture and the lived environment, but Suh’s emotional focus and simple nostalgic obsessiveness is what sets it apart. Even when he deals with wider, societal topics – such as the grey, grimy wall made of rubbings of a room left empty after the Gwangju Uprising in the 1980s – he treats the past as a heavy burden that haunts the present.The issue here is that the three big installations are so dominant and colourful that they dwarf everything else. The works on paper can’t compete, and aren’t that great to begin with. The films – long, drawn-out, eerie portraits of dilapidated apartment blocks and an animation about building a home halfway between New York and Seoul – pass by unnoticed, eclipsed by the bigger work. Only the two little white smocks filled with the artist’s kids’ favourite toys stand a chance against the pull of the installations. The show feels unbalanced as a result, too full, it needs more space and attention.View image in fullscreenHeavy burden … a rubbing of the company housing of Gwangju theatre.Photograph: Photography by Prudence Cuming Associates. Courtesy of the artist and LehmannAnd there’s a part of me that thinks the work is too pretty for its own good, that its ideas get totally lost in the trick of allowing you to walk through a transparent polyester house, which is maybe why that Gwangju Uprising work feels a bit more impactful, with its violence and greyness. Memories aren’t always pretty and pink, sometimes they’re horrible and filthy.But all this ceaseless excavation of often hyper-personal memory still works, largely because it manages to trigger your own memories. It makes you think of all the flat-shares you’ve lived in, all the houses of your childhood. Those rooms, buildings, spaces are symbols of past joy, love, laughter, tears and arguments, every grimy student flat is a container of memory, every childhood bedroom is a place of history. The difference here is that Suh hasn’t left any of it behind, he’s carried his past with him, refusing to let go, refusing to forget, and the results, at their best, are as beautiful as they are moving.Do Ho Suh: Walk the House is atTate Modern, London, 1 May until 19 OctoberExplore more on these topicsCultureTate ModernArtSculptureDrawingInstallationVideo artreviewsShareReuse this content"

Then again, not many political novels begin with a classic meet-cute. Jessica Stanley’s UK debut, Consider Yourself Kissed, is – to misquote Dorothy L Sayers – either a political story with romantic interludes, or a romance novel with political interludes. It is also the kind of book that, for a certain kind of reader, will immediately become a treasure.That meet-cute, then: Coralie, a young Australian copywriter, and Adam, a single dad, swap homes for a single night. Adam looks like a shorter, younger Colin Firth; Coralie waits in vain for him to tell her that she looks “like Lizzy Bennet, a known fact at school”. Coralie considers Adam’s neat bookcase of political biographies, including – to her joy – those of Australian politicians. Adam considers Coralie’s piles of “those green-spine books by women”. They fall in love, books-first, fairly instantly. And the reader who knows immediately thatbattered green spines mean Virago Press, and that what is being implied by Coralie’s careful collection is key to not just her character, but the character of this novel as a whole –thatreader will also be irresistibly, hopelessly in love by chapter three. (If this meet-cute does nothing for you, you’re in the wrong place.)This is a book for people who, like Coralie, love Nancy Mitford, theCazalet ChroniclesandThe Line of Beauty. (Maybe also a hint of Kate Atkinson in the liberal use of ironic parentheses?) That these are Stanley’s literary inspirations is so evident that her novel almost feels like a kind of homage: not just in the funny, brisk, tender texture of her writing, but also in the upper middle-class world she details with such care. There is a clear Elizabeth Jane Howard-ness to Stanley’s fine latticework of family relationships and objects, and the way those objects–for example, the precisely detailed contents of Adam’s daughter’s backpack (“Five pens, two notebooks, a little skateboard … a fawn soft toy dog with enormous eyes, some shriveled conkers, and a slim work of Usborne nonfiction called Animals at War”) - build up to a precise evocation of time and place. What Alan Hollinghurst did with a wedding-cake pile in Notting Hill, Stanley now does for a terrace house in Hackney. (Such is London. Such is inflation.) Adam’s house – which becomes, practically if not strictly speaking financially, Coralie’s also – is a lovely and enviable place. There are artistic lesbian grandmothers to paint scenes (from Animals at War, obviously!) on bedroom doors; vintage baby-changing tables; pink workrooms and yellow nurseries.This is a book about making a better world, both globally and domesticallyAnd yet within this rarefied world, there are clear cracks: one might even say universal cracks, of the kind that not even adoring Adam and cautious Coralie can intellectualise. It is hard to write about the unfairness of Adam and Coralie’s relationship without wanting to excuse it, somehow, on behalf of two fictional characters. Adam just wants to succeed! He’s trying! When Coralie tells him to change, he tries! They make each other (and the reader) laugh; have great sex; are intellectual and emotional equals! I loved Adam; I loved Coralie; I loved their relationship and their family and their life. But when Coralie storms out to sleep in “what used to be … the spare room, but which (somehow) … had become Adam’s study”, that “(somehow)” leaps off the page. (I have long noticed that in a house with one spare room and a heterosexual couple who both work from home, the spare room is where he works – with a door that shuts and perhaps even a designated desk – and she workssomewhere else. Always for good reasons, butalways.)Coralie knows all of this. She has “read novels” about this. And yet it’s happening to her. “How could the world … be made fair,” she wonders, “when two people who loved each other couldn’t even manage alife?” This is a book about making a better world, globally and domestically – and whether, perhaps, those two might amount to the same thing.Stanley is clearly deeply interested in global affairs – her first novel, published only in Australia, detailed the death of a cabinet minister – and it does not always work seamlessly for the regular reader. Sentences that begin, “Sadly, developments in 2020 …” can feel more lecture than pleasure: I hate to think about Brexit as much as Adam wants to mention Brexit. And yet by grounding the novel in such a specific time and place, Stanley makes us believe that at least for these two characters – and perhaps the rest of us, too – the political and personal are inextricably braided together. How can we make a better world? How can we be better to each other? Perhaps, then, Consider Yourself Kissed is neither truly a romance novel nor a political novel – merely a very human novel. And a very good one.Consider Yourself Kissed by Jessica Stanley is published by Hutchinson Heinemann (£16.99). To support the Guardian and the Observer buy a copy atguardianbookshop.com.

You probably haven’t heard of him: DeLear was the lead singer of a band called Glue on the underground post-punk scene in Los Angeles in the 1980s and 90s. On stage, he performed in drag, singing punk songs dressed like a 1960s go-do dancer in cute little dresses. The band never landed a major record deal, andDeLear died from cancer in 2017. This sweet, scrappy documentary has been lovingly put together by his friend Markus Zizenbacher.It’s not the first posthumous attempt at recognition for DeLear. In 2023, his teenage diary, written in 1979, was published under the title I Could Not Believe It. Extracts of this queer black memoir are read here on the voiceover – and they are glorious. Even aged 14 years old, living with his Christian parents in a conservative suburb ofLos Angeles, DeLear was proudly, joyfully gay, though this was before the terror of Aids. The interviews in the film with his mum and brother, an evangelical pastor, feel a little bit thin; his family accepted his sexuality, they say, but not much else.DeLear never had a proper job. For years he believed his band Glue would make it. A friend says the reason they didn’t might have something to do with having a black man in drag as lead singer, and tells the story of a Glue video being pulled from MTV by an executive. DeLear later moved to Vienna, joining a performance art collective, and lived like a celebrity, never thinking about where the rent was coming from. And celebrities loved him: when he walked into the women’s toilets at Kate Moss’s 21st birthday party, a gaggle of supermodels swarmed him, cooing over his dress. Does it matter that he wasn’t famous himself? Clearly he was a legend to everyone who knew him.The Life of Sean DeLear is on True Story from 2 May.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsPunkLos AngelesLGBTQ+ rightsreviewsShareReuse this content"

I’m setting off on a tour of Yugoslav-era Belgrade with driver Vojin Žugić fromYugoversetours, a company in the business of cold-war nostalgia. The car is a time capsule, with its little cube headlights, cranky gear stick and cassette player. Its horn sounds delightfully cheeky, and the smell of diesel and old leather seats is strong. We trundle around the Serbian capital for half a day, taking in communism’s most striking bridges and sites, honking merrily at the many drivers who overtake us. All of them smile and wave, for the Yugo holds fond memories in this part of the world.Driving around the hippodrome next to Ada Bridge,or under the gravity-defying arch of the experimental brutalistGenex tower, it’s easy to get caught up in Žugić’s nostalgia – even though he’s only 24. “I love the feel of the mechanics, the simple geometry,” he says of the car. We park at the tower and take the lift to the top floor at 140 metres for spectacular city views from its spaceship-like windows. When it was designed in 1977, this was architecture of an imagined socialist utopia. Though the concrete is a bit shabby up close, the tower has kept its photogenic appeal. Just like our Yugo.Map for SerbiaNearly everybody’s family car in the Balkans in the second half of the 20th century, the Yugo was made by Yugoslavian manufacturer Zastava in collaboration with Fiat. Italy had good business relations behind the iron curtain, and gave the designs of the Fiat 500 and 600 to Zastava to reproduce locally. These days, they’re mostly driven by older folk who haven’t updated their car since the factory ceased production. But in Belgrade, Yugoverse, a group of about50 young enthusiasts,led by mechanic Jovana Ninković, have been giving these forgotten classics a new lease of life: collecting them, refitting them, meeting up for rallies and driving visitors around.Žugić tells me the appeal of collecting Zastavas comes partly from “a responsibility to maintain our country’s 20th-century heritage, which is fast disappearing”. The Museum of Automobiles closed in 2024, the brutalistHotel Yugoslaviawas bulldozed in January this year to make way for a Ritz-Carlton, and the iconic Jugosped warehouse, once home to artists’ studios and secret raves, has been torn apart to be replaced by a Saudi-backed development of luxury flats.View image in fullscreenThe Genex tower in Belgrade.Photograph: Giorgio Morara/AlamyWhile thegeneration that came of age during the brutal 1990s Balkan warswant to erase the past, many young people are looking further back to more peaceful Yugoslav times to forge their identities, Žugić tells me, as we cross the soaring Gazela Bridge over the Sava. “We see these cars as an essential part of our history. We made them here, we have to look after them because nobody else will,” he says. It’s part of a growing passion among gen Z Serbs, such as influencer@easternblocgirl, to preserve a dying heritage and celebrate a brutalist aesthetic in the Balkans.Winding through mountains, our boxy Yugo comes into its own, chuntering along the bendy roads gracelessly but gloriouslyTo explore farther afield, I book a tour withVlajko Vladan, another young Yugo enthusiast and guide for a youth-led restoration project at Maglič Castle, which has a similar ethos to Yugoverse, chiefly to restore old broken things. He picks me up south of Belgrade and we set off into central Serbia’s rolling countryside. We pass the town of Guca, where every August a legendaryGypsy jazz trumpet festivaltakes place. Soon we find ourselves winding through mountains. It’s here our boxy white Yugo comes into its own, chuntering along the bendy roads gracelessly but gloriously.To one side, a tiny train on its way to the Kosovo border runs alongside a river that feeds into the Ibar valley, dotted with little villages. Some houses have Yugos in varying states of repair parked outside. Their owners look up from tending their vegetables to give us waves of solidarity as we zoom past.View image in fullscreenMaglič Castle was built in the 13th century.Photograph: Camilla Bell-DaviesWe round a bend and the stone fortress of Maglič comes into view on a dramatic hilltop. The name derives from the wordmagla, meaning mist in Serbo-Croat, which seems apt given the atmospheric fog rising from the river. Built in the 13th century to withstand Mongol invasions, the crumbling castle was left to decay until a group of young locals decided to save it – and while the state has taken over restoration, theMagličgrad guesthouse, just below the castle, is still community-owned.After crossing the river by raft, we climb up to the castle and are welcomed by a group of twentysomethings with mandatory shots ofrakia– plum brandy from this region. They show me inside the cosy wooden houses, with their stoves and kilim rugs.On the long evening drive back to Belgrade, the car’s little headlights sweep along the dark road and we blast old 1980s cassettesBefore the light fades, I hike from the castle to a waterfall used as a wild swimming spot.It’s here the Maglič team host barbecues and live music nights reminiscent of their grandparents’ Yugoslav era – “a slower time”, says Vladan. When I get back, there’s a hearty dinner of sausages, pickles and lentils waiting – the kind of hot meal you dream about while on a bracing hike. That night I sleep soundly, well fed and well driven.The next morning, the Yugo has a few problems starting in the cold. I’m not entirely surprised. Yugos were once nicknamed “the worst cars in history”. They were the butt of jokes in US films such as Tom Hanks’ 1987 buddy cop comedyDragnet, in which the Yugo was a last-resort getaway drive after Hanks crashed everything else. In Die Hard 3, Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson jumpstart agold Yugowith a screwdriver.View image in fullscreenCamilla exploring the Serbian countryside in a Yugo.Photograph: Camilla Bell-DaviesAfter much huffing and puffing, our Yugo gets on the road again and I wind down the window to watch the scenery slip by as we head to the Suva Planina mountain, the foothills of the Stara Planina mountains which straddle eastern Serbia and Bulgaria before sweeping down to the Black Sea. We stop for lunch atKafana Dagi Plus, a restaurant/pub/live music venue that’s beyond kitsch but serves excellent food in the southern city of Niš. Then we drive to a scenic spot (near the restaurantEtno dom kafana) to hike the Trem mountain trail. The route is more dramatic than I expect, along a narrow ridge that cuts a seam through the clouds. The valley below is utterly unspoilt, full of lush green hues and tiny villages.On the long evening drive back to Belgrade, the car’s little headlights sweep along the dark road and we blast old 1980s cassettes. I make summer plans to hire one of my Yugo drivers again and head to the Balkan seaside of Montenegro or Croatia, arriving at the coast in style. It will be hot in the chuffy old car, and the windows will be the only air conditioning, but little drawbacks like this don’t bother Yugo lovers. Žugić has even found a way to fix an electric engine into his Yugo so it runs totally sustainably. “That’s the thing with these timeless cars – they’re easy to refit,” he says. “Put another engine in and you’ve got a brand new ride.”The trip was provided byYugoverse, which runs tours of Belgrade from April to September (from€65for a half-day vintage car ride) andMagličgrad,which has rooms and tours from €45 for two people,or €80 for up to seven people, free for volunteers at the siteExplore more on these topicsSerbia holidaysEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Even so, I found this eerie. One August day in 2020, I was going to fetch clothes out of the washing machine when suddenly a cake tin fell at my feet with a loud clang. It wasn’t just any cake tin. It was the heart-shaped tin I had used to bake my own wedding cake. I wouldn’t have thought much of it except that it was only two months since my husband had left me, out of the blue.Nearly 23 years ago, this giant metal heart had been brand new. My husband-to-be had told me he liked fruit cake but hated glace cherries. For our wedding, I decided to bake him a rich, dark fruit cake with no cherries and chopped-up dried apricots to take their place. There are photos of us cutting the cake together looking blissfully happy. We would soon be on our way to Venice for our honeymoon.All these years, I kept the tin. We had three children and sometimes I used it to bake their birthday cakes: shiny brown hearts of chocolate sponge smothered in ganache. It lived in the bottom of a dresser in the hallway, where it was slowly rusting. I kept it there because it was too vast to fit in any of the kitchen cupboards. To give it away would have been unthinkable. It was a keepsake of our love.At the back of my mind, I’d imagined that one day I would use the tin to bake an anniversary cake. In one of her books, the food writer Ruth Reichl gives a recipe for the giant chocolate birthday cake she made for her husband, Michael, the first year that she knew him – a cake so colossal it took four men to help her lift it to the car. Reichl calls it simply Big Chocolate Cake. I had a vague idea that this would be the cake I’d bake for our 25th anniversary. We were getting closer to this moment. I told people how lucky we were, and how we never argued.As symbols go, a heart-shaped cake tin, bought for a wedding, is not exactly subtle. It’s Disneyfied romance, fashioned into a shiny object. I was only 19 when we met and 23 when we married. He was seven years older and was one of my college teachers, which didn’t seem to matter at the time.One morning in June 2020, sitting on an ordinary park bench, drinking a cup of coffee, he said he didn’t love me any more, not “like that”. He never elaborated what “like that” meant. It didn’t seem real. I thought that divorce was something that happened to other people – my parents, for example, who split up when I was 14. At the time, this had been the biggest shock of my life. One New Year’s Day, my father announced over lunch that his resolution was not to live with our mother any more. I was the one who had casually asked whether anyone had any resolutions. For years, I felt I caused him to leave with my question.My purchase of the heart-shaped tin suggests that I was urgently searching for a happy-ever-after: a sweet and unbroken heart. Of all my ex-husband’s excellent qualities, one of his greatest was – or so it seemed to me – that he was so steadfast. He never gave me a moment’s doubt about his loyalty. The morning of the day he left he brought me a cup of tea in bed, just as he always did, and I thanked him with real gratitude, just as I always did. When the tin clattered loudly to the ground, it echoed my own shock.View image in fullscreenBee Wilson at home.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianCertain kitchen objects become loaded with meaning in a way that we are not fully in control of. You can’t predict which will be the utensils you get attached to – the favourite mug, the spoon that feels just right in your hand – and which belongings decline over time into clutter. And then there are the objects that – even if they were made in some anonymous factory and bought in some anonymous shop – seem to carry with them a kind of magic. There is the plate that makes everything you put on it taste better, or the bowl you keep but can’t actually bear to use because it reminds you too strongly of the person who gave it to you.What should I do with the tin heart now that its original meaning was ruptured? When I told the story of it falling on the floor to friends, they all, without exception, made the same suggestion: I should invest the tin with new associations! I should bake a cake for myself in it, the richest cake imaginable, and throw myself a giant divorce party. I was comforted by the kindness of the suggestion, but didn’t feel quite ready for this yet. Instead, I left the tin where it was. I walked past it multiple times a day and sometimes winced slightly when I remembered it was there – a clanging metal symbol of rejection.I started to wonder whether the tin itself – and the cake I originally baked in it – was a powerful indication that our marriage was doomed from the start. Maybe a man who was so fussy about cherries was not the man for me.But when I picked it up, trying to decide what to do with it, the tin felt as solid as it did 23 years ago, as if it were still waiting to be used.Istarted looking for other people who had invested objects in their kitchens with strong meanings or emotions. The more I asked around, the more I saw that feeling emotional about kitchen objects was the rule rather than the exception, even for people who were not especially interested in cooking. I wasn’t alone in having intense and even magical feelings about the things I cooked and ate with.Many people told me that they could still feel the presence of a lost parent or partner in their china cupboard. I met someone who said that the one object belonging to his mother that he and his siblings all wanted when they cleared her house was a glass salad-dressing maker. His mother never rinsed out the garlic at the bottom, just adding fresh garlic before pouring in the oil and vinegar, meaning that this vessel carried the garlicky essence of decades of shared meals. Another person told me that she had a very powerful sense of one of her ancestors, whom she had never met, because she had inherited her rolling pin. A friend told me that the only thing she now had left from her French grandmother was a rusty old herb chopper from long-ago Paris, where her family ran a brasserie. My friend never used this chopper herself, but every time she looked at it she could see her grandmother’s hands, alive and cooking.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Cheryl Chan/Getty ImagesSome of the people I spoke to said that they were not at all sentimental about kitchen objects, but then when they thought harder there was always at least one exception. One man told me that kitchen objects did not interest him, only to reveal that after his mother’s death he had held on to some tea towels and place mats because they seemed to carry the “texture” of her.When people described their favourite objects, I noticed certain common themes emerging. Many of the most treasured objects were ones that they or people close to them had held in their hands and used daily – a grandmother’s wooden spoon, a mother-in-law’s butter dish decorated with a cow, a salt shaker inherited from a parent. Like pets or loved ones, these objects were cherished through daily touch. An excellent cook told me that when she walked past her Gaggia ice-cream maker – which happened every day – she would smile and sometimes even pat it because she had owned it for so long that it felt like one of the family.On the other hand, people also described as special the kitchen objects that they hardly used at all: a fragile porcelain bowl, some precious crystal glasses passed down through the generations, a linen tablecloth that only came out once a year. Some of these belongings had become so special – so hallowed – that almost no meal was good enough to justify their use. Like religious relics, they were venerated from a distance.There is more than one way of demonstrating that an object is special. You can learn to relate to old objects in new ways.One of the people who helped me to start making sense of all this was Roopa Gulati, a chef and food writer who decided to start using her parents’ precious best china after her husband, Dan, was diagnosed with a brain tumour. Having spent nearly five decades feeling that this beautiful dinner service was too good to use – she stored it in the attic for years – Roopa suddenly decided that life was too short not to bring out the good china while she could. Faced with the imminent threat of Dan’s death, her diffidence about using the best china melted away. “If it smashes, it smashes” became her new mantra.Roopa’s parents came from Punjab in northern India. She grew up in England, in rural Cumbria, with her brother and sister – the only Asian family in the village. Her father was an eye doctor. The clinic where he worked on Saturdays was next to a very expensive china shop and Roopa remembers that when she was about 11, he and her mother spent weeks looking at different sets of china before deciding on a purchase. It was 1975 and the whole set was “a huge outlay”, maybe £500.A generation ago, buying a dinner service was a weighty decision, perhaps all the more so for immigrants who were acutely aware of the opinions of others. A woman who worked during the post-second world war decades in a big department store recalled that many of her customers in the china department came in monthly, buying a precious piece or two at a time – a couple of cups and saucers one month, a dinner plate the next – until the set was finally complete.To those who owned them, laying out a special dinner service was a way not just to honour your guests but also to demonstrate what “best” looked like in your home. Roopa’s mother felt such pressure to get dinner just so for her guests that she laid the table two days before they arrived. Her beautiful dishes were a kind of armour with which, as a foreigner in this cold northern village, she shielded herself from the judgment of others.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alexandra Grablewski/Getty ImagesWhen Roopa showed me one of the plates her parents had chosen, a set calledBraemar by Royal Doulton, I instantly saw why they would have fallen in love with this particular set, which included vegetable tureens and bowls and platters along with plates. It was an elegant ceramic with a rare delicacy in colour and design: white in the middle, with a rim of silver followed by an olive-green ring and then two different geometric patterns. Roopa thinks that it must have reminded her parents of the Mughal designs of northern India.We were talking about the plates over lunch at Roopa’s house in London, where she has lived for the past 20 years. She generously cooked me lunch, a feast of dishes fromIndian Kitchens, a book she had been working on about the regional cooking of India. Dan joined us for the first course, a translucent broth of lamb scented with two kinds of cardamom and royal cumin, with fried onions and mint on top. It was only three months since Dan’s last stem cell transplant and he was still very weak. It felt like a miracle that he was home from hospital and in humorous spirits, despite his ordeal.Roopa described the pit she used to feel in her stomach at the idea of breaking one of the Braemar pieces. Suddenly I remembered the “don’t touch” terror I felt as a child walking into any kind of shop selling fancy stuff with my parents. Roopa’s fear around the Braemar remained even after her mother died and she took possession of the whole dinner service. Then her father died, but still she kept the dinner service in the attic because the thought of breaking any of it was too awful to bear.Roopa brought out some of her beloved Braemar plates, on which she served spinach and mustard greens cooked in copious amounts of butter, with flatbreads and finely sliced raw red onions on the side. It was a joy to be able to use the dishes so freely, she said. Her attitude to the dinner service changed immediately after Dan’s diagnosis. In the midst of her grief, she had started worrying about the unused plates up in the attic. She wanted the dishes to hold different foods and witness the conversations of another generation: her daughters’ children. I noticed that she was talking about her tableware as if it were alive.As children, we may be taught that certain possessions are only for best, but what if today is all we have? “Best” doesn’t have to be saved for feast days or honoured guests. Each morning that Dan was alive was now a special occasion for Roopa. Using these shiny plates also became a daily treat that reminded her of her own worth: a way to celebrate her own existence even when she felt she had done little except visit Dan in hospital. She found herself using the Braemar to brighten her ordinary solitary breakfast of toast and marmalade – something her parents would never have done.So many of us spend our whole lives denying ourselves the best things because the time is not right or we feel we haven’t earned them yet, or we fear that someone – probably our parents – will disapprove of us if we drop them. This attitude to objects sometimes goes along with a wider impulse of self-denial. This may be the legacy of hunger and rationing, or a religious childhood, or simply of the social attitudes of earlier generations. But if you don’t use the best china now, you may never use it.Roopa realised that the best way to honour the momentous and costly decision her parents made in the china shop all those years ago was to enjoy the crockery, because now could be the best and only time. “Dad’s no longer there and Mum is not either. This is life.”Some of the most poignant objects I found in my mother’s house when we were clearing it after she moved to a care home because of her dementia were two small platters made by Royal Doulton. They were in the bottom of one of the drawers where she kept her plates and bowls. These small oval-shaped platters – which dated to around 1910 – were decorated in dark, inky blue and bright green, with flower patterns done in fine lines using a delicate sepia brown, all against a creamy-white background. On the back of the platters it said “Matsumai”, along with the Royal Doulton mark. Both platters still had Gift Aid tags attached to them, suggesting that my mother had bought them from a charity shop and never used them.I brought the platters home, along with various boxes of papers and bowls and books and other keepsakes to pass on to her friends and relatives. These platters were too distinctive and special to give away to a charity shop, even if this was where they had come from in the first place. But they didn’t feel like something to give her friends because they had no real personal association with her. She had never served anything on them or even got around to removing the tags and washing them.For a long time, I forgot about the platters. It was only when we were distributing my mother’s stuff after her death in 2022 that I looked at them again. My sister did not want them, so I washed and dried them carefully and put them on a shelf with my other serving dishes, and started using them to serve some of my mother’s favourite salads. I realised I was trying to make food to please a dead person, which felt a little crazy.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alphotographic/Getty Images/iStockphotoMy mother was a brilliant Shakespeare scholarwho devoted decades of her life to understanding his sonnets. All she ever wanted was to be in the right, and to be loved. Often, especially after her divorce from my father, she seemed to feel that she was neither. When I served and ate food from the Matsumai platters, I wanted to bring her back so I could tell her that she was right to buy them and that I loved her.When I was talking in this vein over dinner one night, my oldest son said, “You’ve forgotten how difficult you found Grandma,” and it was true. She was kind to her bones but was also a deeply anxious person. When some tiny detail went wrong – and in the normal run of life, tiny details are always going wrong – she would loudly exclaim, “Oh no!”, as if the thing simply could not be borne. She repressed many of her feelings (because her parents had taught her to do so) and made me feel that I must repress mine, too. It was only after she developed dementia and some of her inhibitions had fallen away that she was able to tell me and my sister directly that she loved us. When I hold the Matsumai platters, I yearn to have her back – all of her, even the parts that drove me mad.Most of all, the platters make me feel how fleeting and sad life is. You buy these small treasures, hoping they will come in handy. You save them for something special. And then you die before the special event happens and they never get used.But things can have a second life (and a third and fourth), even if people can’t. Roopa Gulati spoke of giving her family’s Braemar dinner service another chance of living. I did the same with my mother’s unused platters. The more I celebrated them and arranged food on them, the more I could stop them from being junk, even if she would never know.When I finally decided to use the heart-shaped tin to bake another cake for my 50th birthday to share with my children, the tin was so much smaller than I remembered. In my memory, because of its emotional weight, it was vast enough to make a cake for dozens of people. But as I held it in my hand to scrub off the rust and bake with it, it didn’t look so very large.It was a relief to be able to look at the tin again without wincing. As with Roopa and her dinner service, I was happy that this object had the chance of a second chapter and new associations. What’s more, I was managing to look back at my own past more kindly. In the early days of separation, all the years of my marriage became polluted in my mind. If our relationship could end like this, it must never have been good. But now I could see that the love and hope I felt when I bought that shiny tin were also true.The magic of things is that they can live more than once, passing faithfully through many pairs of hands, gaining different meanings each time. Our most significant kitchen objects can keep us connected with the dead and the absent, so it’s no wonder we sometimes act as if they were charmed.I had a second celebration with some friends, old and new, a few months after my 50th birthday. I realised that my mother’s presence, far more than my ex-husband’s, was the one that hung over my kitchen. He had chosen to go, whereas she had left unwillingly.A young Syrian chef called Faraj Alnasser, a friend, came to cook a feast of Syrian food,including vegetarian kibbehfilled with oyster mushrooms and served on a warm yoghurt sauce with dried Iranian mint. Faraj had been telling me about his own most precious kitchen objects: two long metal vegetable corers which kept him connected with his mother and grandmother although they lived several thousand miles away in Cairo. These corers took Faraj back to the scents and memories of a peaceful Aleppo that no longer existed.Faraj made a feast of Syrian food, including the most incredible cheese scones seasoned with dill and za’atar, peach salad with tahini and lime, and a cucumber salad with fine strands of Syrian cheese and herbs.We were looking for plates for the cucumber salad when I showed Faraj the Matsumai platters. “Yes!” he said. “These are perfect.” Cucumber was my mother’s favourite vegetable and she would have been so cheered to see the green of the cucumber against the blue-black of the plate.Foreign mothers, foreign tongues: ‘In another universe, she could have been my friend’Read moreAt the crematorium nearly two years earlier, I had watched her poor little coffin taken away.Fear No More the Heat of the Sunfrom Shakespeare’s Cymbelinewas one of the songs at her funeral. “Fear no more the lightning flash, / Nor the all-dreaded thunder stone.” She would never again feel the warmth of the sun on her face but she was also free at last from the distress of dementia, which had made her so frightened.Yet looking down at the pale cucumber on the dark ceramic, I had the strangest feeling that she hadn’t really left after all. She was still vividly there in the pattern of that old plate, which had once caught and pleased her eye as it now pleased mine. Even in our supposedly rational age, this is the power of objects; they keep those we miss in the room with us. A plate or a tin may not be much but it can be something to hold when hands are gone.Adapted from The Heart-Shaped Tin: Love, Loss and Kitchen Objects, published by Fourth Estate on 8 May.

The formula, says Gurdeep Loyal, author ofFlavour Heroes(published in June), goes something like this: “You need two things: a really good fat and a really good sour.” Sure, that fat could be oil, but it doesn’t have to be. “It could be an egg yolk, it could be avocado, but if it’s oil, go for a flavoured one,” Loyal says, and in place of the usual acid suspects (vinegar or citrus), try the likes of gherkins, capers or preserved lemons instead. “My go-tos are preserved lemon whizzed up with a bit of their brine, some garlic-infused olive oil and maple syrup. Or avocado blitzed with gherkins, gherkin brine, a bit of sugar, if you want, and perhaps herbs such as chives or tarragon. Or chilli-infused olive oil blitzed with a teaspoon of tamarind.” These powerhouses are a dream on pretty much anything, he says, from a roast kale salad with chickpeas to baked butter beans or even as a dip for pizza crusts.For William Gleave, chef-patron ofSargassoin Margate, meanwhile, “Something with anchovies is always nice, because it goes with so many things”. For him, a “classic stolen/borrowed from the River Cafe” comes out tops: “It’s essentially a dressing with lots of chopped anchovy, grated garlic, red-wine vinegar, lemon juice, oil, black pepper and chilli flakes,” which is to say it’s bright, umami-rich and versatile. “Spoon that over everything from grilled fish to lamb or pork to crunchy veg, and it will feel as if you’ve put in a load of effort, even though it’s super-simple.”Another shortcut to big flavour iszhoug, says Marc Summer, founder ofBubala, which has just opened a third restaurant in London’s Kings Cross. “Whizz up a load of different herbs – coriander, parsley, mint – with oil, garlic andhawaij[a Yemeni spice blend with lots of black pepper, cumin and coriander].” That will transform meals in seconds: “Add it to pasta for an amazing herby sauce, or to fried onions, much as you might a curry paste.”Summer is also a big fan of crunches, especially when apricots are involved. “Make it as you would a chilli crunch, with lots of fried shallots, garlic and Sichuan peppercorns, then add hot oil, dried apricots and harissa for a really amazing, smoky-sweet oil.” Drizzle over yoghurty roast carrots or blanch some noodles, add tahini and top with the crunch: “That’ssotasty.” And remember, it’s the small things that count, so while the harissa’s out, Summer suggests combining it with honey and using as a marinade for vegetables before roasting: “That adds flavour quickly and puts a stop to same-old weekday meals.”Tahini sauce, meanwhile, is Xanthe Ross’s salvation’: “It feels indulgent,” says the author ofStay for Supper, “and it’ll instantly jazz up roast veg and salads, or use it as a dip.” You’ll most likely have all the ingredients (tahini, lemon, olive oil, sometimes honey and water) knocking around, anyway. That said, you can’t go far wrong with a classic vinaigrette, either, but mix up the vinegar element to keep things interesting. “It’s hard to make in small quantities, so have a batch in the fridge for the week,” she says. “That’s good on so many things beyond a green salad, such as tomatoes on toast for lunch, although the French might hate me for saying so.”Got a culinary dilemma?

Food styling assistant: Chloe Glazier.FoodChicken rendang and rasam: Sugen Gopal’s recipes for Malaysian comfort foodA simple, fragrant, restorative soup, plus a chickeny twist on the classic Indonesian-Malay aromatic ‘dry’ currySugen GopalTue 29 Apr 2025 01.00 EDTShareComfort food means different things to different people, and today’s recipes are what do it for me. Rasam is the dish I crave whenever I’m feeling under the weather, because it gives me a boost. This thin, brothy soup is considered to be very good for digestion, so in Malaysia we often serve it at the end of a meal. Rendang, meanwhile, originated in Indonesia before becoming popular across south-east Asia, and is now particularly associated with Malaysia. It is spicy, sweet and very fragrant, because it features both lemongrass and lime leaves. I learned how to cook it from my mum and auntie back at home in Seremban – Mum’s version uses fresh green chillies, but I also add some dried kashmiri chillies, to give it a darker colour and, in my opinion, a better flavour, too. As with many Malaysian recipes, it all begins by making akaripaste, which you can do well in advance, if you wish. Mum taught me to cook the meat separately from the paste, but nowadays I tend to cook them together in the same pan for ease.Rasam, or tomato garlic broth (pictured top)This is packed full of garlic, which is renowned for helping to fight infection, all blitzed to a paste with the skins on.Prep10 minCook15 minServes4½ tsp ground turmeric2 tsp salt10 curry leaves10gfresh coriander, stalks and leaves roughly chopped, plus extra to serve50g tamarind mixed with 100ml water, strained and liquid reservedFor the paste10 garlic cloves, unpeeled2 medium tomatoes, roughly chopped2 tsp freshly ground or whole black peppercorns2 tsp cumin seeds2 tsp coriander seeds1 dried kashmiri chilli, stalk and seeds removed and discarded50g cherry tomatoes, roughly choppedFirst make the paste. Put all the paste ingredients apart from the cherry tomatoes in a blender, add 100ml cold water and blitz to a smooth paste. Add the cherry tomatoes and pulse to combine.In a medium-large saucepan, bring 800ml water to a boil with the turmeric and salt. Once boiling, add the paste, curry leaves and coriander, and simmer for five minutes. Stir in the tamarind juice and serve piping hot with an extra scattering of coriander.Rendang ayam, or chicken rendangView image in fullscreenSugen Gopal’srendang ayam, or chicken rendang.We serve the more traditional beef rendang at theRoti King restaurants, but chicken works brilliantly with the same aromatic spices. Rendang is not particularly saucy – it’s much drier than classic karis – and is always eaten with coconut rice or roti.Prep10 minCook50 minServes4-6For the paste2-4 fresh green chillies(depending on your heat preference), stalks discarded, pith and seeds removed if you prefer less heat5 dried kashmiri chillies, stalks and seeds discarded2 sticks lemongrass, tops cut off and discarded, the rest bashed and roughly chopped35g fresh turmeric root, peeled and roughly chopped35g fresh galangal, peeled and roughly chopped, or ginger1 tbsp vegetable oilFor the rendang3 tbsp vegetable oil1 cinnamon stick1 stick lemongrass, bashed and bruised600gskin-on bone-in chicken thighs1½ tsp salt40gfresh or frozen shredded coconut, or 60g grated coconut block130mlcoconut milk2 tsp dark brown sugar¼ tsp coriander seeds¼ tsp fennel seeds6 makrut lime leaves, stems discarded, rest finely sliced into stripsTo make the rendang paste, simply put everything in a blender with 100ml water and blitz to a smooth paste; if need be, add a little more water to loosen. If you’re not using the paste straight away, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two weeks.Now to cook the rendang. Put the oil in a large pan for which you have a lid and set it over a medium heat. Break the cinnamon stick in half, add it to the pan with the lemongrass, then stir in the rendang paste and cook over a low heat, stirring often, for five to 10 minutes. Add the chicken and salt, give everything a good stir to coat, then turn down the heat to low, cover the pan and leave to cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes.Meanwhile, in a dry nonstick frying pan on a medium heat, toast the shredded coconut (or grated block coconut), stirring continuously, for three minutes, until it turns golden brown. Tip into a mortar, then pound to a paste (if you are using grated coconut block, there’s no need to toast or pound it).Try this recipe and many more on the new Feast app: scan or clickherefor your free trial.Add 100ml water to the chicken pot, stir, cover again and cook, stirring occasionally, for a further 20 minutes. Add the coconut milk, cook for another 10 minutes, then stir in the toasted coconut (or grated coconut block) and sugar.In a small dry pan, toast the coriander and fennel seeds until they’re fragrant and start to pop, tip into a mortar and bash roughly. Tip the broken seeds into the chicken pot, stir in the shredded lime leaves and leave to cook for another two minutes. Serve with coconut rice.These recipes are edited extracts from Roti King: Classic and Modern Malaysian Street Food, by Sugen Gopal, published this week by Quadrille at £18.99.
