Here’s what you need to know if you’re considering it – from the hidden costs to the chances of successZing TsjengSun 16 Nov 2025 07.00 ESTShareWhen I first told my mother I was freezing my eggs, she asked: “So my grandchildren are going to be stored next to some Häagen-Dazs?” (Very funny, Mum.) I’m one of an increasing number of women in the UK who have chosen to put their eggs on ice in order to preserve their fertility, although this does – as discussed later – have clear limitations.According to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), the UK’s regulator for the fertility industry, there was a170% increasein the number of egg freezing cycles between 2019 and 2023. The technology has been around since the 80s, but became more accessible in the 00s with vitrification, a flash-freezing technique. Now, celebrities such asFlorence PughandMichaela Coelopenly discuss their experiences of it, and companies such asMeta, Spotify and Goldman Sachssubsidise the procedure for employees.Despite growing awareness, oocyte cryopreservation – as it’s known medically – can feel like an impossibly complex and daunting procedure. At least it did for me. It didn’t help that this particular part of the fertility industry is facing criticism for its commercialisation andlack of transparency. Here are the things I wish I’d known about egg freezing before embarking on the process.Think of egg freezing as the first half of IVFSomewhat naively, I didn’t think of freezing my eggs as a step on the road to eventualIVF. In the same way as in an IVF cycle, the ovaries are hormonally stimulated to overproduce follicles, which each contain a single egg. Once these follicles mature, the resulting eggs are retrieved under sedation, and frozen. When you’re ready to use them, they’re warmed and mixed with sperm before getting transferred to your womb, again as with IVF. If you’re thinking about putting your eggs on ice, you should know you’re signing up for IVF if you can’t get pregnant naturally.A frozen egg doesn’t guarantee a child“You’ve got to be prepared that it may not be successful,” says Prof Melanie Davies, a senior consultant gynaecologist at University College London Hospitals’ reproductive medicine unit. Some eggs may not survive freezing, let alone thawing, fertilisation or embryo transfer to the womb. The best way to approach egg freezing is as an addition to your reproductive arsenal, advises Dr Zeynep Gurtin, a lecturer at the Institute for Women’sHealthat University College London (UCL): “It gives you another option to try to become a parent using your own genetic material, but in no way does it guarantee that will happen.”Do your research to find the best clinicYou can look for UK clinics on theHFEA websiteand theSeen fertility advice website. Seen CEO Kayleigh Hartigan recommends brainstorming what’s most important to you: do you want a bigger clinic that sees a lot of clients but may feel slightly impersonal, or would you prefer a smaller one with a more hands-on approach? “Have a call with the clinic to figure out if they’re your people and you like them.”It’s difficult to find egg freezing success rates because the procedure is relatively new. The best way to gauge a clinic is its live birth per embryo transfer rates. You can see if this compares favourably against thenational averageby searching for the clinic on theHFEA website. Watch out for clinics that engage in “overselling, talking about things like guarantees and ‘you’ll regret this if you don’t’ messaging – to me, that’s a massive red flag”, says Gurtin.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Kellie French/The GuardianSchedule more time for it than you thinkMy egg freezing process ended up taking place over two months as my initial cycle had to be abandoned because I wasn’t responding to ovarian stimulation. Expect to spend roughly two weeks on a single cycle. You’ll inject yourself with hormones once or twice a day for around eight to 11 days. Typically, this kicks off on the first or second day of your period, which means your start date is somewhat at the mercy of your menstrual cycle – this is important to note if you’re planning your egg freezing cycles around work or trips abroad.You’ll have to juggle scans around workIn order to monitor follicle growth, you’ll be booked in for regular scans where an ultrasound probe is inserted into your vagina. I ended up missing work in order to make my appointments, though many clinics do offer appointments outside normal work hours. That’s why finding a clinic near your home or workplace is important: “You don’t want to be travelling for an hour,” saysMatilda Hay, a film-maker who documented egg freezers before undergoing the procedure herself. Both Hay and I ended up visiting our clinics around four times over 11 days. At the very least, you’ll also have to take a day off to recover from sedation during the egg retrieval operation.The injections are surprisingly fineMost women, myself included, are surprised by how quickly you acclimatise to injecting yourself. “Most fertility injections are subcutaneous – they go in the fat under the skin and are short needles,” says Wael Saab, a fertility consultant and clinical director at the Centre for Reproductive and Genetic Health in London. You inject yourself in your lower belly – it’s not pleasant, but it’s less painful than intramuscular injections such as those used for vaccinations.Don’t panic if you’re late for a jabInjections should be administered at the same time every day, but if you’re off by an hour or a couple of hours “it shouldn’t make a huge difference”, says Saab. But missing one injection completely could jeopardise the cycle. His advice is to immediately contact your clinic if this happens. You can also take your medication out with you. “Someone from my project wanted to go on a hike, and she put her medication into a Thermos flask with an ice pack,” says Hay, who used a Chilly’s bottle in a similar way.Age plays a bigger role than you thinkAccording to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, there is “insufficient data” on the optimal age for egg freezing. Nevertheless, it does say that live birthrates are higher among younger women. “It’s not that your fertility falls off a cliffwhen you hit 35,” says Gurtin. “Many women naturally conceive in their late 30s and 40s, but we know that egg freezing is likely to be more successful if the eggs are of better quality, and that quality is primarily related to age.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Research varies, butone studyestimates that 35- to 37-year-olds will need to freeze 15 eggs to have a 70% chance of a single live birth. Another estimates that a 37-year-old would need20 frozen eggsto have a 75% likelihood. But this isn’t just a “numbers game”, according to Joyce Harper, professor of reproductive science at UCL. “Female fertility is about the quantity and quality of your eggs and about your womb,” she says. “You can have all the eggs you want and not get pregnant.”You don’t need to go wild on supplementsAll the medical experts stressed that a healthy lifestyle – a balanced diet and getting enough sleep and exercise – is more important than expensive supplements. “The main thing is to avoid poisoning yourself with cigarettes and recreational drugs”, along with alcohol and vaping, says Davies. If you do want to invest in supplements, Saab suggests vitamin D, folic acid and coenzyme Q10: “I advise my patients to start taking them as soon as I see them and to continue throughout the treatment.” You should also come off the pill before your egg freezing cycle. “You will have a better response [and get more eggs] if you’re not taking hormonal contraception,” Davies says. The same goes for those taking testosterone as part of gender-affirming hormone therapy.Watch out for extra costs and medicationAccording to the HFEA, egg freezing and thawing costs between £7,000 and £8,000. But it’s easy to spend more – Luzia Bruckamp, an Oxford-based PhD student whoblogged about her egg freezing journey, ended up paying £6,700 for her first round. She was initially quoted a much lower price on the phone, and advises getting final quotes for everything by email.Many clinics will quote an initial price that may not include blood tests or scans. You’ll also be given a broad price range for medication – somewhere between £500 and £1,500. That’s because these vary depending on the individual, so it’s best to build a financial buffer into your budget.You won’t be able to hit the gym hardAs a gym bunny, I was gutted at having to cut out heavy weightlifting during my egg freezing cycle. Intense and high-impact workouts are discouraged to mitigate the risk of ovarian torsion, in which an ovary twists on its supporting structures, cutting off its blood supply. This is a rare complication, though. Egg freezing ismostly very safe, though some experience mild side-effects from the injections and after egg collection, such as fatigue, bloating or mood swings.Egg retrieval is less scary than it soundsOn the day of egg collection, I was sedated and my eggs were drained out of their follicles with a thin needle. “It shouldn’t normally take more than about 30 minutes,” says Harper. As with any surgical operation, there is a risk of infection and complications, but you’ll normally go home a few hours later. You can take over-the-counter painkillers if you need them, and you’ll find out how many eggs were collected on the day.Feeling emotionalisn’t uncommonDon’t be surprised if this all sparks some deep existential questions about your relationship status and future. “There are a lot of emotions like, ‘I’m doing this on my own because I haven’t found my person,’” says Michelle, a Londoner who froze her eggs in 2022. Talk to other egg freezers and build a support network, even if it’s just a parent or a few sympathetic friends. Facebook groups such as theEgg Freezing Support CommunityandEgg Freezing Support (UK)can also be useful sources of connection.Explore more on these topicsPregnancyWomenWomen's healthFertility problemsIVFHealthBiologyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Bode is calling on casting directors to follow Wicked director Jon M Chu’s lead to use disabled actors for disabled roles, and also to cast disabled actors in other roles where the character’s physical ability is not specified.Bode says her experience on the set of Wicked was overwhelmingly positive thanks to the presence of a disability coordinator, Chantelle Nassari, also a wheelchair user, who was tasked with ensuring accessibility on set. “That was one less thing I had to worry about and I could just go in and do the job.” Earlier in her career, Bode says that physical access barriers and a lack of willingness to modify them almost stopped her from performing on stage,“I’ve experienced a lot of inaccessibility in general throughout my life,” she says.However, after the release of the first Wicked film in November 2024, Bode was targeted on social media. Boderesponded on TikToksaying : “Not liking Nessa is OK, it’s totally fine because she’s fictional!” : She added: “Aggressive comments and jokes about Nessa’s disability itself is deeply uncomfortable because disability is not fictional, at the end of the day ... It’s not edgy, it’s not funny.”Bode says she is preparing herself for similar backlash after the release ofWicked: For Good. “Unfortunately, I kind of do expect that [again].” Bode says she hopes that audiences will recognise the character’s motives, her longing for independence, and her desire to be loved. “I understand her deeply, and I wish other people also could see those nuances as well.”View image in fullscreen‘I understand her deeply’ … Marissa Bode as Nessarose with Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba in Wicked.Photograph: Giles Keyte/APAs an indication of progress, Bode points to a key change that the film version of Wicked made to a scene in the stage musical. In the original, Elphaba casts a magic spell on her sister’s ruby slippers, enabling Nessarose to stand up from her wheelchair and walk; the scene has been widely criticised forpromoting the ableist narrativethat disabled people need to be fixed.In Wicked: For Good, the scene underwent a minor change: instead of being able to walk again, Nessa’s shoes give her the ability to float, a feeling she has been wanting to relive since she fell in love in the previous film. “I feel Nessa comes off maybe a little bit more one-dimensional in the stage version,” Bode says. “That [change] is something I really appreciate … I think it just adds so much more humanisation to Nessa.”She adds: “Disabled characters deserve to be complex and deserve to be not just one thing. It is this weird cycle of disability being portrayed as bad or society sees disability as bad, therefore it’s projected on to disabled people.”Earlier this month, Bode receivedthe Christopher Reeve acting awardat the 2025Media Access awards, a celebration of disability representation in the media. The honour aims to support up-and-coming disabled actors. Despite such prizes, unawareness about disability persists in the industry. “I do my best to hold a lot of empathy for those that do get it wrong,” says Bode, “We just don’t have any education surrounding disability or the type of language that is appropriate or that we should use.”To combat this, Bode suggests that people should seek out more information surrounding disability. She credits prominent disabled figures and content creators such asCrutches and Spice,Aariana Rose Phillip, andAubrey Smallswith inspiring her to use her voice and “just be more unapologetic about it”.In the future, Bode wants to see more disabled people making their own art. “I think it’s important that we are telling our own stories a lot of the time,” says Bode, encouraging producers to hire and cast disabled actors, writers and crew. “There’s a great community out there.”Explore more on these topicsFilmWicked: For GoodDisabilityActivismWickedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The acting is melodramatic, the tone bewildering and the plot is full of cartoonishly grim situations that go nowhereJack SealeSun 16 Nov 2025 17.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 16 Nov 2025 17.02 ESTShareHolidays can be murder. Regular domestic life often smothers a festering seam of incompatibility in a relationship, or a fault in an outwardly solid family dynamic. But trap people together for a week or two somewhere far away and there’s nowhere to hide. In Summerwater, a forbiddingly bleak drama written by John Donnelly and based on Sarah Moss’s novel, each of the six rain-lashed lochside cabins contains a uniquely unhappy household-on-holiday that is, on one particular day, about to endure a reckoning.We start, as far too many dramas do, with characters being interviewed in the near future by the police. There has been a fire, but we won’t know who started it, whose cabin it was in and who died until episode six. In between is an interlinked anthology, the same day seen again and again from different perspectives. First we shadow Justine (Valene Kane), a wife and mother of two preteens.Although it improves slightly as the series goes on, once viewers who are generous enough to stick around have got used to its bewildering tone, Summerwater reveals all its flaws in this opening episode. The central problem is that it can’t replicate the detailed inner monologues that were the book’s main selling point, and – having almost entirely ditched Moss’s state-of-the-nation political commentary – it doesn’t know what to offer instead. It lands on a sort of allusive psychodrama, with a lot of baleful blank stares and shots of Scottish trees and water looking indefinably threatening, all set to a shimmering whine of a score. Flashbacks help us piece together some kind of explanation for why Justine is so distant from her emotionally inadequate husband Steve (Daniel Rigby) and their kids, and why her obsessive long runs around the holiday village are punctuated with her trying to dispose of evidence of a crime: back in her normal life, a new colleague being given a job Justine had coveted has triggered a breakdown and a reckless campaign of revenge.There is a resonant story in there somewhere about a woman overwhelmed by the expectations of herself and others, at home and at work, but we know this mainly because Justine suddenly announces it near the episode’s end. Before that is the unsettling spectacle of a character apparently having a severe mental health episode, causing her to behave in extreme and inexplicable ways.View image in fullscreenHostile reception: Marijonas (Arnas Fedaravicius) in Summerwater.Photograph: Sonja Blietschau/Channel 4/Freedom ScriptedSimilarly sketchy and frustrating are subsequent tales about a couple of empty nesters (Dougray Scott and Shirley Henderson) haunted by paths not chosen and pushed to desperation by her serious illness; a teenage boy (Calum Ross) whose first relationship has ended in humiliation in front of his peers at school; and a young eastern European couple (Anna Prochniak and Arnas Fedaravicius) who work in the nearby hotel that owns the cabins. At the end of the day we are forced to repeatedly relive, the immigrants, discriminated against by their employers and othered by the British holidaymakers, annoy everyone by playing hardcore house music too loud and too late. This looks likely to be someone’s fatal tipping point.All of them are phenomenally unhappy people in cartoonishly grim situations, their ability to connect with us stifled by the show’s weakness for melodramatic acting at the expense of narrative substance. Everyone’s backstory is not only too basic for us to care about it but also riddled with implausibility: too often we are left wondering why people are behaving in the way they are, a problem not helped by Summerwater’s occasional tilts towards other genres. A brief use of In Dreams by Roy Orbison suggests Lynchian mind-horror might be about to make our quibbles over weak plotting irrelevant, but that vibe is fleeting. An element of the supernatural, in the form of a mysterious, dilapidated hut in the woods that has a strange influence on all who enter, needed either to feature much more or not at all. In these small doses, it’s nothing more than another annoying loose end.Although Summerwater isn’t devoid of redemptive moments, and its effort not to stick to the template of crime mysteries powered by buried secrets is admirable, it ends up as a drama that makes you want to back out of the room slowly and carefully. Hard truths emerging on tense holidays might be a universal experience, but those cabins are just a bad trip.Summerwater is on Channel 4 now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewSarah MossShirley HendersonreviewsShareReuse this content"

So why have we utterly failed to prepare?Sun 16 Nov 2025 06.55 ESTLast modified on Sun 16 Nov 2025 13.22 ESTShareAs autumn blurs into winter, the news is once again filling up with a familiar story: overflowing rivers, inundated streets and overwhelmed infrastructure. Since Friday, England, Wales and Ireland have beenhit by the stormthe Spanish meteorological agency has elegantly named Claudia, with grim results. One place in particular massively bore the brunt of it all: the Welsh border town of Monmouth, where the raging River Monnow spilled into the streets, people had to berescued from their homesand drones capturedaerial views of the scene, showing fragile-looking buildings suddenly surrounded by a huge clay-brown swamp.Claudia and her effects made it into the national headlines – but mostly, local and regional floods now seem too mundane to attract that kind of attention. Eleven days ago, Cumbria sawsubmerged roads, blocked drains and over 250 flood-related problems reported to the relevant councils. Railway lines in Cornwallwere submerged; in Carmarthen, in west Wales, there werereportsof the worst floods in living memory. But beyond the areas affected, who heard about these stories? Such comparatively small events, it seems, are now only to be expected.There have recently been reminders of how floods are only going to get more disruptive and dramatic. In mid-October, the insurance giant Aviva published a report titledBuilding Future Communities 2025, which was full of unsettling facts: among them, that over the past 10 years, one in 13 new homes have been built in the highest-risk flood zones; and that by 2050, the number of properties at risk from flooding could rise by 25% to 8m. It was accompanied by a Guardian articlewarning that“some towns may have to be abandoned”, a prospect that might already be flickering to life: in the Worcestershire town of Tenbury Wells, where there have been floods four times in the past six years, the council is already adjusting to the fact that the local civic buildings are nowsimply uninsurable.Last week, I had long conversations with two academics who specialise in flooding and the huge challenges it presents. They mentioned years of underinvestment in flood defences and the £10.5bn the government has recentlyset asidefor improvements between now and 2036, but also talked about the lack of attention paid to the natural protection provided by expanded wetlands, new forestry and the simple imperative to make urban environments as green as possible. They also spoke about what the Starmer government’shousebuilding drive– as and when it materialises – might mean for both the numbers of houses constructed in areas with a high flood risk, and whether new-builds will have decent drainage, and use permeable materials, rather than the concrete and asphalt that make floodingeven more of a danger.Prof Jess Neumannworks at the University of Reading, where she specialises in “flood research leading to policy change”. A fundamental modern problem, she told me, is the fact that builders, local councils and water companies are getting these things “up to a standard that’s fit for today, not for 2070 or 2080, when we’re going to see much more extreme weather”.She then talked about problems centred on the insurance business, and showed me figures for the share of commercial properties in areas at high risk of flooding that have no cover, often because premiums are too high, or insurers refuse to cover more than physical damage, leaving lost trade untouched. Those numbers are astonishing: at the last count, in 2022, 58% of retail space in such places is uninsured, and the same applies to 50% of offices. As flooding gets worse, there is therefore a rising fear that plenty of local economies will just hollow out: “businesses will leave, and places might fall into deprivation”.Homeowners at risk of flooding currently benefit from the Flood Re scheme, which pools risk to make the necessary cover more affordable. But itwill cease in 2039– at which point, to quote from the official blurb, “the insurance market will return to fully risk reflective pricing for flood insurance”. That crystallises the prospect of places simply becoming uninhabitable, which may enter the public consciousness much sooner. “Nobody’s putting pins in the maps and saying, ‘these are places that we think will become uninhabitable – because people won’t be able to get insurance, people won’t be able to sell their houses, and businesses will move out,’” said Neumann. “But I think in the next five or 10 years, it’ll become clear where those places are.”At Brunel University’s Centre for Flood Risk and Resilience,Dr Carola Koenigsounded even more stark. “At some point, some hard decisions have to be made – that certain communities will have to be relocated,” she told me. “Protection becomes so expensive that it’s not worth it, so you have to move communities to safer, higher ground.”Here, though, we collide with a few huge issues. Can anyone imagine such a huge change happening amid a political system as replete with cynicism and climate denial as ours? What about the levels of public spending it would entail? Right now, thinking about this aspect of the future surely prompts another question, about flood defence, protection and resilience: why is there such a huge political silence about these likelihoods, and how all of us might start to prepare for them?Eighteen years ago, I can vividly recall three days I spentdriving along the course of the River Severn, in the midst of the dire floods of 2007. I spoke to people in the Gloucestershire town of Tewkesbury who talked about shoals of goldfish swimming down their street, and the deaths of a father and son who had been killed by the fumes from petrol-powered equipment while they were attempting to pump out the local rugby club. In Gloucester, I remember an afternoon spent on a new-build residential avenue called Cypress Gardens, where a local builder told me that he had passed panicked warnings about its flood vulnerability to the council, only to watch as the development had gone ahead regardless, and then, as a brook that fed the nearby Severn had burst its banks, been hit by a metre of water.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The problem is the rest of us, and how politics and power work to fill us with a completely false sense of security, which flies in the face of one particular part of the climate emergency: the fact that although people living close to rivers and coastlines are particularly vulnerable to inundation, the kind of flash floods that are now a regular event can happen absolutely anywhere.In countries threatened by earthquakes, Neumann reminded me, the public tends to be told about the threats, and readied for action. “But we don’t do that here,” she said. “Our greatest natural hazard is flooding, and we don’t prepare people for it.” As she spoke, she suddenly highlighted all the madness of that everyday fact, and the grave dangers we still seem to be sleepwalking into.John Harris is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsFloodingOpinionExtreme weatherClimate crisisWalesUK weathercommentShareReuse this content"

From British royalty to White House alumni, from a Silicon Valley investor to a leftwing academic, connections and influence were the ultimate currency forJeffrey Epstein.Yet none appeared to challenge Epstein over his horrific crimes. If silence is complicity, the casual disdain of the elite circles he moved in spoke volumes.Emailsreleased this weekby the House of Representatives’ oversight committee revealed how Epstein maintained contact with business executives, reporters, academics and political players despite his 2008 guilty plea for soliciting prostitution from an underage girl.Epstein’s death – he was charged with sex trafficking in 2019 and killed himself in prison a month later – has long been a magnet forconspiracy theoriesbut the documents expose a reality less about a shadowy cabal and more about a system of power that operates in plain sight, indifferent to conviction or consequence.Spanning 2009 to 2019, Epstein’s short, choppy emails laden with spelling and grammatical errors do little to implicate his contacts – includingDonald Trump– in any criminal activities. But they do show some acquaintances supporting him during legal troubles while others sought introductions or advice on everything from dating to oil prices.Their bantering, frivolous tone implies that Epstein would have felt still welcome as a member of polite society, receiving no social incentive to change his ways. Far from being ostracised as a sex offender, he was normalised.In several messages in 2018, headvised longtime Trump ally Steve Bannonon his political tour of Europe that year. Bannon forwarded Epstein a news clip that described the German media as “underestimating” Bannon and saying he was “As Dangerous as Ever”.“luv it,” Epstein responded.Epstein wrote that he’d just spoken to “one of the country leaders that we discussed” and that “we should lay out a strategy plan. . how much fun.”Several months later, Epstein sent some advice: “If you are going to play here , you’ll have to spend time, europe by remote doesn’t work.”“its doable but time consuming,” Epstein continued in a follow-up email, “there are many leaders of countries we can organize for you to have one on ones.” Bannon replied: “Agree 100% How do I do that???”When physicistLawrence Kraussfaced sexual harassment allegations, he emailed Epstein for advice on how to handle a journalist’s inquiry. After asking whether Krauss had had sex with the person in question, Epstein advised him not to reply to the journalist.Larry Summers, who was treasury secretary under Bill Clinton and later president of Harvard University, discussed his interactions with a woman and Epstein offered coaching on his response, writing: “you reacted well.. annoyed shows caring. , no whining showed strentgh.”In another email, Summers opined: “I’m trying to figure why American elite think if u murder your baby by beating and abandonment it must be irrelevant to your admission to Harvard, but hit on a few women 10 years ago and can’t work at a network or think tank. DO NOT REPEAT THIS INSIGHT.”In a further message, Summers asked: “How is life among the lucrative and louche?” Epstein replied: “When we meet I will endeavor to mesmerize you with stories of D.C. so wild !!!”Summers was not the only Democrat in Epstein’s orbit.Kathryn Ruemmler, a former White House counsel under Barack Obama, sent a message to him calling Trump “so gross”. A portion of that message was redacted, but Epstein replied: “worse in real life and upclose.”In other emails with Ruemmler, Epstein detailed a whirlwind of well-known people he appears to have been meeting, hosting or speaking with that week, including an ambassador, a tech giant, foreign business people, academics and a film director. “you are a welcome guest at any,” he wrote.In one message, Ruemmler expressed apparent contempt for the people of New Jersey as she planned a road trip to New York: “Think I am going to drive. I will then stop to pee and get gas at a rest stop on the New Jersey turnpike, will observe all of the people there who are at least 100 pounds overweight, will have a mild panic attack as a result of the observation, and will then decide that I am not eating another bite of food for the rest of my life out of fear that I will end up like one of these people.”The documents alsocast significant doubton the former prince Andrew’s official account of his relationship with Epstein and his accusers. An email from March 2011 shows continued contact four months after Andrew later publicly claimed to have ended the relationship. In a message to Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell regarding allegations, Andrew wrote: “I can’t take any more of this my end.”Another email appears to corroborate the famous photograph of Andrew with accuser Virginia Giuffre. Epstein wrote: “Yes, she was on my plane and yes, she had her photo taken with Andrew, as many of my employees have.” This stands in contrast with the prince’s public speculation during a 2019 interview that the photograph may have been faked.JournalistMichael Wolffappears in numerous exchanges, often acting as an informal adviser to Epstein regarding his relationship with Trump. In 2015, Wolff advised Epstein to “let him [Trump] hang himself” if Trump were asked about their relationship during a CNN appearance, suggesting that any denial from Trump would give Epstein “valuable PR and political currency”.Shortly before the 2016 election, Wolff wrote to Epstein: “There’s an opportunity to come forward this week and talk about Trump in such a way that could garner you great sympathy and help finish him. Interested?”The emails show that Epstein’s role in his network went far beyond social pleasantries. He was treated as a trusted consigliere, a fixer whose judgment on matters of politics, scandal and personal life was actively sought by the powerful.He even sought to shape foreign policy. In the run-up to Trump’s 2018 bilateral meeting with Vladimir Putin, Epstein proposed thatSergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, might benefit from his own insights into the then-US president.“I think you might suggest to Putin that Lavrov can get insight on talking to me,” Epstein wrote in an email to Thorbjørn Jagland, the former Norwegian prime minister who was at the helm of the Council of Europe at the time.Epstein went on to claim that he had previously discussed Trump with Vitaly Churkin, Russia’s ambassador to the UN, before Churkin’s death in 2017. “Churkin was great,” Epstein wrote. “He understood Trump after our conversations. It is not complex. He must be seen to get something – it’s that simple.”In January 2010, biotech venture capitalist Boris Nikolic was attending the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and Epstein emailed to ask: “any fun?” Nikolic replied that he had met “your friend”Bill Clinton, as well as then-French president Nicolas Sarkozy and “your other friend”, Andrew, “as he has some questions re microsoft”.But then Nikolic said he was getting sick of meetings. Later, he wrote Epstein that “it would be blast that you are here”. He mentioned flirting with a 22-year-old woman and wrote that “It turns out she is with her husand. Did not have chance to check him out. But as we concluded, anything good is rented ;)”.In emails with Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, an Emirati businessman, Epstein complimented Bannon, saying in 2018 that “We have become friends you will like him”.“Trump doesn’t like him,” responded Sulayem.A year earlier, Sulayem had asked Epstein about an event where it appeared Trump would be in attendance, asking: “Do you think it will be possible to shake hand with trump.”“Call to discuss,” Epstein wrote back.The list of associates was wide and varied. In 2011, Epstein asked the publicist Peggy Siegal to contact media entrepreneur Arianna Huffington to “champion the dangers of false allegations” and investigate accuser Virginia Giuffre. Siegal called the request “moronic”.In a 2015 email, Epstein offeredNoam Chomsky, a linguist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and political activist, use of his New York and New Mexico residences. Their exchange also covered topics such as currency collapses and behavioral science.The artistAndres Serranodiscussed the 2016 election with him, writing that he was so “disgusted by the outrage over ‘grab them by the pussy’ that I may give him my sympathy vote”.Bondi announces investigation into Epstein ties to Trump’s Democratic adversariesRead moreEpstein was also in touch withPeter Thiel, a Silicon Valley investor and ally of JD Vance. Epstein sent Thiel an email in 2014 saying “that was fun , see you in 3 weeks”. Four years later, Epstein asked if Thiel was enjoying Los Angeles, and, after Thiel said he could not complain, replied “Dec visit me Caribbean”. It is unclear whether Thiel ever responded.The secrets of Epstein’s inbox do not reveal an overarching conspiracy but paints a more sobering picture: a world where immense wealth, privileged access and proximity to power can insulate individuals from accountability and consequences. For those inside the circle, the rules of the outside world do not apply.Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House judiciary committee, said: “This is a guy who I believe gave huge donations to colleges and universities, including Harvard and MIT, and those kinds of gifts can buy you a lot of currency and access in different elite circles.“People will want to know to what extent all of these different actors understood what was going on. It may be that the people he interacted with at MIT or Harvard did not have the same level of awareness as Prince Andrew orDonald Trumpdid but everybody should be asked to tell what they knew.”Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinUS politicsAndrew Mountbatten-WindsorPeter ThielDonald TrumpSteve BannonLarry SummersanalysisShareReuse this content"

On net zero, Reform councillors sitting on planning committees – like all councillors – are required to be apolitical in their decision-making, he added.“There was an ongoing divergence between what time I was able to dedicate to serving the residents in my division versus trying to unravel the push-pull between national and local.”Two days later, Reform’s leader in Cornwall, Rob Parsonage, also resigned the role and from the party. Parsonage, who represents Torpoint, said as leader he would receive “instructions” over WhatsApp from “head office” ordering them to “put motions in to scrap all net zero target-related matters”.“The trouble with that is you have to go in there with an open mind and with a view to assessing a planning application based on its merits, the regulations and the law,” Parsonage added. “So, effectively, you’re being asked to do something that you’re not allowed to do.”O’Connor and Parsonage have formed the Cornish Independent Non-aligned Group with two other former Reform councillors, Anna Thomason-Kenyon and Karen Knight.View image in fullscreenNigel Farage with party activists in the Knights of the Round Table pub in Camelford, Cornwall in April.Photograph: Ben Birchall/PAParsonage’s wife, Christine Parsonage, who was elected as a Reform councillor for St Columb Minor and Colan, stood down at the end of last month on health grounds. Her short time as councillor, however, was mired in controversy after it emerged she lived more than 40 miles away from her division in Torpoint.She was heavily criticised by members of Newquay town council in August for not attending their meetings as the Cornwall council representative for the area she represented. She lateradmitted standing as a “paper candidate”– a contender who does not realistically expect to be elected.The five departures mean Reform now has 23 seats on Cornwall council, having previously held 28, compared with the Liberal Democrats’ 26.Before the departure of Rob Parsonage and O’Connor, the former had come under criticism from within his own party. Curtis Mellows, the then chair of the Reform Cornwall south-east branch, did not hold back with his criticism of Parsonage online, calling him an “odious little man”.“He’s got no leadership qualities whatsoever,” Mellows said. “He tries to make out he’s got experience in politics. Well, he proved he hasn’t. I told the head office this guy shouldn’t be there, and he’s going to be a disaster – and you’ve seen what’s unfolded in the south-west.”In another twist, Mellows himself is now suspended from the party after making allegedly offensive comments about Prince Harry in a social media post.Mellows said he had made formal bullying complaints about members of the party in the county, which were not dealt with by the regional or national figures. “I wouldn’t let the bullying drop and I kept on and on and on about it,” he said. “They’ve obviously decided to get rid of me, which is fine.”Despite the election of a new leader and deputy leader for the Reform group, the infighting continues.Only this week, the chair of the Camborne, Redruth and Hayle branch was removed, much to the dismay of branch members.The waters are muddied further by the fact the chair who was removed from the branch against its members’ wishes is – and remains – the newly appointed deputy of the party in Cornwall, Roger Tarrant.Members of the branch have been anonymously briefing thelocal press, complaining of the “removal of our popular and successful previous chairman, and the parachuting in of an unknown”.So as Reform unravels, how are the parties in power responding? Leigh Frost, the Liberal Democrat leader of Cornwall council, said: “It’s quite astounding. In reality, everyone knew that this would eventually come. It’s no surprise.“We had a lot of Reform paper candidates in the local elections in May. A lot of those people got elected on the wave, and are now realising what it’s like to be a councillor, what it means to be a councillor.“Ultimately, some of them are realising it’s very difficult and don’t want to do it, and that’s entirely up to them.“Others are realising that there’s more to it, and they want to do a good job for their communities, which is great, and sort of realise that Reform isn’t the answer to that.”A Reform UK spokesperson said: “These claims are untrue. Reform UK councillors have complete autonomy to take a stand on local issues and are encouraged to come up with solutions to improve their communities.“However, voters are right to expect their elected Reform UK representatives to remember the platform they were elected on, which includes opposing the net zero agenda and ensuring taxpayer funds are spent on local people, not illegal migrants.”The newly appointed Reform leader in Cornwall, Paul Ashton, also rejected comments that local councillors had to focus on national Reform policies, such as immigration and net zero, rather than prioritising important issues affecting Cornish voters, such as affordable housing and public services.He said there was no directive from Farage or any other senior Reform figure that members had to toe the national line. “There is nobody from HQ breathing down our necks saying you’ve got to do this or you’ve got to do that.”Explore more on these topicsReform UKCornwallLocal politicsLocal governmentnewsShareReuse this content"

Two said they were particularly concerned about the plans to ramp up deportations of refugee families, including those with children.Charities warned it would risk “another Windrush scandal” and leave refugees in near-permanent limbo, with children liable to be unrooted from schools and adults unable to build careers, and make integration harder.The home secretary will announce three new safe routes for refugees to legally come to the UK from war-torn countries such as Sudan and Eritrea, but even the status of those refugees will be under constant review.Mahmood confirmed on Sunday that refugees would be liable to be returned if their country was no longer deemed dangerous, with their status reviewed every 30 months, including families with young children in school.The government will announce that it will legislate to toughen how courts apply the European convention on human rights (ECHR) regarding family life, enabling more deportation of people with family members still in the UK.On Sunday night it also emerged that Mahmood had threatened three countries with visa bans for refusing to take people back from the UK.The Times reported that Mahmood wrote to the embassies in London of Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo on Thursday, warning that they have a month to start cooperating on removals before a sliding scale of sanctions are imposed. Mahmood is expected to confirm the measures on Monday.Asylum system in UK ‘out of control’ and dividing country, home secretary saysRead moreIn her article for the Guardian, Mahmood said she knew the changes would “face opposition” but said the alternative would risk public support for all refugees collapsing.“Dark forces are stirring up anger in this country, and seeking to turn that anger into hate. We must take the opportunity we have to stop that from happening. And I know we can,” she wrote.“The true nature of this country is openness, tolerance and generosity. We want to provide sanctuary to those in danger. We want to be a Greater Britain, not a littler England. To do so, we must restore order and control.”Mahmood will announce three “modest” routes for refugees from war-torn countries such as Sudan, Palestine or Eritrea to come if they are students and those seeking to work in certain professions, as well as those sponsored by community and voluntary organisations who support them when they arrive. Refugees arriving via those routes will not be given permanent settled status.Other key measures to be announced on Monday include:Restricting asylum seekers to one single appeal rather than different appeals on multiple grounds.Creating a new body for fast-tracking cases for dangerous criminals and those with little hope of success.Legislating to restrict last-minute modern slavery claimsJoining other countries in seeking reform of ECHR article 3 rights, to more narrowly define the risk of torture and degrading treatment.Changing the Home Office’s duty to provide support to asylum seekers toa discretionary power, enabling them to potentially be removed from accommodation.Several senior aides are understood to have severe reservations about how that would affect school-age children and MPs are understood to be particularly concerned about Ukrainian refugees, many of whom brought young children who have now fully integrated into British life.“These sweeping changes will mean that a child who is settled at school, studying hard for their GCSEs, will be uprooted and forcibly removed, possibly being put in detention as part of that process,” the Refugee Council’s Enver Solomon said, likening it to how long-settled people were treated under the Windrush scandal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Asylum seekers often use its provisions on right to family life in order to stay in the UK.The effect of the changes could mean many more people are deported from the UK even if they have young children living here. Judges will be required to prioritise “public safety” over family rights. A Home Office source suggested this would be more likely to apply to extended family.On Sunday night it also emerged that Mahmood had threatened three countries with visa bans for refusing to take people back from the UK.The Times reported that Mahmood wrote to the embassies in London of Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo on Thursday, warning that they have a month to start cooperating on removals before a sliding scale of sanctions are imposed. Mahmood is expected to confirm the measures on Monday.Mahmood is to warn concerned Labour MPs that the changes are necessary to address public concern about the levels of migration as well as counterattacks from Reform UK.“Unless we act, we risk losing popular consent for having an asylum system at all. In a country that is seeing division stirred up on our streets, we will not bring unity unless we restore order to our borders,” she wrote in the Guardian.“My goal is to ensure there are legal routes into this country for those who are truly fleeing peril, and for whom this is the first safe country they have encountered.”The Home Office has briefed widely that Mahmood has beeninspired by the Danish system, which has much tighter rules on family reunions as well as on refugee status.Mahmood’s predecessor, Yvette Cooper, temporarily suspended new applications in September from a family reunion route that allowed those granted asylum in the UK to bring their family.Home Office sources have suggested the asylum changes will have far wider effects than anything brought in by the Conservatives.Almost 40,000 people havecrossed the Channel in small boatsto claim asylum in the UK so far this year and the number of asylum applications in the UK is at a record high. Government figures show 111,084 people applied for asylum in the UK in the year to June 2025.Both the Conservatives and Reform UK have said they would leave the ECHR in order to undertake more severe measures to cut migration. Mahmood has said she will not leave the ECHR, but there are likely to be significant legal challenges to what she is proposing on Monday.The Conservatives have suggested the party could support the plans brought forward by Mahmood if she faces a rebellion from Labour backbenchers.But the shadow home secretary, Chris Philp, criticised the plans as “very small steps in the right direction with a few gimmicks”.He told Sky News’s Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips programme: “We want no illegal immigration whatsoever. We need to have a cap on legal inward migration each year, so the numbers are very, very dramatically lower.”Several loyalist MPs told the Guardian they were deeply uncomfortable at the prospect of disrupting the lives of settled refugee families if their countries became safer to return to. At least one minister is understood to have severe reservations.The Labour MP Tony Vaughan urged the government to “think again” on the changes. “The prime minister said in September that we are at a fork in the road. These asylum proposals suggest we have taken the wrong turning,” he posted on X.“The idea that recognised refugees need to be deported is wrong. The rhetoric around these reforms encourages the same culture of divisiveness that sees racism and abuse growing in our communities.”The Labour MP Stella Creasy wrote in the Guardian that leaving refugees in a state of “perpetual limbo” for 20 years was economically as well as morally damaging. “If we want to stop the boats we need to stop the BS when it comes to what is generating refugees or how to respond to them,” she said.“If you can’t stabilise your status, you will always struggle to get a job, a bank account or a mortgage, making it more likely you will be dependent on state or voluntary support.”Explore more on these topicsMigrationImmigration and asylumShabana MahmoodLabournewsShareReuse this content"

You’re talking about licence fee payers’ money, you’re talking about public money. It would not be appropriate.”Hall, who stepped down as director general in 2020 after seven years in the role, called the video edit a “serious error”, and said it should have “been recognised as such much earlier in the whole process”. But he said he also worried that the “hard work, diligence and the belief in impartiality” of BBC journalists had been lost in the debate.The row over an episode of Panorama from last year about the Capitol riot in 2021 led to accusations of bias at the broadcaster andthe resignationof two of the most senior executives at the BBC: the director general, Tim Davie; and Deborah Turness, the chief executive of news.On Thursday, reports said the BBC faced separate accusations of misleading viewers about Trump’s 2021 Capitol speech more than two years before the Panorama edit aired.In an episode broadcast in June 2022, Newsnight reportedly played an edited version of his speech, similar to the one used in the Panorama programme. A BBC spokesperson said about the fresh claims, reported by the Telegraph’s Daily T podcast: “The BBC holds itself to the highest editorial standards. This matter has been brought to our attention and we are now looking into it.”The BBC, which has agreed not to show the edition of Panorama again, sentan apology to Trump on Thursdaybut said there was no legal basis for him to sue the public broadcaster over a documentary his lawyers called defamatory. On Friday evening Trump told reporters onboard Air Force One: “We’ll sue them for anywhere between a billion and $5bn, probably sometime next week. We have to do it.”The BBC chair, Samir Shah, sent a personal apology on Thursday to the White House and told lawmakers the edit was “an error of judgment”. The following day the culture minister, Lisa Nandy, said the apology was “right and necessary”.Turmoil erupted at the BBC after the clip re-emerged a week ago when a leaked internal memo highlighted the misleading edit, in which the US president appeared to say: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol … and I’ll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.”The verbatim quote from the speech was: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.” More than 50 minutes later Trump added: “And we fight. We fight like hell.”In an interview with GB News on Friday, Trump said the edit was “impossible to believe”. He added: “I made a beautiful statement, and they made it into a not beautiful statement. Fake news was a great term, except it’s not strong enough. This is beyond fake, this is corrupt.”Explore more on these topicsBBCTony HallDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

As host, Brazil is carefully neutral about what can be on the formal agenda.Silva spoke approvingly of the potential for a roadmap, without explicitly committing Brazil to it. She said: “When we have a terrain or environment that is quite grim, it is good that we have a map. But the map does not force us to travel, or to climb.”In an exclusive interview with the Guardian, she added: “The map is an answer to our scientific knowledge [of the climate crisis]. It is an ethical answer.”Scores of countries meeting in Belém for theUN climate summit, which is entering its second week, want to establish how a global phaseout of fossil fuels could work. They want to build on a historic resolution made two years ago at Cop28 in Dubai to“transition away from fossil fuels”.That promise had no timetable attached or details on how it could be achieved, and although it was passed unanimously, some countries have since attempted to disavow the pledge. Attempts last year to elaborate on what it would mean in practice were stymied by opposition from petrostates atCop29 in Azerbaijan, which is heavily reliant on oil and gas exports.There was no mention of the transition away from fossil fuels in the outcome of Cop29 as a result.For these reasons,Brazil has been wary of callsby some countries to put the transition on theagenda for Cop30. But Silva has worked hard behind the scenes to ensure the pledge could be discussed at the summitoutside the formal agenda.She won round Brazil’s president, Luis Inácio Lula da Silva, who made public reference three times to the need to “move away from dependence on fossil fuels” at thesummit of world leaders that preceded Cop30, and at the opening of the conference.“This is something that we know at some point had to be put forward, because it is the only way to face the problem from the root,” Marina Silva said. “We recognise that it is not easy, and we cannot sell false hopes. Raising the subject is courageous, and I hope [to see] this courage from all, from producers and consumers.”Brazil had not initiated the call for a phaseout, she said, because that had been done at Cop28. Instead, it was allowing the discussions to take place in accordance with what some countries wished. “We know these topics are delicate. We will give the opportunity to discuss it,” she said.There is not enough time at Cop30 to draw up a roadmap, a process Silva said could take several years because many countries faced complex issues around dependence on fossil fuels, or wanted to use the proceeds from selling fossil fuels to finance their development.“Brazil raises the subject, because Brazil is both a producer and consumer,” she said. “But Brazil is different, because Brazil, if it wants to, need not depend on fossil fuels. We have to understand that there are some that depend on fossil fuels in their economies and don’t have easy solutions, and others where fossil fuels are the basis of their economy.“To be fair is to be fair to everyone, but the essential, primordial justice is not to be unfair to the planet, because it is our home.”If the pledge receives enough support, Cop30 could set up a forum in which the process of drawing up a roadmap to the phaseout could begin.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Cop experts have told the Guardian they believe there could be support for such a proposal from about 60 countries, but there are thought to be at least 40 opposed. There are 195 countries represented at the talks.Leo Roberts, a programme lead at the E3G thinktank, said: “Despite being the root cause of climate change, fossil fuels are about the most contentious subject there is within the UN negotiations, so to see a chunky group of countries openly backing a route to achieving global phaseout is in itself pretty groundbreaking.“In simple terms, there’s no route to a world where warming stays below 1.5C in which countries aren’t able to discuss fossil fuel phaseout.”Panama’s climate negotiator, Juan Carlos Monterrey, said: “We need this language for real in this conversation. It’s quite stupid that we talk about everything but that when fossil fuels are the actual problem.”Negotiations continued on Saturday on four outstanding issues that have not yet been incorporated into the formal agenda: trade, transparency, finance and how to address theshortfall between the emissions cuts countries have plannedand those required to hold to the 1.5C temperature limit.The Cop30 president, André Corrêa do Lago, promised a “note” that would address these issues, after consultations – which have been going on since Monday – were inconclusive. He called on countries to adopt the “mutirão” spirit, meaning one of cooperation and constructive discussion.Work on other substantive issues – including adaptation to the impacts of the climate crisis, the just transition for those affected by the move to a low-carbon economy and how to build institutional capacity in developing countries – carried on productively, the presidency said.Brazil’s chief negotiator, Liliam Chagas, said the technical part of the Cop process was nearing completion, and the political phase – when ministers who have the power to change their countries’ positions arrive – was beginning.Explore more on these topicsCop30Climate crisisBrazilAmericasFossil fuelsEnergynewsShareReuse this content"

Well, he’s just now decided to investigate a hoax, if it’s a hoax. And I have another concern about these investigations that he’s announced. If they have ongoing investigations in certain areas, those documents can’t be released.“So, this might be a big smokescreen, these investigations, to open a bunch of them, as a last-ditch effort to prevent the release of the Epstein files,” he added.ABC anchor Jonathan Karl asked Massie about what the Epstein records might contain and why Trump appears afraid of what they might reveal.“You know, I’ve never said that these files will implicateDonald Trump,” Massie replied. “And I really don’t think that they will. I think he’s trying to protect a bunch of rich and powerful friends, billionaires, donors to his campaign, friends in his social circles. That’s my operating theory on why he’s trying so hard to keep these files closed.”Massie also said it was possible that more than 100 House Republicans may vote in favor of releasing the Epstein files, documents currently held by the justice department related to the alleged crimes and alleged clientele of the late financier and sex offender, when the measure reaches the House floorfor a votethis week. He urged skeptics to rethink their position.“I would remind my Republican colleagues who are deciding how to vote: Donald Trump can protect you in red districts right now by giving you an endorsement. But in 2030, he’s not going to be the president, and you will have voted to protect pedophiles if you don’t vote to release these files, and the president can’t protect you then. This vote, the record of this vote, will last longer than Donald Trump’s presidency,” Massie said.Meanwhile, Khanna of California said moments later on NBC News’ Meet the Press that the effort was “not about Donald Trump” and encouraged the president to meet with thevictimswho have survived Epstein’s alleged sex-trafficking ring and have sincespoken out.“What we’re asking for is justice for the survivors,” Khanna said. “So, it’s not about Donald Trump. I don’t even know how involved Trump was. There are a lot of other people who are involved who have to be held accountable.”Marjorie Taylor Greene says Trump’s remarks hurtful but hopes they can make upRead moreHe also noted that many survivors who have spoken publicly about their abuse will be in Washington on Tuesday, where they plan to request a meeting with Trump.Epstein killed himselfin prisonin 2019 while awaiting federal trial in New York on sex crimes, having previouslyserved timein Florida for sex offenses after negotiatinga plea dealthere in 2008. His associate,Ghislaine Maxwell, is currentlyin prison.Mike Johnson, the Republican speaker of the House, said on Sunday he believed the approaching vote would help put an end to allegations that the president had any ties to Epstein’s abuse and trafficking of underage girls.“They’re doing this to go after President Trump on this theory that he has something to do with it. He does not,” Johnson said of critics, on the Fox News Sunday program.“Epstein is their [Democrats] entire game plan, so we’re going to take that weapon out of their hands,” Johnson said. “Let’s just get this done and move it on. There’s nothing to hide.”The Senate is thought unlikely to produce the necessary support to advance the legislation, however, and Senate majority whip John Barrasso, speaking on NBC on Sunday, declined to commit to holding a vote even if the pending bill passes in the House.Georgia Republican congresswomanMarjorie Taylor Greenehas also demanded the release of all the Epstein documents,despite itcausing a rift with Trump.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The lifting of the privacy order was firstreported by the Independenton Sunday.A spokesperson for Abramovich told Reuters: “No charges have been brought against Mr Abramovich in the three and a half years since the investigation was commenced, and, to our knowledge, in fact no progress has been made on this case.“Mr Abramovich was allowed earlier this year to introduce claims of conspiracy against the government ofJersey.”The crown dependency froze more than $7bn (£5.3bn) of assetssuspected of being linked to himsoon after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The Jersey attorney general also said Abramovich was a suspect in a criminal investigation.Abramovich then succeeded in his legal attempt to force ministers and other senior figures in Jersey to produce private messages, emails and other data related to him that would now be made public, the Independent reported.The paper also published details from a judgment reportedly issued last week by the advocate David Michael Cadin, the master of the royal court, ordering the government of Jersey (GOJ) to pay Abramovich’s costs and describing its failure to provide data requested by the oligarch’s legal team more than two years ago as “extreme”.“The GOJ defendants’ conduct was out of the ordinary for any litigant let alone an ‘office holder’, and unreasonable,” he is reported to have said. “No proper explanation has been offered by the GOJ defendants for their failings.”Jersey is one of the tax havens from which Abramovich managed his fortune, using a network of offshore companies and trusts, that in turn controlled companies with bank accounts inSwitzerland.According to the Swiss rulings that first shone a light on the investigation, Jersey officials are looking into the origins of the oligarch’s wealth, acquired during the chaotic rise of capitalism inRussiain the 1990s and 2000s.Abramovich, through his lawyers, has denied the Jersey allegations and said any suggestion he was involved in criminal activity was false.The Law Officers’ Department in Jersey said: “We are unable to comment.”Abramovich did not respond to the Guardian’s invitations to comment.Quick GuideContact Guardian Business about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact the Business team confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

He remembers his parents and his grandmother saying: “Trade unions, they’ll bring the country down.” And I pointed out that it is absolutely necessary for people to have bargaining power. Socialism isn’t about the violent expropriation of people’s properties, it’s about a little bit of redistribution.Dining across the divide: ‘He looked like a typical Green voter – long hair, laid-back, that sort of thing’Read moreJonathanGiven what I see in the world today, especially in the US where people have no rights, workers definitely have to have a voice. When they don’t, their rights are eroded. But I don’t think what we had in the past worked that well. I’m a big fan of having workers on boards – but I’ve worked in Germany as well, where they have the workers’ council, and they have crazy stuff that they can’t get through, because the workers say no.AndrewYou look at Bezos or Musk – do you think for one minute they would like unions? Of course they wouldn’t.JonathanWe thought the same about Musk. I don’t think that’s the way the world needs to go, to have very, very rich people controlling the vast majority of the wealth.

That’s a profit motive. But it can’t just go to a private equity company that strips it. That said, if it’s entirely nationalised, and there’s no profit motive, that’s not a workable solution, either. Those companies become bloated – there’s no incentive to efficiency, to do better.AndrewI agreed with him – British Rail was terrible. But the trains are terrible now, they’re just more expensive.

Archive image: courtesy of Ronni Ancona and Alistair McGowanBorn in Louth, Lincolnshire in 1969, and raised in Troon, Ayrshire, Ronni Ancona is an actor, writer and impressionist. She studied at Edinburgh College of Art and trained as a teacher before turning to comedy. Born in Evesham, Worcestershire, in 1964, Alistair McGowan studied at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama before becoming an impressionist. The pair met on the London comedy circuit in the 1990s. They co-created the Bafta-winning Big Impression, which aired between 1999 and 2003 and became one of the BBC’s most popular sketch shows. Ancona’s new podcast with Hal Cruttenden –Hal & Ronni in Pieces– is available now.AlistairThis was taken during the promotion for Big Impression. I can see the desire in my eyes. The expression, the whole stance screams “Watch our show! Look at me!”, as if I’m trying to reach the audience through the lens. Now I have the look of a relatively contented man. That desperate sense of yearning has gone.The story of Ronni and I is still very moving to me. She’s so gorgeous – she just takes your breath away. But we had a tempestuous relationship, and this was taken during a tough time. She and I broke up in 1999, a few months before shooting the first series. We had been together for seven years. When you’ve had that sort of history, it never goes away. There was hurt there, and a bit of pain, while also great passion and love for the time we spent together.She and I first met at a comedy club on a boat. I was performing that night and so was Ronni – she was doing this fantastic Marilyn Monroe impression, and I was blown away by how talented she was. There was something special about her – she reminded me of Diane Keaton in Annie Hall, my favourite film. Daffy, independent, fiercely intelligent. We met and, slowly, we both became single and started seeing each other.Nobody else could tell me that my Prince Charles was ‘sounding a bit like Hugh Grant’ quite like RonniWhy did we break up? It wasn’t about football addiction [Ancona and McGowan co-wrote A Matter of Life and Death: Or How to Wean A Man Off Football in 2009]. That was rather a construct to sell the book, which failed completely. All I can say is that it was a complicated situation, but everything worked out for the best.Ronni has strong views and is very good at expressing them. She’s an absolute force. I am … not. One of my sketches was presenters Oz Clarke and Antony Worrall Thompson; they would often say, “It’s very dogs and logs”, referring to a Sunday magazine type of lifestyle. Ronni’s background was dogs and logs; meanwhile, I was cats and rats. Even our comedic sensibilities are opposite – she is more surreal, and I am all about words and puns.Actor Alexandra Roach looks back: ‘I’m from a small town – when I snuck into a nightclub underage, 11 people told my dad’Read moreTogether we often depicted celebrity couples: Richard and Judy, Posh and Becks. The Sven and Nancy material was really a reflection on our relationship. It was about a strong woman and an acquiescent bloke. When I see it now, I feel moved because these characters are tinged with the reality of our dynamic. The depth of our relationship also gave us a shorthand when on set. Nobody else could tell me that my Prince Charles was “sounding a bit like Hugh Grant” quite like Ronni.When this was taken I thought it was our moment. I believed it would lead to other opportunities. For a while I didn’t like the fact that it didn’t. I was quite annoyed. Then Ronni decided she didn’t want to be the comic known for being Posh Spice for ever, and after a while I just got very sanguine about the whole situation and realised: “Weren’t we lucky to have had that time at all?” I don’t do a great deal of television now. Music and poetry took over for me completely.Throughout everything, Ronni and I have remained close friends. I’ll call her and talk about life, and she’ll want to talk about work. I don’t think we’d ever leave it for longer than three months. I never had children, and I’m usually busy, but every August I still find myself wondering – even after 20 years – why I haven’t heard from her. Then September arrives and, like clockwork, she gets back in touch for some advice or guidance, and I realise it’s the end of the kids’ summer holidays.Our friendship feels elusive but deep and electric. Ronni’s hard to reach, but whenever we do get together something unexpected always happens.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I did Jonathan Ross in it, a couple of photoshoots. These were innocent times: “Don’t worry about getting a stylist, just bring along the nice shirt!”When this photo was taken, we were in an unusual situation. We had been engaged and broke up a few months before we started working on the first series. There was a huge amount of awkwardness, but also a frisson; like atoms colliding. There was probably some resentment and anger, but looking back that chemistry manifested as something very creative. I like to think of our post‑breakup work as a little bit like Abba, but less successful. Or like Fleetwood Mac, but less international, more parochial and short-lived. Also there was no cocaine involved.I’m good friends with Alistair’s wife, but back in those first years after we split up – when we each had different partners – there was definitely some jealousy. I can understand why; it must’ve seemed odd that we still wanted to hang out after being together. But, really, I think our connection was always artistic. A meeting of minds. Not saying we didn’t love each other, but we had a synergy, and Big Impression was the correct outlet for it.He’s so pedantic and controlling. Somehow I really like those maddening qualities in himAlistair might mind me saying this, but when Big Impression started it was his show, then I came on board. Generally there was more sexism in comedy in those days and there were a lot of times where I ended up feeling as if I was behind a reception desk asking, “Can I help you, sir?”, rather than being treated as his equal. I spent a lot of time frustrated. Not with Alistair, but other people.Our show was made just as celebrity culture was about to go stratospheric. People were getting famous fast and making lots of money. It was also pre-social media so we had less information about what these famous people were actually like at home. Our first review said: “This is interesting, quite funny, hit and miss. But why are they bothering to do David and Victoria? Who knows how they speak and who’s actually interested in these people?” We even did a version of Celebrity Wife Swap before it was ever commissioned. I wish we’d sued them for some royalties, actually. We were permanently broke. On top of that, we worked really hard. Even when we were hot, we weren’t ever cool.Alistair thinks I am still driven, but really I just have all of these tools and I want to use them. These days, people presume you’re not working when you are, as nobody watches TV in the same way any more. They think you’ve slid into obscurity. It’s a bit annoying but I understand – I’ve done something recently and I don’t even know if I can find the channel it’s on.My friendship with Alistair is poignant and deep. He’s so pedantic and controlling in ways that would normally drive me insane. Somehow I really like those maddening qualities in him. I actually think we would have killed each other if we’d stayed together. Instead, our friendship is eternal. I don’t agree with everything he says and he doesn’t agree with me, but I know it would never be enough to break the bond.Explore more on these topicsFriendshipFlashbackFamilyTV comedyTelevisionComedyPhotographyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Oh man, it’s been hard.”Despite the surprising ease with which he had beaten his nemesis Chris Eubank Jrover 12 one-sided rounds on Saturday night, Benn’s face was bruised. But his mouth almost crumpled because of a different struggle locked deep with himself. In 2022, Benn testedpositive for clomifene twicein separate tests held months apart from each other.Conor Benn overpowers Chris Eubank Jr to seal dominant rematch victoryRead moreHe reacted angrily then – protesting his innocence vociferously but never producing in public the evidence he said cleared him categorically of intentionally taking a prohibited substance. Benn was in undoubted turmoil but the infamy did not hurt his bank balance.Benn made a reputed £7.5m seven months ago when he was finally allowed to return to the ring in Britain –but he lost clearly against Eubank Jr in a brutal bout. That defeat was his first as a professional and it hurt far more because it was doled out by a man he claimed then to detest.He earned even more on Saturday when he apparently took home £8m to Eubank Jr’s £10m. But he did not look like a man with money on his mind. “You go through things in life but you just have to keep fighting,” the 29-year-old said. “Facing your own demons every single day. That’s your hardest fight. You have to live in your head every single day. Getting in the ring is no problem.”He said his uncharacteristically composed performance was driven by a resentment towards those who doubt him: “It’s the chip on my shoulder, people saying ‘Oh, you can’t box, you can’t do this or that.’ I woke up with that feeling every morning – people think I can’t outbox him for 12 rounds? Watch me. That fuelled me.”Benn is highly emotional and complex and he admitted that “it’s hard for me to tone it down … but I felt a lot of pressure from my team to get it right. You can’t get it right for eight weeks and not on fight night. You’d be a mug.”Benn boxed with such authority that he was entitled to remind us that: “I said earlier in the week there was going to be a systematic beat-down and that’s what I done”. At one stage in his domination of Eubank, Benn revealed, “I said to him: ‘This is easy work. Is that all you got?’”Benn seems determined to move down from middleweight to his natural home at welterweight – where he needs to shed 13 pounds to make the 147 limit. “It’s going to be hard,” he conceded while stressing that his “dream” is to emulate his father, Nigel, by winning the WBC world title.View image in fullscreenChris Eubank Jr (left) refused to discuss his future and any pre-fight problems after the comprehensive loss.Photograph: Justin Setterfield/Getty ImagesEubank Jr had looked severely diminished in the ring but, to his credit, he came out to face the media first. “I’ve been through hell and back to make it here today,” he said, hinting at unspoken “issues” during his long camp. “I genuinely thought that regardless of the issues that I’ve been dealing with, I would be able to go in and win. But from that first round I realised I was mistaken.”He held our gaze. “I’m a fighter. This is what I do, regardless of the dangers and the risk. We go to war. I tried my best but Conor put on a hell of a fight. I congratulate him.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He fought a great fight and I’m not here to talk about me. He’s a tough man and a great fighter.”He sounded like a man who was done with boxing. “No, we’re not talking about that. I’m not in a state of mind to be thinking about next fights. I need to heal. I need to deal with what I’m dealing with.”Someone asked Eubank if he was OK. “I’m alive. I’m happy. I get to do what I love every day, regardless of the trials and tribulations. I’m still fulfilled. So I’m good. I’m OK.”Eubank has persisted more than most in still asking questions about Benn’s positive drug tests but, with the fight beaten out of him, he was less belligerent and dogged than usual: “If you share a ring with a man for 12 rounds or 24 rounds you have that respect.”There was relief, too, in the fact that Benn had also run out of animosity. Asked if his vanquished 36-year-old rival should retire Benn said: “He’s got more important things to worry about – with twin boys [who are due to be born soon]. He’s a dad of two now and that’s always a priority. It’s not down to me to say whether or not he should retire.”Benn reiterated that his long spat with Eubank Jr was “over”. He said: “I feel like we’re done now. I can breathe. This has been three years of my life – hearing Benn-Eubank, Eubank-Bennevery single day. It’s good to sit here and say: ‘Yeah, it’s done and I’ve ended it with a win.’ That’s closed. Let’s move on. Let’s just call it a day.”Explore more on these topicsBoxingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Share the story of your sex life, anonymouslyAs told toOlivia LadanyiSun 16 Nov 2025 06.00 ESTShareMaya, 29If I know that Ollie’s on a date, I find it difficult sitting around, not knowing what to do with myselfI knew I liked Ollie immediately. He was the perfect mix of male and female. I asked him what his hobbies are, and he said dressing up as a woman and masturbating furiously. I got the impression he was just looking for sex, but so was I. If either of us had thought the other was looking for something serious, we’d have run a mile.That Ollie is more experienced in ethical non-monogamy (ENM) made me feel insecure at first. I felt embarrassed about being new at it. I knew that for Ollie it was a non-negotiable, and worried, what if I decide I can’t do it? There’s a part of me that hasn’t fully worked out if I can do this for ever. What if I wake up one day and want him to be mine? With monogamy, you know what the rules are, but with ENM, there are lots of conversations to be had. We’ve agreed to be open and honest, to use protection, and that if I see him out with someone else, I wouldn’t want them to be intimate in front of me.I thought that if I took penetration off the table, it would be a big issue. But sex with Ollie is pleasure-drivenI don’t believe monogamy works long-term. With my ex, I had trust issues, and he ended up cheating on me. The hiding is the problem, and ENM removes that. There’s no reason not to trust Ollie. But that doesn’t mean I don’t get jealous, and I question whether that jealousy means I’m not cut out for non-monogamy. If I know that Ollie’s on a date, I find it difficult sitting around not knowing what to do with myself. I visualise him having sex with someone else. But then I tell myself that’s learned behaviour, and I need to unlearn it.Sex with Ollie doesn’t compare with the sex I’ve had before. In previous relationships, I didn’t enjoy penetrative sex and found it painful. I thought that if I took penetration off the table it would be a big issue. But sex with Ollie is pleasure-driven, and he makes me feel confident enough to take on a more dominant role, which I find terrifying and exciting. The times I’ve been dominant are the sexiest I’ve ever felt. But I’d struggle if it weren’t for Ollie being so submissive, gender-fluid and in tune with his desires.Share your experienceIf you’re keen to talk to us about your sex lives you can get in touch by filling in the form below.

I’d been in an abusive relationship that ended a year before, and felt damaged, so although I’d been dating I didn’t want to be attached. Establishing intimacy with someone else was difficult at first, but as we got to know each other, and she showed me unrelenting kindness, I began to feel safe with Maya.I don’t believe one person can meet all of another’s needs or wants. But while I’d been in open relationships before, Maya hadn’t, and in the early days she’d get jealous. She would struggle when I saw female-presenting people, but was less bothered when it came to men. We’ve got better at navigating jealousy, which starts with just acknowledging that it exists. I don’t feel jealous about sexual acts and am happy for Maya to tell me anything about the people she sees, but I’d struggle if she developed deeper feelings for someone else.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

She hadn’t thrown up for 24 hours so I took my chance to do a quick run to the chemist to stock up on supplies. My husband worked away during the week, so I had to manage on my own. I was exhausted, carrying the sick kid in my arms, while walking the healthy one along next to me as quickly as I could.The next thing I know, my supposedly healthy kid stops and vomits all over the floor in the middle of the shopping mall.

But what if quitters are happier and healthier?Sun 16 Nov 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 16 Nov 2025 16.23 ESTShareHave you ever heard yourself saying “I’m going to do this if it kills me”? As the pensioners at my gym can attest, it’s what I hiss every time I’m there, attempting slowly and laboriously to get myself a millimetre closer to doing the splits.But what if it actuallyiskilling me? Not the groin strain, problematic as that is, but because I’ve just read inNew Scientistthat giving up is good for you, while grinding on isn’t. One study showed that people who “struggled to disengage from unfulfilling goals” had higher levels of cortisol and inflammatory molecules. “The result,” the article explained, “could be a heightened susceptibility to all kinds of conditions, including cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer’s.” In addition, “goal disengagement” – giving up – correlated with a lower risk of headaches, constipation and eczema; it may even protect against infection. Of131 older adults, those who scored highly on a giving up scale (asking how easily they stopped fixating on unfulfilling goals and pivoted to others) got fewer colds.It’s a kick in the teeth for self-optimising strivers, but it feels odd even if you’re notthe locked-in, 4am ice bath type. We’re taught from infancy that perseverance is a moral virtue and that persistence pays – it’s something everyone internalises, I think, and who doesn’t like a “triumph over adversity” arc?Plus, in the age of influencers, grit and #goals are served up in transformation reels, training programmes and motivational quotes. God, the quotes: you lose 100% of the shots you don’t take; nothing worth having comes easy. (Investigating the quote glut, I’ve realisedThomas Edison was a one-man inspo factory; sample saying: “Our greatest weakness lies in giving up.” He should have invented the podcast.) Instinctively, it feels right that striving is – eventually – rewarded.But in real life, you can strive and still fail; it’s pretty standard, actually. I can see it’s emotionally healthy to grasp that, and move on. Last year a New Yorker headline,Should you just give up?, dropped into my inbox at a tired moment and and I imagined it being whispered seductively in my ear. The piece discussedOliver Burkeman’s Meditation for Mortals, which argues that our unrealistic striving represents a refusal to accept our limitations and finite lives; we’d be happier being more realistic about what we can achieve. Having mental flexibility and siting your self-worth in stuff other than self-imposed achievements is clearly saner. And quitters seem happier, too: they reporthigher life satisfactionand areless likely to suffer anxiety. It’s hardly surprising that has knock-on effects on physical health.So is the answer to that New Yorker question “yes”, we should sign up for giving up, regardless of what Thomas Edison would think? Despite the evidence, I’m struggling with the idea of renouncing my goals. They are, currently: 1) write a novel; 2) join the metropolitan elite; 3) do the splits.These reflect quite deep aspirations. I’ve assumed I’ll write a novel since I was a child; I think most voracious readers do and I don’t know who I am if I never manage it. Number two sounds silly, but after several very isolated decades, I developed a yearning to be the kind of person who not only goes to parties with urbane, Radio-4-famous people, but shines at them. Three, I suppose, is about turning 50 and wanting to fight the sense that I’m just a bag of rapidly failing flesh. They all tap into insecurities, disappointments and unfulfilled ideas of who I “should” be, and it’s hard giving up on that stuff.But with the knowledge that I’m doing myself no good, I’m considering whether, and how, to call it quits. I have no imagination, so it’s probably time to retire the nonexistent novel, but maybe I can become a better, braver writer? I know I’ll never make Amol Rajan laugh, either, but for the first time in my adult life, I have a lovely group of friends near me – seeing them regularly will make me happier than standing awkwardly in the corner at a party full of strangers.But not all goals need to be abandoned. I’m hypermobile and bitterly determined: dignity be damned, I’ll do the splits one day.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsFitnessOpinionHealthcommentShareReuse this content"

A senior White House sourcetoldESPN: “It’s what the president wants, and it will probably happen.”The giant $300m ballroom that Trump is adding to the White House iscalled“the President Donald J Trump Ballroom” on the list of donors to the project, and senior administration officials told ABC the name was likely to stick – though Trump has since said he is not planning to name it after himself.Still, Trump is moving to immortalize himself with his name etched far and wide.This is what fascist dictators have done when in power. Stalin, Hitler and Mussolini built monuments to glorify themselves so they’d be exalted in history.Democracies prefer to memorialize their heroes after they’ve died, and only if the public wants them commemorated.Trump deserves to be remembered – but not as a hero. To the contrary: it is our solemn duty to ensure he is remembered for all he has done and may still do to destroy American democracy.He must be remembered as the president who claimed without evidence that an election was “stolen” from him. Who then instigated a coup attempt that included false electors and was followed by an assault on the US Capitol that resulted in five deaths and injuries to 174 police officers.He should be remembered as the president who, after being re-elected, tried to erase the nation’s memory of what he had done by pardoning1,600 peopleconnected with the Capitol attack and77 who were accusedof trying to overturn the 2020 election. Hecalled the rioters “patriots”.He must be remembered as the president who then usurped the powers of Congress. Who denied people due process of law. Who prosecuted his political opponents. Who violated international law by killing people he labeled enemy combatants. Who sent the military into American cities over the objections of their mayors and governors.We must not allow Trump to erase this history with false tributes to himself, etched into silver, marble or granite.Instead, after he is gone, a monument should be erected to remind future generations of Trump’s treachery and the treachery of officials who supported him.It would be a simple building constructed of iron and cement, containing the records of his attacks on democracy and the names of everyone who aided him.Over its doorway would be the words “Trump’s Treason”.It would be situated on the White House lawn where the Trump ballroom (since demolished) once stood. It would face outward toward Pennsylvania Avenue so that families visiting the nation’s capital – including those commemorating the 500th anniversary of the US – have easy access, and will long remember this catastrophe.Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.

The authors call for the use of these “RPI-plus” contracts to be strictly limited by regulators.Elsewhere, the nature of the rip-off may be harder to detect. There may be many players, apparently competing hard, but the baffling complexity of the products on offer, and the faff of comparing these and switching, mean only the keenest consumers are getting a fair deal.This is at heart a problem of “information asymmetry”: companies are able to exploit the fact that they know much more than their customers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They highlighted the phenomenon of “shrouding”, whereby consumers are unable to see all the information they need to make decisions – because of hidden charges, for example.Since Labour came to power, Reeves has repeatedly urged the nation’s army of regulators to take more account of economic growth. She has suggested that means they should“tear down regulatory barriers”and get rid of the dreaded “red tape”.Sissons and Springford argue, however, that regulators may need to be better resourced and more interventionist, to make markets work better to the benefit of consumers and the economy.As well as restricting the use of those RPI-plus contracts, they set out a series of radical proposals. These include a new government-enforced rule that any service you can subscribe to online, you can cancel online, too.Auto-renewing contracts, where consumers end up stuck with their existing provider unless they act by a certain deadline, should not be the norm, they argue – aside from perhaps in essential areas such as car insurance.In some markets, the pair suggest, regulators could even draw up definitions of a few standard products – plain vanilla insurance contracts, with a set excess and very few exemptions, for example.That could allow companies to compete to provide these on the basis of price and service – instead of baffling consumers with byzantine small print.Aside from workers’ rights, Labour’s language on regulation has tended to follow the laissez-faire playbook of the Tories – Reeves has even said overbearing rules are a“boot on the neck”of businesses.But it will take better, not less, regulation to foster more dynamic markets for the services consumers rely on, and stop them being shortchanged.Explore more on these topicsRegulatorsEconomics viewpointUK cost of living crisisServices sectorEconomicsConsumer affairsMobile phonesInsurancecommentShareReuse this content"

Just ask Margaret AtwoodRhiannon Lucy CosslettIn a culture of therapy-approved ‘forgiveness’, the author’s new memoir shows how hilarious long-delayed vengeance can beSun 16 Nov 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 16 Nov 2025 12.07 ESTShare“Alot of people have died, so I can actually say these things without destroying somebody’s life. Except for the people whose lives I wish to destroy.” Thus spake Margaret Atwood in arecent interviewabout Book of Lives: A Memoir of Sorts, in a clip that has gone viral. “They deserve it,” she says, of the people she hasn’t said such nice things about. Asked if she likes holding a grudge, she replied: “I don’t have a choice. I’m a Scorpio.”Part of the clip’s appeal is Atwood’s icily sardonic delivery: you can understand why a recent review of her autobiography describes her as “a literary mafia don”, reminding those who have crossed her that she knows who they are, even if they remain unnamed, or pointing out that they may well be dead by now anyway. It reminds me a bit of the writer who once said to me: “If you wait by the bend in the river long enough, the bodies of your enemies will eventually float past”. Not a Buddhist proverb, for obvious reasons.It’s that same wry acknowledgment of the supposed wrongness of one’s own grudge-holding that makes Book of Lives so funny. From Atwood’s response to one hatchet job being the immortal words: “Piss up a rope, wanker”, to her account of hiring an exorcist to banish the possible ghost of her husband’s ex-wife, the woman who unfairly labelled her a “homewrecker”, her vengeance is too hilarious to be judged entirely cold.Though is it revenge, to name and shame those who have wronged us, in the telling of our own stories? There’s a notion that to bear a grudge is somehow petty, and to a certain extent, it is public delight in that pettiness that has made the clip of Atwood take off online. Perhaps it’s the notion that prize-winning, household-name authors should be above such feelings, that there is a certain glee, not to mention comfort in discovering that, like the rest of us, they are nurturing a mental “shit list” of people who have hurt them.I suspect that it’s more than that. In today’s therapy-led culture of forgiveness, closure and moving on, bearing a grudge simply isn’t the done thing. It’s all about processing the crimes that have been done to us and liberating ourselves from the supposed toxicity of our ongoing resentments. We meditate and try to wish “loving kindness” even to those who have been cruel to us. Resentment is unhealthy, supposedly, and makes us bitter. We are supposed to “let it go”. But what if we can’t? Furthermore, what if we don’t want to? What if all this pressure to forgive becomes an additional burden? “I’m trying so hard, but I just can’t forgive her”, a friend said recently, of her narcissistic mother. “Why do you have to forgive her?” I said.Maybe I’m a long way from reaching enlightenment. I don’t think bearing a grudge – which carries a mental load ­– is the same thing as accepting that some things still cause us pain. Besides, it is indeed death, not forgiveness, that liberates the memoirist. Now that they can’t sue you, you can finally have your say, without having to dress it all up as fiction – as Atwood said she did in Cat’s Eye, hermasterful novelabout the lifelong impact of bullying between girls. “It was true that parts of the novel were autobiographical,” Atwood now writes. “I avoided saying so because the chief perp was still alive: she became a teenage friend and we’d kept in touch. But now, she and her immediate family are all dead.” The bully’s name was Sandra.In Cat’s Eye, the bully is Cordelia, and women who have their own Cordelias still break down in tears when they meet Atwood. Such is the legacy of girl-on-girl cruelty, and the recognition that reading Cat’s Eye provokes. My mother gave me a copy of it during my own awful time with bullies. Still, when I think of my first year of secondary school, the image that comes to mind is that of the dark, glacial toilet block in which I’d hide at breaktime, and its blue walls (I have always hated blue walls). I have had many years of therapy. Like Atwood, I understand that the person who bullied me was damaged. Understanding isn’t forgiveness, though, and it doesn’t surprise me that so many people struggle with the latter when their bullies later reach out to them in search of absolution.Atwood may ham up the revenge angle – it’s great fun and excellent marketing. She notes that bearing a grudge isn’t an especially attractive thing in a person (“I struggle against it, but not very hard”). At the same time, her naming of Sandra doesn’t feel petty or gleeful at all. She avoided doing so sooner to avoid hurting her.To be bullied as a child is to feel great shame, and to tell the truth is, I believe, its radical antidote. As someone who has written a memoir herself, I know it’s a process that, when done well, is a continual act of self-interrogation: why am I telling this story? You can always tell when a writer is simply score-settling. In the Book of Lives, something deeper is going on, rooted in the understanding that a long life, even a highly successful one, will always have moments of pain. It doesn’t mean that the pain can’t be funny. Laughing is, after all, all part of the process.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Britain is said to have objected to repeated, lethal US airstrikes on alleged smugglers off Venezuela’s coast – which have been widely condemned asillegal extrajudicial killingsamounting to murder.The strikes appear to foreshadow directUS attacks on Venezuelaitself. Trump makes no secret of his wish to topple Nicolás Maduro’s authoritarian, ostensibly leftist regime. Most Venezuelans support this aim, but not the means. Regime change forcibly imposed by a foreign power contravenes international law, unless it is authorised by the UN or undertaken in self-defence as a last resort. Legal or not, it never ends well.The US lacks apersuasive justificationfor war, despite Trump’s fanciful portrayal of Maduro, and Latin American cartel bosses, as“narco-terrorists”with whom he deems the US to be at war. But Trump doesn’t care. He believes that he and his country are above the law, that might makes right. Call it by its name: this is exactly the kind of brash, monarchic imperialism that the New World colonists famously rebelled against.The self-aggrandising, regionally expansionist outlook of the second Trump administration is the most striking recent manifestation of the new eraof state lawlessnessthat has taken hold around the world. The concept of a common rulebook and joint action to tackle shared global problems has been scorned. In Ukraine, Vladimir Putin has taken state lawlessness to new extremes – and no one seems able or willing to stop him.Brutish, bullying, imperialistic: the Ugly American is back | Steven GreenhouseRead moreTwo rapidly developing conflicts may soon drive home the dangers. One is the anticipated US assault on Venezuela, which Trump, as arrogant as any pith-helmeted 19th-century empire-builder, could trigger imminently. The other is the prospective reigniting of the summer’sunfinished Israel-Iran waralongside a renewed Israeli offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon – conflagrations that could be much worse this time.Trump, as usual, has no plan forVenezuela, no thought for the “day after”. Like George W Bush in Iraq in 2003, he seems to think functioning democracy will somehow magically materialise in a post-coup Caracas. In any case, he does not value representative governance per se–nor the security and prosperity of Venezuelans. Of greater interest are the country’s oil, gas and minerals, and scoring an easy win.A questionable precedent, bruited about in Washington, is the1989 US invasionthat overthrew Panama’s dictator, Manuel Noriega – also accused of drug trafficking. Trump should beware. Operation Just Cause was not straightforward. Several hundred civilians, and some US troops, died. Venezuela is a much bigger, less easily subjugated country.I reported first-hand on the Panama crisis for the Guardian. Much went wrong then for the “piranhas” –Noriega’s name for the invaders– and could do so again. As ever, it’s political. In 1989, the newly elected George HW Bush needed a victory in his signature presidential “war on drugs”. Noriega, a former CIA informant, knew too much; Bush, a former CIA director, wanted him silenced. Demonising Maduro helps Trump argue that he, too, is beating the drug barons. And limited military operations in Venezuela could distract attention from his own skeleton in the cupboard: Jeffrey Epstein.Problems of state lawlessness in the Middle East centre principally on Israel and Iran. Forced reluctantly into a Gaza ceasefire (which it is failing to honour), Benjamin Netanyahu’s violence-addicted, peace-averse regime is seeking new targets. Record numbers of mostly unchecked, unpunishedJewish settler attackson West Bank Palestinians, notably on food andwater supplies, recall genocidal Israeli actions in Gaza.View image in fullscreenA screengrab from a video posted by Pete Hegseth shows what the US defence secretary says is a strike on a vessel carrying narcotics in the Pacific on 9 November 2025.Photograph: US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth’s X Account/AFP/Getty ImagesIsrael is bombingsouthern Lebanonagain, too, claiming the Lebanese army has failed to disarm Hezbollah after last year’s truce and that the Iran-backed fighters are regrouping. “The result of this reality is a growing likelihood that at some point in the coming weeks, Israel’s attacks on Lebanon will escalate into a full-scale war once again,” theHaaretz newspapercommentator Amir Tibon warned.Resumed, direct warfare between Israel and Iran is the biggest worry. Trump claimed in June that Iran’s nuclear facilities had been“obliterated”. He lied. Tellingly, both he and Netanyahu have since threatened to strike again. Analysts suggest another Israeli onslaught is inevitable, given unallayed suspicions about Iran’snuclear capabilities, the collapse of negotiations and UN inspections, and the reimposition of tougher sanctions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But their very vulnerability could render Tehran’s mullahs more dangerous. Iran is reportedly building thousands of missiles. If attacked, it may hit back much harder next time.A repeat bout of unprovoked, US-backed Israeli aggression would be another instance of extreme state lawlessness. Yet who would stop it? Not the UN. Not the international courts. Not a cowed Europe, nor Trump-appeasing Arab states. A similarly woeful saga of fecklessness, indifference and impotence could unfold if, say, China were to invade Taiwan. Or ifRussia invaded Moldova, or even Nato member Estonia.This is the world as it is now. Rampant state lawlessness finds ultimate expression in an accelerating global nuclear weapons race unconstrained by arms control treaties or common sense. Trump isresuming nuclear tests; Putin is following suit. Xi Jinping flaunts China’s atomic arsenal; Netanyahu conceals Israel’s. Indian and Pakistani leaders threaten mutual destruction. North Korea’s Kim Jong-un is building nukes like there’s no tomorrow.Which, at this rate, there may not be. They’re all rogue states now.

But it can lead to deeper understandings of the worldSun 16 Nov 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 16 Nov 2025 17.55 ESTShare“Why me?” “Why evil?” and “Why God?”According to theologian and psychologistKaren McClintock, these are the three key questions that a person will ask of their faith in the aftermath of trauma.Normally, a person goes about their life, making meaning of everything that happens to them, slotting it into a world that makes sense. PsychologistBessel van der Kolkexplains that a traumatic event short circuits this process. Trauma overwhelms a person, rendering them unable, in the moment, to integrate the event into their lives.In the context of spirituality, trauma is a hand grenade, exploding two of spirituality’s primary functions: to help a person make meaning and feel at home in the universe. A survivor of trauma has two choices. They can develop a new way of making sense of the world; or live with existential despair, believing that nothing can ever make sense again.Don’t believe everything you see: why Buddhist scepticism is vital in the age of generative AI | Bertin HuynhRead moreFor many years, I opted for the latter. I think of my seven-year-old self, struggling to understand why my sister had been given cancer by a loving God. The cancer was real, ergo God wasn’t. My childhood attempt at making meaning of something as meaningless as my sister’s brain tumour shaped the next 40 years of my life.It’s only recently that I have learned to view my departure from religion through the lens of childhood trauma. PsychologistJudith Hermanwrites that a trauma survivor “stands mute before the emptiness of evil, feeling the insufficiency of any known system of explanation”. A survivor faces the challenge of becoming “a theologian, a philosopher, and a jurist […] to articulate the values and beliefs that she once held and that the trauma destroyed”.ResearchersMaxine Harris and Roger Fallotfirst introduced the idea of “trauma-informed care” in 2001, and described five principles: safety, trust, choice, collaboration and empowerment.Safety includes physical, psychological and spiritual dimensions. Someone who feels spiritually safe feels comfortable to express, explore and yet question their fundamental beliefs and values.Spirituality isn’t rigid dogma. It’s a living, breathing practice that helps make sense of an incomprehensible world | Shadi Khan SaifRead moreI don’t think I ever felt spiritually safe, even before my sister’s diagnosis. I had a child’s understanding of my religion: believe in God, go to heaven; don’t believe in God, go to hell. It was not safe to engage in the questioning and re-framing that the trauma of her illness required.Trauma doesn’t always break a person’s connection to God. For some, it deepens and expands their understanding of their faith. In Leigh Sales’s book Any Ordinary Day,former University of Sydney vice-chancellor Michael Spence explains that the loss of his wife to cancer deepened his Anglican faith. After she died, he maintained a list of the ways in which he felt that God was still looking out for him. Spence’s religious worldview did not shatter; it expanded to include his grief.It’s only in the past 10 years that I have felt spiritually safe enough to find a position closer to, say, Sam Harris than Richard Dawkins. Years of therapy and the good fortune of a loving family of my own have enabled me to engage with the possibility that there might be more to the universe than cosmic chaos.God and I had a pretty acrimonious divorce the first time around. I don’t use the word “god” and I don’t believe in a deity. But I am open to mystery. I am softening towards the idea that the universe may bend towards life. I don’t have to forgive a god if I don’t believe in one. But that doesn’t mean I can’t forgive myself.Jackie Bailey is the author of The Eulogy, the winner of the 2023 NSW Premier’s literary multicultural award.

The administration has moved beyond verbal attacks on civil society. It is now deploying coercive force against civic organizations and their leaders. While the attacks may seem contained for now, they are likely to grow. Research on other cases of democratic backsliding suggests that once coercion begins, regardless of how limited at first, escalation follows.In the months ahead, we should thus expect more, not less, government repression. To meet it, pro-democracy organizations, universities and law firms must bravely speak up against abuses of power while building the broadest possible coalition to stand up for fundamental rights. Community, labor and advocacy groups must also train their ranks in strategic nonviolence to resist provocations from the state and make repression backfire.The evidence that coercion has started is abundant. Trump’s campaign promise was to use coercion primarily on undocumented immigrants. Since January, targets have multiplied. The administration began with brazen assertions of executive power to cow universities and law firms. Former FBI director James Comey and the New York attorney general, Letitia James, who tried to hold Trump to account, have been indicted (they areseeking to have the cases dismissed). The administration hasdesignated “antifa”(a nonexistent organization) a “domestic terror” organization. National guard troops and other federal forces have been deployed in cities against the will of governors and mayors, leading to confrontations that become violent. All of this comes in addition to the turbo-charging of ICE, which is now usinghelicopters and chemical agentsto raid communities. US citizens seen as obstructing ICE operations are being detained.These escalations are a dire sign for democracy, which has always been about much more than elections. A healthy democracy protects and promotes civil society – civic associations, PTAs, business associations, universities and more – as a space for public dialogue, policy debate and resisting abuses of power. When the government begins to attack civil society, without due process, it is rolling back democracy.The use of security forces to contain civil society is one of the clearest signs of democratic backsliding and is straight out of the authoritarian playbook.In most cases of democratic backsliding, presidents don’t start out with the intention to repress massively. But they easily end up creating massive repressive machines. Vladimir Putin in Russia, Hugo Chávez in Venezuela and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Turkey are perfect examples. It is important to understand how these repressive machines grow.The cycle typically begins when a leader articulates extreme policy goals designed to overhaul the system wholesale. Many times, these maximalist policy goals also come in a package of threat inflation. The president exaggerates the magnitude of some domestic danger. It could be crime, terrorism, corruption, even the wrong ideology. Suddenly, there is an existential scourge to fight. Extreme policies and threat inflation typically produce societal rejection (and admiration by supporters). The president then begins to see the rejection coming from sectors of society as more evidence of the threat they are obsessed with. The response is to boost the security apparatus even more. That step, of course, begets more societal resistance.At this point, the country enters into an insecurity trap. The president begins to feel increasingly unsafe and more justified in deploying coercion. The state sees itself as the victim of societal attacks, rather than the instigator. A new logic emerges; the president’s goal expands. The new aim is to not only defeat the resistance, but also to protect the country’s own security forces. This leads the president to grant more impunity to his security forces, and of course, expand their mandate. What started out as an ambitious agenda for change escalates into coercive imposition. A machine designed to generate law and order easily morphs into an organization operating under lawlessness.Putin, Chávez, and Erdoğan followed this pattern. All three started out as bold reformers and threat inflators, focusing on corruption and disintegration (Putin), Kurdish terrorism and secularism (Erdoğan), party collusion and capitalism (Chávez). They initially relied on the intelligence and law enforcement agencies inherited from the democratic era. But as power grabs expanded and protests escalated, culminating in the 2011 Bolotnaya protests in Russia, the 2007 student protests in Venezuela, and the 2013 Gezi Park protests in Turkey, plans changed. In Russia and Turkey, the old intelligence organizations (the federal security service and national intelligence organization, respectively) were fortified, personalized, and turned more secretive. In Venezuela, they were shut down (the intelligence agency know as Disip) and replaced with a meaner force (the Sebin). In addition, these regimes created supplementary security forces:Rosgvardiyain Russia in 2016,colectivosin Venezuela in the mid-2000s, and Sadat, a private paramilitary organization that works closely with the state to conduct security operations in Turkey. Soon, the focus shifted: intelligence and security forces were instructed to focus on all forms of opposition.Trump could easily embark on a similar path. The Trump administration has advanced a litany of extreme policies in just nine months, ranging from gutting entire federal agencies and driving out hundreds of thousands of federal government workers toinstalling vaccine skepticsat major health agencies to moving tostrip hundreds of thousands of immigrantsof their legal status and trying to end birthright citizenship, which is guaranteed by the 14th amendment.The attempt to push extremist policies leads to power concentration by the executive branch, along with bullying of institutions. Trump’s first administration moved in that direction, leading to protests. Trump tried to contain protests with democracy-era security institutions, but many of these organizations resisted Trump’s excesses.In his second term, Trump came back with a bolder reform agenda (Project 2025) and a bolder plan to fortify a relatively new security apparatus, ICE. Wielding the threat of an animated base, he cowed party members who would otherwise have resisted these efforts. Even a US senator andfederal judgeshavespoken openlyabout the fear they face.Power concentration and bullying triggers civil society, and so the cycle begins. Protest in 2025 has far exceeded that in 2017, as scholar Erica Chenoweth’sCrowd Counting Consortium has shown. The No Kings march in June may have been thelargest single-day protestin American history at the time. The October follow-up march was even bigger, withmore than 2,700 protestsacross all 50 states.We may be entering the stage where a cycle of repression begets more repression and the government opts to protect the security apparatus first. The most alarming sign is the administration sending troops to American cities with flimsy justification. This type of escalation is exacerbated when leaders empower non-state violent actors, something we saw Trump do most notably with the mass pardons of January 6 insurrectionists. Without a shift in direction, communities across the country could become powder kegs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

Both capitulation and extremism must be avoided. Capitulating can actually be self-harming. When the law firm Paul Weiss capitulated this year, it lost prominent clients andsenior talent, while others that stood firm won their legal challenges and gainednew business. Philanthropy has provided an even more encouraging example, with more than 700 charitable foundations joining together to publicly“unite in advance”of potential attacks on the sector. Actions like this help hold open the civic space that remains.Community, labor and advocacy groups must also inoculate their members and the communities they represent for what’s coming. Most likely, the administrationwillbe sending more federal troops to more cities to provoke more violence. In those cities, communities will need to be trained not just to organize, but also to engage in strategic nonviolence – maintaining the discipline not to be provoked into violence while bearing witness and taking action. We have seen powerful examples of that in Washington DC, where the group Free DC has undertakenbrilliant ward-by-ward organizingto resist military occupation by training thousands of residents in these methods; in Chicago, where educators and parents have organized toaccompany children homewhen federal agents attacked right outside their school; and in Portland, where protesters have usedanimal costumes and dance musicto mock repressive forces. Efforts like these will need to spread rapidly.Now that state repression is here, pro-democracy forces will need to continue to show their courage by speaking out and building the broadest possible coalition – both nationally and in cities and states under threat – to defend institutions and rights. This strong coalition must be complemented by widespread training in strategic nonviolence to effectively resist the provocations of the state.What’s giving me hope nowDaniel: I am encouraged by the tens of thousands of people who have joinedtrainingson nonviolentstrategic actionsince the beginning of the year, both online and in-person.Javier: I am reassured by the many legal organizations and law firms (many of them quite small!) using the courts to try to defend rights and curb executive branch overreach.Javier Corrales is Dwight W Morrow 1895 professor of political science at Amherst College.

Addressing a gathering of the French far-right party Identité-Libertés, which is led by Marine Le Pen’s niece, Marion Maréchal, Italy’s prime ministerunderlinedthe need to work towards “the unity of the right and the centre-right” adding “I hope that one day this can also happen in France … but that will depend on you.”Ms Meloni knows of what she speaks. Her Brothers of Italy party, which has a lineage going back to postwar neofascist movements, became hegemonic under her leadership by mounting a reverse takeover of the Italian right. Less than a decade ago, itscoreda marginal 4% in a general election. Currently, itstandsat 31% in the polls. Forza Italia, the centre-right party founded by Silvio Berlusconi and a coalition partner in Ms Meloni’s government, is at 8%.In France, a regularly mobilised “republican front” has seen centre-right voters combine with those on the left to stop Ms Le Pen achieving something similar. But as the conservative Les Républicains party (LR) searches for a way to revive its flagging fortunes, the cordon sanitaire is looking thin and frayed.Last month it was definitively breached in parliament for the first time, as MPspasseda motion put forward by the far right on an immigration-related theme. Senior conservative figures have meanwhile stopped talking about the threat to mainstream French values embodied by Ms Le Pen and her youthful protege, Jordan Bardella. The former LR president Laurent Wauquiez has evenenvisionedpolitical cooperation withSarah Knafo, a rising star in Éric Zemmour’s virulently Islamophobic Reconquête party.Mr Wauquiez and other influential colleagues argue that the chief political threat facing France comes from the supposed extremism of the left. This self-serving line is relentlessly hammered home by the vast multimediaempirebelonging to Vincent Bolloré, the billionaire entrepreneur.Elsewhere, there is evidence of a similar direction of travel. Duringnegotiationsto form the next Dutch government, the centre-right VVD party has declared itself happy to contemplate a coalition including the far right. In Germany’s east,cooperationat a local level between the Christian Democrats and Alternative für Deutschland has become normalised.Echoing the trend, a landmarkvoteat the European parliament last week saw conservative MEPs break protocol and ally with far-right parties to water down climate legislation. As with the French national assembly vote, that was a first. With grim candour, one green MEPobserved: “It’s a shitty sign for European majorities, it is a shitty sign for Europe.”During the rightwing populist wave of recent years, there has been no evidence that a political dividend awaits parties willing to accommodate themselves to a far-right agenda. Rather, the reverse. In the US, moderate Republicanism’s attempt to play with Trumpian fire turned out to be the path to oblivion. A determination tokeepup with Nigel Farage risks delivering the same outcome for the Conservatives in the UK. Nevertheless, ahead of presidential elections in 2027 whose importance cannot be overstated, a growing section of the formerly Gaullist right seems ready to hang on to the coat-tails of Ms Le Pen. For those who value that tradition, and for mainstream European politics, that is a sorry and depressing state of affairs.Explore more on these topicsEuropeOpinionFranceItalyMarine Le PenGiorgia MeloniNetherlandsGermanyeditorialsShareReuse this content"

Proliferation must not be considered inevitableSun 16 Nov 2025 12.30 ESTLast modified on Sun 16 Nov 2025 16.33 ESTShareWhen Eisaku Satō, a former prime minister of Japan, received the Nobel peace prize in 1974 after committing his country to not making nuclear bombs, owning them or allowing them on its territory, heassured the audience: “I have no doubt that this policy will be pursued by all future governments.”Yet last week, Sanae Takaichi, Japan’s new prime minister,declined to saywhether the country that understands the cost of nuclear war better than any other would stand by its commitment – reflecting the bleak broader outlook. Eighty years after the US dropped Little Boyon Hiroshima, incinerating tens of thousands of people, and almost 40 after Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan seriously discussed nuclear abolitionin Reykjavik, the spectre looms once more. Last month, Donald Trump ordered the US militaryto match other countries’ nuclear weapons testing.Vipin Narang and Pranay Vaddi, who worked on nuclear strategy in the Biden administration, warn that arms control has essentially broken down and that the growing risksamount to a “Category 5 hurricane”. Ankit Panda, another noted expert in the field, has publishedThe New Nuclear Age: At the Precipice of Armageddon. Tellingly, the subject has returned to pop culture. Kathryn Bigelow’s new movie A House of Dynamite shows a nuclear attack targeting Chicago.The last nuclear arms control treaty between Russia and the US, New Start, is due to expire in February. For decades the main fear was of terrorists or rogue states such as North Korea; now there is a new great power rivalry. In place of the old standoff between two hegemons comes a more complicated contest, with China massively expanding its capabilities, and broader proliferation. For unsettled US allies such as South Korea and Poland, acquiring their own arsenals is no longer out of the question. The nuclear taboo is wearing thin. The Biden administration believed Vladimir Putincould well follow throughon his nuclear threats in Ukraine.Donald Trumppulled out of the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty, which Russia had been violating, in his first term. In withdrawing from the JCPOA nuclear deal with Iran in 2018, andbombing Iran’s nuclear facilitiesthis year, though it did not have an active weapons programme, he told potential adversaries that the best strategy is North Korea’s: arm yourself as soon as you can. China was content with a relatively modest arsenal for decades after it acquired the bomb; its breakneck expansion reflects its growing global might, but its efforts ramped up after Mr Trump was first elected.Mr Trump’s confusing comments on nuclear tests (prompting counter-threats from Mr Putin) appear toreflect his misunderstandingof Russian systems tests which, though alarming, do not breach the de facto moratorium. A resumption – the US last detonated a warhead in 1992 – wouldprobably be more usefulto adversaries than to the US itself. It would also strengthen suspicions that non-proliferation is window dressing for the maintenance of the nuclear monopoly of a few states, rather than a serious commitment for the sake of humanity.Mr Trump, said totruly fear nuclear war, should instead challenge Mr Putin tomake good on hisproposal of a one-year extension of New Start treaty limits and revive non-proliferation endeavours by championing the comprehensive test ban treaty. The US and China have not ratified it; Russia withdrew ratification. A president aspiring to a Nobel peace prize couldset an examplethat is sorely needed.Explore more on these topicsNuclear weaponsOpinionJapanDonald TrumpUS foreign policyVladimir PutineditorialsShareReuse this content"

Plus letters fromNick Moss, andDr Margherita de Candia andMarianna GriffiniSun 16 Nov 2025 12.48 ESTLast modified on Sun 16 Nov 2025 12.50 ESTShareThe combination of charts showing the spread of Reform UK supporters (Who supports Reform and why?, 13 November), and Aditya Chakrabortty’s typically shrewd and combative commentary (The real Reform voters have been revealed – it’s a slapdash coalition Farage will struggle to hold together, 13 November) represented a rare bright spot in an increasingly bleak political landscape.They provide a clear roadmap towards challenging what too many doomsayers have been presenting as the inevitability of aReform UKvictory at the next general election.The task now for those who are alarmed by the rise of Nigel Farage’s cult is to use these findings to constantly highlight the inherent contradictions within his policies, while remembering the wisdom of one 19th-century political economist who said that philosophers had only interpreted the world, but the task is to change it. Keir Starmer, take note.Les BrightExeter, DevonAditya Chakrabortty suggests that, come a general election, Nigel Farage will have to “cobble together an actual platform, he’ll have to pick a side” from his “curious dish of microwaved Thatcherism, seasoned with a big dash of old Labour”.Reform UK’s policies were already clear in the run-up to the last general election, in its manifesto: “patriotic” education policies; permanent school exclusions; tax relief for private schools; all job seekers to find employment within four months, otherwise benefits will be withdrawn; high-intensity training camps for young offenders; vouchers for private healthcare treatment; making it easier to hire and fire “so that businesses can grow”; and abolishing the renters’ (reform) bill.This is straightforwardly an attack on the working class. What keeps Reform in the game is its ability to outflank the other parties in the race to the bottom on immigration. In a stagnating capitalism, redistribution from the top to the bottom is not on offer – instead we are encouraged to fight among ourselves for the scraps. Reform’s selling point to the working class is that it will put“natives”first. Its selling point to capital is that it will discipline the working class. I think we’ve seen this somewhere before.Nick MossLondonFocusing on Nigel Farage and Giorgia Meloni’s personality risks missing the deeper forces that have shaped the latter’s trajectory in office (Can Nigel Farage emulate success enjoyed by Italy’s far-right Giorgia Meloni?, 9 November).Meloni has moderated not simply because of her past parliamentary experience or personal inclination towards pragmatism and willingness to compromise, but because Italy’s political and institutional environment requires moderation. Coalition government forces Fratelli d’Italia to work with more centrist partners, most notably Forza Italia.EU membership imposes further discipline. Access to Brussels’ post-pandemic recovery funds and the need to maintain Italy’s credibility inEuropehave indeed pushed Meloni to compromise on key issues, regardless of her personal instincts.None of these constraints apply to Reform UK. Britain’s first-past-the-post system discourages coalition building, and a post-Brexit government faces no external checks equivalent to those from the EU. If Farage were to gain power, the forces that tempered Meloni simply wouldn’t exist. That’s why personality-based comparisons risk obscuring crucial differences that matter.Dr Margherita de CandiaLecturer in comparative politics, King’s College LondonMarianna GriffiniAssistant professor in international relations and anthropology, Northeastern University LondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Every day, money is wasted because fragmented public services continue to work in silos and are not organised around the needs of individuals, families and communities. Too little is spent on preventing problems and too much on responding to them.As ministers and officials, we promoted Total Place pilots in 2009-10. They showed that far better outcomes could be achieved for the same money when Whitehall allowed local service leaders to work with local communities across service and budget boundaries. Place-based budgets should once again be put at the centre of public service reform.Michael BichardFormer permanent secretary, Department for EducationJohn DenhamSecretary of state for communities and local government 2009-10Liam Byrne MPChief secretary to the Treasury 2009-10Helen BaileyDirector of public service, HM Treasury 2008-11Demos research shows that an increase in income tax is not only necessary to get the public finances out of the mess, but could avoid broad public opposition if delivered alongside pragmatic taxes on wealth. And reforms to level the playing field like the partnership tax announced this month enjoy voter support from across the political spectrum.It’s the lack of a positive vision that lets this government down. The public won’t get behind tax rises if the government is hesitant to make the case for them. Your editorial (11 November) rightly urged the chancellor to stop digging holes and lay the foundation for a different politics. This budget offers an opportunity to change the narrative in Britain. Offer the public a new deal between citizen and state, founded on fairness, mutual contribution and a concrete promise on delivery.Dan GossResearcherin economic policy, DemosYou report (14 November) that Rachel Reeves is no longer going to raise income tax rates.

I wrote to Joe before my 70th birthday suggesting that, as I had for most of my adult life “suffered” from having the same name, maybe he could send a message to my party.A few weeks later, a package arrived from the US with his CD Hymn for My Soul, on which he had written in silver ink, “Small world – Joe Cocker to Joe Cocker”. Having the same name often led to conversations that would not otherwise have happened. I once arrived in Peru and an airport official told me that he had not heard of Joe Cocker but people kept asking him “Is he really coming?” (Someone must have seen the incoming passenger list.) Before anyone asked, I would say to them that, generally speaking, people were prepared to pay me not to sing.Joe CockerLeominster, HerefordshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

I have to review it. I saw he was not happy. To a certain degree if you have players like Jude who are so competitive they will never like it but my word stands, it is about standards and a commitment and respect to each other. So someone is waiting and we will not change our decision because someone is waving their arms.”Bellingham shook hands with Tuchel as he went off. But Tuchel has repeatedly emphasised the importance of the collective. “Morgan Rogers was for sure not happy when he couldn’t start today because he deserves to play for us and he wants to play all the time,” the German said.“We gave him a bit of a rest because he came with a lot of minutes for his club and played against Serbia.

They were not at their best at Albania but ground out another victory thanks to a late double from Kane, who has surpassed Pelé’s record of 77 international goals.“We just mentioned it in the dressing room,” Tuchel said. “This cherry on top of everything is that he overcomes Pelé today.

To cap a remarkable week in Irish football history, Parrott, the two-goal hero of Portugal’s defeat in Dublin on Thursday, stunned Budapest’s Puskas Arenainto silence, barring the ecstatic scenes among the Irish contingent.Parrott had described Thursday’s defenestration of Cristiano Ronaldo’s team as the best night of his life, only for Sunday to be yet more gloriously dramatic. The former Tottenham trainee, who plays in the Dutch Eredivisie for AZ Alkmaar, would almost certainly not have started Ireland’s double-header had Roma’s Evan Ferguson not injured an ankle.Denmark hit by sickness bug before crunch World Cup qualifier with ScotlandRead moreHis third goal, poked from the grasp of Hungarian goalkeeper Denes Dibusz, came in the sixth minute of injury time, following a deft, falling-leaf finish for his 80th minute equaliser. In the first half, after Daniel Lukacs had scored from a third-minute corner, on 15 minutes Parrott stepped up to coolly slot a penalty, defying a baying, partisan home crowd doing its best to distract him.“I said against Portugal that this is what dreams are made of, but I think tonight, I will never have a better night in my whole life,” Parrott said, after the wild celebrations following his goal and the final whistle. “It is a fairytale. You can’t even dream about something like that. I have no words to describe the emotions right now.”Hungary appeared set fair for the playoffs next March when, in the 37th minute, Barnabas Varga chested the ball down with his back to goal just outside the box, swivelled and unleashed a stunning left-foot half volley.As full time approached, with news of Portugal’s 9-1 defeat of Armenia meaning they will head to North America as Group F winners, tension wracked the home team. Liverpool’s Dominik Szoboszlai was continuing his excellent club form but those around him cracked under the pressure Ireland exacted on them. Heimir Hallgrímsson had opted for the same direct tactics that confounded Portugal though Ireland required Caoimhin Kelleher, their keeper, to play his very best, too.Hungary’s attempts to kill off the contest in the closing stages fell spectacularly flat. “They wasted their own time and that’s kind of funny,” said Hallgrímsson, the Icelander who co-managed his home nation at Euro 2016 and then led them at the 2018 World Cup. “Now we need to use this moment and continue improving.”View image in fullscreenIreland players celebrate in front of their disbelieving fans in Hungary.Photograph: Ryan Byrne/Inpho/ShutterstockAfter the substitute Johnny Kenny was denied by Dibusz during a fraught injury-time period, Parrott stole on to Liam Scales’s flicked header to poke home his winner, before being mobbed by exultant teammates and substitutes.Awaiting Ireland in March are two single-leg playoff games to qualify for the United States, Mexico and Canada next June. Should they be successful, Ireland will play their first World Cup finals since reaching the last 16 in 2002. The draw for those playoffs, to be played against other European countries, will be made on Thursday this week.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersRepublic of IrelandHungarymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Italian has now won 31 consecutive matches on the surface dating back to the starring role he played in Italy’s Davis Cup triumph in 2023. At 24 he is the youngest man to defend anATP Finalstitle since Roger Federer in 2004 and just the second man after Novak Djokovic to win this title consecutively without dropping a set.Perhaps most importantly, Sinner struck back after absorbing so many difficult blows in his rivalry with Alcaraz this year. While Sinner has compiled an 85-2 record against the rest of the field dating back to last August, he had lost seven of his past eight matches against Alcaraz, his only victory comingin the Wimbledon final. He will head into the new season having levelled the playing field against his biggest rival.The final months of Sinner’s season, which ends with three titles and a 15-match winning run, have underlined the Italian’s work ethic and desperation to improve. Immediately after hisdefeat by Alcaraz at the US Open, Sinner was transparent about his beliefs that he needed to make significant changes to his game in order to tackle Alcaraz’s unique brand of unpredictable variety.View image in fullscreenJannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz greet each other at the net after the Italian’s victory.Photograph: Marco Bertorello/AFP/Getty ImagesHe has spent the past few months carefully working more drop shots and net forays into his game. After a dire serving display in New York, Sinner made adjustments to his service technique and this week those improvements played a decisive role in this victory. In the face of Alcaraz’s net forays deep in the first-set tie-break, Sinner continued to think clearly under pressure and the significant risks he took behind his second serve on key points paid off.Both players burst into the match serving precisely and eviscerating the ball in their desperation to take the first strike, their combined intensity and quality so much higher than any other match this week. Not even a 10-minute break because of a medical emergency in the crowd, with the spectator eventually being escorted out while conscious and moving, slowed their rapid momentum.After an hour of relentless first‑strike tennis, it looked like Alcaraz might set himself apart with his variation. At 6-5 on Sinner’s serve, he followed up his first drop‑shot of the match, a perfectly timed winner, with an intelligent foray to the net to reach set point. Sinner responded immediately, firing down a spectacular winning 116mph second serve to scupper the Spaniard’s opportunity before serving brilliantly to force a tie-break. At the end of a monumental 79‑minute set, Sinner played with clarity, executing two brilliant lobs over a net rushing Alcaraz to seal the set.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His hamstring was taped up before the second set. Although Alcaraz broke serve early in set two, remaining solid in an erratic Sinner service game, he clearly lacked his usual explosiveness with his forward movement.An even bigger problem for Alcaraz, however, was his desperate rival across the net. As the wild Italian crowd chanted Sinner’s name, the occasion inspired the most expressive version of the Italian, who is usually so composed in the biggest moments. He celebrated epic points by cupping hands to his ears or raising his racket high to the crowd, asking for even more noise from his captive audience. He refused to let the opportunity pass him by, nervelessly shutting the door on Alcaraz in two immense sets to end his season with a perfect result.Explore more on these topicsATP FinalsJannik SinnerCarlos AlcarazTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

The 2012 victory gave rise to optimism at the end of Stuart Lancaster’s first year in charge but the bubble burst when England were thrashed 30-3 by Wales in Cardiff in the following Six Nations.“We don’t want it to be a flash in the pan,” said Ford, who scored 13 points, including two crucial drop-goals after the All Blacks had taken a 12-0 lead, in a virtuoso man-of-the-match performance.“We just wanted to make sure that we get our preparation right and we attack it. And we felt that if we did that, then we could have a good chance of getting the result. That’s just probably where we’re at as a team at the minute. I think the way we’re preparing, there’s a good feeling around the place.”While England’s 2019 victory against the All Blacks was the high point of Jones’s tenure, Borthwick believes there is plenty of room for growth for his current side. “There’s a huge amount of growth,” he said.“If the players continue to strive to develop, remain ambitious with their dreams and then continue to train at the level they do – as eager as they are to improve – then I think there’s a lot of growth. The guys just have utter belief now. If we go down on the scoreboard, I have utter belief in the senior guys that their team becomes composed, resilient and find a way through it.”The Springboks remain the standard bearers but are not scheduled to play England at Twickenham this autumn.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The hosts were 21-0 up and cruising in the second half when a loose Finn Russell pass was seized on by opponents who had been poor until that point.Blair Kinghorn was soon in the sin‑bin and a sensational flurry of five Argentina tries in the final 24 minutes sealed Scotland’s fate. It was all orchestrated in stunning fashion by Santi Carreras of Bath, one of six replacements who appeared together after half-time.Wales humbled by Argentina as Steve Tandy witnesses scale of task aheadRead moreDisappointment generated by inaccuracy and uncertainty is a familiar refrain for home fans but this, a record comeback for Argentina in Test rugby, was far more painful than most.The talent of Scotland’s fly-half, Russell, had terrorised Argentina in a collectively dominant first half. A swivel of the hips or a dart of the eyes had carved the Pumas open but, like it or not, he will be held responsible for this collapse after an extravagant attempted pass, soon after half-time, led to a profound shift.“It’s such a huge momentum swing,” Gregor Townsend, Scotland’s head coach, said of the Russell error that sparked a calamity. “Sometimes you make an error and nothing happens … But for it to flip the field and us to lose a yellow card, it was obviously very costly. That’s down to the actions of others as well, and very good play by Argentina.”Felipe Contepomi, the Argentina head coach, conceded they were “imprecise” before the break, but insisted he was always confident of a contest, saying it was akin to “pounding a rock”.Contepomi said: “I wasn’t angry at half‑time. We knew the challenge we were facing and we said this was going to go for 80 minutes. We felt when we had the ball with long sequences we could hurt them. We started playing, suddenly the momentum shifted and the guys accelerated.”It had all been going so well for Scotland. After Darcy Graham marked his 50th cap pre-match, Russell skilfully created the first try, popping a short pass to the No 8 Jack Dempsey, who ran a perfect line after Juan Cruz Mallía had been sent to the sin-bin.The visitors were cracked open again through Russell’s creativity, this time after a garryowen collected by Graham. Ewan Ashman smashed through a couple of defenders and gave Russell a simple conversion.When Argentina fouled up an attacking lineout Contepomi held his head in his hands. Even when Rory Darge was penalised for a dangerous clear-out, they missed touch with the clearing kick, and Ashman thundered over again. Russell converted and it was 21-0 after 44 minutes. All going well.Contepomi mixed it up two minutes later, unloading six replacements in one hit. Then came that booming, loose pass from Russell with Scotland pushing for the score that would have buried their visitors.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Argentina captain, Julián Montoya, took a scrum and was vindicated when he forced himself over the line. Argentina smelt blood.Rodrigo Isgró soon powered over, then Pedro Rubiolo, with 10 minutes remaining, and from 21-0 down the Pumas had pulled it back to a five‑point game at 24-19. They kept coming. Pablo Matera scored the try that took Argentina ahead, barging over from close range. Fittingly it was Santi Carreras, the architect of the comeback, who converted the decisive try after a television match official check.A turnover in the Scotland 22 then allowed Justo Piccardo, another replacement, to complete Scotland’s misery. Murrayfield was stunned, and Argentina could barely believe it either.“As players we need to take a good hard look at ourselves,” the Scotland captain, Sione Tuipulotu, said. “If we had scored one more try the floodgates could have opened … We deserve to cop it a bit as a playing group. That performance just was not good enough and we have to own that.”Argentina,after thrashing Waleslast weekend and now shocking Scotland with this classic comeback, face England at Twickenham on Sunday. “It will be a different challenge next week against England,” Contepomi said. “The challenge will be huge because they are probably the most on-form team in the world at the moment, bar maybe South Africa. On form, probably England.”Townsend was left to protest that mental fragility is not an issue for this team. “Collectively and individually, we have to do better,” he said.

We rally so much around his spirit and around his quotes and everything he meant for European golf. To equal him last year was cool, but to surpass him this year, I didn’t get this far in my dreams, so it’s very cool.”McIlroy also set his sights on Montgomerie’s mark, adding: “I want it [eight titles], of course I do. I was the first Europeanto win the grand slamand I would love to be the European with the most wins in terms of the order of merit and season-long races.”Fitzpatrick had started the final day among a group of six players who were one shot behind McIlroy and Denmark’s Rasmus Neergaard-Petersen. McIlroy began the final round in style and moved clear at the top of the leaderboard after going four under through the first seven holes.But, as he stumbled, Fitzpatrick put himself in pole position for victory by landing a birdie at the last to complete a bogey-free round of 66 to leave McIlroy and Neergaard-Petersen requiring eagles to force a playoff.While the Dane faltered, the Masters champion sank his putt from about 15 feet to set up the playoff, but it was Fitzpatrick who prevailed after both players missed the green with their approach shots.Fitzpatrick said: “He [McIlroy] is one of only a few where you know you are going to a playoff. You are two clear with one to play and you know you are going to a playoff because he did it again in typical Rory fashion.“I struggled at the start of the year, obviously, and to turn it round in the summer like I did, have the Ryder Cup like I did which is hard to top, but the way I played today – there was one bad shot all day. So proud of myself.”Tommy Fleetwood was in a group of four players, including Neergaard-Petersen, who tied for third place after a final round 67, while Tyrrell Hatton, the only man to start the final day with a faint hope of denying McIlroy the Race to Dubai title, fell away to finish in a share of 14th.Explore more on these topicsGolfRory McIlroySeve BallesterosEuropean TournewsShareReuse this content"

Final Demand, one of the best novice hurdlers last season, made a flawless debut over fences and suddenly Mullins’s squad for the Grade Ones at the festival back here in March is beginning to take shape.The style and strength of his 13-length defeat of Wingmen – also a useful novice hurdler last year – was such that he is now just 6-4 for the Brown Advisory Novice Chase at the festival.Panic Attack’s Gold Cup victory at Cheltenham a boost for Skelton’s title hopesRead more“He was just so natural, wasn’t he?” Mullins said afterwards. “Jumping down the back, taking fences in his stride. I got a little worried coming to the third-last that he was getting a little tired, and I thought Jack [Kennedy, on Wingmen] was getting a little closer. When they were over the third-last, Paul just gave him a squeeze and a shake, and next thing he just started opening up again. His jumping was so natural, it was fantastic.”The final day of the November meeting is as close as Cheltenham gets to a “family” day – there was even a mascot race to keep the crowd entertained – but there was a distinct hint of quality about the way Joe Tizzard’s Alexei accelerated six lengths clear of the runner-up after the last in the card’s feature event, the Greatwood Handicap Hurdle.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Monday tipsShowPlumpton12.50 Fountains Blenhein 1.20 Clear Storm 1.50 Alto Alto 2.20 Listentoyourheart (nap) 2.50 Final Straw 3.19 Ballyfinn 3.50 BelcamoLeicester1.10 Maccarellu 1.40 Mind Hunter 2.09 Trad Jazz 2.40 Little Venice 3.10 Island Bridge 3.40 Wind Your Neck InExeter1.30 Harry Lowes 2.00 Lulamba 2.30 A Path To Ronda 3.00 Denemethy (nb) 3.30 Mythe Bridge 4.00 Jakar Du MoulinNewcastle3.35 Savvy Victory 4.10 Ilraawi 4.40 Light The Night Up 5.10 Parole Officer 5.40 Applesandpears 6.10 Maelstrom 6.40 La Scanderbeide 7.10 J StreetWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.A scattering of subsequent Grade One winners, both over hurdles and fences, have won this race in the past and the German-bred Alexei even received a 40-1 quote for next year’s Champion Hurdle after following up a win at Ascot earlier this month, though his trainer is taking it one race at a time.“I thought this was the best I’d had him but this was a step up again”, Tizzard said. “I’m just enjoying what he’s doing at the moment.

We did so well last year, that hasn’t just gone away all of a sudden.”Manchester City cruise past United in derby to surge four points clear in WSLRead moreThe Gunners desperately needed a win to maintain any pretence of being title contenders but, despite their dominance at the BetWright Stadium, they could not break through the well-marshalled Spurs defensive structure.Arsenal’s title aspirations were dented last weekend by a frustrating 1-1 home draw with Chelsea, and their Champions League defence took a hit in midweek after a second‑half collapse saw them go from 2-0 up against Bayern Munichto lose 3-2. But results elsewhere across the weekend had fallen kindly with both Manchester United and Chelsea dropping points.The atmosphere at the BetWright Stadium for this north London derby was electric, a record attendance of 6,788 set for Tottenham women at Leyton Orient’s ground.This was the 12th meeting of the two north London sides in the Women’s Super League, with Arsenal claiming nine wins and Spurs just one. But, despite that dominant record, this fixture presented a big test for Arsenal with Spurs thriving under their new manager, Martin Ho, and level on points with their rivals going into this game.That aided the intense environment, the stand of Arsenal fans behind Daphne van Domselaar’s goal embarking on a loud rendition of the anthem North London Forever shortly after kick-off before the home support attempted to drown them out. It felt like a derby of consequence, for perhaps the first time.“If we want more fans to come and watch our games then we have to put in more performances like this,” Ho said. “The fans won’t ask for perfection, but they will ask for a team who work hard and play for the badge.”The home team edged possession in the first half but Arsenal created more chances, though none were gilt-edged. Changes came for the visiting team at the break, earlier than usual, Beth Mead and Katie McCabe switched out for the summer signings Taylor Hinds and Olivia Smith.Smith’s impact was instant, her pace troubling the left‑back Amanda Nildén and her powerful strike from a tight angle testing Lize Kop in goal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It did not give details on where the vessel was traveling from or what organization it was associated with.The latest operation was the 21st known attack on drug boats by the US military sinceearly Septemberin what it has called a justified effort to disrupt the flow of narcotics into the United States.Trump’s targeting of alleged drug vessels strains UK-US intelligence tiesRead moreThe strikes have killed more than 80 people, according to Pentagon figures. Lawmakers inCongress, human rights groups andUS allieshave raised questions about the legality of the attacks.TheTrump administrationhas said it has the legal authority to carry out the strikes, with the justice department providing a legal opinion that justifies them and argues that US military personnel who carry out the operations are immune from prosecution. The administration also has not publicly explained the legal justification for the decision to attack the boats rather than stop them and arrest those on board.The latest deadly strike came as the US navy announced itsmost advanced aircraft carrierhad arrived in the Caribbean Sea on Sunday in a display of power that raised questions about what the new influx of troops and weaponry could signal for the Trump administration’s intentions in South America.The arrival of the USS Gerald R Ford and other warships rounds off the largest buildup of US firepower in the region in generations. With its arrival, the “Operation Southern Spear mission includes nearly a dozen navy ships and about 12,000 sailors and marines.The carrier strike group, which includes squadrons of fighter jets and guided-missile destroyers, transited the Anegada Passage near the British Virgin Islands on Sunday morning, the navy said.Rear Adm Paul Lanzilotta, who commands the strike group, said it will bolster an already large force of American warships to “protect our nation’s security and prosperity against narco-terrorism in the western hemisphere”.Adm Alvin Holsey, the commander who oversees the Caribbean and Latin America, said in a statement that the American forces “stand ready to combat the transnational threats that seek to destabilize our region”.Stakes rise as Trump deploys world’s largest aircraft carrier to the CaribbeanRead moreHolsey, who will retire next month after just a year on the job, said the strike group’s deployment is “a critical step in reinforcing our resolve to protect the security of the western hemisphere and the safety of the American homeland”.InTrinidad and Tobago, which is only 7 miles (11km) from Venezuela at its closest point, government officials said troops have begun “training exercises” with the US military that will run through much of the week.Trinidad and Tobago’s minister of foreign affairs, Sean Sobers, described the joint exercises as the second in less than a month and said they are aimed at tacklingviolentcrimeon the island nation, which has become a stopover point for drug shipments headed to Europe and North America. The prime minister has been a vocal supporter of the US military strikes.The exercises will include marines from the 22nd expeditionary unit, who have been stationed onboard the navy ships that have been looming offVenezuela’s coast for months.Venezuela’s government has described the training exercises as an act of aggression.

Any scheme uncovered in these companies must receive a swift and just response.”In further announcements on Sunday, he said he had instructed the government to submit an “urgent law” to Ukraine’s parliament to bring changes to the composition of a key energy regulator, the National Energy and Utilities Regulatory Commission. He also promised to appoint new leaders at the top of other energy bodies.Ukraine’s anti-corruption bureau announcedlast Monday that it was investigating a criminal gangbehind a scheme whereby Energoatom’s counterparties were forced to pay kickbacks of 10-15% in order to avoid having payments blocked or losing their supplier status. Ukrainian media subsequently reported that one of the senior figures involved was Timur Mindich, a businessman and co-owner of a media production company founded by Zelenskyy before he became president.The reform promises came shortly before Zelenskyy arrived in Athens on Sunday to mark the signing of a deal that would enable Ukraine to import US-supplied liquefied natural gas through the winter. The Ukrainian government is urgently seeking alternatives to compensate for losses caused byrelentless Russian attacks on energy infrastructure.The agreement between Greece’s state-owned gas company, DEPA Commercial, and its Ukrainian counterpart, Naftogaz, will supply Ukraine with US liquefied natural gas via Greece between December 2025 and March 2026.‘This winter under Russian drones, missiles, and daily strikes is a major challenge for Ukraine and for the Ukrainian people,” Zelenskyy posted on X during his visit, where he met the Greek president, Constantine Tassoulas, the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, and the new US ambassador to Greece, Kimberly Guilfoyle. The Ukrainian president expressed his gratitude to his US counterpart, Donald Trump, for the US energy supplied via Greece.Zelenskyy, who is also due to travel to France and Spain this week to sign military aid agreements, is under pressure to prove to European allies that he is serious about tackling corruption, a key condition for Ukraine to become an EU member state.The Finnish president, Alexander Stubb, told the Associated Press news agency that Zelenskyy had to deal quickly with the corruption allegations, but also praised his wartime leadership and urged European leaders to increase financial and military support for Ukraine.The scandal comes at a difficult moment, as Kyiv faces a looming budget shortfall, while the EU isdeadlocked over a €140bn (£124bn) loan for Ukrainebased on Russia’s frozen assets. The Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who is blocking progress in Ukraine’s EU accession talks, has seized on the anti-corruption investigation, claiming it showed “a wartime mafia network” with “countless ties” to Zelenskyy.The corruption allegations have caused outrage across Ukraine and have turned into the worst scandal of Zelenskyy’s presidency. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (Nabu) has released damning audio recordings featuring members of his inner circle.They include the president’sfriend and former business partner Mindich, who fled his Kyiv apartment last Monday hours before investigators came to arrest him. Mindich – who co-founded Zelenskyy’s media production company, Kvartal 95 – escaped to Poland in a taxi. He is believed to be hiding in Israel.Zelenskyy’s reforms announced on Sunday followedhis sacking last week of his justice and energy ministers. Both are implicated in the affair, in which a group of government officials are accused of taking kickbacks from contracts with Energoatom. The former ministers deny wrongdoing.Most commentators believe the illicit scheme was not a one-off, and suggest the scandal may spread to other ministries.Ukrainian media have reportedthat Mindich was allegedly involved in a bid to supply body armour to the defence ministry, via an Israeli firm and shell companies.Rustem Umerov, the secretary to the National Security and Defence Council, confirmed he met Mindich while defence minister. But Umerov, who denies any improper influence, said a contract was terminated and stressed no items were ever delivered.“It’s a huge blow, but the worst part of it is that I’m not sure that we are at the end of it. It might still be unfolding,” one pro-government deputy told the Kyiv Independent newspaper over the weekend.Nabu officials acknowledge Ukraine has a corruption problem, nearly four years after Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion. But they pointed out the scandal had come to light – something that would be unlikely in neighbouring Russia orHungary, they added.“The story isn’t about corruption. It’s about Ukraine’s struggle and fight against corruption,” Oleksandr Abakumov, the head of Nabu’s investigating team, said.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He said Iran did not have any undeclared nuclear sites, and Tehran could not yet allow the UN nuclear inspectorate to visitbombed nuclear sitesfor security reasons.Araghchi is treading a difficult path since Iran does not want be seen to be acting from a position of weakness, and he insisted repeatedly that Iran had emerged stronger militarily and psychologically from the Israeli-US attack on its nuclear sites in June.He was speaking at a security conference in Tehran where he restated that Iran had “an inalienable right to enrich uranium domestically that it will never give up” – the primary cause of the impasse in the previous talks.How effective was the US attack on Iran’s nuclear sites? A visual guideRead moreThe previous five rounds of talks between the US and Iran were brought to an abrupt and acrimonious end on 12 June when Israel, with US support, attacked Iranian nuclear sites in a 12-day war that ended with Donald Trump claiming the sites had been obliterated. Subsequently, European countries used their right to reimpose UN-wide sanctions, but Iran insists they have not had a major impact.Iranian officials said they felt they had reached a “magic solution” to the enrichment issue in previous talks, when it was agreed an Iran-based consortium, with American involvement, could enrich uranium. Both sides would have been able to claim victory since domestic enrichment would have continued and the US could be confident that Iran’s nuclear programme was exclusively peaceful.It had not been agreed in the talks that US nuclear scientists could operate inside Iran, but that was a logical implication of the consortium proposal. Officials claimed three times they had reached agreement with Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff only for the deal to collapse due to “spoilers in Washington”.Iranian officials said the consortium offer was now off the table, but it seems highly likely the proposal could be revived in some form if talks reopen.Trump last week said he had been receiving messages that Iran wanted to reopen negotiations, but privately Iranian officials say they are not yet receiving coherent offers from Washington either directly or from key regional mediators, such as Qatar, Egypt, Oman and Saudi Arabia. The Iranian foreign ministry has been accused of passivity in the face of Trump’s direct instinctive approach, but Tehran says diplomacy is not part of a show.In his speech to the forum, designed to paint the US as a hegemonic power that misuses the concept of international law, Araghchi said the 12-day war showed the conflict could not be ended by military means. He said the attacks started with a US demand for an unconditional Iranian surrender and ended with an unconditional call for a ceasefire.Iran is convinced the initial Israeli attacks were mounted with full US knowledge and coordination, making trust hard to restore.Araghchi said: “It was not Iran that had fled diplomacy; it was America and the western countries that had always sought to impose their will during the negotiations. Diplomacy can still be alive and remains the ultimate solution to resolve disputes, but its criteria, rules and principles must be adhered to.“If they speak to the Iranian people with the language of dignity and respect, they will receive a response in the same language.”In what is described by Iranian officials as the battle of repair and recovery, Araghchi said he was confident Iran’s defence capabilities “are much stronger than before 13 or 14 June of this year. All our capabilities have been restored. We learned many lessons from this war; we have come to know our own weaknesses and the weaknesses of the enemy.”He added: “We successfully passed this war. Our nuclear technology, which they intended to destroy, remains in place. The facilities and equipment, if destroyed, will be rebuilt; what is important is the will of the Iranian people and then the national cohesion that they targeted, but failed to break. The Iranian people have become stronger, more united, and more supportive of the government and the state in the face of this invasion.”Explore more on these topicsIran's nuclear programmeIranUS foreign policyIsraelNuclear weaponsMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The house did not immediately respond to calls, an email and text message on Sunday.The collection of more than 600 lots at auction in western Neuss, near Düsseldorf, included letters written by prisoners from German concentration camps to loved ones at home, Gestapo index cards and other perpetrator documents, the German news agency dpa reported. The auction was titled “the System of Terror”.“For victims of Nazi persecution and Holocaust survivors, this auction is a cynical and shameless undertaking that leaves them outraged and speechless,” Christoph Heubner, an executive vice-president of the International Auschwitz Committee, a Berlin-based group of survivors, said on Saturday.“Their history and the suffering of all those persecuted and murdered by the Nazis is being exploited for commercial gain,” he added. The committee said the names of individuals were identifiable in many of the documents.Heubner said such documents “belong to the families of the victims. They should be displayed in museums or memorial exhibitions and not degraded to mere commodities.”“We urge those responsible at the Felzmann auction house to show some basic decency and cancel the auction,” he added.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

But is it really feasible?Edward Helmorein New YorkSun 16 Nov 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 16 Nov 2025 07.02 ESTShareScott Bessent, the US treasury secretary, returned fromSouth Carolinalast week brandishing a small piece of metal, proclaiming that it was the first rare-earth magnet made in the US in a quarter of a century.It was, he indicated toFox Business, proof that the US is ending “China’s chokehold on our supply chain”. Thanks to theSouth Carolinacompany eVAC’s new rare-earth mineral processing center, Bessent added: “We’re finally becoming independent again.”BreakingChina’s processing and manufacturing dominance in these materials, essential for some semiconductors, batteries and armaments, is a top priority for theTrump administrationthat has made a bet, via tariffs and other economic tools, that it can return the industry to US shores.The world dropped the ball on critical minerals and China pounced. Is it too late for Australia and the US to close the gap?Read moreThose tariffs led China to restrict rare-earth exports to the US and pushedDonald Trumpto sign deals with Australia, Malaysia, Cambodia and Japan.The US andChinahave now brokered a trade truce on rare earths but China, with approximately 70% of global mining and over 90% of global processing capacity, has a head start that Trump will struggle to erode.There’s no easy fix for the US to reset its dependence on Chinese production of minerals critical to national security, semiconductor production, and the transfer of energy production from fossil fuels to wind and solar. The US imported 80% of the rare earths it used in 2024, according to theUS Geological Survey.For some rare-earth minerals such as dysprosium, used in chip production, and samarium, essential to military applications, Chinese refinement dominance rises to 99%. Dysprosium and terbium are used in magnets essential for electric engines in electric vehicles and generators in wind turbines, along with uses in cellphones, high-intensity lighting and nuclear reactors.“These materials are used in electric motors for EV cars but also in guidance systems that have obvious applications for the defense department,” says Adam Webb, head of energy raw materials at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. “Anything that has a decent magnet in it uses rare earths.”Trump’s efforts to reduce the US’s dependence on Chinese production on rare-earth minerals could take years. “‘Rare earths’ is somewhat of a misnomer because they’re not that uncommon in terms of abundance in the earth’s crust,” Webb says, but many deposits, including inUkraine, where Trump made a deal earlier this year, are only in the early stages of extraction.“It’s not that there’s a shortage per se, it’s that China can limit how much is exported,” Webb said, adding that getting export licenses from China can be a lengthy, difficult process.Greenland, another focus of Trump’s attention, and Brazil, are two other countries where there are significant rare-earth deposits. In the continental US, there are deposits inCalifornia, Wyoming and Missouri, with the largest operational mine operating at Mountain Pass, California, about 60 miles from Las Vegas.In July, the Pentagon became the largest shareholder in MP Materials, the operator of the California mine, with plans to open a new “mine-to-magnet” plant, called 10X, to make magnets crucial in F-35 fighter jets, drones and submarines, according to thedepartment.In North America, measured and indicated resources of rare earths were estimated to include 3.6m tons in the US and more than 14m tons in Canada, according to thegeological surveydata – far less than the 44m tons estimated in China.Mirroring direct investment and stakes in the steel industry and US chipmaker Intel, the interior department said it was prepared to makedirect investmentsin critical mineral companies.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is not too late for the US but action is needed now.”Five years on, a scramble to assemble trading alliances around rare earths is accelerating.“In about a year from now, we’ll have so much critical mineral and rare earths that you won’t know what to do with them,” Trump told reporters. That came eight months after Trump demanded $500bn of Ukraine’s minerals to compensate the US for the military aid. In September, the government of Pakistan signed a $500m deal with the American company US Strategic Metals, giving it access to minerals such as antimony and copper.But can the US make up its shortfall and loosen China’s hold on rare-earth supply chains? “The US has taken really significant steps already,” Webb says. The US, he adds, cannot be “self-reliant in the short term because it takes time to bring a mine online and build refining capacity.”Explore more on these topicsCritical mineralsTrump administrationDonald TrumpChinaUkraineSouth CarolinaCaliforniafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Iranians desperate for answers as water dries upAs rainy season fails to bring relief, authorities try cloud seeding – while others across the country pray for a miraclePatrick Wintourin TehranSun 16 Nov 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 16 Nov 2025 12.43 ESTShareWater, and its absence, has become Iran’s national obsession. In the mosques of northern Tehran the imams have been praying for rain, while the meteorologists count down the hours until the weather is forecast to break and rain is finally due to fall from the sky.Forecasts of “rain-producing clouds” are front-page news. More than 50 days have passed since the start of Iran’s rainy season and more than 20 provinces have not yet had a drop. The number of dams that haveless than 5% of their reservoir capacityhad increased from eight to 32, and the crisis has spread from the central plains right across the country.On Sunday, despite some reports of localised rainfall, authorities attempted to take matters into their own hands, launching cloud seeding operations to try to induce rainfall. Cloud seeding involves spraying particles such as silver iodide and salt into clouds from aircraft to trigger rain.View image in fullscreenThe Amir Kabir dam, north-west of Tehran.Photograph: Majid Asgaripour/ReutersIn Tehran, only 1mm of rain has fallen this year, a once-in-a-century event (the capital’s average annual rainfall between 1991 and 2000 was 350mm). All this comes on top offive previous years of drought. The second half of November is normally the snow season in the capital.Snow cover has decreased by 98.6% nationwide compared with the same point last year, and in Tehran the daily temperature has been a balmy 20C. The price of bottled water has escalated and limits are being placed on purchases.All acrossIran, in towns and villages, organised rain prayers have been taking place. Past miracles are recalled, such as the spring of 1944, when wartime Iran was suffering drought and the people of Qom went out into the fields and for three days prayed for rain under the mocking eyes of their British occupier. After the third day, as the crowd scattered, the winds blew and the rail fell.View image in fullscreenPeople praying for rain at the Imamzadeh Saleh shrine in Tehran.Photograph: Majid Asgaripour/ReutersRather than blaming the climate crisis, attention in some quarters has turned to whether this descent into calamity is God sending a disapproving message. The link between “blatant debauchery on our streets” and drought is drawn by Ayatollah Mohsen Araki, a conservative member of the Assembly of Experts.Grand Ayatollah Javadi Amoli warned: “Sometimes cultural problems, social shortcomings and sin take away the grounds for mercy.”Some MPs have also blamed the drought on the Iranian government for failing to enforce the restrictive hijab laws passed by parliament. Supporters of the president, Masoud Pezeshkian, asked in reply: why is Europe, where women are free to expose their hair to the wind, so green? One headline read: “Why do atheist countries have more rain?”View image in fullscreenThe Lavasan River, once considered one of Tehran’s most water-rich rivers, which has largely dried up.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThere is also discussion of what is the right kind of prayer. Dr Abdularin Saroush, a philosophy lecturer, distinguishes three forms of prayer – praise to God, supplication and request.But for those looking for explanations of Iran’s water supply beyond faith and morality, Iranians also take new heed of those officials who warned about the imminence of a crisis in the past but were ignored.‘We must change’: how drought and overextraction of water has run Iran dryRead moreKaveh Madani, the award-winning former deputy head of the Environmental Protection Agency, recalls being told by senior officials not to use alarmist phrases such as “water bankruptcy”. He felt forced to leave the country when there was a crackdown on environmental activists, including himself, and is now the head of the Institute for Water Environment and Health at the United Nations University in Canada. He insists he was neither a prophet nor a fortune teller. But he also recognises how ordinary Iranians are puzzled by what has happened to their climate.“There are questions like: ‘Have the clouds really been stolen?” Madani said. “Does burning diesel cause it not to rain? Is it possible to fertilise the clouds … Is it true that we can evaporate the water of the Persian Gulf and transport it to the Zagros Mountains to make it rain there?”View image in fullscreenWomen praying for rain in Tehran. The president, Masoud Pezeshkian, alarmed many by suggesting the capital’s population may have to be evacuated and moved south.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesHe says that, after the trauma of the Israeli attack in June, Iranians want to know what they can do to save their capital from a second catastrophe. According to Mohsen Ardakani, the director general of Tehran’s provincial waste and company, residents are already responding to appeals, cutting their water consumption by 10% in seven months, but he says a 20% reduction is needed.However, few signs are publicly visible suggesting an emergency campaign to save the capital from imminent disaster.Water rationing of a sortis already under way in Tehran, a city of more than 14 million people, as the water pressure is restricted after midnight. But Ardakani insists he will not resort to cutoffs.Pezeshkian, a leader who has a habit of delivering alarming home truths to his fellow Iranians, grabbed headlines worldwide when he warned the crisis was so serious it imay be necessary by mid-December to evacuate the capital andmove its residents south– remarks that were rejected elsewhere in government as not feasible.View image in fullscreenPeople buying water storage tanks in Tehran.Photograph: Majid Asgaripour/ReutersBut his proposal is not completely rejected as outlandish. Dariush Mokhtari, a senior academic in water resources management, admitted this week a situation may arise when the parts of Tehran most dependent on dam water would have to be evacuated.Mostafa Fadaei Fard, another water resources academic, said: “Is there any city village or camp available to provide temporary or permanent residence for more than 15 million people anywhere in Iran? If it does not rain on other cities and villages of the country by the end of December should the entire country be evacuated?”Mohammad Darwish, a popular Iranian environmentalist and the co-editor of a new book, Environment as Life, believes an environmental movement is growing in Iran, looking for practical solutions to how Iran adapts to the climate crisis.Pezeshkian, by his dramatic warning of Tehran’s evacuation, has at least convinced his fellow Iranians that denial is no longer an option.Explore more on these topicsIranDroughtWaterClimate crisisReligionMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

No NHC forecaster had ever issuedsuch a bold forecastfor rapid strengthening.But Papin had an ace up his sleeve: artificial intelligence in the form of Google’s new DeepMind hurricane model – released for the first time in June. And, as predicted, Melissa did become a storm of astonishing strength that tore through Jamaica.Forecasters at the NHC are increasingly leaning hard on Google DeepMind. On the morning of 25 October, Papin explained in his public discussionand on social mediathatGoogle’s model was a primary reason he was so confident: “Roughly 40/50 Google DeepMind ensemble members show Melissa becoming a Category 5. While I am not ready to forecast that intensity yet given the track uncertainty, that remains a possibility.‘We need help’: devastated Jamaican communities still await aid after Hurricane MelissaRead more“It appears likely that a period of rapid intensification will occur as the storm moves slowly over very warm ocean waters which is the highest oceanic heat content in the entire Atlantic basin.”Google DeepMind isthe first AI model dedicated to hurricanes, and now the first to beat traditional weather forecasters at their own game.Through all 13 Atlantic storms so far this year, Google’s model is the best – even beating human forecasters on track predictions.Melissa eventually made landfall in Jamaica at category 5 strength, one of the strongest landfalls ever documented in nearly two centuries of record-keeping across the Atlantic basin. Papin’s bold forecast likely gave people in Jamaica extra time to prepare for the disaster, possibly saving lives and property.Google DeepMind has been making weather forecastsfor a few years now, and the parent forecast system from which the new hurricane model is derivedalso performed spectacularly wellin diagnosing large-scale weather patterns last year.Google’s model works by spotting patterns that traditional time-intensive physics-based weather models may miss.“They do it much more quickly than their physics-based cousins, and the computing power is less expensive and time consuming,” Michael Lowry, a former NHC forecaster, said.“What this hurricane season has proven in short order is that the newcomer AI weather models are competitive with and, in some cases, more accurate than the slower physics-based weather models we’ve traditionally leaned on,” Lowry said.To be sure, Google DeepMind is an example of machine learning – a technique that has been used in data-heavy sciences like meteorology for years – and is not generative AI like ChatGPT.Machine learning takes mounds of data and pulls out patterns from them in a such a way that its model only takes a few minutes to come up with an answer, and can do so on a desktop computer – in strong contrast to the flagship models that governments have used for decades that can take hours to run and requiresome of the biggest supercomputers in the world.Still, the fact that Google’s model could outperform previous gold-standard legacy models so quickly is nothing short of amazing to meteorologists who have spent their careers trying to forecast the world’s strongest storms.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It struggled with Hurricane Erin earlier this year, as it was also undergoing rapid intensification to category 5 north of the Caribbean.It also struggled with Typhoon Kalmaegi– which made landfall in the Philippines on Monday.In the coming offseason, Franklin said he plans to talk with Google about how it can make the DeepMind output even more helpful for forecasters by providing additional under-the-hood data they can use to assess exactly why it is coming up with the its answers.“The one thing that nags at me is that while these forecasts seem to be really, really good, the output of the model is kind of a black box,” said Franklin.There has never been a private, for-profit company that has produced a top-level weather model which allows researchers a peek into its methods – unlike nearly all other models which are provided free to the public in their entirety by the governments that designed and maintain them. While Google has made top-level output of DeepMindpublicly available in real time on a dedicated website, its methods have still largely been hidden.Google is not alone in starting to use AI to solve difficult weather forecasting problems. The US and European governments also have their own AI weather models in the works – which have also shownimproved skill over previous non-AI versions.The next steps in AI weather forecasts seem to be startup companies taking swings at previously tough-to-solve problems such as sub-seasonal outlooks andbetter advance warnings of tornado outbreaks and flash flooding– and theyare receiving US government funding to do so. One company, WindBorne Systems, is evenlaunching its own weather balloonsto fill the gaps in the US weather-observing network, which has recentlybeen downsized by the Trump administration.Explore more on these topicsGoogleHurricanesArtificial intelligence (AI)Hurricane MelissaNatural disastersUS weathernewsShareReuse this content"

Achieving it alongside our existing targets on climate and sustainability – which are set in law – will require effort on a scale not seen before.“That certainly will not be achieved by scapegoating nature, claiming that it is a ‘blocker’ to housing delivery. We are clear in our report: a healthy environment is essential to building resilient towns and cities.

But thesecretary of state for housing, Steve Reed, told MPsto vote down the changes during a Commons vote on the bill this week.The committee said it had concerns that the legislation as drafted would mean the government would miss its legally defined target to halt the decline of nature by 2030 and reverse it by 2042.The report found that local planning authorities were severely underresourced in ecological skills. It heard evidence that staff atNatural Englandwere “stretched to their limits”, that the skills needed to deliver the ecological aspects of planning reforms “simply do not exist at the scale, quality or capacity that is needed”.This comes as Natural England will take on a major role in planning under the government’s changes. The body will oversee the national nature restoration fund, which will be funded by developers and will enable builders to sidestep environmental obligations at a particular site – even if it is a landscape protected for its wildlife.Critics of the bill have questioned the conflict of interest in giving Natural England new funds from developers while expecting the body to regulate their actions.Explore more on these topicsUK newsThe UK housing crisisNatural EnglandHousingConstruction industryConservationCommunitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

First, I did a walk around everywhere important to me: primary school, secondary, college.” Then he headed to Lewisham shopping centre. “I remember my head was telling me: ‘You’re probably better off doing this.’”He was exhausted by his paranoia, which had grown in tandem with a cannabis habit. Now 29, he first tried marijuana at 14, becoming a daily user by 17. At university, studying event management during the pandemic, he smoked more “because this is how you meet people”, but remembers growing “feelings of suspiciousness”, first towards his housemates, then to his workmates at a part-time office job. He struggled to sleep, “started to isolate”, and cannabis became a way to cope. In the end, smoking three joints a day, he felt he could trust no one.Boyish and smiley in spite of his trauma, he is telling his story at the monthly brunch group of theCannabisClinic for Patients with Psychosis, surrounded by tables full of jelly sweets, fidget toys and colouring books, all designed to take users’ minds off their cravings. Based in Denmark Hill in south London, this is the only clinic in the UK – indeed, its founders believe, anywhere – to offer specialist “dual-diagnosis” support for adults with psychosis who are trying to reduce their cannabis use.That the Cannabis Clinic stands alone in tackling these issues at the same time seems remarkable, given the links that have been established between them.A 2019 studyby King’s College London, published in the Lancet Psychiatry, estimated that across 11 locations in Europe, 12% of new cases of psychosis were linked to the use of high-potency cannabis (meaning anything consisting of 10% or more tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC). In London, where high-potency strains dominate the market, the figure was 30%.A few miles from the clinic, at University Hospital Lewisham, consultant Diego Quattrone, who runs the psychiatric intensive care unit, says that at least 80% of new admissions report cannabis use. He feels the dangers of the drug are overlooked, adding that use is “among the strongest factors associated with violence before and during admission”. Meanwhile, “daily use of high-potency cannabis” is associated with “a distinct subtype of violence driven by psychotic symptoms, such as paranoid delusions and hallucinations”.View image in fullscreenDaria Semikina running a group session at the Cannabis Clinic.Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The GuardianIt is not surprising then that the Cannabis Clinic, which works closely with King’s College London’s Institute of Psychiatry,Psychologyand Neuroscience, reports increased demand for its services. It takes just 16 people at a time, mostly men in their 20s, offering them weekly one-to-one meetings for up to a year, lively weekly online support sessions, and the monthly brunch group we are attending today. Patients on the waiting list (14 currently) are welcome at the brunches, and also get regular reassuring telephone calls.It was the sheer persistence of one woman, Dr Marta Di Forti, a professor of drug use, genetics and psychosis at King’s, that brought the clinic into being, first in a trial by the Maudsley Charity, then with a commission from the South London and MaudsleyNHSfoundation trust. She is its clinical lead, and with two part-time practitioners has helped 90 people since the NHS commission. Of those who completed the clinic’s intervention, 74% have stopped using, and 91% of that grouphave gone back to education or work. Di Forti is devastated that people are now waiting months for the vital one-on-one sessions. Is it dangerous? “Of course,” she says.“It is a huge wasted opportunity. The chances of them getting a severe presentation of their psychosis and needing hospital admission is between three and four times greater.”Isiah has been on the clinic’s waiting list for two months. Despite being taken to hospital that night on the roof after an employee got to him “in the nick of time”, and receiving therapy and medication, he still uses cannabis daily. Overall, he consumes less than he did, and his mental health has improved, but he is unable to stop. No service has supported him in tackling his addiction. Here, he has been encouraged to join group sessions while he waits.View image in fullscreen‘There were moments he could only just about trust me’ … Isiah with his mum, Nicci, at the clinic.Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The GuardianHis mum, Nicci, 53, is with him, sitting close, her eyes revealing how drained she is. Isiah lives at home. She recalls his distressed calls from university. Later, he would tell her that his workmates “were in contact with each other, trying to … harm him”. He had once been a fun-loving teenager keen to take up acting. “I just didn’t recognise my son,” she says. “There were moments he could only just about [trust me].” Both financially and emotionally, his habit haunts them. “He has to come off it,” she says. “Because it’s like the king. It’s ruling everything. It’s there every day.”As we speak, nine service users, predominantly young men, are creating “cravings boxes”, full of items to distract them when needed.This apparently lighthearted task exemplifies the clinic’s stance of tackling the practical hurdles of withdrawal alongside psychological issues, all with as little pressure as possible. Senior practitioner Jodie Lynn explains other approaches. “Sometimes we do role-play: how to have difficult conversations. Some people find it really difficult to set boundaries with their peers. And there are cannabis diaries: we get people to record when they’re having joints, how they were feeling before and afterwards – the triggers.”Sleep and dreaming emerge as an important area. Heavy cannabis users typically never dream. When dreams return as they withdraw, they can be terrifying, which can prove an insurmountable obstacle. “It’s just about supporting them through that,” says Lynn.Many users hear voices, often derogatory, harbour “grandiose beliefs” about their spirituality, powers, even celebrity, and experience visual hallucinations. One-to-one sessions can be online to work around these complexities. “We’re working with people who might be a bit paranoid about coming out of the house,” says Lynn.No one’s psychosis is the same. Aaron, 23, manipulates a black fidget toy. He started smoking at 18 at university and the habit became three joints a day. He describes his psychosis as “dissociation from reality”, “a disregard, like apathy”. This resulted in erratic behaviour that led to him being arrested. “I was loud in public, shouting, running from police.” He was admitted to hospital twice. It is two weekssince he last used.View image in fullscreen‘My patients can’t get hold of low-potency cannabis’ … clinical lead Marta Di Forti (left, standing) with practitioners Daria Semikina and Jodie Lynn with (sitting) peer-support mentor Stacey and a student.Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The GuardianMeanwhile, Kenneth, 31, observes everything intently. He is well-spoken, poised, but insular. His psychosis is dominated by sounds, which often seem to come from inanimate objects. From the age 22 he used every day; now it’s “once or twice” a month. He was using to “socialise, experiment”. To cope? “Without realising it,” he says. “I didn’t think much about why until I came to the clinic.” Making connections is central here.These young people are living in a hotspot. A study in theLancet Psychiatryin 2019 found south London had the highest incidence of psychosis in Europe and identified cannabis as a contributor. But although this part of the capital has a reputation for cannabis consumption, there’s more to this story than the number of users.Cannabis use is declining in England and Wales,according to the Office for National Statistics,and in London it is falling sharply: in 2023-24 only 6.8% of 16- to 59-year-olds had used the drug in the previous year, compared with 14% in 2001-02.However, Di Forti explains, those who do use are doing so more frequently. She points to a large study calledCannabis and Me, led by King’s and published in BMJ Mental Health in August. This questioned 3,389 former and current cannabis users aged over 18. “Fifty per cent were daily users and the overall consumption of cannabis per week was 17 joints.” She says decreased perception of harm is one potential reason, driven in part by the increased use of cannabis for medicinal purposes. While the NHS prescribes for a small number of conditions, some private clinics prescribe much more freely. “‘If cannabis is medicinal it can’t be too bad’: this is something I get all the time from my patients …”I think we are at the beginnings of an epidemicThe high potency of modern cannabis is key. Forty years ago, dried leaf marijuana found in Britain was commonly 3% THC. In London, skunk-like cannabis of an average 14-16% THC accounts for 94% of the street market. “My patients will tell you they can’t get hold of low-potency cannabis even if they wanted to,” she says.Di Forti’s husband is Sir Robin Murray, a professor of psychiatric research at King’s. Talking shop is clearly hard to avoid. “It does dominate our dog walks,” she admits. He describes the situation starkly: “I think we are at the beginnings of an epidemic.”He compares it to when diabetes experts were “banging on” about fast food obesity in the 1980s. “We thought, ‘They’re just exaggerating’ – and it turned out to be true … As cannabis becomes more available, more potent, then we’re going to see more, more and more psychosis.”He cites an increase in lower-level paranoia, too. “Those who are using a lot are more likely to be a bit paranoid. They’re not sufficiently paranoid to get admitted, but they’re sufficiently paranoid to quarrel with colleagues, to be suspicious of friends, to fight with their spouse.”The clinic can feel like a tiny bastion against this rising threat. Yet 20 minutes with Katie and you see its power to change lives. The 46-year-old grew up in care and was only eight when she first tried cannabis. She was a daily user at 12. “I was self-medicating with it for many years,” she says.She heard voices from a young age. “They’re very intrusive, commanding voices that usually tell me to harm myself or other people … to beat people up, stab people, to try and kill myself.”High-strength cannabis increases risk of mental health problemsRead moreSmoking about 20 joints a day by the age of 20, she was then first admitted to hospital. “I was running down the Old Kent Road wearing fluffy pyjamas and nothing on my feet at 2am thinking I was God.” In the following two decades, she was sectioned 50 times. For all the medication and support she received, none of it was targeted at cannabis. Yet a year after finding the clinic, she is now abstinent.She still hears voices “pinging off in my head”, but can live well. “My paranoia was so bad I couldn’t get on a bus or a train, could barely get out of bed and leave my house at my worst … Now I’m here and everywhere,” she says. She is sleeping and eating again.Hers is a seismic transformation. Implemented widely, the clinic’s integrated approach could stem a tide. “I wouldn’t say I’m better, but I’m a lot healthier – I’m able to do a lot more,” she says. “And I’m dying for a sandwich!” At least there are plenty of sweets.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.In the US, you can call or text theNational Suicide Prevention Lifelineon 988, chat on988lifeline.org, ortext HOMEto 741741 to connect with a crisis counselor.

Prayers were said at masses around the country.Simon Harris, the tánaiste, or deputy prime minister, said a “veil of deep sadness has come over our country” and paid tribute to first responders. “One cannot even imagine the extraordinarily difficult and tragic circumstances in which they found themselves working last night as they set about trying to help in the most harrowing of situations,” he said.View image in fullscreenA Garda officer at the scene of the crash on the L3168 just outside Dundalk, County Louth.Photograph: Damien Eagers/PAGardaí appealed to any witnesses who may have seen the crash or had dashcam footage from the area between 8.30pm and 9.15pm on Saturday to contact them.Speaking near the scene of the crash, Supt Liam Geraghty noted that Sunday was World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims. “The events that occurred here last night again are a very clear reminder of how things can change dramatically on our roads in a split second, and the tragedy that brings to families, communities and loved ones,” he said.A total of 157 people had been killed on Irish roads so far this year, a slight increase on the same period last year, said Geraghty.Explore more on these topicsIrelandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Rayner, often considered as a potential successor to Keir Starmer, declined to rule out running for the job or returning to frontline politics, saying she had “not gone away”.However, those close to Rayner, who had been seen as a frontrunner to succeed Starmer until her shock resignation over underpaid stamp duty, say she was significantly shaken by the impact on her family. They said that would be the key factor over whether she would run and that it was nonsense that she was plotting any imminent challenge.One source close to Rayner said she had left her role as housing secretary with a much clearer view of how to implement Labour values in government and would be keen to return to do more. She has recently joined the Tribune group of soft Labour MPs, run by the ex-cabinet minister Louise Haigh, which hopes to grow considerably in influence.Rayner has told allies she would never have attempted to force Starmer to step down and would have run as leader only if he had made his own decision to resign. “The idea she’d want to be in the heart of the storm again right now is for the birds,” one said. “But if things kick off again after the May elections, then who knows.”Speaking to the Daily Mirror in her constituency, Rayner criticised the briefing againstWes Streeting, the health secretary, accused by some allies of Starmer of plotting to challenge the prime minister.“I think Wes has clearly set out his stall after what was clearly a very turbulent couple of days and I think being around here for the last hour just shows you actually that that tittle-tattle in Westminster, it almost looks arrogant when you’ve got real challenges that real people are facing and that’s what we really need to be focusing on,” she said.MPs have long suggested that Rayner and Streeting could do a deal over the leadership, though there is no agreement over who would have the top job.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Inspector Starmer is on the case | Marina HydeRead moreThe home secretary,Shabana Mahmood, also called the past week of leadership speculation “mortifying” and warned her party not to forget the privilege of being in government.Mahmood, speaking on the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, said she hoped Starmer could now draw a line under the speculation. “I think what happened earlier on this week was horribly embarrassing. It’s deeply mortifying for everybody in the government, and I’m pleased that the prime minister has dealt with it,” she said.“I think that everybody needs to draw a line under what’s happened and move on, because actually, we’ve got a really important job to do. We all have important, difficult jobs to do, and it is incumbent on all of us as cabinet ministers to focus on the job.”Mahmood said it was unlikely anyone would be identified as directly responsible for the briefing, after a week of speculation about the position of Morgan McSweeney, the prime minister’s chief of staff.“One of the difficulties of these sorts of briefings, it is very difficult to find out exactly who was responsible, but I hope that the individuals who were responsible, who are now feeling the abject humiliation of what has happened, that that humiliation will serve as a reminder that they should not indulge in a repeat performance,” she said.“The prime minister has made his position very clear. He sets a tone for the government. None of this is acceptable. We all need to focus on the people who put us in government in the first place. It is an incredible privilege to be the government of this country. We are only ever granted a few years at a time, and Labour governments don’t come along that often in the history of this country.

This was a lawful patrol operation conducted by theChinacoast guard to uphold its rights and interests,” the statement said.China and Japan have repeatedly faced off around the islands but the latest activity comes amid an intensifying diplomatic spat after the Japanese prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, told parliament that if China attack democratically ruled Taiwan itcould trigger a military response from Tokyo.That sparked an angry response from Beijing, which has signalled it expects a retraction from Takaichi.Canada says Russia and China are ramping up spy efforts in Arctic regionRead moreChina claims Taiwan as its own territory and intends to annex it under what it terms “reunification”. It has not ruled out the use of force. Taiwan’s government and people overwhelmingly reject the prospect of Chinese rule – preferring to maintain the status quo without explicitly declaring themselves independent, but vowing to defend themselves if necessary.An attack or invasion by China would threaten to spiral into a regional or global conflict, potentially involving the US and other allies including Japan, which has territory just 110km (68 miles) from Taiwan.Senkaku islands mapIn Taiwan, the defence ministry said on Sunday morning that it had detected 30 Chinese military aircraft, seven navy ships and one “official” ship, which was likely the coast guard, operating around the island over the past 24 hours.Maps provided by the ministry showed up to three drones flying between Taiwan and the Japanese islands off its north-east coast, appearing to go particularly close to Yonaguni, the nearest island. Chinese military transits there are not rare, but infrequent, and Chinese military activity in Taiwan’s air defence identification zone generally has been low in recent weeks.Late on Saturday, the ministry said China had been carrying out another “joint combat patrol” to “harass the airspace and sea around us”. It added Taiwan had sent its own aircraft and ships to monitor the situation. Taiwan reports such Chinese patrols a couple of times a month as part of what Taipei says is an ongoing military pressure campaign.Japan has been facing mounting pressure from China since Takaichi made her remarks, with China’s consul general in Osaka prompting a formal protest from Tokyo by commenting that “the dirty head that sticks itself out must be cut off”.Beijing then summoned the Japanese ambassador for the first time in more than two years, and China’s defence ministry declared that any Japanese intervention would be doomed to fail.On Friday,China cautioned its citizens against travelling to Japan, prompting Tokyo to urge Beijing to take “appropriate measures”, though it did not elaborate.Three Chinese airlines said on Saturday that tickets to Japan could be refunded or changed for free.In another escalation, China’s government on Sunday urged its citizens to “carefully reconsider” studying in Japan, citing what it described as an unstable security environment, according to the Kyodo news agency.While the advice does not amount to a ban, a dramatic reduction in the number of Chinese students could have a negative impact on Japanese universities. A record 336,708 foreign nationals were studying in Japan last year, according to the Japan Student Services Organisation. They included more than 123,000 Chinese students – by far the single biggest group.Late on Saturday, a Chinese state media editorial accused Takaichi of staging a political stunt that was “not just dangerously provocative but fundamentally perverse”.“A conflict between Japan and China would not be a limited skirmish; it would likely draw in other powers, including the United States, and could quickly spiral into a large-scale conflict with unimaginable consequences.”The government of Taiwan says only its people can decide its future. Japanese leaders have previously avoided publicly mentioning Taiwan when discussing such scenarios, maintaining a “strategic ambiguity” also favoured by Tokyo’s main security ally, the US.However, China’s ruling Communist party says the unification of Taiwan with the People’s Republic of China is “inevitable”, and casts any opposition to it as escalatory. As it moves towards being capable of military annexation, China has also been escalating its non-military activity andits rhetorictowards Taiwan.The Japanese embassy in Beijing did not immediately respond to a request for comment.With ReutersExplore more on these topicsChinaJapanTaiwanAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Víctor Camacho, a photographer for one of Mexico’s main newspapers, La Jornada, accused police of assaulting him as he covered the rally. “The journalist was kicked while on the ground, with many of those kicks aimed at his face,” the newspaper reported. “One officer … threatened to kill me,” Camacho claimed.There were also reports of disturbances in Mexico’s second-largest city, Guadalajara, where 47 people were detained and 13 people injured, including three police officers, according to authorities.Sheinbaum, who has been in power since October 2024, maintains approval ratings above 70% but has faced criticism of her security policy after several high-profile murders. Mexico’s first female president denounced the violence during a visit to Tabasco state. “We say no to violence,” she told reporters.Many of the protesters held banners and wore hats saluting Carlos Alberto Manzo Rodríguez, the mayor of Uruapan in Michoacán statewho was assassinated on 1 Novemberhaving led a crusade against drug trafficking gangs in his town.Man gropes Mexican president as she speaks to citizens on the streetsRead more“He was killed because he was a man who was sending officers into the mountains to fight delinquents,” said 65-year-old real estate agent Rosa Maria Avila, who had travelled from Michoacán state. “He had the guts to confront them.”Protesters gathered in front of the National Palace, where Sheinbaum lives and works, and knocked down some of the metal fences around the building.Police protecting the compound used teargas and fire extinguishers to contain the protesters. “This is how you should have protected Carlos Manzo,” some of the demonstrators shouted at the security forces.Hundreds of young people threw projectiles at the police, who responded by deploying their shields and also threw objects at the protesters.In the days leading up to Saturday’s protest, Sheinbaum accused rightwing parties of trying to infiltrate the gen Z movement, and of using bots on social media to try to increase attendance.“It is a movement promoted from abroad against the government,” she said.With Agence France-Presse and Associated PressExplore more on these topicsMexicoClaudia SheinbaumAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Ministers have not yet outlined plans for Scunthorpe’s longer-term future.The government set aside £2.5bn for the steel industry in its election manifesto last year, but Kyle confirmed that it has already spent hundreds of millions of pounds of that money to keep operations going at British Steel and another manufacturer, Liberty Steel, whichfell into insolvency in August.Kyle said the government had been forced to change plans as the global steel industry faced a slew of crises.“Britain is operating in a highly complex global environment, which includes, of course, the impact of tariffs, but also the impact of oversupply,” he said. Donald Trump has caused chaos with trade levies, while a huge amount of steel has continued to flood global markets from China as it looks for other markets.Using up the money set aside for the steel industry would probably mean less money for capital investment. Nevertheless, asked if he thought there would be electric arc furnaces in Scunthorpe, Kyle responded: “I do.” He said he would provide more details in the government’s steel strategy.Steelworkers will be cautious of the plans after the experience of Tata Steel, which last yearcut 2,500 jobs at Port Talbot, in south Wales, as it switched to electric arc furnaces. The plan would also require adeal with Jingye, still the legal owner, to walk away.A move away from blast furnaces would also raise questions over the UK’s ability to make virgin steel. Jonathan Reynolds, Kyle’s predecessor as business secretary, repeatedly said the government was taking control of the Scunthorpe site to preserve “primary steelmaking”, the ability to produce steel from iron ore.Alasdair McDiarmid, the assistant general secretary of Community, a union representing steelworkers, said he welcomed “the government’s firm commitment to a just transition”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Electric arc furnaces, by contrast, use electricity to melt down scrap steel, not iron ore.The government is considering investing in a separate facility to turn iron ore intodirect reduced iron(DRI), which is compatible with electric arc furnaces. That DRI could then be produced using clean hydrogen, preserving primary steelmaking ability with much lower carbon emissions. However, industry sources have cast doubt on the financial viability of such an arrangement.Frank Aaskov, the director of energy and climate change policy at UK Steel, a lobby group, said it was “encouraging to see the secretary of state set out a clear future vision for the UK steel industry and British Steel”.He said the steel industry needs “a stronger business environment through lower power prices and robust trade policies”.Kyle spoke to the Guardian from Cardiff, where he was meeting small businesses to hear about productivity improvements using digital technology. He said the government wanted to play a “greater role” in coordinating AI training for companies.Explore more on these topicsBritish SteelSteel industryManufacturing sectorLincolnshireEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

On mental health leaflets and in magazine columns, emblazoned on mugs and motivational posters. All this is the result of more than two decades’ research in positive psychology which has found that having a “gratitude practice” (usually jotting down three to five things you are thankful for most days) bringsa host of psychological and physical benefits.I don’t want to seem, well, ungrateful. I’m a sceptical historian, but even I was persuaded to take up the gratitude habit, and when I remember to do it, I feel better: more cheerful and connected, inclined to see the good already in my life. Counting your blessings, whether that’s noticing a beautiful sunset or remembering how your neighbour went out of their way to help you earlier, is free and attractively simple. But there’s the problem. In our eagerness to embrace gratitude as a cure-all, have we lost sight of its complexity and its edge?In positive psychology circles, gratitude is generally defined as awholly good thing, a spontaneous feeling of joyful appreciation. But back in 1923, theHarvard psychologist William McDougallbelieved gratitude – especially when directed towards another person, rather than an experience in the more abstract way of, say, being “grateful to be alive” – was far knottier. Yes, there was awe for the generosity of the human spirit, and tender feelings towards the person who had given up their time to help. But there were also quiet feelings of envy or embarrassment, a sense of the “superior power” of the helper and even what he called “negative self-feeling” but which today we’d call “low self‑esteem”. The Japanese expressionarigata-meiwaku(literally: “annoying thanks”) gets to the heart of what he meant.Arigata-meiwakuis the feeling you have when someone insists on performing a favour for you, even though you don’t want them to, yet convention dictates you must be grateful anyway. There’s a reason all this feels so annoying: being grateful throws off the balance of power and increases feelings of obligation. There’s your benefactor at the top, bathed in a sunshine glow of generosity. And there’s you, at the bottom, doffing your cap.This connection between power and the demand for gratitude reaches into many parts of lifeIt might seem mean-spirited to focus on how being thankful can also obligate, diminish or confuse us. But as #feelingblessed becomes a performative norm, these aspects of gratitude are even more important to understand, particularly for the role they play in how hierarchies are reinforced in our world. One of the bleakest tales about compulsory gratitude I have read is that of the 13-year-old orphanEyo Ekpenyon Eyo II. In 1893, he travelled from his home in British-occupied west Africa to take up a scholarship in a missionary school in Colwyn Bay, Wales. Less than six months after arriving, Eyo wrote to his patron, expressing thanks but begging to return home. The cold weather had made him sick, and he feared for his life, a reasonable worry since three west African pupils had already died at Colwyn Bay.Eventually Eyo did secure a passage home, but not before the British press got hold of the story. In a vicious outpouring, they called him “spoilt” and “ungrateful”, a “little prince”, their language soaked in colonial assumptions about who ought to feel grateful to whom. Not much has changed. InThe Ungrateful Refugeethe author Dina Nayeri describes how, as a child refugee from Iran, she was expected to feel “so lucky, so humbled” to be in the United States. Only later did she understand how this “politics of gratitude” had subtly worked to transform her human right to refuge into a gift, one that had to be repaid by staying submissive and uncomplaining, being a “good immigrant” who stayed in her lane.This connection between power and the demand for gratitude reaches into many parts of life. Whenpeople in high-power positionsare made to feel insecure, for instance by having their failings pointed out, they commonly berate those who they perceive as inferior to them for being ungrateful. It was hard not to think of this as Donald Trump and JD Vance took Volodymyr Zelenskyy to task forfailing to show sufficient gratitudeearlier this year (or in 2023, when then-defence UK secretary, Ben Wallace,made a similar demand).These costs are part of what psychologists now call the “dark side” of gratitude. One common objection to the gratitude movement is that it risks“toxic positivity”, encouraging people to ignore and repress more painful feelings. But feeling thankful can lead to other dangers, too. People aremore likely to transgress moral codeson behalf of someone else if they feel grateful to them. Members of historically marginalised groups, including women and LGBTQ+ people, areless likely to complain about unfair treatmentif they are reminded first how lucky they are compared with the past. And, asstudies with women in abusive relationships show, when people have been gaslit into believing they cannot survive without an abuser, gratitude makes them feel obliged to stay. Should all those coffee cups and motivational posters come with caveats and health warnings?This is a lot to think about while trying to jot down three things you feel grateful for so you can go to sleep. But I don’t think we need to throw the baby out with the bathwater. The lessons of the latest research remind us that, like all emotions, feeling grateful is neither wholly good nor wholly bad. Too little, and we risk being entitled or rude, alienating those who try to help us. Too much, and we may leave ourselves open to exploitation by amplifying the power someone holds over us. Context, as always, is everything.There are strategies that help mitigate the risk. Focusing on circumstances rather than individuals (broadly, feeling gratefulfororthat, rather than gratefulto) can side-step the issue of power. And if you notice a boss, parent, friend or partner expecting more gratitude than you want to give, you might ask yourself why. What might seem like ungrateful behaviour in our hierarchical world may really be an act of self-preservation, even one of political defiance (“How can you thank a man for giving you what’s already yours?” asMalcolm Xsaid).And sometimes gratitude does need to have an expiration date. When I spoke to the artistBrian Lobel, who experienced cancer as a young person and now creates rituals for others as they move into post-cancer life, he said “for all we feel thankful, sometimes we have to release ourselves from the burden, to move on with our lives”. Gratitude is important. But so is paying attention to its limits. Feeling better? You can thank me later.Tiffany Watt Smith is a historian and author ofBad Friend: A Century of Revolutionary Friendships (Faber).Further readingThe Ungrateful Refugeeby Dina Nayeri (Canongate, £10.99)Smile Or Dieby Barbara Ehrenreich (Granta, £10.99)Toxic Positivityby Whitney Goodman (Orion, £14.99)Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingThe big ideaPsychologyMental healthSocial trendsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There’s a slinky, strung-out downtown New York theatre trope slipping through the set showcasing her latest release Virgin; subtle nods to Talking Heads’ Stop Making Sense pile up as each song brings a new prop and body to clamber across tabletops in euphoric abandon.Drum machines drop into Royals, then cameras zoom in on analogue synths tangled in patch cables for Broken Glass. Behind Ella Yelich-O’Connor, screens flicker in a fast-paced blur of electric blue, her projection shattered into pixelated 8-bit dots like a Windows screensaver. “You tasted my underwear, I knew we were fucked,” she confides in Current Affairs, stripping down to her grey Calvin Klein boxers.Everything about the current Ultrasound tour is viscerally kinetic, as if someone pressed fast-forward on an early-2000s DVD. One moment, she sprawls on the raised stage, kicking her legs like a teenage girl in bed, the next, she paces on a treadmill, crying into the bouncy ballad Supercut. There’s an emphasis on the body: dancers clasp handheld cameras, filming her midriff wired to the screens, sweat beading under the lights. The lens twists, holding the contours of Lorde’s body in a small reclamation of self. “I’m a little starstruck by you,Manchester,” she shouts.Clearblue stuns. She grips a vocoder to her chest Imogen Heap-style, her duct-tape bra catching the strobes as she performs intimately to an adoring crowd. At the end of the night, an outfit change sees Lorde walk through fans in a luminous bike-reflector jacket, holding on to a member of the audience as he sings David. The live feed glitches between her soft face and a pre-recorded image, a digital echo of tonight’s performance and her past. Lorde truly captures intimacy and nostalgia like no other.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

He is the Candide of the music business, smiling benignly, strumming and singing, seamlessly pausing for selfies and fist-bumps and high-fives; he almost visibly absorbs energy from the saucer-eyed fan-worship shown by gobsmacked passersby and radiates it back at them.Maybe you have to be a Sheeran fan to really appreciate it, but this is another single-take bravura special from film-maker Philip Barantini (who directed Netflix’s searing single-take dramaAdolescence) and his director of photography Nyk Allen. With no cuts (though there’s an allowable fast-forward bit, and the audio might have been tweaked in post-production) they follow the unselfconscious Ed as he completes a late-afternoon soundcheck at the New York theatre where he’s playing a concert later on, and then for the next hour, and with fans pretty much always swarming around him, he wanders through the city with his guitar for various encounters, some planned, some (supposedly) not.At one point Sheeran plays a song when a mate of his proposes marriage to his girlfriend, then he stages an impromptu gig on a tourist bus, then performs at a rooftop birthday party (there is a hilariously uncomfortable scene riding up in the lift in silence with a baffled non-fan businessman) and at a pub where he jams with some more friends. Then he grooves his way on to the subway to play on a train – and then, without a glitch, finds himself back outside the theatre. We follow behind as he glides through the foyer and triumphantly bops through the packed auditorium and up on to the stage to start the concert.As ever, Barantini pulls off some magical camera moves (the same that, during Adolescence, had cinephiles comparing him toRussian camera wizard Sergei Urusevsky). By being passed smoothly from handheld operators to drones and back again, the camera floats miraculously through enclosed interior spaces and out into the wide-open skies. The city streets and the theatre make this look a bit like Alejandro González Iñárritu’s single-take filmBirdman (Or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance), which also may have influenced Barantini a bit. The team of camera operators and crew remain invisible (though I think I glimpsed one on the subway); the production assistants who presumably have to get people to sign release forms are similarly discreet.There are, of course, some moments when the spontaneity looks suspect. At the beginning, Sheeran tries to hail a cab, misses it, and then hails another one which pulls over for him; this cab driver lets the camera into his vehicle without commenting on it. Hmm. Then there’s a purely outrageous scene when Ed happens to chance upon his friend Camila Cabello at the wheel of her car. “What are you doing in New York?” she gasps, a moment that isn’t going to get her any acting nominations. Ed explains and asks for a lift which Cabello gives him, and they have a bit of a James Corden-style carpool karaoke before she drops him off. What a bit of luck to find her! But Sheeran beams his way through it all, inexhaustibly.One Shot: Ed Sheeran is onNetflixfrom 21 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsEd SheeranNetflixreviewsShareReuse this content"

I’d seen Steve Harley on Top of the Pops and liked his look, with the mascara and bowler hat, like Alex from A Clockwork Orange. One day, me and my mates decided to cycle to Salisbury Plain. I had a transistor radio tied to the handlebars and Judy Teen came on. Unfortunately, the batteries ran out when we got to Swiss Cottage [in north London] … and my legs ran out at the same time!The first single I boughtThe Wall Street Shuffle by 10cc, from Woolworths in Camden Town. Later on, we used to pinch records, but I paid my dues for a while.The song I do at karaokeI normally have a go at (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman by Aretha Franklin. It’s a big song, man. But I’m never shy. When I do karaoke, it’s usually like: “Dad, get off, for fuck’s sake.”The best song to play at a partyFor dancing, Teardrops by Womack & Womack. It’s so simple, so uplifting. The wildest party I’ve ever thrown? We once had an end-of-tour party in Australia. All I can remember is our saxophone player chasingDuffy’s backing singers round a gigantic polystyrene volcano in his underpants.The song I can no longer listen toSomeone showed me an interview I did with Smash Hits. And I’d said: “There’s no way I’ll still be playing Baggy Trousers when I’m an old man of 30.” Those words still ring in my ears at 64 years old. But because the band took a long time out, I enjoy it more now.The song I secretly like, but tell everybody I hateWhite Flag by Dido. The lyric is, like, “I’m not going to let this shit sink me”, which is quite moving when you’ve had a couple and Chelsea have lost.The best song to have sex toI’ve heard there are rock stars who listen to their own records. I find that disturbing. Can you imagine popping on House of Fun? For me, the most romantic song is Marvin Gaye’s What’s Going On. That is so sensual, shall we say, without getting too lurid.The song that changed my lifeI heard Prince Buster’s Al Capone in a pool hall on Tottenham Court Road and loved the energy, humour and spirit. Then I played the B-side, which was One Step Beyond. So it was a pretty epochal 45, that:Madnessdid One Step Beyond as our second single.The song that makes me cryCry Me a River by Julie London. Funnily enough, when I moved into my first house in Camden, I had no furniture except a jukebox – and the only record on it was Cry Me a River. I had a housewarming party and it started sending everyone mad. Someone unplugged the jukebox in the end.The song I want played at my funeralIs That All There Is? by Peggy Lee.

My novel set out to explore these contradictionsAlice JollySun 16 Nov 2025 07.00 ESTShareIn 2015, I decided to write a novel about Dr Hans Asperger, who worked at the University Children’s Hospital in Vienna during the second world war. My interest was sparked by two nonfiction books: NeuroTribes: The Legacy ofAutismand How to Think Smarter About People Who Think Differently by Steve Silberman and In a Different Key: The Story of Autism by John Donvan and Caren Zucker.Reading these stories told about Asperger, you would have thought they were talking about two different people. To Silberman, Asperger was a compassionate and original thinker, whereas Donvan and Zucker depict him as an enthusiastic supporter of Hitler. For a historical novelist, widely differing accounts of the same person are gold dust, and I began to dig deeper.Asperger became famous as the result of a thesis he wrote during the second world war that contains a description of what we now categorise as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). His work was lost for decades but in 1980 it was rediscovered by British psychiatrist Dr Lorna Wing. Asperger was posthumously claimed as “the father of neurodiversity”. As I read about the work that he and his colleagues were engaged in at the Vienna children’s hospital, it was clear that their thinking was years ahead of its time and remains relevant today.Questions were being asked about where the line falls between disease and difference. Diagnosis was rejected because each child was genuinely seen as unique. Everything depended on finding the right educational approach and providing “the best sovereign care”.When Asperger signed the paperwork, he must have known it was effectively a death warrantAt the heart of this work were the words of Asperger’s predecessor Erwin Lazar: “What gift is the child offering us?” All of this sounded so caring and empathetic. It couldn’t be true that Asperger was a Nazi collaborator? I set out for Austria to meet Prof Herwig Czech of the University of Vienna, who has spent years researching Austria’s involvement in the medical crimes of the Third Reich. When we met, he was about to publish a paper proving that Asperger had signed paperwork that transferred children to the notorious Am Spiegelgrund (the children’s ward of the Am Steinhof psychiatric hospital where many were murdered) and that he must have known that this was effectively a death warrant.This was in the early days of social media pile-ons, and the online response to Czech’s paper was frenzied. Keyboard warriors swamped the internet with righteous assurances thattheywould never have supported the Nazis. None of these people seemed to have read Czech’s measured paper, which actually clears Asperger of some of the other accusations against him. The messages were so simplistic and vicious that I wanted to walk away.View image in fullscreenAsperger working with children circa 1940.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyWhat Asperger did is beyond defence. But why did so few want to consider the context? This was heavyweight history: controversial, recent. But I knew I had to continue because I needed to tell the stories of the many who were not heroes. “To know all is to forgive all” – but understanding and forgiveness can be decoupled. When I was growing up in England, simplistic second world war narratives were bolstered by endless films. We were the good guys, we won. Victors’ justice obliterated nuance. But millions across continental Europe were bystanders or active collaborators. Collaboration is not an aberration; it’s the resisters who are exceptional.I had already read plenty of nonfiction books demonstrating that the they-didn’t-know defence does not hold up. So if people knew, why did they not act? I began to feel that the novel form is actually uniquely able to get beyond the binaries of nonfiction and mine those seams of human nature that we would rather ignore.I knew that my novel would be told in the first person and the present tense. I needed a narrator who was peripheral but close to events, able to see and not see. When I read that Asperger had a patient obsessed by collecting 1,000 matchboxes, I knew I had found that all-important back door into the story. My eponymous matchbox collector is the fictional 12-year-old Adelheid Brunner, whose account of events at the children’s hospital is sometimes deadly accurate but more often wildly unreliable – not because she has any particular condition but because she is human.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

In particular, I wanted to celebrate Dr Josef Feldner. One of Asperger’s colleagues, he hid a young Jewish man in plain sight, merely describing him as “my nephew”. Asperger knew the true identity of the “nephew” but kept silent.So, was Asperger a criminal or a meticulous chronicler of brilliant and original ideas? The answer, of course, is that he was both. We have told ourselves enough stories that serve only to reassure us that we are essentially good. The work of the novel now is to remind us of our shared darkness as well as our light and to challenge us to find humility when considering those who have been forced to take decisions that – at least for the moment – most of us will never have to make.The Matchbox Girlby Alice Jolly is published by Bloomsbury.Explore more on these topicsFictionScience and nature booksAutismHistory booksNeurodiversityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Devil’s Den, an hour-long opera with words and music byIsabella Gellis, is certainly one of the odder shows to have been hosted by Opera North. Following a try-out at the Nevill Holt festival in summer 2024, it was being fully staged for the first time here, courtesy of Shadwell Opera and the Sheffield City Morris.Morris dancing in opera? That was being claimed as a first. The dancers filled the interludes between scenes like a hanky-waving Greek chorus, their bells and sticks adding another layer to Gellis’s music.TheDevil’s Denis a neolithic monument in Wiltshire with legends attached to it involving the devil, who is desperate to topple its capstone; a talking rabbit who translates the devil’s squeaks and grunts; and a fire-breathing toad that may or may not be summoned by a child running round the stones seven times, depending on whether that child is bad or good.Staged here in simple and effective style by Jack Furness, with a set involving just a circle of greensward and three large imitation rocks forming a dolmen (unavoidable shades of Spinal Tap), Gellis’s opera is the story of a good child whom everyone decides is bad. And everyone includes the audience: the child is put on trial by the lavishly garlanded druid, who teaches us a song of condemnation and gets us to repeat it in almost ritual fashion. It’s like being harangued by a cross between Gareth Malone and a mulberry bush.View image in fullscreenLike a hanky-waving Greek chorus … Sheffield City Morris.Photograph: Charlie SwinbourneAnd yet give it a chance and there’s the feel of a modern mystery play to it all – with a touching moment when we stop singing and the child is still trying to block us out with a song about a butterfly she made up earlier. In fact, the whole piece is a bundle of contradictions.What’s not in question is the rewardingly agile, transparent quality of Gellis’s music for the 15-strong instrumental ensemble, who play, hum, whistle and warble, conducted by Finnegan Downie Dear. It’s often witty, especially when unseen characters “talk” via solo instruments that rumble, tootle or squeak like Charley Says. The cast is first rate. Lotte Betts-Dean is the ambiguous devil, who squeals and beatboxes in an attempt to communicate, with Nicholas Morris similarly vivid as her sinister rabbit sidekick and Ossian Huskinson in booming voice as the druid. Jennifer France is luxury casting as the child, hitting even the highest notes diamond bright.The Devil’s Den could use some further tightening: some scenes feel too long, perhaps unsurprisingly given that it is Gellis’s first full-length stage work. But it would be a shame if this eccentric opera didn’t get to crop up on any other morris dancers’ patch.Explore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicOpera NorthLeedsFolklore and mythologyFolk dancingreviewsShareReuse this content"

Benjamin Britten’s Violin Concerto was written from 1938-39, his backdrop; the beginnings of the second world war, Britten – a pacifist – moving to the US with his lover Peter Pears, and the death of the composer’s mother. All these things have found their way into Marston’s piece, Against the Tide, and all for the better.William Bracewell plays the unnamed protagonist, his dancing instinctive as ever, the whorls of his mind played out in the twisting and untangling of his body. Here come military men, with rigid demeanour and clenched fists, and Matthew Ball with satin shirt and seduction; there is Bracewell torn between duty, beauty and freedom. You can feel his torment, it reads like one long dark night of the soul.View image in fullscreenA giant happy sigh … Everywhere We Go by Justin Peck.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe partnering between Bracewell and Ball is beautifully done, endlessly inventive, their bodies on convoluted trajectories that might lead to a fish dive of sorts, or a tender moment nuzzling foreheads. Marston’s choreography is never predictable but always human. Melissa Hamilton appears as the spirit of Bracewell/Britten’s mother. The score brings heightened senses, the astringent sounds of rattled nerves, ominous brass. Chloe Lamford has designed a fantastic set, a grey slate bridge rising across the stage, heavy and hopeful at the same time.Best foot forward: Justin Peck’s Royal Ballet debut – in picturesRead moreThe rest of the programme showcases two American choreographers who were/are very comfortable to just dancing to great music.George Balanchinebuilt his career on it, and Justin Peck, the inheritor of Balanchine’s flame, is following suit. Both delight in the joy of pure dance, at speed, with intricate detail. In Peck’s piece, Everywhere We Go, the dancers repeatedly move on the “and”, ahead of the bar line, raring to go.Peck is the pre-eminent US ballet choreographer of the 21st century, but surprisingly, this is the first time the Royal has performed his work, and they dance it well: preppy, perky, jaunty, tightly drilled, as Peck scrolls through different permutations of dancers to a busily orchestrated score bySufjan Stevens. There are gorgeous interventions for the whole group, as when dancers leap en masse with arms sweeping the sky then fall to Earth, it’s like a giant happy sigh. Marianela Nuñez brings her magnanimity to a slow section, with the music pared back to emotive repetition; puckish Daichi Ikarashi flies through the fast bits with infectious delight.View image in fullscreenDiaphanous … Serenade by George Balanchine.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianBalanchine’s Serenade, from 1935, has one of the most arresting openings in ballet: the charged Tchaikovsky chords, the curtain raised on a stageful of women in long tulle skirts, hands raised to the sky. It begins like a ballet class, but it is both academic and escapist, at best the dancers diaphanous and vivacious – Leticia Dias captures it perfectly. It’s the epitome of Balanchine’s famous “ballet is woman” quote. Although since his death there’s been some reappraisal of Balanchine’s attitudes towards women, and it’s hard to watch the scene where three sylphs let down their long hair and surround lone man Ryoichi Hirano without imagining it as Balanchine’s after-hours fantasy. But there’s no denying it’s very beautiful.At theRoyal Opera House, London, until 2 DecemberExplore more on these topicsBalletDanceRoyal BalletRoyal Opera HouseGeorge BalanchineSufjan StevensCathy MarstonreviewsShareReuse this content"

We can’t wait to share its story with visitors.”The astrolabe, made of a type of bronze, was found in about 1990 in the wreck of a Spanish ship that sank off Pednathise Head, part of Scilly’s uninhabited Western Rocks. The Scilly archipelago, 30 miles off the British mainland, is infamous for shipwrecks.View image in fullscreenThe Western Rocks of Isles of Scilly where the Pednathise Head astrolabe was found.Photograph: Isles of Scilly MuseumIt is not known what the unnamed ship was doing there but it is thought to have been lost at about the time of the Spanish Armada’s attempt to overthrow Elizabeth I in 1588.The Pednathise Head astrolabe was not complete but relatively few are known to survive worldwide and the intrigue around them helps make them valuable artefacts.Philip Pullman saw examples at theHistory of Science Museum in Oxfordand, in theHis Dark Materialsseries, based the look of themystical truth-telling device the alethiometeron the astrolabe.The Scilly astrolabe was sold and then vanished. It has now been established that at some point it was misidentified as another astrolabe found on a ship called the Nassau, a Dutch vessel that sank off Malaysia in 1606.It is known to have been in the collection of a man from South Australia but was seized by the state when he was convicted of serious crimes.The astrolabe was subsequently mentioned in a chat group by an Australian antiques dealer who said he had paid “peanuts” for it and it was worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.View image in fullscreenLydia Bassett, the director of Scilly Arts & Heritage, with the Pednathise Head astrolabe.Photograph: Isles of Scilly MuseumCuriously, it then found its way into the collection of a car dealer in New Jersey who donated it tothe Mel Fisher Maritime Museum inthe Florida Keys.A US expert on astrolabes, James Jobling, realised it was the Scilly astrolabe. There were two more stops for it – his laboratory in Texas and the National Maritime Museum in Falmouth, Cornwall – before it arrived back in Scilly.It will take pride of place as the centrepiece of a navigation case at the islands’ revamped museum on the most populous island, St Mary’s, next year.Lydia Bassett, the director of Scilly Arts & Heritage, said: “It’s great timing for us because our museum will open next autumn.“The maritime gallery will tell the story of the many shipwrecks on Scilly.

As ITVX streams every single episode, we look back at its highlightsStuart HeritageSun 16 Nov 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 16 Nov 2025 16.10 ESTShareVery quietly, ITVX is making a case for itself as one of the best streaming services around. All of Lost is there. All of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is there. It’s the only place in the UK to watch every episode ofDocumentary Now, which is quite possibly the best show streaming anywhere. As of last month, you can even use ITVX to watchSpace Live – 4K footage of Earth seen from the International Space Station, a spectacle exactly as stunning as it sounds.And, if that wasn’t enough, now there’s Byker Grove too. Last month it was announced that ITV had secured the rights to the show, which originally aired on BBC One, and as of Sunday it will host all 18 series. If you’re as old and creaky as I am, it will provide you with a near fatal dose of nostalgia.Perhaps you had to be there. But if you were, then Byker Grove was a mainstay of your childhood. A fixture of CBBC, back in the glory days when CBBC aired on BBC One, it was a soapy teen drama about the comings and goings of a Newcastle youth club. If you hadgrown up watching Grange Hill, with its backbone of stern authority, the show felt like a blast of fresh air.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: ITVWhere Grange Hill was always partly about the teachers, Byker Grove – with the exception of one bafflingly bearded manager we’ll come to soon – was all about the children. They mucked around. They came of age. They got into trouble. They had accents that were fun to replicate on the playground the following morning.I was nine when the first episode of Byker Grove aired, and the irreverence of it was palpable. The theme tune was, and remains, a banger. The opening titles were full of iconography – acid-era smileys, skateboard wheels, crushed Coke cans – that showed none of the paternalism often seen in shows of this ilk. And the show itself was full of kids unafraid to talk back to grownups – which is always exciting to watch.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: ITVAnd because it aired after 5pm (the quasi-watershed after which television was allowed to be marginally grittier), it was allowed to deal with serious issues. There were storylines about abuse and abortion and drug addicts being attacked in their squats. There was the first gay kiss ever seen on British children’s TV. And – thanks to one horrific moment that will for ever linger in the hearts of anyone who saw it – there was also a strong message about the need for safety goggles when playing paintball.Plus, people died. They actually died, and in grisly ways too. Car crashes, murders, brain tumours, electrocutions. In the case of Geoff Keegan, the aforementioned manager whose dramatically furry, chinless W-shaped beard became an important part of British iconography, his death in a gas explosion felt like watching one of your parents explode. This was strong fare for children to swallow, and it was all the better for it.Of course, as fun as Byker Grove was, its legacy as a star-maker has long been the thing that cemented it. The number of future celebrities who passed through the show has become legendary. It’s where Ant and Dec got their big break, famously, as PJ and Duncan. But it also gave a leg up to Jill Halfpenny, Donna Air, and Charlie Hunnam, as well as a fleet of actors from Hollyoaks and Emmerdale. Catherine Johnson (who wrote Mamma Mia) and Matthew Graham (who co-created Life on Mars) wrote for Byker Grove. Tom Hooper of The King’s Speech and, less impressively, Cats directed episodes.Obviously you are not going to park yourself down and watch all 344 episodes of Byker Grove. A lot of its early daring has dated hugely by now. What was thrilling when I was nine now often comes off as slow and pondering.

Now she’s back in the UK to star alongside Bryan Cranston in All My Sons. She talks about the frightening rehearsal schedule, how she’d work again with Mike Leigh in a heartbeat, and why she’s taking up boot-makingSun 16 Nov 2025 05.00 ESTShareMarianne Jean-Baptiste arrives at the rehearsal space in  Southwark, south London, and immediately announces that she’s exhausted. It wouldn’t be surprising if nerves were getting the better of her; she’s seven days into a three-week rehearsal period for a new production of Arthur Miller’s All My Sons, which is brutally short by anyone’s standards. Peeling off unnecessary layers of clothes – it’s not a cold morning – she says jet lag has been messing with her circadian rhythms since she flew in from Los Angeles 10 days ago. “I woke up at 3.17am and was like: fucking hell, it’s early. I lay there for a while, running lines from the play in my head. Then I thought: ‘Just get up and marinate the chicken.’ I made some ginger and lemon tea and finally went back to bed at 5.30am – better to rest and meditate even if I couldn’t sleep.” She was just dropping off when the alarm went off at 7am.These days it takes a lot to lure Jean-Baptiste away from her home in Los Angeles, where she has lived with her husband and two daughters full-time since 2003. She loves coming back to her native London to see family and friends, but LA has a slower pace, optimism, a vast ocean – and, for a long time, it offered better opportunities to work. Her breakthrough role as the optometrist in search of her birth mother in the 1996Mike Leighfilm Secrets & Lies brought a Golden Globe nomination and she became the first Black British woman to be nominated for an Academy Award. She memorably played Doreen Lawrence in the 1999 TV movie The Murder of Stephen Lawrence, but then – nothing much. Most offers of work came from the US.Between 2002 and 2009, Jean-Baptiste appeared in the American police procedural Without a Trace, but we pretty much didn’t see her again on British TV screens till she turned up as the killer’s defence barrister in the second season of Broadchurch in 2015. If you were lucky, you might have caught her in the National Theatre revival of the James Baldwin playThe Amen Cornerin 2013 or in Debbie Tucker Green’sHangat the Royal Court in London two years later. Then, earlier this year, she returned to the big screen with a bang, finally reuniting with Mike Leigh inHard Truths. Watching her raging, resentful yet blazingly funny performance as Pansy reminded us of exactly what we’ve been missing.It was a joy to hear that she was returning to the London stage in All My Sons, a play she admired as a student at Rada but has never seen on stage. The drama revolves round the Keller family: the father, Joe, has been falsely exonerated after selling defective plane parts to the US military, leading to the death of 21 American pilots; the mother, Kate, described by Miller as “a woman of uncontrolled inspirations and an overwhelming capacity for love”, is convinced that her son Larry, MIA, is still alive; their other son, Chris, wants to marry Larry’s former girlfriend, Ann. As an exploration of guilt, loyalty, the destructive nature of capitalism and (coincidentally) secrets and lies, it’s as relevant now as when it was first performed on Broadway in 1947.Yet, when she was sent the offer to play Kate, Jean-Baptiste asked director Ivo van Hove if she could take time to consider. “It’s never easy spending six months away from home,” she says, sipping strong tea. “It has to be worth not being able to paint, garden, cook, write, walk my dogs. But Ivo is a great director, and it was an opportunity to work with Bryan Cranston, who plays Joe. Bryan worked with Ivo onNetworkat the National Theatre, so we met in LA to discuss the process. He told me that Ivo doesn’t talk much; it’s very instinctive. He works with actors who come in with their ideas about the character, which he then moulds and shapes. Whenever I do theatre, I always end up wondering why I said yes to the terror. It’s delightfully terrifying, though.”I love the fact that I care so much. If you don’t feel like that, go home. Do something elseVan Hove, who won a Tony award in 2016 for directing Arthur Miller’s A View from the Bridge, was mesmerised by Jean-Baptiste’s performance as Pansy. “Hard Truths is a masterpiece,” he tells me. “When I saw Marianne doing a merciless impersonation of a woman plagued by demons and in a constant emotional rage, I called our producers and said I found the mother in All My Sons! And I was the luckiest director in the world when she said yes.”Jean-Baptiste may have a reputation as a brilliant character actor, but she works in an industry that doesn’t always understand how to use its talents. When I spoke to her earlier this year for Hard Truths, she said that she has always had to compromise because there’s a lack of multilayered roles for Black women both in the US and the UK. There was so much buzz around her portrayal of Pansy that an Oscar nomination seemed inevitable, but shortly after we met it turned out that the Academy had other ideas, which infuriated critics both here and Stateside (she was also nominated for a Bafta, losing out to Mikey Madison for Anora).View image in fullscreenSons of the stage … Marianne Jean-Baptiste and Bryan Cranston.Photograph: Jan VersweyveldAsked about the snub by Interview magazine, Jean-Baptiste, whose humour is bone-dry, said that “Pansy would’ve burned down the Academy building.” Now, Jean-Baptiste is more phlegmatic. Perhaps still frustrated, but certainly not sorry for herself. “I try to avoid the word ‘should’. Yes, I could have got those nominations and awards. You know what, it might sound flipping sappy, but I’ve had the opportunity to do two films in my life – Secrets & Lies and Hard Truths – which prompt people to stop me on the street to say they decided to search for their birth mother or make contact with their sister after 10 years [Pansy has a fractious relationship with her sister Chantelle, played by Michele Austin]. When you get that kind of validation, nothing can touch it.”Not even an Oscar? “A little gold dolly would be lovely, don’t get me wrong. I grew up on BBC dramas that were about the people and for the people. That’s what Mike does so well.” Jean-Baptiste first worked with Leigh on his 1993 play It’s a Great Big Shame! and says that she would “work with him again in a heartbeat, for nothing. In fact, I’ll pay him!” They met a few days earlier, in fact, for a natter. “I was talking to him about the play, wondering why they picked me. He said: ‘Well, that’s obvious, they couldn’t get anyone else.’ That’s our relationship.”Jean-Baptiste admits that doubt seeps into her mind. Van Hove is known for both his avant-garde productions and a tight rehearsal time of about six weeks, which makes this three-week period for All My Sons feel absurdly short. A week in, Jean-Baptiste is still learning the other actors’ rhythms – alongside Cranston’s Joe, Paapa Essiedu is Chris and Hayley Squires is Ann – and sharing her doubt. “I was telling Hayley that I slipped up on one line and was convinced that they’d have a word with me afterwards and tell me that they were thinking of finding someone else to play Kate. She had exactly the same fear! We were laughing about it, but I love the fact that I care so much. If you don’t feel like that, go home. Do something else.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I’ve got an insatiable appetite for creativity … I've got to be doing thingsThe joke is that Jean-Baptiste very easily could do something else. Growing up in Peckham, south London, in the 70s with an Antiguan care-worker mother and a St Lucian labourer father, Jean-Baptiste attended theatre workshops until taking up a place at Rada. She has wanted to act for as long as she can remember, but the truth is that it’s just one of several creative endeavours. She composed the music for the score of Mike Leigh’s 1997 film Career Girls and sings on the soundtrack (Leigh once told me that she has “a beautiful voice”). She is currently writing a script about grief, which she “has parked” as All My Sons is infused with grief and she wants all her attention to be on the play.She also has a studio in her LA garden where she paints. I ask to see some of her work, before briefly panicking that it might be awful and am then stunned when she shows me a portrait of Leigh on her phone – it’s good enough to hang in the National Portrait Gallery. “I left it in Mike’s trailer in a lovely box as a wrap present at the end of the Hard Truths shoot and he came to me, wild-eyed, saying that it looked just like him. It’s the best compliment I could have got.”Is there anything else she can do, I ask, half joking. She laughs. “Well … I can cook. Garden. Knit. Sew. I’ve got an insatiable appetite for creativity. I’m like: I’ve gotta know how to do this! It’s not like a neurotic energy because I’m very laid-back. It’s about greed; I’ve got to be doing things. I signed up for a boot-making course in a technical college in downtown LA and then the bloody pandemic happened. I’m just waiting for a window to sign up again.”We talk, briefly, about the US. She says that she lives “in a blue bubble where everybody is nice and sane, apart from a few nutters”. She has talked before about the David and Goliath nature of film-making in which indie cinema is the underdog; Trump’s threat to impose 100% tariffs on “any and all movies” made abroad could pretty much destroy indie films.“It’s rough out there for sure,” she says. “It’s very difficult to be an artist in this kind of environment. It’s all about the money and the number of likes something gets on social media. I really love it when a director makes a fantastic film, and the next film isn’t so good because they’re trying to do something different. I’m not sure the movie industry understands that any more.”Mark Kermode on… director Mike Leigh, who mines the comedy and tragedy of lifeRead moreFor now, Jean-Baptiste is focusing on All My Sons. I ask if her friends are all clamouring for tickets and she nods furiously. “Oh my God! I’ve got people here, in Europe, in the States, all asking the best date to come. I don’t know! Or they say the play is going to be brilliant. Don’t say that! We don’t know that yet. Pressure. Pressure. Pressure. Fucking hell! But it’s great people want to come.”I tell her that I can’t wait to see it. “I can’t wait to be in it! Well, I can. I could do with two more weeks of rehearsals. But we did Hard Truths in three months and look how well that turned out. So, you know … it’s all good!” The sun suddenly streams into the room and Jean-Baptiste smiles.All My Sonsis at Wyndham’s theatre, London, to 7 March.Explore more on these topicsMarianne Jean-BaptisteIvo van HoveMike LeighinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Simultaneously, Jackson also broke records for receiving 116m views in 24 hours for the trailer of a new biopic, Michael, set for release in April.Millions of fans may be excited and primed for a Jackson biopic. For comparison, the trailer beat outTaylor Swift’s Eras tour preview and it will join a procession of recent music biopics about Bruce Springsteen,Amy Winehouse, Bob Dylan, Elvis Presley and Elton John. The most successful of all – the Freddie Mercury and Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody – took in nearly a billion dollars at the box office.But are moviegoers truly ready for Jackson to moonwalk back into their lives? It’s only six years since Leaving Neverland, a Netflix documentary that examined the claims of two men who allege they were abused as children by the singer, and nine since another, Off the Wall, examined his rise as an extraordinary solo performer.Michael: first trailer unveiled for controversial Michael Jackson biopicRead moreJackson, who was acquitted of all child sexual abuse charges after a 14-week criminal trial in 2005, remains a potent force, and his legacy is subjected to opposing forces: one that would celebrate his musical and performing talents, and another that would notate it but caution against further celebration in light of the accusations against him. Jackson and his estate have always denied the claims.“I would not want to bet against people’s love ofMichael Jackson,” says Dan Green, professor of entertainment management at Carnegie Mellon University, pointing to the hit Jackson Cirque du Soleil show in Las Vegas and the hit Broadway musical MJ.“I think there’s going to be a lot of interest around it and I would expect it to do really well.”The Jackson biopic stars Jaafar Jackson, a nephew of the singer and son of Jermaine – proving that showbiz to the Jackson clan was never nothing less than a family enterprise.The film, directed by Antoine Fuqua (Training Day), promises to tell “the story of Michael Jackson’s life beyond the music, tracing his journey from the discovery of his extraordinary talent as the lead of the Jackson Five, to the visionary artist whose creative ambition fueled a relentless pursuit to become the biggest entertainer in the world”.The producer Graham King, who also produced Bohemian Rhapsody, told CinemaCon last year that he would deliver “to the audience a film like they’ve never seen before. When you mention his name, everyone has an opinion.”The $150m production’s release was delayed when the filmmakers were forced to reshoot the last third of the movie after a challenge to a legal agreement with Jordan Chandler, a Jackson accuser who reached an out-of-court settlement with the singer for $23m in 1994, rendering part of what had already been filmed unusable.How far Michael goes in addressing the claims against Jackson, or how far it goes in addressing the effect of those claims – he died in 2009 of poisoning by the anesthetic propofol administered nightly so he could sleep – is unclear.“I think we’re being asked to bifurcate,” says Green. “So many of us live in our own echo chambers, we’re going to keep planning for our own aspects of it. The Jackson estate isn’t doing this because it needs a few extra bucks. It’s doing it because people still want to see this.”Jeff Jampol, who manages legacy rock estates including those of Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin and Charlie Parker, and acts as a consultant to the Jackson estate, points out that a theatrically released biopic is the “best possible vehicle” for boosting an artist’s cultural legacy – regardless of any profit or loss.“Remember, we wear a different hat to the film-maker. They’re looking to spend $20m to make $40m. We’re looking to connect a legacy to future generations. Even if the film makes no money theatrically, the resultant buzz, talk and publicity is more than worth it,” he said.In that sense, the job of an estate manager or adviser is to identify what made that artist or act popular in the culture in the first place “and put it back into the pop culture conversation in a way that’s meaningful, credible and authentic to 11-to-30-year-olds”, Jampol says. “They then pick it up and the legacy moves forward. Remember, Light My Fire is a brand-new song to a 12-year-old.”Jackson fans, he adds, “are so connected, fanatical and devoted. They still organize flash mobs to this day. Michael’s legacy was never about merely being ‘cool’, per se; it was about his artistry and his connection to people. He was unique, and he wore his heart on his sleeve.”Ultimately, Jampol says, when managing an artist “with a lot drama or swirling accusations” around them, a biopic is still valuable.“But what story does the director of the Michael Jackson biopic want to tell?” he asks. “And in telling that story, will it include any allegations, will it include his relationship with his father? Will it include his death, or his doctor, Conrad Murray? I don’t know. We will find out.”Explore more on these topicsMichael JacksonBiopicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Time to get up to speed before the actor/model next hits the headlines …Elle HuntSun 16 Nov 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 16 Nov 2025 03.02 ESTShareSpare a thought for Sydney Sweeney! Yes, she is young, beautiful, rich and talented, but she has also been getting it from all sides this week. Her passion project has bombed at the box office; she is still paying for a jeans advertisement she did four months ago, and being called on to address charges of having joked about eugenics; and fellow members of the Hollywood elite are breaking ranks to express their disdain (in one case, with a vomiting emoji). And, as she found out this week, she can’t even enjoy a kiss with her controversial new boyfriend without being snapped by the callous paparazzi!Here’s what you need to know when Sweeney’s name next crops up – which, if current trends continue, will be soon.View image in fullscreenSweeney with Glen Powell in Anyone But You.Photograph: Brook Rushton/Sony Pictures Entertainment1. She’s dating Taylor Swift’sarch-nemesisSince September, Sweeney has been romantically linked with Scooter Braun, the music mogulbest known for allegedly holdingTaylor Swift’s song catalogue hostage. The pairing has generated discussion online for its apparent randomness and 16-year age gap, but they haven’t shied away from attention, either, being photographed together on several long and outdoors-y dates.The happy couple were recently pappedsharing an intimate yet also highly visible moment, kissing on a rock in Central Park – suggesting they are at least not averse to publicity. Sweeney may be comfortable writing herself off the guest list for Swift’s wedding, but her affiliation with Swift’s arch-villain hasn’t helped with her increasingly embattled public image.2. Bezos wants her for BondView image in fullscreenSweeney(left)at the 2025 Vanity Fair Oscar Party with Jeff Bezos.Photograph: Dave Benett/VF25/WireImage for Vanity FairBraun is not the only pop-culture “bad guy” Sweeney is cosy with. The couple reportedly connected at Jeff Bezos’s Venice wedding to Lauren Sánchez in June. Sweeney’s attendance at the lavish event initially raised eyebrows, given her lack of public connection to the Amazon founder, but was later explained as a money move, with Sweeney attached to a forthcoming blockbuster from Amazon MGM Studios. A sourcetold Page Sixthat Sweeney “is not friends with either” Bezos or Sánchez, but “came to pay respects to the ‘boss’, just like in the old days of Hollywood”. Sweeneyis also reportedto be launching a lingerie line, backed by the private equity firm Coatue – where Scooter Braun’s friend Ben Schwerin, formerly of Snapchat, is a general partner – and $1bn in investment from Bezos and his bride. Bezos isnow allegedly pushingfor Sweeney to be made the next Bond girl.3. She’s been dealt a KO blow at the box officeView image in fullscreenSydney Sweeney in Christy.Photograph: Eddy Chen/APSweeney’s starring role in Christy, David Michôd’s biopic about the trailblazing boxer Christy Martin,has been widely interpretedas a bid to cement her as a serious actor, proving her chops witha physical transformationand gruelling training regimen. The film has received mixed reviews and, last week, bombed at the US box office, opening to just $1.3m. Sweeney, who made her name as an actor on theHBO teen dramaEuphoria, has taken the blow in her stride,declaring on Instagramthat she remained proud of the picture. “Why? Because we don’t always just make art for numbers, we make it for impact. And Christy has been the most impactful project of my life.”4. She ‘did a jean ad’View image in fullscreenAn advert featuring Sweeney outside an American Eagle store in Times Square, New York.Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP/Getty ImagesSweeney’s art, however, is increasingly at risk of being overshadowed by her controversies. In July, an ad for the denim company American Eagle, showing Sweeney decked out in denim with the tagline “Sydney Sweeney has great jeans” sparked instant controversy, seen by some as catering to the “male gaze” andsubtly promoting whiteness. Since then, when asked about the adon red carpets, Sweeney has barely been able to conceal her exasperation. Last week, she finally addressed the controversy – sort of.“I did a jean ad,” she,witheringly, toldGQ. “I mean, the reaction definitely was a surprise, but I love jeans. All I wear are jeans. I’m literally in jeans and a T-shirt every day of my life.” Offered the chance to respond to criticism that “white people shouldn’t joke about genetic superiority”, Sweeney demurred: “I think that when I have an issue that I want to speak about, people will hear.” Her flippant, eye-rolling – not to mention, much belated – response to the controversy hasn’t won her fans.5. She’sbeen adopted by the rightOf course, it’s not just about the “jean ad”. In August, Sweeney was shown to haveregistered as aRepublican voter, not long after recent family photos were published showing guests wearing Maga-style caps. Sweeney also registered in tax-friendly Florida, shortly after purchasing a $13.5m mansion. At the time, she dismissed the reporting of the images as “an absurd political statement” and asked the public to “stop making assumptions”. She has not commented on her politics, but the publicly accessible documents have for many been proof enough. Regardless of Sweeney’s relationship to the Republican party, they have been eager to align with her. Texas senator Ted Cruzdeclaredcriticism of the jean ad evidence that “the crazy left has come out against beautiful women”. And President Trump was also quick to lend hisendorsement(“the ‘HOTTEST’ ad out there … Go get ‘em, Sydney!”).Sydney Sweeney: the Hollywood up-and-comer who started a culture warRead more6. She’s not the most popular woman in HollywoodThis week,White Lotus star Aimee Lou Wood, musician SZA and actor Christina Riccireportedly likedan Instagram video criticising Sweeney’s dismissive response to the American Eagle saga. (Woodalso posted avomiting emoji elsewhere.) Orange Is the New Black actor Ruby Rose (who lost out on the Christy role) also laid into Sweeney on Instagram Threads,writing: “You’re a cretin and you ruined the film. Period. Christy deserved better.” Rose’s objection was to an apparent Republican playing a gay woman: “None of ‘the people’ want to see someone who hates them, parading around pretending to be us.”7. She’s also regular fodder for the discourse machineBetween her sex-symbol status and her place in the culture wars, Sweeney is a recurring trending topic on X, variously lusted over and reviled. Last December, candid photos of the actorsparkedwhat X generously described as “debates over beauty standards” that waged for several days. (Think Andrew Tate acolytes calling Sweeney “mid” and a “catfish”.) This week, a screenshot of her implacable response to the GQ interviewer has been taken up by right-wingers as a meme-ish expression of ideological superiority.The unseemly discourse is not just limited to online. After Sweeneyplayed a Hooters waitresson SNL last year, the Spectatordeclared: “Yay! Boobs are back!” While, last month, conservative commentator Megyn Kellyrailedagainst Sweeney’s sheer red-carpet gown: “I object.” In 2021, Sweeneytearfully addressedsocial-media trolling; more recently she has tried to rise above it, laughing offphotographers’ demandsto “show us those boobs” at the 2022 Met Gala. “It’s this weird relationship that people have with me that I have no control or say over,” she toldVariety last year.8. She’s not above selling out …Sweeney has established herself as a businesswoman, producing many of her recent films. She’s not been shy about chasing brand deals, promotingflip phones,face creams,ice-creamand“super soft slippers”. “If I just acted, I wouldn’t be able to afford my life in LA … They don’t pay actors like they used to,” Sweeneyexplained in 2022. Earlier this year, Sweeney partnered with a “men’s personal company” to produce a limited edition soap, marketed as containing a “touch” of her own bath water. “Why? Because y’all wouldn’t stop asking,”said the company, Dr Squatch, giving the soap’s scent as “morning wood”.9. … butnowshe could do with a winView image in fullscreenSweeney in Americana.Photograph: Ursula CoyoteSweeney has re-cast box-office misfires as stepping stones to success. As her co-stars strained to apologise for their part in 2024’sdisastrous Madame Web, Sweeneyexplainedit as one of her “strategic business decisions”, enabling her “to build a relationship with Sony” that later led to Anyone But You.The charming 2023 romcomwas a surprise hit, buoyed up by Sweeney’s on-screen chemistry (and rumoured romance) with her co-star Glen Powell. That same year, Sweeney delivereda powerful performancein Reality, playing an NSA whistleblower word-for-word from the interrogation transcript. But this year all four of Sweeney’s tentpole projects – Ron Howard’s historical thriller Eden, the cowboy crime-drama Americana, the straight-to-streamingEcho Valley, and now Oscar bait Christy – have fallen flat at the box office. Sweeney’s still standing, but if she is to get off the ropes, she’ll need a win soon.Explore more on these topicsSydney SweeneyCelebrity crib sheetCelebrityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Food styling: Natasha Piper.Felicity Cloake's masterclassFoodHow to make risotto alla milanese – recipeJust like Italy’s fashion capital, this saffron-hued dish is elegantly simple and very richFelicity CloakeSun 16 Nov 2025 08.00 ESTShareRisotto alla milanese is, like the city it calls home, elegantly simple, but very rich. The saffron that gives the dish its striking colour is rightly expensive (it takes about 150 flowers to produce a mere gram), but you don’t need much and, though it’s often served alongsideosso buco, I think it makes a fine meal on its own with a bitter-leaf salad.Prep5 minCook30 minServes41 onion75g butter, or 15g butter plus 60g bone marrow350g risotto rice(carnaroli, arborio, vialone nano)1 litre beef stock, or chicken or vegetable stock75ml dry white wine(see step 4)1 level tsp saffron threads75g finely grated parmesan, or grana padano or a vegetarian alternative1 Chop the onion very finelyPeel and finely chop the onion; the aim is for it almost to disappear into the dish, rather than remaining as distinct chunks, so take your time over doing this (you could substitute two shallots, if you prefer – their sweetness works particularly well with the flavour of the wine and cheese).2 Soften the onionView image in fullscreenMelt a generous tablespoon of the butter in a frying pan set over a medium-low heat, then fry the chopped onion until soft, golden and limp, but not coloured.Turn the heat up to medium-high, add the rice and fry, stirring constantly, until the grains are hot and starting to turn translucent around their edges.View image in fullscreen3 A note on the stockMeanwhile, bring the stock to a gentle simmer on the hob. Beef is the traditional choice with osso buco, but you may prefer to use a chicken or vegetable-based example, or simply water down the beef stock for a slightly lighter dish. Conversely, for a beefier result, substitute some of the butter with bone marrow from the butchers.4 Add the wineOnce most of the rice grains are semi-translucent, pour in the wine (it should hiss when it hits the pan) and leave to bubble away until it’s almost all evaporated. You could also use dry vermouth or sherry here, if that’s what you have to hand, or indeed leave out the alcohol altogether, as many local Milanese recipes do.5 Start adding stock bit by bitView image in fullscreenStir in a ladleful of hot stock, then leave to cook until it’s all been absorbed (there’s no need to stir at this point). While you wait for that, lightly crush most of the saffron threads in a mortar (keep a few back to use as a garnish later), then pour in a little of the hot stock and leave to steep and infuse.View image in fullscreen6 Keep adding stockKeep adding ladlefuls of hot stock for about eight minutes, waiting until each one is absorbed before adding the next, and begin stirring the rice as you do so. Keep going until the rice is just a little al dente for your taste; classically, it should still have some bite in the centre, but that’s up to you. If you run out of stock, switch to hot water.7 Flavour with the steeped saffronView image in fullscreenStir in the saffron-infused stock. Risotto should have a loose texture that’s more like porridge or a loose rice pudding than anything capable of holding its own shape; if yours feels a little on the stodgy side, stir in a little more stock or water as your taste dictates (try it before deciding, though, because you might find it rich enough as it is).8 Add butter and cheeseView image in fullscreenAdd the remaining butter or bone marrow to the risotto, along with the grated cheese; grana padano is the local option. Cover and leave to sit for a couple of minutes, then vigorously beat the risotto until it turns creamy. Season to taste (you may well not need any more salt), garnish with the reserved saffron and serve at once in hot shallow bowls.9 A note on getting aheadAlternatively, to get ahead, after the first eight minutes of cooking the rice in stock, spread out the rice in a single layer on a large baking tray. Leave it to cool, then transfer to a suitable container, cover and chill. When you’re ready to eat, simply return the rice to the pan, heat both it and the stock back up and continue with the recipe as written.Explore more on these topicsFoodFelicity Cloake's masterclassRiceCheeseItalian food and drinkWineHerbs and spicesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Yoga trousers and a smart hoodie, but PE kit nonetheless. And, once I arrive at2210 By Natty Can Cook, I realise I am severely underdressed.When chef Nathaniel Mortley announced that he was opening a restaurant that aimed to celebrate Caribbean culture “in style” and to win a Michelin star, his loyalInstagram following, as well as their families and friends, took the brief and dressed accordingly. As fancily plated ackee and saltfish spring rolls passed by, as well asa lotof rum punch, I rustled in my handbag for some bigger earrings and more makeup. “This isn’t dinner, it’s an occasion!” I hissed at Charles when he asked why I was off to the loo to put on some lippy, leaving him with a menu filled with the likes of confit pork belly with scotch bonnet mayo, lobster rasta pasta and carrot and plantain bhajis. By the time I got back, a plate of thin, crisp roti with a highly addictive scotch bonnet butter dip had appeared. One shouldn’t drink butter, but in this instance it’s excusable.View image in fullscreen‘A crispy beast’: 2210 by Natty Can Cook’s ackee and saltfish spring roll.This new restaurant is a natural progression of Mortley’s recent stint atthe Greyhound pubopposite Peckham library, where his red snapper with corn salsa and jerk chicken with brown butter mash quickly earned him a loyal audience. Mortley began cooking as a teenager – his mother’s an accountant and his father a businessman – and he went on to work at the likes ofOblixand Jason Atherton’sCity Social, but then circumstances led him to spend some time at Her Majesty’s Pleasure in Brixton HMP.Dwelling on this prison stint may seem a bit churlish, not least in light of quite how utterly classy 2210 is, but those jail years are a pivotal part of Mortley’s origin story. All cool restaurants these days open with an idyllic, flowery tale about Chef Tarquin floating about Thailand or India, gap-yearing and stealing inspiration, so by contrast, when Mortley speaks about his time atthe Clink, the charity-led, prisoner-run restaurant at Brixton prison, a food writer’s ears are bound to prick up. The Clink, which I frequent from time to time, is a funny old restaurant: you make a booking at least a week in advance, gather in a Portakabin for security checks, and are then escorted into the intimidating womb that is Brixton prison. If you’ve ever watchedPorridge, which was filmed between 1974 and 1977, well, Brixton doesn’t feel much different now, and an atmosphere of hopelessness hangs heavy in the air. Until, that is, you step into a discreet outbuilding where a semi-formal restaurant serving a modern European menu is in full swing. Prisoners cook, prisoners do front of house and, inside these doors, at least, some hope prevails.Mortley threw himself into life at the Clink, and in doing so asked himself some big questions about how he’d ended up locked in a cell, rather than rising to the top of the Caribbean cooking game. Now, umpteen residencies later, he must look out of 2210’s service hatch when service is in full swing and pinch himself at how far his life has turned around.View image in fullscreen‘Elegantly flavoured’: 2210 by Natty Can Cook’s jerk chicken supreme with fried allspice terrine, charred spring onion and mango and pineapple salsa.Charles, my longsuffering dining partner, says 2210 is the best meal out we’ve had this year; for me, it’s definitely up there in the best-of list. That ackee and saltfish spring roll, for example, is a crispy beast filled with rich, moist fish, served on a red pepper velouté and drizzled with a spring onion emulsion. Next up, a lamb belly skewer strewn with a masala reduction and tomatoconcasse. The jerk chicken, meanwhile, is elegantly flavoured with thyme, garlic and cinnamon and comes with a good, sharp mango and pineapple salsa. A particular stand-out is the seared pimento duck breast that’s served with confit duck leg croquette and pumpkin puree.View image in fullscreen‘Highly recommended for your own sense of wellbeing’: Natty Can Cook’s deep-fried apple crumble.Sure, 2210 isn’t by any standards cheap – starters are about £12 and mains hover around the £30 mark – but there’s an attention to detail in every dish that makes this place more than fit for a special occasion. There are only two desserts on offer right now: plantain cake with white chocolate ganache, which is a hunk of sponge with “chocolate snow” and the more humble of the two. Treat that as your starter pudding, then move on to the deep-fried apple crumble, which is large hunks of pickled apples with apple gel and caramelised pecans, all deep-fried and served with coffee chantilly and a split basil creme anglaise. Calories-wise, this is, of course, entirely unnecessary, but for your own sense of wellbeing, I highly recommend it.2210 by Natty Can Cook is much much more than just posh jerk chicken at fancy prices. It’s already mobbed and there’s something genuinely good going on here.2210 by Natty Can Cook75 Norwood Road, London SE24, 020-3713 5108.

Should I cut her off?A face-to-face conversation telling her how her behaviour affects you would give you peace, even if she ignores youAnnalisa BarbieriSun 16 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 16 Nov 2025 11.38 ESTShareI have been friends with a woman formore than 20 years, who has overcome many challenges, which I admire.However, she’s constantly blindsided by people. Her husband left her, and it was a huge shock. Alot of her friends disappeared at that pointas they wereonly interested inher husband. This surprised her. She made moreeffort to be my friend, andmust have realised more clearly what friendship was.Over theyears since, quite a few of her friends have disappeared and she isn’t sure why. Her last employer turned on her, even though she was anexcellent employee,and she left withoutknowing what had changed.Recently we’ve both retired and are seeing each other more, but I am finding my role in the relationship isas the audience. I open topics of conversation and she changes them to what interests her. Politically, she has strong opinions. I try to suggest factchecking and alternate views.She has been planning a holiday to a country I’ve visited many times and lived in for a while.I tried to offer insights, butthis was not welcomed. She really only wanted me to confirm her choices.I’ve just returned from a month in that country and she wants to catch up, but I don’t.I don’t want to be a friend who cuts and runswithout explanation, but Idon’t think she will ever understandthe impact of her behaviour on my self-esteem.At this point I am in avoidance mode. What should I do?You could cut and run, but it is rarely the peaceful resolution we hope for. But confrontation with a view to resolution takes courage and willingness on both your parts.I went to UKCP-registered psychotherapist Noel Bell and he felt you should address this with your friend “especially as in the past people didn’t confront her openly and she’s been blindsided”.Bell suggested this useful conflict resolution tool: “The first step is to state what typically happens in your conversations. This needs to be as factual as possible and essentially what a recording device would replay. The second is to tell her how it leaves you feeling. There should be no dispute about this. Your feelings are your feelings, after all. The third step is to ask how you are both going to change the dynamics of your friendship.”Remember, of course, that she also has a point of view, so you need to be prepared to hear thatBell says you need to think about how you are going to address this with her. You could write a letter but face to face might be best. “In spite of her abrasiveness, she might be more amenable to hearing your side of the coin in person, especially if she values your friendship.” Plus, face to face lets you gauge body language, which can tell you when to push or when to pull back conversationally. “It will also allow an opportunity to answer any of her questions,” says Bell. He suggests trying to do this when you are in a relaxed and private setting.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Some people have a “survival narrative”: they have a story about themselves they cannot let go of because their very survival depends upon it and it’s all they’ve known, and everything is everyone else’s fault. This is difficult as there is no thoroughfare with these people, only cul-de-sacs. But she may initially present like this and then think about what you’ve said.

Is this a new form of modern slavery?Words byDiane Taylor. Photographs by Ayman AlhussainSun 16 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 16 Nov 2025 00.02 ESTShare“I earn more cleaning toilets than I do from being aDeliveroorider,” says Marina, a Brazilian woman who juggles two jobs to support her 12- and 18-year-old daughters.It’s a “bullshit, horrible job”, says Adam, from Sudan, who combines riding for Deliveroo with studying for a law degree. “On a good day I can earn £50 or £60, although it’s really hard doing deliveries using a pedal bike.”“As humans we are invisible to the people we deliver to,” says Mohammed, a Syrian refugee who also works as a Deliveroo rider. “People don’t think about our struggles and our dreams. I’ve heard people in this country talk about second-class citizens; delivery riders are actually third-class citizens.”View image in fullscreen‘We are invisible and exposed at the same time.’Marina, Adam and Mohammed are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of food delivery riders in the UK, mostly working for the big three players, Just Eat, Deliveroo and Uber Eats. Most are migrants, according to the riders themselves. Deliveroo, which says it has about 73,000 riders across the UK and Ireland, describes them as a “multitude of nationalities”.The government has been clamping down on people working illegally in the food delivery industry, but those the Guardian interviewed in London, Liverpool and Manchester say they are working legally in challenging, low-paid conditions that many Britons would find unacceptable. And it’s not just at Deliveroo: they all say they have had similar experiences while working for other platforms.“I have worked for all of them over the past few years,” says Marina. “At different times one company has paid a bit more or a bit less than the others, but today in terms of pay and working conditions they’re all pretty much the same.”Men dominate this work but Marina is one of about 800 members of a UK WhatsApp group for female riders from Brazil. Here they swap advice on how to deal with hazards such as exhaustion, low pay and accidents and injuries, as well as harassment from male customers.“Sometimes men open the door to female riders naked or in their underwear,” says Marina. “One man I delivered food to tried to pull me inside his house. Another slapped me across the face in the street. Doing this job makes you feel that you are not a human being, just a delivery machine.”“Everyone assumes all riders are working illegally, which is not the case,” adds Rayan, from Pakistan. “We are vulnerable to being attacked – I’ve been attacked twice by teenagers who were just doing it for fun. We are invisible and exposed at the same time.”None of the riders the Guardian spoke to said they had ever met a boss from any of the platforms in person. All said their only interaction was with the app, which offers them deliveries that are available and the fee they will be paid – sometimes only about £3.View image in fullscreen‘The chill of the wind and rain turns my skin white.’“We are a very modern kind of slave,” says Mohammed. “The slave driver is the app that sends us our orders.”All the riders told the Guardian that they loathe delivery work, but have no choice if they want to earn money legally. Visa and residency conditions mean that many do not have the right to do jobs defined as “highly skilled” by the government.When it’s really icy I have to defrost my legs with a hairdryerSunny days are the worst for delivery riders, as potential customers are more likely to leave home and pick up their own food. Riding along dark streets, slippery with rain and with poor visibility, increases the risk of accidents. But at least they will be earning.Rayan, an English graduate who dreams of becoming a professor of English literature and writing novels, says the only way he can get by is by working for as many hours as he can bear without taking a break.“Sometimes I am so cold I want to go home and thaw out. When it’s really icy I have to defrost my legs with a hairdryer. The chill of the wind and rain turns my skin white. The thought of going out on the road again after warming up is too much to bear.”Some days he works in four pairs of socks, three pairs of trousers and two jackets.“I still dream of becoming an English professor one day but things don’t always work out the way you want them to. I came here thinking I had a job lined up with a sponsor but I was tricked. There was no sponsor, so I am doing deliveries, working 10- to 12-hour days or for as long as I have the energy.”View image in fullscreenA cafe offering Just Eat deliveries.When he started to work as a delivery rider he used to borrow books from the library to read while he was waiting for orders to come through. “My favourite author is Dostoevsky, who I call the ‘magician of writing’. I particularly loveThe Idiot, but I don’t read any more because I’m too tired. This work has just drained everything out of me.”Rayan says that riders on bicycles can earn about £300 per week, while those on mopeds can earn about £450, but the latter group have to pay insurance and fuel costs. “I don’t earn enough to support my wife and child, so I have had to take out a loan just to get by.”The feeling among riders that they have been “deleted” as humans from the business model comes up again and again. They see themselves as simply a mechanism joining three dots – the delivery company, the shops or restaurants where they pick up the orders, and the customers who receive the food.“All we riders can think about is money and how to keep going in order to earn enough to survive,” says Rayan.Bruno, from Brazil, describes himself as a “dinosaur” because he has been doing Deliveroo work for six years.“Many people can’t speak English, and this is a job they can do without needing to speak the language,” he says. “I continue doing it because I have a son I need to drop off and collect from school, and I need work that has flexibility.”A team of researchers at Birmingham University, led by Professor Nando Sigona, recently publishedresearchabout the exploitation of migrants doing delivery and domestic work.Food delivery platforms have found a dial that allows them to turn back the clock on workers’ rights“The UK food delivery sector has become a ‘testing ground’ for a new model of migration governance,” he says. This work is advertised as “flexible” and “empowering”, but in reality “it fuses work automatisation, digital surveillance and immigration enforcement.”Working conditions have become harsher since March, he says, when immigration checks increased as part of a crackdown on illegal working.“These changes have effectively embedded the hostile environment into platform work. This is a system where migrant workers are tolerated only as long as they remain silent, flexible and invisible. It’s time for a policy reset that puts workers’ dignity and rights at the centre.”While the supreme court ruled in 2021 that Uber drivers were “workers” rather than independent contractors, entitling them to certain basic rights, the same court declared in 2023 that delivery riders are self-employed due to a “substitution clause”, a contractual provision allowing them to send someone else to work in their place.Unions continue to fight for more rights for this group of workers. The GMB has a voluntary agreement with Deliveroo, for example, that is meant to ensure riders are paid at least the national minimum wage plus costs for the time they are on an order. However, if they are only sent one or two orders in an hour they are unlikely to earn the hourly national minimum wage.“Food delivery platforms have found in the gig economy a dial that allows them to turn back the clock on workers’ rights,” says Alex Marshall, president of the International Workers’ Union of Great Britain, which also has delivery rider members. “The result is a workforce plagued with financial, physical and mental health struggles. With such low pay, riders are forced to take dangerous risks on the road to shorten delivery times. With no holiday pay, they get no time to rest. And with no hourly wage they are kept in constant anxiety about whether or not they will be able to make ends meet that week.”The delivery platforms reject this characterisation. “The overwhelming majority of riders tell us they are satisfied working with us,” a spokesperson for Deliveroo says. “We are always looking at ways to raise the quality of self-employed work. We were the first major delivery platform to support unionisation and voluntarily partner with the GMB. Earlier this year we increased riders’ minimum hourly earnings guarantee and have introduced numerous valuable protections, such as free insurance, sickness cover and financial support when riders become new parents.”View image in fullscreen‘I think twice about working at night because I have seen some people targeted by racists.’“The safety and wellbeing of everyone who uses our platform is our top priority,” says Uber Eats, “and there are a number of safety features designed for couriers … We offer a flexible way for thousands of couriers to earn while being able to choose when, where, and for how long they work. While the vast majority are satisfied with their experience on the app, we work closely with our union partner, GMB, to ensure couriers’ interests are always represented.”“Our pay rates are competitive,” says Just Eat, “and data shows that couriers delivering for Just Eat earn, on average, significantly over the national living wage for the time they are on an order. We want all couriers on our network to work safely and we give extensive support on topics from road safety to customer interactions.”Ahmed came to the UK from Turkey with a start-up business visa almost three years ago, but turned to delivery rider work when his business struggled.“For a single person renting one room it is just about possible to survive on delivery rider income,” he says. “But I don’t see anyone who has a family being able to afford to rent a flat on this money. If you use a pedal bike you don’t have the cost of insurance and fuel that moped riders have, but the cycling burns so much energy that you need more calories, so you have to build in the extra food costs to your budget. My legs have changed shape from all the cycling I do. I think twice about working at night because I have seen some people targeted by racists – people who think immigration is a problem for this country.”For now, Marina says she will continue to juggle bringing up her children with house cleaning and delivery rider work.“I am doing this so I can put food on the table for my daughters. We are human beings and we are doing hard, honest work, but because we are migrants we don’t have the same value. My older daughter has started college and is studying health and social care. I hope that by supporting my kids with my food delivery riding I can help them break the cycle of poverty and ensure they won’t have to do this work.”Explore more on these topicsDeliverooImmigration and asylumWorkers' rightsSexual harassmentPovertyWork & careersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It has detected a 22% more cases this year than in 2023, with victims losing an average of £2,000. In one case, a criminal is thought to have made £150,000 by selling 550 worthless policies online.“Typically victims understand they have fallen victim to a ghost broker in the event they’re stopped by the police, they need to make a claim, [or] they’re in a car accident,” says Kat Cunningham, the underwriting fraud lead at Aviva.“It’s at that point where there’s a check done on the insurance and [they have] that horrible moment of ‘that really good deal … actually I’ve got no insurance in place’.”UK drivers warned to watch out for ‘crash for cash’ fraud claimsRead moreWhat the scam looks likeA social media ad will promise insurance for a fraction of the cost of what is available on the legitimate market. In one case, a 23-year-old was “quoted” £586 a year for cover on an Audi A3. The ad directs people to a site that could look like a legitimate insurance company or have the name of a fake firm.They are asked for their personal details – name, age, address, experience of driving – either on the site or through a messaging app. They are often then asked to pay for the insurance by bank transfer.The fraudsters posing as a broker may charge a fee for their services – this is typically a few hundred pounds.View image in fullscreenAnother unregulated car insurance ad found on social media.Photograph: HandoutAccording to Cunningham, the criminals will then do one of two things. They could email a fake insurance certificate to the victim. Or they could contact an insurance company and buy a policy – but they will change the age and occupation of the driver to get a cheap quote. They will pay for it and then send an altered copy of the real certificate to the victim. The criminal pockets the fee and the difference between what they have charged the victim and the cost of the policy.What to doBe alert to anyone claiming to sell insurance on social media, especially if they are offering cheap cover and you are a young driver. While legitimate brokers may advertise this way, they will always direct drivers to their legitimate website to buy a policy.Only buy insurance from brokers that are registered with theFinancial Conduct Authority– you can search on its website.If you do feel that you have been the victim of ghost broking, you can contact the Insurance Fraud Bureau’sCheatLineor by calling 0800 422 0421. You can also contact the national fraud reporting centre,Action Fraud.If you are worried about your insurance cover, contact the company that you believe you have cover with and it will be able to tell you what information it holds on you.Explore more on these topicsScamsScam watchCar insuranceMotoringInsuranceConsumer affairsCrimefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The revamp was intended to capture the spirit of bygone Kraków, especially the cafes and restaurants that proliferated between the first and second world wars. The aesthetic is also inspired by two legendary midcentury hotels, Cracovia and Forum, and Kino Kijów, a cinema that is still open today. There is lots of pale oak panelling, natural stone, handmade glass and ceramics, and local art. Rooms have retro radios and Bauhaus-inspired furniture.

And why do some things trigger it more than others?Jules, FifeSend new questions tonq@theguardian.com.Readers replyBecause things used to be better?GorgoblinBecause “the human condition” in general, and our individual lives in particular, are difficult and can be disappointing. As youngsters we hoped for more for ourselves, and become disillusioned. So we yearn for the good times of our past, and idealise them and our relative innocence – often forgetting the anxiety and fears we may have had at the time. Some of our cultures also idealise the good aspects of the past, and ignore the hardships.justsomeguy01Our hardships as youngsters are different from those when we become adults. Sometimes the good just outweighs the bad, which is why the feeling of nostalgia is so strong.VegansRuleThePlanetNostalgia is normal; as we get older, we find ourselves getting misty-eyed about our past and our experiences. But obviously it’s going to be selective – we don’t wish to indulge in the unpleasant, sad times. We focus on the good. It can be restrictive in a way, if we close ourselves off to the present. You’ll see it on any social media discussion or comments section. How the music or entertainment was so much better in “our” day. That today’s songs, shows and films aren’t up to scratch. We become our parents and some of us take it further. They get angry if their favourites are rejected by the younger generations. They get furious at reboots, remakes and sequels – forgetting that stories and music have been recycling and re-doing for ever. It gets particularly concerning when politicians tap into nostalgia, promising to take us back to the mythical past, when things were simpler. It goes beyond a fondness for the formative years, or the glory days. It’s used to divide people and push dark ideologies that impact on individuals and entire communities. With nostalgia, there’s a balance, and when you go from healthy reminiscing to hating the youth for liking things you don’t, it’s sowing the seeds for something more than discontent. It’s a potent weapon, nostalgia. But hasn’t it always been? Just look at history.CaptainLibMass surveillance, authoritarianism, climate breakdown, the dehumanising power of technology … all the horrors came true. Of course we’re nostalgic.ElCommentarioThe worst kind of nostalgia is nostalgia for a time that never was. And that is what lies behind the Maga movement.Cousin2Often nostalgia is fulfilment of some early desire – like a toy or car or book we always wanted growing up, but couldn’t have because we were too young and it was too expensive or too rare. Ultimately, if we are able to possess what we have always wanted, sometimes we wonder why we ever did. The nostalgia being better than the reality.DrBlamm0Because we’re looking back at an idealised past that never really existed. Some of us are nostalgic for our childhoods, because (if we were fortunate) we were loved unconditionally, had a good home and enough to eat, and didn’t have to make hard decisions or face the realities of life. Some of us are nostalgic for other eras because of TV shows or books like Downton Abbey, Leave It to Beaver, Bridgerton or the novels of Jane Austen, because they offer anidealised version of life with the rough edges smoothed away. It’s easy to be nostalgic for the 1950s and a life where you have a beautifully furnished home, a wardrobe full of gorgeous clothes and a community. It’s when you start to think about the boredom of being a housewife, or that many of the men would have had mental and/or physical issues as a result of military service that the illusion fades. Same with Downton or Bridgerton, where women routinely died in childbirth, servants were ill-treated and abused, the smell would have been appalling and life for most people was nasty, brutish and short. We get nostalgic for the appearance without honestly thinking about what life would have been like stuck in one tiny community without escape, or indoor sanitation.GarySquirrel919And that is, presumably, why the rightwing culture warriors get so upset when the National Trust covers such aspects of the past in its stately home presentations.SpoilheapSurferA bit hard on Austen. Pride and Prejudice opens with the claim that everyone knows a rich man will want a wife, but the story is about how badly poor women need a husband; when parents die and sons inherit everything, an unmarried woman is in a lot of trouble. It happened to Austen herself; she was saved by a brother who’d made good by chance. But we shouldn’t let her irony blind us to the Georgian realities that she actually recounts.jno50Yearning is our favourite emotion. We are afraid of the future and we won’t yearn for that. Which leaves us with the past as a suitable object for yearning.XylopiaView image in fullscreenNew York in the 1960s.Photograph: Butch Martin/AlamyI’m not so sure about that – I think it depends on the overall optimism of the times. I can remember the late 90s being a time of great optimism, a positive belief that everything was gradually getting better. One of the reasons why there was so much 1960s nostalgia in the 90s (often among people too young to have been there) was because that feeling permeated the 60s, too. Just look at the utopian sci-fi of both eras to see the kinds of worlds it was assumed we were destined for. But when times are bad, we look back to when they weren’t. I mean, I’ve just done it now …MotoringJournoThere are some fairly negative comments about why we might feel nostalgia, but I find it to be more about that warm feeling you can get from remembering certain times you enjoyed, that felt special, loving, inspiring. And there’s nothing wrong with that. It doesn’t have to be in comparison to now. Very recently I saw the sister of my best ever friend, who died in her late 40s. It was so lovely to be able to share memories of our lives and times, even though some of them were tough. It gave a sense of connection, continuity, presence in the now.LorLalaIf nostalgia only gives us positive memories, old photographs can prompt negative recollections, to give balance. That can be distressing.RedmondI think there are two different things: nostalgia on a collective cultural level, for earlier eras that nobody, or very few, living actually lived through (as featured in a lot of pop culture, and as all-too-often weaponised by politicians), and nostalgia on an individual level for one’s own past life. The interesting thing about the latter, it seems to me, is that it’s such an ambivalent feeling – always bittersweet.formerleftyI think nostalgia is the memory of hope we felt in our younger days juxtaposed against the lack of hope we feel in the present. There’s also an element of looking back at a time when things seemed less morally complex, so we didn’t have to deal with the relentless knowledge that the world is a lot more nuanced than it is typically represented as to children.tic_no_denNostalgia just ain’t what it used to be …TeeDubyaBeeAs humans, we seem to have an innate ability to remember the positives, while conveniently overlooking the darker or more threatening memories – just like the common observation that women tend to forget the traumas of childbirth until it recurs a second or third time. It’s a survival strategy that allows for the same trauma to occur again. Nostalgia is basically a survivalist memory functionality which denies the possibility of negative outcomes.PostApocalypselouLike all of us, I’m getting older every day, but find so many people my age (60+) do tend to go on about things years ago. It reminds me of one of Garrison Keillor’s stories about the Scandinavians in Minnesota. He speaks to an elderly Norwegian who emigrated in his 50s. The old boy speaks just about passable English, with a heavy accent, and complains about being treated as “a thick Norski”. He then says, “In Norway, I was smart. Not now.” The point is that people are looking back at the best versions of themselves and don’t really fathom, as Dylan said, that “it was in another lifetime”.PeteTheBeatI think it’s a way of dealing with fear of the future. We live in fear of what might happen next, and only enjoy the time after we know what might have happened next actually didn’t. The second world war is an example of how people enjoy(ed) the memories, hardships and all, once they knew that Hitler didn’t win. I doubt there would be the same nostalgia in a Nazi-occupied UK.DJ59As I grow older, I find I no longer feel nostalgia; but I hanker for the days when I used to.ThereisnoOwlI remember the cartoonist Garry Trudeau, of Doonesbury fame, satirising Ronnie Ray-gun’s backwards and distorted vision of the US: “A country of Burma Shave ads, 5-cent Cokes, and hard-working white people.”eibhearIn terms of popular music, it has been scientifically proven that we filter out all of the dross that was in the charts when we were younger, to the point where it becomes dulled in our memory.

It has been accused of plotting drone strikes on Russian airfields, blowing up the Nord Stream pipeline, directing “terrorist” raids insideRussia, and even abetting last year’s gruesome Islamic State concert attack in Moscow.This week, a new charge was added to the pile: Russian authorities claimed that British intelligence had tried and failed to lure Russian pilots into defecting to the west.“The FSB [Russia’s Federal Security Service] exposed all this in great detail,” Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, told reporters in Moscow, describing what he called a British-backed plot to lure a Russian pilot flying a Kinzhal missile-equipped jet to Romania, where, he claimed, it would be shot down by Nato forces.“I do not know how the British will wash themselves clean of it, although their ability to play the role of goose coming out of the shower is well known,” Lavrov added, using a Russian idiom that cast Britain as somehow always emerging spotless, despite its actions.London denies involvement in all these plots.View image in fullscreenA Kinzhal missile-equipped-jet of the type that Nato allegedly planned to shoot down over Romania, according to Sergei Lavror.Photograph: Pavel Golovkin/APAs Moscow looks to rebuild ties with the Donald Trump administration, Britain has assumed the role once reserved for the US – the Kremlin’s chief adversary and favoured bogeyman in its propaganda war.“Russia regards itself as on a par with the United States,” said Capt John Foreman, the UK’s former defence attaché to Moscow. “Now they can’t criticise Trump directly, so who do you blame for your woes – for the losses inUkraine, for a million casualties? You blame the closest thing, the British. It’s easy to portray us as the root of all Russia’s problems.”This year, Russia’s foreign intelligence service (SVR) said: “London today, like on the eve of both world wars, is acting as the main global warmonger”.It is a mantle Britain has worn on and off for more than two centuries, in Russia’s view.From Moscow’s perspective, the UK is more isolated than at any time since 1914 and can be picked offProf Michael ClarkeDuring the cold war, the US was known in KGB parlance as the “main enemy”, with Britain a distant second. Although rivalry and mutual spying between the two never went away, in the minds of the Kremlin the threat from Britain was very much a subplot to the main battle between Moscow and Washington.But rivalry between Russia and Britain has a long history, stretching back to the “Great Game” of the 19th century, when imperial Russia and Britain fought for influence in central Asia, where their empires came within 20 miles of one another in some places.There was a brief period when the empires were allies, but after the October Revolution of 1917, Britain again became the primary antagonist, seen by the Marxist Bolsheviks as the leading power representing the old capitalist and imperialist order.The US at this time was a mere afterthought; the early Soviet foreign intelligence service covered the country from its British department, “as it was an Anglo-Saxon country and because it did not bother us much anyway”, in the words of Georges Agabekov, an intelligence officer who later defected.The full-scale invasion of Ukraine, however, has brought relations to a new low.Although Britain’s budget and capabilities are much smaller than those of the US, the British have often been far more willing than their American counterparts to take risks and push boundaries when it comes to assisting Ukraine militarily and with intelligence sharing.“The Brits have been one step ahead from the very first days,” a Ukrainian intelligence source said.Boris Johnson was one of the first western leaders to visit Kyiv after the invasion, arriving in early April 2022 just 10 days after Russian forces had withdrawn from positions around the capital. It was February 2023 before Joe Biden made his own visit. US officials signed off on massive support for Ukraine, but they were wary of escalation, whereas Johnson frequently used bullish rhetoric about the defeat of Russia, which did not go unnoticed in Moscow.Russia is at war with Britain and US is no longer a reliable ally, UK adviser saysRead moreRussian officials, including Vladimir Putin, have repeatedly seized on claims that Johnson derailed a potential peace deal in the spring of 2022. In Moscow’s telling, Kyiv was ready to agree to terms early in the war but pulled out on British orders – a version of events rejected by President Volodomyr Zelenskyy but now embedded in Russian state media.“Pockets of anglophobia really do exist within the security services, among people like [Nikolai] Patrushev, [Alexander] Bortnikov and [Sergei] Naryshkin,” said Foreman, referring to three of Russia’s most powerfulsiloviki, members of the security establishment.Among Russia’s ruling elite, the once-innocuous term “Anglo-Saxons” has been reborn as shorthand for the Kremlin’s deepest anxieties about the west. In the official lexicon, it no longer denotes an ancient people but a geopolitical cabal, led this time by London and accused of plotting to contain, humiliate and ultimately dismantle Russia.The hostility has trickled down from the top. Russia’s television propagandists now compete to issue ever more lurid threats: one of Putin’s favoured hosts regularly boasts that Britain could be “sunk underwater” by Russia’s new nuclear torpedo.Public opinion has followed suit. According to a Levada Centre poll this summer, 49% of Russians name Britain as one of their country’s main enemies, second only to Germany.But this hatred appears to have gone largely unnoticed in Britain itself, Foreman said.“They care about us much more than we care about them,” he said. “It’s not a reciprocal relationship; the average Brit on the street has no idea this hate exists.”Adding to the confusion, Moscow’s messaging is often contradictory, depicting Britain as a fading colonial relic as well as as a power with outsized sway over world affairs.“Soviet leaders then, and Russian leaders now, pay the UK an inverted compliment in professing to believe that London is behind every conspiracy against them,” Michael Clarke, a visiting professor of defence studies at King’s College London,wrotein a recent issue of the British Army Review.“British intelligence remains a favouritebête noirefor analysts in Russia,” he added.At the same time, as a recent paper by the New Eurasian Strategies Research thinktank put it, Britain isportrayedin Moscow “as a weakened power, a puppet of the United States, and a society in moral and social decay”.View image in fullscreenA British-made Husky support vehicle at a Russian ministry of defence exhibition in Moscow of military equipment captured from the Ukrainian army.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesBritain is not alone in the Kremlin’s gallery of enemies. Since Trump’s election,Europeas a whole has joined the ranks – no longer the loyal Washington follower but, in Moscow’s telling, the real source of western aggression and instability.Still, the UK appears to occupy a special place.“They don’t like Europe, but they really hate the Brits, that’s the message that comes through when talking to the Russians,” said a senior European diplomat in Moscow, who requested anonymity to speak freely.What Britain’s enemy status means for actual Russian policy vis-a-vis the UK is hard to gauge.The UK is not unique in accusing Moscow of conducting a far-reaching hybrid campaign on its territory. Across Europe, intelligence services have blamed Moscow for sabotage, arson and disinformation operations, part of what they describe as a coordinated campaign against the continent.But diplomatically, Moscow appears uniquely unwilling to engage with London, even through private channels. The Financial Times reported this week that London has tried, without success, to establish a discreet line of communication, while the Kremlin has proved more receptive to Berlin and Paris.Pavel Baev, a research professor at the Peace Research Institute Oslo, suggested this may be because military support for Ukraine enjoys broad backing among the British public and across the political spectrum, whereas in other European countries it is more contested.“As a result,” Baev said, “Moscow is focusing more on Germany and France as potential channels for derailing European rearmament plans.”Clarke noted that Moscow’s hostility is sharpened by what it sees as Britain’s strategic vulnerability: a country aligned with Europe yet standing outside it, and increasingly isolated from it.“Moscow perceives that the UK isolated itself from its European partners in the Brexit process and will take some time to recover the political ground it lost among the major European powers,” he said.At the same time, Clarke wrote, Britain has struggled to maintain a renewed strategic partnership with the US, finding it difficult to sustain close ties under the Trump and Biden administrations.“So from Moscow’s perspective, the UK is more isolated than at any time since 1914, and can be picked off.”"

As host, Brazil is carefully neutral about what can be on the formal agenda.Silva spoke approvingly of the potential for a roadmap, without explicitly committing Brazil to it. She said: “When we have a terrain or environment that is quite grim, it is good that we have a map. But the map does not force us to travel, or to climb.”In an exclusive interview with the Guardian, she added: “The map is an answer to our scientific knowledge [of the climate crisis]. It is an ethical answer.”Scores of countries meeting in Belém for theUN climate summit, which is entering its second week, want to establish how a global phaseout of fossil fuels could work. They want to build on a historic resolution made two years ago at Cop28 in Dubai to“transition away from fossil fuels”.That promise had no timetable attached or details on how it could be achieved, and although it was passed unanimously, some countries have since attempted to disavow the pledge. Attempts last year to elaborate on what it would mean in practice were stymied by opposition from petrostates atCop29 in Azerbaijan, which is heavily reliant on oil and gas exports.There was no mention of the transition away from fossil fuels in the outcome of Cop29 as a result.For these reasons,Brazil has been wary of callsby some countries to put the transition on theagenda for Cop30. But Silva has worked hard behind the scenes to ensure the pledge could be discussed at the summitoutside the formal agenda.She won round Brazil’s president, Luis Inácio Lula da Silva, who made public reference three times to the need to “move away from dependence on fossil fuels” at thesummit of world leaders that preceded Cop30, and at the opening of the conference.“This is something that we know at some point had to be put forward, because it is the only way to face the problem from the root,” Marina Silva said. “We recognise that it is not easy, and we cannot sell false hopes. Raising the subject is courageous, and I hope [to see] this courage from all, from producers and consumers.”Brazil had not initiated the call for a phaseout, she said, because that had been done at Cop28. Instead, it was allowing the discussions to take place in accordance with what some countries wished. “We know these topics are delicate. We will give the opportunity to discuss it,” she said.There is not enough time at Cop30 to draw up a roadmap, a process Silva said could take several years because many countries faced complex issues around dependence on fossil fuels, or wanted to use the proceeds from selling fossil fuels to finance their development.“Brazil raises the subject, because Brazil is both a producer and consumer,” she said. “But Brazil is different, because Brazil, if it wants to, need not depend on fossil fuels. We have to understand that there are some that depend on fossil fuels in their economies and don’t have easy solutions, and others where fossil fuels are the basis of their economy.“To be fair is to be fair to everyone, but the essential, primordial justice is not to be unfair to the planet, because it is our home.”If the pledge receives enough support, Cop30 could set up a forum in which the process of drawing up a roadmap to the phaseout could begin.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Cop experts have told the Guardian they believe there could be support for such a proposal from about 60 countries, but there are thought to be at least 40 opposed. There are 195 countries represented at the talks.Leo Roberts, a programme lead at the E3G thinktank, said: “Despite being the root cause of climate change, fossil fuels are about the most contentious subject there is within the UN negotiations, so to see a chunky group of countries openly backing a route to achieving global phaseout is in itself pretty groundbreaking.“In simple terms, there’s no route to a world where warming stays below 1.5C in which countries aren’t able to discuss fossil fuel phaseout.”Panama’s climate negotiator, Juan Carlos Monterrey, said: “We need this language for real in this conversation. It’s quite stupid that we talk about everything but that when fossil fuels are the actual problem.”Negotiations continued on Saturday on four outstanding issues that have not yet been incorporated into the formal agenda: trade, transparency, finance and how to address theshortfall between the emissions cuts countries have plannedand those required to hold to the 1.5C temperature limit.The Cop30 president, André Corrêa do Lago, promised a “note” that would address these issues, after consultations – which have been going on since Monday – were inconclusive. He called on countries to adopt the “mutirão” spirit, meaning one of cooperation and constructive discussion.Work on other substantive issues – including adaptation to the impacts of the climate crisis, the just transition for those affected by the move to a low-carbon economy and how to build institutional capacity in developing countries – carried on productively, the presidency said.Brazil’s chief negotiator, Liliam Chagas, said the technical part of the Cop process was nearing completion, and the political phase – when ministers who have the power to change their countries’ positions arrive – was beginning.Explore more on these topicsCop30Climate crisisBrazilAmericasFossil fuelsEnergynewsShareReuse this content"

Víctor Camacho, a photographer for one of Mexico’s main newspapers, La Jornada, accused police of assaulting him as he covered the rally. “The journalist was kicked while on the ground, with many of those kicks aimed at his face,” the newspaper reported. “One officer … threatened to kill me,” Camacho claimed.There were also reports of disturbances in Mexico’s second-largest city, Guadalajara, where 47 people were detained and 13 people injured, including three police officers, according to authorities.Sheinbaum, who has been in power since October 2024, maintains approval ratings above 70% but has faced criticism of her security policy after several high-profile murders. Mexico’s first female president denounced the violence during a visit to Tabasco state. “We say no to violence,” she told reporters.Many of the protesters held banners and wore hats saluting Carlos Alberto Manzo Rodríguez, the mayor of Uruapan in Michoacán statewho was assassinated on 1 Novemberhaving led a crusade against drug trafficking gangs in his town.Man gropes Mexican president as she speaks to citizens on the streetsRead more“He was killed because he was a man who was sending officers into the mountains to fight delinquents,” said 65-year-old real estate agent Rosa Maria Avila, who had travelled from Michoacán state. “He had the guts to confront them.”Protesters gathered in front of the National Palace, where Sheinbaum lives and works, and knocked down some of the metal fences around the building.Police protecting the compound used teargas and fire extinguishers to contain the protesters. “This is how you should have protected Carlos Manzo,” some of the demonstrators shouted at the security forces.Hundreds of young people threw projectiles at the police, who responded by deploying their shields and also threw objects at the protesters.In the days leading up to Saturday’s protest, Sheinbaum accused rightwing parties of trying to infiltrate the gen Z movement, and of using bots on social media to try to increase attendance.“It is a movement promoted from abroad against the government,” she said.With Agence France-Presse and Associated PressExplore more on these topicsMexicoClaudia SheinbaumAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Boric is constitutionally barred from seeking a consecutive term.But an initial win for Jara may yet end in defeat in a runoff against a rightwing rival who promises a harsher security crackdown. “If [Jara] moves toward being tougher on crime, the right can always be tougher,” said Disi. “It’s a losing game.”This is the first time in Chile’s history that all eligible citizens will be obliged to vote for the next president.The country recently reintroduced mandatory voting after ending the practice in 2012. Voter registration is now automatic, so the millions of people who never registered, even when voting was compulsory, will be casting their first ballots in a presidential race. Those who fail to do so face fines of up to $100.Analysts are divided over the potential effects.“It’s a huge question,” said Robert Funk, an associate professor of political science at the University of Chile. “We have 4 million new voters. Who are they? Are they young people who like Jara? Are they people from marginal neighbourhoods attracted to Kast’s hardline stance on crime?”Chile will also renew the entire lower house of congress and part of the senate on Sunday.The country has 15.7 million eligible voters, of whom more than 800,000 are immigrants with residency of five years or more, who are exempt from mandatory voting. Polls show that foreigners overwhelmingly favour the right – especially Venezuelans who fled their repressive socialist government.All frontrunners have taken an iron-fisted approach to illegal immigration. Chile’s foreign population has doubled since 2017, with 1.6 million immigrants recorded last year in the nation of 18 million. An estimated 330,000 are undocumentedKast wants to build a massive wall along Chile’s northern border and deport tens of thousands of people who entered illegally. Kaiser wants to hold undocumented people in detention camps and bar their children from attending school. Matthei wants to deploy drones and more armed forces to the borderJara, too, has sought to burnish her tough-on-crime credentials with promises to build new prisons and expel foreigners convicted of drug trafficking.Explore more on these topicsChileAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The plan, the CRC said, has recently been revised to include emerging scientific and historical evidence, though they have not yet revealed the updated version.At their last summit in July, Caricom leaders backed apetition to King Charlesfrom Jamaica on reparations.The petition asks Charles to use his authority to request legal advice from the judicial committee of the privy council, the final court of appeal for UK overseas territories and some Commonwealth countries, on whether the forced transport of Africans toJamaicawas lawful, if it constituted a crime against humanity, and whether Britain was under obligation to provide a remedy to Jamaica for slavery and its enduring consequences.Explore more on these topicsReparations and reparative justiceJamaicaSlaveryAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

This was a lawful patrol operation conducted by theChinacoast guard to uphold its rights and interests,” the statement said.China and Japan have repeatedly faced off around the islands but the latest activity comes amid an intensifying diplomatic spat after the Japanese prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, told parliament that if China attack democratically ruled Taiwan itcould trigger a military response from Tokyo.That sparked an angry response from Beijing, which has signalled it expects a retraction from Takaichi.Canada says Russia and China are ramping up spy efforts in Arctic regionRead moreChina claims Taiwan as its own territory and intends to annex it under what it terms “reunification”. It has not ruled out the use of force. Taiwan’s government and people overwhelmingly reject the prospect of Chinese rule – preferring to maintain the status quo without explicitly declaring themselves independent, but vowing to defend themselves if necessary.An attack or invasion by China would threaten to spiral into a regional or global conflict, potentially involving the US and other allies including Japan, which has territory just 110km (68 miles) from Taiwan.Senkaku islands mapIn Taiwan, the defence ministry said on Sunday morning that it had detected 30 Chinese military aircraft, seven navy ships and one “official” ship, which was likely the coast guard, operating around the island over the past 24 hours.Maps provided by the ministry showed up to three drones flying between Taiwan and the Japanese islands off its north-east coast, appearing to go particularly close to Yonaguni, the nearest island. Chinese military transits there are not rare, but infrequent, and Chinese military activity in Taiwan’s air defence identification zone generally has been low in recent weeks.Late on Saturday, the ministry said China had been carrying out another “joint combat patrol” to “harass the airspace and sea around us”. It added Taiwan had sent its own aircraft and ships to monitor the situation. Taiwan reports such Chinese patrols a couple of times a month as part of what Taipei says is an ongoing military pressure campaign.Japan has been facing mounting pressure from China since Takaichi made her remarks, with China’s consul general in Osaka prompting a formal protest from Tokyo by commenting that “the dirty head that sticks itself out must be cut off”.Beijing then summoned the Japanese ambassador for the first time in more than two years, and China’s defence ministry declared that any Japanese intervention would be doomed to fail.On Friday,China cautioned its citizens against travelling to Japan, prompting Tokyo to urge Beijing to take “appropriate measures”, though it did not elaborate.Three Chinese airlines said on Saturday that tickets to Japan could be refunded or changed for free.In another escalation, China’s government on Sunday urged its citizens to “carefully reconsider” studying in Japan, citing what it described as an unstable security environment, according to the Kyodo news agency.While the advice does not amount to a ban, a dramatic reduction in the number of Chinese students could have a negative impact on Japanese universities. A record 336,708 foreign nationals were studying in Japan last year, according to the Japan Student Services Organisation. They included more than 123,000 Chinese students – by far the single biggest group.Late on Saturday, a Chinese state media editorial accused Takaichi of staging a political stunt that was “not just dangerously provocative but fundamentally perverse”.“A conflict between Japan and China would not be a limited skirmish; it would likely draw in other powers, including the United States, and could quickly spiral into a large-scale conflict with unimaginable consequences.”The government of Taiwan says only its people can decide its future. Japanese leaders have previously avoided publicly mentioning Taiwan when discussing such scenarios, maintaining a “strategic ambiguity” also favoured by Tokyo’s main security ally, the US.However, China’s ruling Communist party says the unification of Taiwan with the People’s Republic of China is “inevitable”, and casts any opposition to it as escalatory. As it moves towards being capable of military annexation, China has also been escalating its non-military activity andits rhetorictowards Taiwan.The Japanese embassy in Beijing did not immediately respond to a request for comment.With ReutersExplore more on these topicsChinaJapanTaiwanAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

He splashed fuel and set it alight before stabbing himself and dying nearby. The bodies of Aaliyah, six, Laianah, four, and Trey, three, were found in the vehicle; Clarke died in hospital.The coroner presiding at the inquestfound that it was unlikely anything more could have been doneto prevent Baxter from killing his family.View image in fullscreenHannah Clarke with her children Aaliyah, Trey and LaianahBut a whistleblower has alleged that the homicide investigation into the deaths – some of Australia’s most high-profile domestic violence killings – did not investigate the prior police response and failed to address potentially critical mistakes in the final months of Clarke’s life.These omissions mean police conduct before Clarke’s death has never been effectively scrutinised, the whistleblower alleges.The Guardian can reveal that afterClarke and her children were killed, detectives turned the spotlight on the victim – investigating the “veracity and motive” of her allegations of domestic violence and coercive control.‘Missed opportunities’Baxter controlled, abused, stalked and killed his estranged wife and their children, and spent days planning the act. An inquest found that he was a “master of manipulation” and that – while there had been “missed opportunities” to hold him accountable and failures by all agencies to recognise the extreme risk he posed to Clarke and her children – overall police had handled the case appropriately.But the new evidence raises serious questions about the police response to Clarke’s pleas for help, the subsequent coronial investigation and the inquest findings.View image in fullscreenFlowers placed during a vigil to remember Clarke and the children.Photograph: Jono Searle/Getty ImagesHundreds of pages of text messages between Clarke and a senior constable, Kirsten Kent, submitted to the inquest and released to the Guardian by the coroner, show that the Brisbane mother had disclosed non-lethal strangulation, stalking and suspected child grooming in the months before her death.Non-lethal strangulation and stalking are known risk factors for intimate-partner homicide. But these allegations were not recorded in police systems by Kent, who had been assigned to handle Clarke’s case and formed a friendship with her, and nor were they investigated as potential crimes.Kent told the inquest she had considered treating the stalking allegations as a criminal complaint but “did not push Hannah into making one for several reasons”, including that she did not believe there was enough evidence and Clarke had not wanted to do so.Police sources say Kent’s failure to log the allegations could have prevented an accurate assessment of the level of risk Clarke faced. They say that if she had been identified as being at extreme risk of violence it would have triggered additional protections and referrals.Clarke also disclosed in text messages to Kent that she believed Baxter was capable of killing her, himself and the children.More than half of calls to Queensland domestic violence helpline unanswered for full month last year, report findsRead moreThe deputy state coroner Jane Bentley said at the inquest that Kent was “to be commended” for her dealings with Clarke, because she “identified that Hannah was a victim of DV when Hannah had not recognised that herself” and “did everything she reasonably could to protect and assist [her]”.A whistleblower from within the coronial system, who last year made a complaint to the Crime and Corruption Commission (CCC) about the handling of the case, accused the coroner of failing to identify the fact that Kent had not logged these messages and of failing to consider the consequences of that failure.One of the inquest’s terms of reference was to review the Queensland police service (QPS) response before Clarke’s death.47:41Broken trust: how police failed Hannah Clarke and other women they were supposed to protect – videoA spokesperson for the coroner’s court said Bentley would not comment further on the findings.A police spokesperson said the QPS “acknowledges the Coroner’s findings in the Hannah Clarke case, which commended Constable Kent and noted that the organisation acted appropriately in its response. It is recognised that officers responded based on the information and understanding available to them at the time, in alignment with the organisation’s values of integrity, respect, and courage.“Since the murders of Hannah, Aaliyah, Laianah and Trey, the Service has continued to evolve and learn; strengthening its response to domestic and family violence but recognising there is still more to achieve.”View image in fullscreenPolice at the scene of the car fire that claimed the family’s lives.Photograph: Dan Peled/AAP‘Say you are a good dad’On Boxing Day in 2019, Baxter grabbed his middle child, Laianah, at an access visit and took her interstate. Police initially treated the matter as a custody dispute because no formal parenting orders were in place.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailWhen Kent found out about the abduction, she sought a police protection order against Baxter that prohibited him from approaching the children or Clarke’s residence.Body-worn camera footage released to Guardian Australia by the coroner shows two male police officers who served Baxter with the order telling him how to challenge it in court.“Talk to your friends about, you know, someone who might be willing to provide a reference,” one officer says.The other adds:“To say you are a good dad and … don’t need any conditions.”The footage also shows one of the officers agreeing with a comment from Baxter that women can make domestic violence allegations “for anything”. The camera is then turned off while officers are still speaking to Baxter, in an apparent breach of protocol. There is no suggestion Kent was aware of these comments.A former senior detective, Kate Pausina, who helped to investigate hundreds of domestic violence-linked deaths in Queensland, tells the Guardian the footage is shocking.“In all my time of policing I’ve never seen an officer coach somebody in what to say when they’ve been charged with a stealing offence,” she says. “Why would you do it in [these] circumstances of a domestic violence matter?”The footage was played at inquest but the coronial findings make no mention of the officers’ comments.View image in fullscreenFormer police sergeant Kate Pausina.Photograph: David Kelly/The GuardianThe coroner found there had been “a failure by all agencies to recognise [the] extreme risk of lethality” Clarke faced and “a failure to recognise the risk of intimate-partner homicide which results from separation in a coercive controlling relationship”.She recommended that the Queensland government provide funding for urgent training for all specialist domestic violence officers and for men’s behaviour change programs in prisons and the community.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A number of issues are listed for investigation – the first of which is the “veracity and motive” of Clarke’s domestic violence allegations.“Witness statements provide different accounts of the nature and severity of the domestic violence committed by Rowan,” the briefing document says.It says those witnesses – whose evidence was later criticised by the coroner – “question the veracity of some of the allegations made by Hannah … in the affidavit she completed and the motive for her making a DVO application”.Clarke’s affidavit had stated that she believed Baxter was “totally capable of killing himself and killing our children to get back at me. This scares me beyond words.”View image in fullscreenA makeshift shrine to Clarke and the children the day after the murders.Photograph: Dan Peled/AAPThe report Harris ultimately handed to the coroner did not address this early line of questioning.The Guardian asked police at what point the focus of the investigation changed. “Responding to a domestic and family violence incident is challenging and complex and in the wake of the horrific DFV homicides of Hannah Clarke and her three children, the dangers and risks of coercive control became evident,” a spokesperson said.“As a result, the QPS committed to the development of additional training, specifically focussing on the nuances of coercive control and the fundamental need for domestic and family violence investigations to be holistic (rather than single-incident based), victim-centric and trauma informed.”‘Victim blaming’Harris was appointed to lead the investigation into Clarke’s death after the QPS stood aside the original investigator, Det Insp Mark Thompson, for “victim blaming” comments. “Is this an issue of a woman suffering significant domestic violence and her and her children perishing at the hands of the husband?,” Thompson told a press conference in the wake of the murders. “Or is it an instance of a husband being driven too far?”Harris had previously been involved in the police response to Clarke’s allegations – he was responsible for assessing the “child harm referral” after Baxter abducted Laianah. He told the inquest he had ultimately declined to investigate the matter, finding there was no imminent harm to the children on the basis that there was no child protection history and no formal parenting orders in place.Queensland police commissioner tried to access records of alleged domestic violence victim to investigate herRead moreHe deemed it a “custody dispute” not a criminal matter. The findings say Harris forwarded a copy of the referral to the Department of Child Safety, in line with procedure.The whistleblower’s complaint to the CCC raises concerns about Harris’s involvement in the homicide investigation, accusing him of having a “conflict of interest” that was not addressed by the QPS or the coroner.The complaint says Laianah’s abduction “should have resulted in immediate actions being taken by police (and other services) to protect Ms Clarke and the children”, such as an urgent referral to high-risk teams.It argues that because the QPS response to Clarke was a matter for consideration by the inquest, Harris had been effectively ordered to “investigate himself”.“Given Detective Sergeant Harris was involved in the service delivery, there is no reason he should have been tasked to investigate this case,” it says.The whistleblower argues that police failed to scrutinise evidence of “errors, incompetence and/or otherwise embarrassing failures in response to Ms Clarke’s reports of domestic and family violence and child abuse and Mr Baxter’s identifiable pattern of escalating violence and risk”.Anindependent reviewof investigations into police-related and DFV deaths in Queensland was told the brief of evidence prepared by the police in the Clarke investigation was poor quality and missing relevant documents and reports.View image in fullscreenQueensland police deputy commissioner Cameron Harsley.Photograph: David Kelly/The GuardianGuardian Australia asked the police officer with oversight of domestic and family violence, the deputy commissioner Cameron Harsley, whether he believed “victim blaming” attitudes had continued in the investigation after Thompson stepped down. He said he believed police “always” believed the victim.The CCC assessed the whistleblower’s allegations and found that allegations that Harris had a conflict of interest, if proven, “would not meet the standard of the conduct the community reasonably expects of a police officer”.It declined to investigate further on the basis the allegations were considered to amount to “police misconduct” rather than “corrupt conduct” because they were not serious enough to result in criminal charges or sacking.Cameron Harsley retired from the role of deputy commissioner of the Queensland Police Service in September.In Australia, the crisis support serviceLifelineis on 13 11 14 and the nationalfamily violence counselling serviceis on 1800 737 732.

As this matter is before the court it would be wholly inappropriate to comment further.”A letter sent in November 2022 to Panthera’s clients seen by the Guardian shows the company claimed it was “business as usual” in the state despite the ban from the state regulator as it sought permission from the state’sBusinessLicensing Authority to resume trading.“Our debts being handled in Victoria have been assigned to Panthera Finance (Vic) Pty Ltd, which is not subject to these discussions. Panthera Finance (Vic) is a fully owned subsidiary of Panthera’s holding company PF Australia. This means it is business as usual for Panthera’s Victorian operations,” the statement said.For Panthera Finance (Vic) to have lawfully collected on the debt, it is understood the company needed to have undertaken a debt sale agreement to have it transferred to the new entity. It is understood this did not occur.In the statement to clients, which is framed in a “question and answer” format, the company canvasses the prospect that consumers may have recourse to challenge the debt collected during this time.One of the questions on the document is: “Will consumers you collected debt on in Victoria have recourse to challenge the debts you have collected from them?”The answer is: “Panthera is confident it has abided with all the relevant laws regarding its operations in Victoria.”Under the Australian Consumer Law and Fair Trading Act, a court may make an order for refunds to be paid to affected consumers if a breach is found to have occurred.AGuardian Australia investigation last year revealedthat Panthera allegedly continued to buy debt from energy and telco providers weeks after receiving direct warnings from Consumer Affairs Victoria that doing so could amount to a criminal offence.Documents seen by the Guardian show that debt purchase agreements were signed by Panthera with Energy Australia, Simply Energy, IPF Digital, Optus and Origin Energy throughout 2021 and 2022.In December 2023 Panthera Finance also sold a debt portfolio to Pioneer Credit for $24m made up of credit card and loan debt that had originated from the Commonwealth Bank. This debt portfolio is understood to have included Victorian customers.The Victorian prohibition came after a 2020 federal court ruling found that Panthera had unduly harassed three consumers for debts and was fined $500,000. The court’s findings that Panthera Finance breached federal consumer law made it a “prohibited person” under the state’s debt collection laws.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It also declined to comment on whether it would be prepared to offer refunds to customers.CAV also declined to comment on whether it would be seeking refunds as part of current proceedings.Francom is understood to now have a total debt book worth $1.4bn, made up of unpaid debt bought from banks and other lenders, as well as from major telco and energy companies. About a third of this – close to $450m – is understood to be in Victoria.The five-year prohibition placed on Panthera lifted in March this year, however Francom is yet to resume its debt collection activities in Victoria, pending the outcome of the court action.Francom Group, which took over Panthera Finance after it was placed into administration by its financial backers Brookfield, is owned by the lawyer Charles Antoun. His wife, Georgina Antoun, is the company’s chief executive. Neither Francom nor the Antouns are accused of any wrongdoing.When Francom took over Panthera Finance, the company announced it had the “ambition to transform the perceptions and practices of the debt collection industry”.In response to questions from the Guardian about debt collection activities in Victoria from 2022 to 2024, Georgina Antoun said: “All allegations against Panthera Finance by CAV occurred under prior ownership.“When we took over, we immediately set about transforming the company and aligning its debt practices with Francom’s, which are underpinned by strong moral and ethical values.”The company would not comment on how much debt Panthera Finance (Vic) Pty Ltd had collected from consumers during the period Panthera Finance was banned.“Out of respect to the current judicial process, which is actively before the Court, we will not be commenting further,” Antoun said.The company has also told staff it will be closing its Brisbane office, with a spokesperson telling The Guardian this was due to “operational requirements”.It said it was consulting with 40 people in the Brisbane office, but its “intention is to retain all staff throughout this process by offering relocation and relocation assistance”.Multiple former Panthera staff are understood to have left Francom Group this year.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The lifting of the privacy order was firstreported by the Independenton Sunday.A spokesperson for Abramovich told Reuters: “No charges have been brought against Mr Abramovich in the three and a half years since the investigation was commenced, and, to our knowledge, in fact no progress has been made on this case.“Mr Abramovich was allowed earlier this year to introduce claims of conspiracy against the government ofJersey.”The crown dependency froze more than $7bn (£5.3bn) of assetssuspected of being linked to himsoon after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The Jersey attorney general also said Abramovich was a suspect in a criminal investigation.Abramovich then succeeded in his legal attempt to force ministers and other senior figures in Jersey to produce private messages, emails and other data related to him that would now be made public, the Independent reported.The paper also published details from a judgment reportedly issued last week by the advocate David Michael Cadin, the master of the royal court, ordering the government of Jersey (GOJ) to pay Abramovich’s costs and describing its failure to provide data requested by the oligarch’s legal team more than two years ago as “extreme”.“The GOJ defendants’ conduct was out of the ordinary for any litigant let alone an ‘office holder’, and unreasonable,” he is reported to have said. “No proper explanation has been offered by the GOJ defendants for their failings.”Jersey is one of the tax havens from which Abramovich managed his fortune, using a network of offshore companies and trusts, that in turn controlled companies with bank accounts inSwitzerland.According to the Swiss rulings that first shone a light on the investigation, Jersey officials are looking into the origins of the oligarch’s wealth, acquired during the chaotic rise of capitalism inRussiain the 1990s and 2000s.Abramovich, through his lawyers, has denied the Jersey allegations and said any suggestion he was involved in criminal activity was false.The Law Officers’ Department in Jersey said: “We are unable to comment.”Abramovich did not respond to the Guardian’s invitations to comment.Quick GuideContact Guardian Business about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact the Business team confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The house did not immediately respond to calls, an email and text message on Sunday.The collection of more than 600 lots at auction in western Neuss, near Düsseldorf, included letters written by prisoners from German concentration camps to loved ones at home, Gestapo index cards and other perpetrator documents, the German news agency dpa reported. The auction was titled “the System of Terror”.“For victims of Nazi persecution and Holocaust survivors, this auction is a cynical and shameless undertaking that leaves them outraged and speechless,” Christoph Heubner, an executive vice-president of the International Auschwitz Committee, a Berlin-based group of survivors, said on Saturday.“Their history and the suffering of all those persecuted and murdered by the Nazis is being exploited for commercial gain,” he added. The committee said the names of individuals were identifiable in many of the documents.Heubner said such documents “belong to the families of the victims. They should be displayed in museums or memorial exhibitions and not degraded to mere commodities.”“We urge those responsible at the Felzmann auction house to show some basic decency and cancel the auction,” he added.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Any scheme uncovered in these companies must receive a swift and just response.”In further announcements on Sunday, he said he had instructed the government to submit an “urgent law” to Ukraine’s parliament to bring changes to the composition of a key energy regulator, the National Energy and Utilities Regulatory Commission. He also promised to appoint new leaders at the top of other energy bodies.Ukraine’s anti-corruption bureau announcedlast Monday that it was investigating a criminal gangbehind a scheme whereby Energoatom’s counterparties were forced to pay kickbacks of 10-15% in order to avoid having payments blocked or losing their supplier status. Ukrainian media subsequently reported that one of the senior figures involved was Timur Mindich, a businessman and co-owner of a media production company founded by Zelenskyy before he became president.The reform promises came shortly before Zelenskyy arrived in Athens on Sunday to mark the signing of a deal that would enable Ukraine to import US-supplied liquefied natural gas through the winter. The Ukrainian government is urgently seeking alternatives to compensate for losses caused byrelentless Russian attacks on energy infrastructure.The agreement between Greece’s state-owned gas company, DEPA Commercial, and its Ukrainian counterpart, Naftogaz, will supply Ukraine with US liquefied natural gas via Greece between December 2025 and March 2026.‘This winter under Russian drones, missiles, and daily strikes is a major challenge for Ukraine and for the Ukrainian people,” Zelenskyy posted on X during his visit, where he met the Greek president, Constantine Tassoulas, the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, and the new US ambassador to Greece, Kimberly Guilfoyle. The Ukrainian president expressed his gratitude to his US counterpart, Donald Trump, for the US energy supplied via Greece.Zelenskyy, who is also due to travel to France and Spain this week to sign military aid agreements, is under pressure to prove to European allies that he is serious about tackling corruption, a key condition for Ukraine to become an EU member state.The Finnish president, Alexander Stubb, told the Associated Press news agency that Zelenskyy had to deal quickly with the corruption allegations, but also praised his wartime leadership and urged European leaders to increase financial and military support for Ukraine.The scandal comes at a difficult moment, as Kyiv faces a looming budget shortfall, while the EU isdeadlocked over a €140bn (£124bn) loan for Ukrainebased on Russia’s frozen assets. The Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who is blocking progress in Ukraine’s EU accession talks, has seized on the anti-corruption investigation, claiming it showed “a wartime mafia network” with “countless ties” to Zelenskyy.The corruption allegations have caused outrage across Ukraine and have turned into the worst scandal of Zelenskyy’s presidency. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (Nabu) has released damning audio recordings featuring members of his inner circle.They include the president’sfriend and former business partner Mindich, who fled his Kyiv apartment last Monday hours before investigators came to arrest him. Mindich – who co-founded Zelenskyy’s media production company, Kvartal 95 – escaped to Poland in a taxi. He is believed to be hiding in Israel.Zelenskyy’s reforms announced on Sunday followedhis sacking last week of his justice and energy ministers. Both are implicated in the affair, in which a group of government officials are accused of taking kickbacks from contracts with Energoatom. The former ministers deny wrongdoing.Most commentators believe the illicit scheme was not a one-off, and suggest the scandal may spread to other ministries.Ukrainian media have reportedthat Mindich was allegedly involved in a bid to supply body armour to the defence ministry, via an Israeli firm and shell companies.Rustem Umerov, the secretary to the National Security and Defence Council, confirmed he met Mindich while defence minister. But Umerov, who denies any improper influence, said a contract was terminated and stressed no items were ever delivered.“It’s a huge blow, but the worst part of it is that I’m not sure that we are at the end of it. It might still be unfolding,” one pro-government deputy told the Kyiv Independent newspaper over the weekend.Nabu officials acknowledge Ukraine has a corruption problem, nearly four years after Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion. But they pointed out the scandal had come to light – something that would be unlikely in neighbouring Russia orHungary, they added.“The story isn’t about corruption. It’s about Ukraine’s struggle and fight against corruption,” Oleksandr Abakumov, the head of Nabu’s investigating team, said.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

A circulating pump operator, he was in the reactor’s main northern hall in April 1986 when an explosion ripped through the unit. His remains are still under the rubble.After the blast, Nataliia Khodemchuk was evacuated from her home in the town of Pripyat, and given an apartment on Kyiv’s left-bank. On Friday, a drone crashed into the side of her building, known as Chornobyl house, on Honoré de Balzac Street in the Troieshchyna district.She suffered 45% burns and died later in hospital. Six other people were killed in the attack. The Kyiv apartment block is home to other former Chornobyl workers, including Oleksiy Ananenko, who dived into a tank beneath the reactor, preventing a second explosion.Ukraine’s state agency for exclusion zone managementsaidKhodemchuk had been due to take part in a photoshoot to mark the 40th anniversary of the disaster. “We lost a woman who went through Chornobyl hell, lost her husband, raised children and withstood tragedies that would break anyone. But not her,” it said.“Nataliia lived with dignity, love, and a quiet strength that inspired everyone who knew her personally or through her story. She was cheerful, supported others, and shone. Now her voice joins the voices of all innocent Ukrainians killed by Russian terror.”It added: “The pain of this loss is unbearable. Russia proves its true face every time: a terrorist country that recognises neither humanity nor compassion.”The couple met in the 1970s in Pripyat’s canteen, where Nataliia worked as a salesperson. They had two children – a son, Oleh, and a daughter, Larysa. In the hours after the 1986 blast, she visited Chornobyl’s medical unit and morgue in search of her missing husband.View image in fullscreenNataliia Khodymchuk and her husband, Valerii. His body was never recovered after the disaster.Photograph: Facebook/State Agency of Ukraine on Exclusion Zone ManagementShe was instructed to pack a few belongings and to evacuate Pripyat, together with her children and other nuclear families. “They left with only small bags for three days. As it turned out it was forever,” Tamara Khrushch, a Ukrainian journalist,wrote in a tribute on Facebook.Khrushch – who interviewed Chornobyl survivors for a TV documentary series – said Russia’s drone attack on Friday had left many of them homeless for a second time. “I’m stunned. Nataliia suffered severe burns. She was already in poor health with chronic diseases because of the 1986 accident,” she said.In recent months, the Kremlin has dramatically escalated its aerial attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. Most cities and towns experience frequent blackouts,including Kyiv and its presidential palace. Zelenskyy has called on allies to help bolster its air defences systems.Writing on social media, he said the Russians last week “launched nearly 1,000 attack drones, nearly 980 guided aerial bombs and 36 missiles of various types”. Overnight, there were strikes on Ukraine’s second city, Kharkiv, and the Odesa and Dnipro regions, he said.“Every night requires multi-component air defence – air defence systems, combat aviation, mobile fire groups, interceptor drones. We are actively working with partners … to reinforce Ukraine’s protection,” he wrote.Additional reporting by Artem MazhulinExplore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropeChornobyl nuclear disasternewsShareReuse this content"

He said Iran did not have any undeclared nuclear sites, and Tehran could not yet allow the UN nuclear inspectorate to visitbombed nuclear sitesfor security reasons.Araghchi is treading a difficult path since Iran does not want be seen to be acting from a position of weakness, and he insisted repeatedly that Iran had emerged stronger militarily and psychologically from the Israeli-US attack on its nuclear sites in June.He was speaking at a security conference in Tehran where he restated that Iran had “an inalienable right to enrich uranium domestically that it will never give up” – the primary cause of the impasse in the previous talks.How effective was the US attack on Iran’s nuclear sites? A visual guideRead moreThe previous five rounds of talks between the US and Iran were brought to an abrupt and acrimonious end on 12 June when Israel, with US support, attacked Iranian nuclear sites in a 12-day war that ended with Donald Trump claiming the sites had been obliterated. Subsequently, European countries used their right to reimpose UN-wide sanctions, but Iran insists they have not had a major impact.Iranian officials said they felt they had reached a “magic solution” to the enrichment issue in previous talks, when it was agreed an Iran-based consortium, with American involvement, could enrich uranium. Both sides would have been able to claim victory since domestic enrichment would have continued and the US could be confident that Iran’s nuclear programme was exclusively peaceful.It had not been agreed in the talks that US nuclear scientists could operate inside Iran, but that was a logical implication of the consortium proposal. Officials claimed three times they had reached agreement with Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff only for the deal to collapse due to “spoilers in Washington”.Iranian officials said the consortium offer was now off the table, but it seems highly likely the proposal could be revived in some form if talks reopen.Trump last week said he had been receiving messages that Iran wanted to reopen negotiations, but privately Iranian officials say they are not yet receiving coherent offers from Washington either directly or from key regional mediators, such as Qatar, Egypt, Oman and Saudi Arabia. The Iranian foreign ministry has been accused of passivity in the face of Trump’s direct instinctive approach, but Tehran says diplomacy is not part of a show.In his speech to the forum, designed to paint the US as a hegemonic power that misuses the concept of international law, Araghchi said the 12-day war showed the conflict could not be ended by military means. He said the attacks started with a US demand for an unconditional Iranian surrender and ended with an unconditional call for a ceasefire.Iran is convinced the initial Israeli attacks were mounted with full US knowledge and coordination, making trust hard to restore.Araghchi said: “It was not Iran that had fled diplomacy; it was America and the western countries that had always sought to impose their will during the negotiations. Diplomacy can still be alive and remains the ultimate solution to resolve disputes, but its criteria, rules and principles must be adhered to.“If they speak to the Iranian people with the language of dignity and respect, they will receive a response in the same language.”In what is described by Iranian officials as the battle of repair and recovery, Araghchi said he was confident Iran’s defence capabilities “are much stronger than before 13 or 14 June of this year. All our capabilities have been restored. We learned many lessons from this war; we have come to know our own weaknesses and the weaknesses of the enemy.”He added: “We successfully passed this war. Our nuclear technology, which they intended to destroy, remains in place. The facilities and equipment, if destroyed, will be rebuilt; what is important is the will of the Iranian people and then the national cohesion that they targeted, but failed to break. The Iranian people have become stronger, more united, and more supportive of the government and the state in the face of this invasion.”Explore more on these topicsIran's nuclear programmeIranUS foreign policyIsraelNuclear weaponsMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Two said they were particularly concerned about the plans to ramp up deportations of refugee families, including those with children.Charities warned it would risk “another Windrush scandal” and leave refugees in near-permanent limbo, with children liable to be unrooted from schools and adults unable to build careers, and make integration harder.The home secretary will announce three new safe routes for refugees to legally come to the UK from war-torn countries such as Sudan and Eritrea, but even the status of those refugees will be under constant review.Mahmood confirmed on Sunday that refugees would be liable to be returned if their country was no longer deemed dangerous, with their status reviewed every 30 months, including families with young children in school.The government will announce that it will legislate to toughen how courts apply the European convention on human rights (ECHR) regarding family life, enabling more deportation of people with family members still in the UK.On Sunday night it also emerged that Mahmood had threatened three countries with visa bans for refusing to take people back from the UK.The Times reported that Mahmood wrote to the embassies in London of Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo on Thursday, warning that they have a month to start cooperating on removals before a sliding scale of sanctions are imposed. Mahmood is expected to confirm the measures on Monday.Asylum system in UK ‘out of control’ and dividing country, home secretary saysRead moreIn her article for the Guardian, Mahmood said she knew the changes would “face opposition” but said the alternative would risk public support for all refugees collapsing.“Dark forces are stirring up anger in this country, and seeking to turn that anger into hate. We must take the opportunity we have to stop that from happening. And I know we can,” she wrote.“The true nature of this country is openness, tolerance and generosity. We want to provide sanctuary to those in danger. We want to be a Greater Britain, not a littler England. To do so, we must restore order and control.”Mahmood will announce three “modest” routes for refugees from war-torn countries such as Sudan, Palestine or Eritrea to come if they are students and those seeking to work in certain professions, as well as those sponsored by community and voluntary organisations who support them when they arrive. Refugees arriving via those routes will not be given permanent settled status.Other key measures to be announced on Monday include:Restricting asylum seekers to one single appeal rather than different appeals on multiple grounds.Creating a new body for fast-tracking cases for dangerous criminals and those with little hope of success.Legislating to restrict last-minute modern slavery claimsJoining other countries in seeking reform of ECHR article 3 rights, to more narrowly define the risk of torture and degrading treatment.Changing the Home Office’s duty to provide support to asylum seekers toa discretionary power, enabling them to potentially be removed from accommodation.Several senior aides are understood to have severe reservations about how that would affect school-age children and MPs are understood to be particularly concerned about Ukrainian refugees, many of whom brought young children who have now fully integrated into British life.“These sweeping changes will mean that a child who is settled at school, studying hard for their GCSEs, will be uprooted and forcibly removed, possibly being put in detention as part of that process,” the Refugee Council’s Enver Solomon said, likening it to how long-settled people were treated under the Windrush scandal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Asylum seekers often use its provisions on right to family life in order to stay in the UK.The effect of the changes could mean many more people are deported from the UK even if they have young children living here. Judges will be required to prioritise “public safety” over family rights. A Home Office source suggested this would be more likely to apply to extended family.On Sunday night it also emerged that Mahmood had threatened three countries with visa bans for refusing to take people back from the UK.The Times reported that Mahmood wrote to the embassies in London of Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo on Thursday, warning that they have a month to start cooperating on removals before a sliding scale of sanctions are imposed. Mahmood is expected to confirm the measures on Monday.Mahmood is to warn concerned Labour MPs that the changes are necessary to address public concern about the levels of migration as well as counterattacks from Reform UK.“Unless we act, we risk losing popular consent for having an asylum system at all. In a country that is seeing division stirred up on our streets, we will not bring unity unless we restore order to our borders,” she wrote in the Guardian.“My goal is to ensure there are legal routes into this country for those who are truly fleeing peril, and for whom this is the first safe country they have encountered.”The Home Office has briefed widely that Mahmood has beeninspired by the Danish system, which has much tighter rules on family reunions as well as on refugee status.Mahmood’s predecessor, Yvette Cooper, temporarily suspended new applications in September from a family reunion route that allowed those granted asylum in the UK to bring their family.Home Office sources have suggested the asylum changes will have far wider effects than anything brought in by the Conservatives.Almost 40,000 people havecrossed the Channel in small boatsto claim asylum in the UK so far this year and the number of asylum applications in the UK is at a record high. Government figures show 111,084 people applied for asylum in the UK in the year to June 2025.Both the Conservatives and Reform UK have said they would leave the ECHR in order to undertake more severe measures to cut migration. Mahmood has said she will not leave the ECHR, but there are likely to be significant legal challenges to what she is proposing on Monday.The Conservatives have suggested the party could support the plans brought forward by Mahmood if she faces a rebellion from Labour backbenchers.But the shadow home secretary, Chris Philp, criticised the plans as “very small steps in the right direction with a few gimmicks”.He told Sky News’s Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips programme: “We want no illegal immigration whatsoever. We need to have a cap on legal inward migration each year, so the numbers are very, very dramatically lower.”Several loyalist MPs told the Guardian they were deeply uncomfortable at the prospect of disrupting the lives of settled refugee families if their countries became safer to return to. At least one minister is understood to have severe reservations.The Labour MP Tony Vaughan urged the government to “think again” on the changes. “The prime minister said in September that we are at a fork in the road. These asylum proposals suggest we have taken the wrong turning,” he posted on X.“The idea that recognised refugees need to be deported is wrong. The rhetoric around these reforms encourages the same culture of divisiveness that sees racism and abuse growing in our communities.”The Labour MP Stella Creasy wrote in the Guardian that leaving refugees in a state of “perpetual limbo” for 20 years was economically as well as morally damaging. “If we want to stop the boats we need to stop the BS when it comes to what is generating refugees or how to respond to them,” she said.“If you can’t stabilise your status, you will always struggle to get a job, a bank account or a mortgage, making it more likely you will be dependent on state or voluntary support.”Explore more on these topicsMigrationImmigration and asylumShabana MahmoodLabournewsShareReuse this content"

It did not give details on where the vessel was traveling from or what organization it was associated with.The latest operation was the 21st known attack on drug boats by the US military sinceearly Septemberin what it has called a justified effort to disrupt the flow of narcotics into the United States.Trump’s targeting of alleged drug vessels strains UK-US intelligence tiesRead moreThe strikes have killed more than 80 people, according to Pentagon figures. Lawmakers inCongress, human rights groups andUS allieshave raised questions about the legality of the attacks.TheTrump administrationhas said it has the legal authority to carry out the strikes, with the justice department providing a legal opinion that justifies them and argues that US military personnel who carry out the operations are immune from prosecution. The administration also has not publicly explained the legal justification for the decision to attack the boats rather than stop them and arrest those on board.The latest deadly strike came as the US navy announced itsmost advanced aircraft carrierhad arrived in the Caribbean Sea on Sunday in a display of power that raised questions about what the new influx of troops and weaponry could signal for the Trump administration’s intentions in South America.The arrival of the USS Gerald R Ford and other warships rounds off the largest buildup of US firepower in the region in generations. With its arrival, the “Operation Southern Spear mission includes nearly a dozen navy ships and about 12,000 sailors and marines.The carrier strike group, which includes squadrons of fighter jets and guided-missile destroyers, transited the Anegada Passage near the British Virgin Islands on Sunday morning, the navy said.Rear Adm Paul Lanzilotta, who commands the strike group, said it will bolster an already large force of American warships to “protect our nation’s security and prosperity against narco-terrorism in the western hemisphere”.Adm Alvin Holsey, the commander who oversees the Caribbean and Latin America, said in a statement that the American forces “stand ready to combat the transnational threats that seek to destabilize our region”.Stakes rise as Trump deploys world’s largest aircraft carrier to the CaribbeanRead moreHolsey, who will retire next month after just a year on the job, said the strike group’s deployment is “a critical step in reinforcing our resolve to protect the security of the western hemisphere and the safety of the American homeland”.InTrinidad and Tobago, which is only 7 miles (11km) from Venezuela at its closest point, government officials said troops have begun “training exercises” with the US military that will run through much of the week.Trinidad and Tobago’s minister of foreign affairs, Sean Sobers, described the joint exercises as the second in less than a month and said they are aimed at tacklingviolentcrimeon the island nation, which has become a stopover point for drug shipments headed to Europe and North America. The prime minister has been a vocal supporter of the US military strikes.The exercises will include marines from the 22nd expeditionary unit, who have been stationed onboard the navy ships that have been looming offVenezuela’s coast for months.Venezuela’s government has described the training exercises as an act of aggression. It had no immediate comment on Sunday on the arrival of the aircraft carrier.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS militaryUS politicsUS foreign policyDrugs tradenewsShareReuse this content"

Well, he’s just now decided to investigate a hoax, if it’s a hoax. And I have another concern about these investigations that he’s announced. If they have ongoing investigations in certain areas, those documents can’t be released.“So, this might be a big smokescreen, these investigations, to open a bunch of them, as a last-ditch effort to prevent the release of the Epstein files,” he added.ABC anchor Jonathan Karl asked Massie about what the Epstein records might contain and why Trump appears afraid of what they might reveal.“You know, I’ve never said that these files will implicateDonald Trump,” Massie replied. “And I really don’t think that they will. I think he’s trying to protect a bunch of rich and powerful friends, billionaires, donors to his campaign, friends in his social circles. That’s my operating theory on why he’s trying so hard to keep these files closed.”Massie also said it was possible that more than 100 House Republicans may vote in favor of releasing the Epstein files, documents currently held by the justice department related to the alleged crimes and alleged clientele of the late financier and sex offender, when the measure reaches the House floorfor a votethis week. He urged skeptics to rethink their position.“I would remind my Republican colleagues who are deciding how to vote: Donald Trump can protect you in red districts right now by giving you an endorsement. But in 2030, he’s not going to be the president, and you will have voted to protect pedophiles if you don’t vote to release these files, and the president can’t protect you then. This vote, the record of this vote, will last longer than Donald Trump’s presidency,” Massie said.Meanwhile, Khanna of California said moments later on NBC News’ Meet the Press that the effort was “not about Donald Trump” and encouraged the president to meet with thevictimswho have survived Epstein’s alleged sex-trafficking ring and have sincespoken out.“What we’re asking for is justice for the survivors,” Khanna said. “So, it’s not about Donald Trump. I don’t even know how involved Trump was. There are a lot of other people who are involved who have to be held accountable.”Marjorie Taylor Greene says Trump’s remarks hurtful but hopes they can make upRead moreHe also noted that many survivors who have spoken publicly about their abuse will be in Washington on Tuesday, where they plan to request a meeting with Trump.Epstein killed himselfin prisonin 2019 while awaiting federal trial in New York on sex crimes, having previouslyserved timein Florida for sex offenses after negotiatinga plea dealthere in 2008. His associate,Ghislaine Maxwell, is currentlyin prison.Mike Johnson, the Republican speaker of the House, said on Sunday he believed the approaching vote would help put an end to allegations that the president had any ties to Epstein’s abuse and trafficking of underage girls.“They’re doing this to go after President Trump on this theory that he has something to do with it. He does not,” Johnson said of critics, on the Fox News Sunday program.“Epstein is their [Democrats] entire game plan, so we’re going to take that weapon out of their hands,” Johnson said. “Let’s just get this done and move it on. There’s nothing to hide.”The Senate is thought unlikely to produce the necessary support to advance the legislation, however, and Senate majority whip John Barrasso, speaking on NBC on Sunday, declined to commit to holding a vote even if the pending bill passes in the House.Georgia Republican congresswomanMarjorie Taylor Greenehas also demanded the release of all the Epstein documents,despite itcausing a rift with Trump.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

He added that many of those taken into custody had “significant criminal and immigration history” and that the mass arrests were accomplished in “about 5 hours”.Federal immigration officers begin sweep in Charlotte, North CarolinaRead moreHe posted pictures of people the Trump administration commonly dubs “criminal illegal aliens” as a damning characterization for people living in the US without legal permission who have alleged criminal records. That included one of a man with an alleged history of drunk driving convictions.“We arrested him, taking him off the streets ofCharlotteso he can’t continue to ignore our laws and drive intoxicated on the same roads you and your loved ones are on,” Bovino wrote on X.The latest effort by federal law enforcement has been labeled “Operation Charlotte’s Web” as a play on the title of the children’s book but conjuring an image of people caught in a trap.In response to the crackdown, activists were seen invideosposted to social media handing out whistles to community members for them to alert their neighbors to the presence of ICE and federal agents.Charlotte mayor Vi Lyles, board of county commissioners chair Mark Jerrell, and Charlotte-Mecklenburg board of education chair Stephanie Sneed released ajoint statementfollowing news of the targeted efforts.“Our organizations believe that our diversity makes us stronger,” the statement reads. “The expected … operations are causing unnecessary fear and uncertainty in our community as recent operations in other cities have resulted in people without criminal records being detained and violent protests being the result of unwarranted actions.”At Camino, a nonprofit group that offers services to Latino communities, some said they were too afraid to leave their homes to attend school, medical appointments or work. A dental clinic the group runs had nine cancellations on Friday, spokesperson Paola Garcia said.“Latinos love this country. They came here to escape socialism and communism, and they’re hard workers and people of faith,” Garcia said. “They love their family, and it’s just so sad to see that this community now has this target on their back.”Nikki Marín Baena, co-director of Siembra NC, an immigrant advocacy group, called it a “shameful day for the North Carolina Republican Party, who hailed the arrival of so-called law enforcement officers carrying out terrorist operations, and echoed Greg Bovino’s talking points about ‘going after criminals’” in a statement to theNew York Times.The group added that, prior to Saturday, the biggest number of immigrant arrests in a single day inNorth Carolinawas 30 people back in June.Recent operations led by Bovino in Chicago and Los Angeles triggered a flurry of lawsuits and investigations over questions about use of force, including wide deployment of chemical agents against protesters.Democratic party leaders in both cities said that agents’ presence inflamed community tensions and actually led to violence.Bovino and other Trump administration officials have called the use of force appropriate, citing a growing threats on agents’ lives.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees CBP, did not respond to inquiries about the Charlotte arrests. Bovino’s spokesman did not return a request for comment on Sunday.A refugee’s deportation rattles a deeply conservative town: ‘What Trump has done is not Christlike’Read moreDHS has not offered many details about who it has been arresting. For instance in Chicago, the agency only provided names and details on a handful of its more than 3,000 arrests in the metro region from September to last week.By Sunday, reports of CBP activity in Charlotte were “overwhelming” and difficult to quantify, Greg Asciutto, executive director of the community development group CharlotteEast, said in an email.“The past two hours we’ve received countless reports of CBP activity at churches, apartment complexes and a hardware store,” he said.City council member-elect JD Mazuera Arias said targeting houses of worship was “just awful”.“These are sanctuaries for people who are looking for hope and faith in dark times like these and who no longer can feel safe because of the gross violation of people’s right to worship,” he said.Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS immigrationICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Trump administrationUS politicsNorth CarolinaCharlottenewsShareReuse this content"

He was taken to Bellevue Hospital, where he is in critical but stable condition.New York Jets legend Nick Mangold dies aged 41 while seeking kidney transplantRead more“We are aware of the situation involving Kris Boyd and will have no further comment at this time,” the Jets said in a statement.One of Boyd’s college friends from his time at Texas, Ernest Quander, said the player was recovering well.“He’s all good right now. He’s in good condition. He’s doing real good,” Quander told theNew YorkPost on Sunday.The Post reportedthat Boyd was shot after a dispute outside a restaurant turned violent. Police said they are looking for a man they believe to be the shooter who fled the scene in a BMW X8 SUV.Boyd, a cornerback who plays mainly on special teams, was a seventh-round selection by the Minnesota Vikings in the 2019 draft after his college career at Texas. He also played for the Houston Texans and Arizona Cardinals before joining the Jets in March. He has not played so far this season due to a shoulder injury.During his time at Texas, Boyd said that struggles during his childhood – he lost his father and the grandmother who helped raise him – had given him a positive outlook on life.“I appreciate all the little things,”Boyd said. “Everyone always asks me why I’ve got a smile on my face. It’s because I’m not supposed to be here.”The Jets have endured a difficult season off the field. In October one of the most popular players in their history, Nick Mangold, died at the age of 41while seeking a kidney transplant. Earlier this month, Dallas Cowboys defensive end Marshawn Kneelanddied at the age of 24.Explore more on these topicsNFLNew York JetsNew YorkUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

But is it really feasible?Edward Helmorein New YorkSun 16 Nov 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 16 Nov 2025 07.02 ESTShareScott Bessent, the US treasury secretary, returned fromSouth Carolinalast week brandishing a small piece of metal, proclaiming that it was the first rare-earth magnet made in the US in a quarter of a century.It was, he indicated toFox Business, proof that the US is ending “China’s chokehold on our supply chain”. Thanks to theSouth Carolinacompany eVAC’s new rare-earth mineral processing center, Bessent added: “We’re finally becoming independent again.”BreakingChina’s processing and manufacturing dominance in these materials, essential for some semiconductors, batteries and armaments, is a top priority for theTrump administrationthat has made a bet, via tariffs and other economic tools, that it can return the industry to US shores.The world dropped the ball on critical minerals and China pounced. Is it too late for Australia and the US to close the gap?Read moreThose tariffs led China to restrict rare-earth exports to the US and pushedDonald Trumpto sign deals with Australia, Malaysia, Cambodia and Japan.The US andChinahave now brokered a trade truce on rare earths but China, with approximately 70% of global mining and over 90% of global processing capacity, has a head start that Trump will struggle to erode.There’s no easy fix for the US to reset its dependence on Chinese production of minerals critical to national security, semiconductor production, and the transfer of energy production from fossil fuels to wind and solar. The US imported 80% of the rare earths it used in 2024, according to theUS Geological Survey.For some rare-earth minerals such as dysprosium, used in chip production, and samarium, essential to military applications, Chinese refinement dominance rises to 99%. Dysprosium and terbium are used in magnets essential for electric engines in electric vehicles and generators in wind turbines, along with uses in cellphones, high-intensity lighting and nuclear reactors.“These materials are used in electric motors for EV cars but also in guidance systems that have obvious applications for the defense department,” says Adam Webb, head of energy raw materials at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. “Anything that has a decent magnet in it uses rare earths.”Trump’s efforts to reduce the US’s dependence on Chinese production on rare-earth minerals could take years. “‘Rare earths’ is somewhat of a misnomer because they’re not that uncommon in terms of abundance in the earth’s crust,” Webb says, but many deposits, including inUkraine, where Trump made a deal earlier this year, are only in the early stages of extraction.“It’s not that there’s a shortage per se, it’s that China can limit how much is exported,” Webb said, adding that getting export licenses from China can be a lengthy, difficult process.Greenland, another focus of Trump’s attention, and Brazil, are two other countries where there are significant rare-earth deposits. In the continental US, there are deposits inCalifornia, Wyoming and Missouri, with the largest operational mine operating at Mountain Pass, California, about 60 miles from Las Vegas.In July, the Pentagon became the largest shareholder in MP Materials, the operator of the California mine, with plans to open a new “mine-to-magnet” plant, called 10X, to make magnets crucial in F-35 fighter jets, drones and submarines, according to thedepartment.In North America, measured and indicated resources of rare earths were estimated to include 3.6m tons in the US and more than 14m tons in Canada, according to thegeological surveydata – far less than the 44m tons estimated in China.Mirroring direct investment and stakes in the steel industry and US chipmaker Intel, the interior department said it was prepared to makedirect investmentsin critical mineral companies.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is not too late for the US but action is needed now.”Five years on, a scramble to assemble trading alliances around rare earths is accelerating.“In about a year from now, we’ll have so much critical mineral and rare earths that you won’t know what to do with them,” Trump told reporters. That came eight months after Trump demanded $500bn of Ukraine’s minerals to compensate the US for the military aid. In September, the government of Pakistan signed a $500m deal with the American company US Strategic Metals, giving it access to minerals such as antimony and copper.But can the US make up its shortfall and loosen China’s hold on rare-earth supply chains? “The US has taken really significant steps already,” Webb says. The US, he adds, cannot be “self-reliant in the short term because it takes time to bring a mine online and build refining capacity.”Explore more on these topicsCritical mineralsTrump administrationDonald TrumpChinaUkraineSouth CarolinaCaliforniafeaturesShareReuse this content"

In some cases, be prepared to pay out 2.5% more as a “financing” fee because you’re using a credit card. Enjoying that meal at the local diner? Better have cash or you could be subject to the same fee. Grabbing a bag of chips and a soda at the local convenience store? Oops … Unless you’re prepared to spend a minimum of 10 bucks you can’t use your credit card, sorry.I’ve always been irritated by these practices. And I know I’m not alone. Who carries cash any more? Why are we, the customer, being shamed because we choose to buy something using what has become a standard form of payment over something that’s clearly a thing of the past?Merchants have been fighting the credit card companies about these fees for years. And now they’ve won. This past week, Visa and Mastercardended their battle, and now future fees will probably be lower for consumers that use some cards, particularly the ones that offer fewer rewards. But did these businesses really win? I’m not so sure. Be careful what you ask for.I’m as capitalist as they get but Medicare for all is the best hope for US healthcare | Gene MarksRead moreBecause thanks to this “victory”, these businesses are complicating things even more for the consumer and themselves.Fees will probably be layered based on the card used and some business owners may even find themselves rejecting some cards altogether because the fees are too high. The average consumer carries about four credit cards, according tosome studies. Up until now all were treated equally. But no longer. Can I use this card to buy a packet of chips or that card? Will merchants now provide a list of cards that are acceptable to them? Will I be penalized otherwise or turned away at the door?By making things more difficult for your customer, you’re risking the sale. Or a future sale if the headaches of doing business with you outweigh the benefits. And you’re increasing your costs to account for the different cards used and fees charged and for what you’ll probably pay your point of sale system provider to help you do this.Small business owners complain about the high merchant fees charged by credit card companies, and yet it’s those very same small businesses who heavily rely on these services. According to theNational Bureau of Economic Research, credit card payments (and usage) by small businesses increased from $10,000 a month on average in 2020 to $24,000 a month by April 2022. About 55% of small businesses surveyed said they used a corporate credit card in the past 12 months.The settlement will probably have a rewards boomerang effect on these very same businesses. Credit card companies use merchant fees to establish partnerships with thousands of businesses so that their customers can enjoy more products, services and travel perks by using their cards. Some cards offer as much as 1% to 5% back at office supply stores and on internet, cable and phone services, as well as at gas stations, restaurants and other locations. Others have partnerships with brands such as Google Workspace, ZipRecruiter and Lyft that offer ongoing credits and price reductions on their services specifically to small businesses.Talk about biting the hand that feeds you. These services and programs will probably be rolled back, or made more expensive. And it’s the small business owner who will be penalized.Limiting awards also means limiting revenue. Many studies have shown that consumers tend to spend more at a business when using their credit card. Credit card rewards programs also include countless small merchants offering their wares. By participating in these programs, these small business owners enjoyed introductions to new customers that never would have known about them otherwise.Finally, who are we kidding? Do we really think Mastercard and Visa aren’t going to make up for these costs elsewhere? Of course they will. They’ll charge higher annual membership fees to the business owners who enjoy these perks and increase late payment and penalty fees or special charges for things like fraud investigations which are paid by – you guessed it – business people. They’ll raise interest rates on foreign transaction and cash advance fees that are also paid by businesses, or pass down higher costs to their partners like banks and other financial service providers, who will in turn pass these costs to their customers who are – ready? – business people.If you run a retail shop or a diner, isn’t it easier to just calculate how much the merchant fee costs as a percentage of your total revenues and then spread out a small price increase among all your products, where the impact would be barely noticed? Will a customer care if they’re paying $12.50 or $12.75 for a burger? No. Will they raise an eyebrow because you’re charging an additional fee on top of the entire bill because – gasp – they don’t use cash? Yes, they will.Small businesses are deluding themselves when they say this credit card settlement is a victory. All this does is create more costs, not less.Explore more on these topicsUS small businessCredit card feesConsumer affairscommentShareReuse this content"

That meant thousands of flights were cancelled during the crisis, which ended last week.After the Senate and House passed legislation to reopen the government, the transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, said that the controllers wouldreceive 70%of their back pay within 24 to 48 hours of the shutdown ending and the remainder a week later. This week, there was a significant reduction in the number of controllers who called off from work, according to the transportation department.“Already we are seeing less flight cancellations and delays,” said Mike Arnot, spokesperson for the aviation analytics company Cirium. “That’s a testament to the controllers, right? Now that the controllers are going to get their back pay, finally, it probably will relatively quickly re-establish stability in the US airline industry.”In short, “Thanksgiving shouldn’t be impacted at all”, Arnot said.Before the shutdown started on 1 October, the country was already dealing with a shortage of air traffic controllers because of retirements anddifficultyfinding people who could complete the necessary training.The deficiency worsened during the shutdown because 13,000 controllers and 50,000 Transportation Security Administration staff had to work without pay.As such, on 6 November, theFederal Aviation Administration ordereddomestic airlines to gradually reduce the number of flights at 40 of the busiest airports by 10% to ensure public safety amidst absences and stress among traffic controllers. That weekend, almost 7% of the more than 72,000 scheduled departures from the US were canceled, according to Cirium. On a normal day, about 1% of US departures are canceled.But on Wednesday, even before Donald Trump approved the bill toreopen the government, there were only four staffing triggers, meaning delays when air traffic facilities are understaffed, according to the transportation department. That was down from 81 on 8 November.As such,Duffy announcedthat the agency would freeze flight reductions, which had been slated to expand on Friday, and instead stick with the 6% cut.In addition to Duffy’s pledge that controllers would be paid quickly after the shutdown ended, Trump, who criticized air traffic controllers who took time off during the shutdown, said that those who had continued to work during the shutdown would receive a$10,000 bonus.The homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem,then saidon Thursday that TSA officers “who showed up every day to serve and protect the American people” would also receive a $10,000 bonus.Noem did not specify the criteria that determined which TSA officers would receive payment.Johnny J Jones, secretary-treasurer of the American Federation of Government Employees’ TSA Council 100, the union representing TSA officials, told theNew York TimesThursday that the bonuses were “great for some, but it’s better to give everybody a little something because they all suffered and they all endured hard times during the last 43 days”.If staffing levels return to normal this weekend, the FAA will probably start allowing airlines to restore their usual flight schedules early next week, Henry Harteveldt, airline industry analyst at Atmosphere Research Group, said.“Paying the air traffic controllers the money they earned during the shutdown will also go a long way towards ensuring that the controllers return to work, reducing the stress that they have felt during the shutdown and allowing them to better concentrate on their jobs,” Harteveldt said.After a 35-day government shutdown ended in 2019, it took more than two months for controllers to receive full back pay, Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, told theAssociated Press. He predicted during this shutdown that it would take months for air travel to return to normal.A spokesperson for the association said Daniels was not available for comment.Despite the less-than-expected turbulence at airports after the government reopened, some uncertainty remains.Pilots worked additional hours because of delays during the shutdown and, in some cases, reached the maximum time they were allowed to work, according to Dennis Tajer, a spokesperson for Allied Pilots Association, the union for American Airlines pilots. That not only caused pilots additional stress, but airlines then also had to call up reserves.Delta settles flight attendant lawsuit over sexual harassment and union retaliationRead moreIf the weather causes delays in the coming weeks, airlines could face a shortage of pilots, Tajer said.“It all depends on Mother Nature,” Tajer said. “That truly will be the key.”Even once the remaining air traffic controllers return to work – some of them retired – there will still be a shortage. Theair traffic controllers’ associationstated before the shutdown that there were 10,800 controllers, which was about 3,800 fewer than the FAA’s target level.“It’s going to take two or three years to get enough air traffic controllers to approach the full number,” said Kit Darby, an aviation consultant.On Thursday, 3.5% of flights departing in the US were cancelled, marking the fourth straight day in which that percentage had declined, according to Cirium. Also, 94% of flights left within 15 minutes of the departure time, compared with 75% a week earlier.“We believe the impact of the shutdown will be muted by Monday,” Arnot stated.Explore more on these topicsUS newsAirline industryUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The lifting of the privacy order was firstreported by the Independenton Sunday.A spokesperson for Abramovich told Reuters: “No charges have been brought against Mr Abramovich in the three and a half years since the investigation was commenced, and, to our knowledge, in fact no progress has been made on this case.“Mr Abramovich was allowed earlier this year to introduce claims of conspiracy against the government ofJersey.”The crown dependency froze more than $7bn (£5.3bn) of assetssuspected of being linked to himsoon after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The Jersey attorney general also said Abramovich was a suspect in a criminal investigation.Abramovich then succeeded in his legal attempt to force ministers and other senior figures in Jersey to produce private messages, emails and other data related to him that would now be made public, the Independent reported.The paper also published details from a judgment reportedly issued last week by the advocate David Michael Cadin, the master of the royal court, ordering the government of Jersey (GOJ) to pay Abramovich’s costs and describing its failure to provide data requested by the oligarch’s legal team more than two years ago as “extreme”.“The GOJ defendants’ conduct was out of the ordinary for any litigant let alone an ‘office holder’, and unreasonable,” he is reported to have said. “No proper explanation has been offered by the GOJ defendants for their failings.”Jersey is one of the tax havens from which Abramovich managed his fortune, using a network of offshore companies and trusts, that in turn controlled companies with bank accounts inSwitzerland.According to the Swiss rulings that first shone a light on the investigation, Jersey officials are looking into the origins of the oligarch’s wealth, acquired during the chaotic rise of capitalism inRussiain the 1990s and 2000s.Abramovich, through his lawyers, has denied the Jersey allegations and said any suggestion he was involved in criminal activity was false.The Law Officers’ Department in Jersey said: “We are unable to comment.”Abramovich did not respond to the Guardian’s invitations to comment.Quick GuideContact Guardian Business about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact the Business team confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

He was taken to Bellevue Hospital, where he is in critical but stable condition.New York Jets legend Nick Mangold dies aged 41 while seeking kidney transplantRead more“We are aware of the situation involving Kris Boyd and will have no further comment at this time,” the Jets said in a statement.One of Boyd’s college friends from his time at Texas, Ernest Quander, said the player was recovering well.“He’s all good right now. He’s in good condition. He’s doing real good,” Quander told theNew YorkPost on Sunday.The Post reportedthat Boyd was shot after a dispute outside a restaurant turned violent. Police said they are looking for a man they believe to be the shooter who fled the scene in a BMW X8 SUV.Boyd, a cornerback who plays mainly on special teams, was a seventh-round selection by the Minnesota Vikings in the 2019 draft after his college career at Texas. He also played for the Houston Texans and Arizona Cardinals before joining the Jets in March. He has not played so far this season due to a shoulder injury.During his time at Texas, Boyd said that struggles during his childhood – he lost his father and the grandmother who helped raise him – had given him a positive outlook on life.“I appreciate all the little things,”Boyd said. “Everyone always asks me why I’ve got a smile on my face. It’s because I’m not supposed to be here.”The Jets have endured a difficult season off the field. In October one of the most popular players in their history, Nick Mangold, died at the age of 41while seeking a kidney transplant.

The Italian has now won 31 consecutive matches on the surface dating back to the starring role he played in Italy’s Davis Cup triumph in 2023. At 24 he is the youngest man to defend anATP Finalstitle since Roger Federer in 2004 and just the second man after Novak Djokovic to win this title consecutively without dropping a set.Perhaps most importantly, Sinner struck back after absorbing so many difficult blows in his rivalry with Alcaraz this year. While Sinner has compiled an 85-2 record against the rest of the field dating back to last August, he had lost seven of his past eight matches against Alcaraz, his only victory comingin the Wimbledon final. He will head into the new season having levelled the playing field against his biggest rival.The final months of Sinner’s season, which ends with three titles and a 15-match winning run, have underlined the Italian’s work ethic and desperation to improve. Immediately after hisdefeat by Alcaraz at the US Open, Sinner was transparent about his beliefs that he needed to make significant changes to his game in order to tackle Alcaraz’s unique brand of unpredictable variety.View image in fullscreenJannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz greet each other at the net after the Italian’s victory.Photograph: Marco Bertorello/AFP/Getty ImagesHe has spent the past few months carefully working more drop shots and net forays into his game. After a dire serving display in New York, Sinner made adjustments to his service technique and this week those improvements played a decisive role in this victory. In the face of Alcaraz’s net forays deep in the first-set tie-break, Sinner continued to think clearly under pressure and the significant risks he took behind his second serve on key points paid off.Both players burst into the match serving precisely and eviscerating the ball in their desperation to take the first strike, their combined intensity and quality so much higher than any other match this week. Not even a 10-minute break because of a medical emergency in the crowd, with the spectator eventually being escorted out while conscious and moving, slowed their rapid momentum.After an hour of relentless first‑strike tennis, it looked like Alcaraz might set himself apart with his variation. At 6-5 on Sinner’s serve, he followed up his first drop‑shot of the match, a perfectly timed winner, with an intelligent foray to the net to reach set point. Sinner responded immediately, firing down a spectacular winning 116mph second serve to scupper the Spaniard’s opportunity before serving brilliantly to force a tie-break. At the end of a monumental 79‑minute set, Sinner played with clarity, executing two brilliant lobs over a net rushing Alcaraz to seal the set.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His hamstring was taped up before the second set. Although Alcaraz broke serve early in set two, remaining solid in an erratic Sinner service game, he clearly lacked his usual explosiveness with his forward movement.An even bigger problem for Alcaraz, however, was his desperate rival across the net. As the wild Italian crowd chanted Sinner’s name, the occasion inspired the most expressive version of the Italian, who is usually so composed in the biggest moments. He celebrated epic points by cupping hands to his ears or raising his racket high to the crowd, asking for even more noise from his captive audience. He refused to let the opportunity pass him by, nervelessly shutting the door on Alcaraz in two immense sets to end his season with a perfect result.Explore more on these topicsATP FinalsJannik SinnerCarlos AlcarazTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

DR Congo beat Nigeria after a gripping penalty shootout in Sunday’s final, and go through to represent Africa in the intercontinental playoffs in March.EgyptMohamed Salah scored twice as Hossam Hassan’s side beat Djibouti 3-0 in Casablanca in October and made up formissing out on Qatar 2022by reaching the finals with a game in hand. This will be Egypt’s fourth finals, even though they have yet to win a game. Bizarrely, the Pharaohs did qualify for the first World Cup, in 1930, but missed their boat from Marseille to South Americaafter a storm delayed them.MoroccoThe undisputed neutrals’ favourites at the last finals became the first African nation to reach the 2026 showpiece with a 5-0 thumping of Niger on 5 September in Rabat. The Qatar 2022 semi-finalists qualified from Group E with two games to spare after Tanzania’s 1-1 draw in Congo-Brazzaville. The Atlas Lions have reached the finals six times and willco-host the 2030 editionalongside Portugal and Spain (the three opening matches will be played in Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay).TunisiaLikewise, the Carthage Eagles qualified with two games to spare in Group H. Mohamed Ben Romdhane’s last-gasp winner and the defiance of the goalkeeper, Aymen Dahmen, in Malabo against Equatorial Guinea ensured Tunisia reached the finals for a seventh time, although they have yet to progress beyond the group stage.AlgeriaVladimir Petkovic’s side secured their place with a comfortable 3-0 win over Somalia in October. Mohamed Amoura scored twice, taking the Wolfsburg striker’s tally in the qualifying campaign to eight, and the captain, Riyad Mahrez, added another. Victory put them four points clear of second-placed Uganda in Group G with one round of matches remaining. It will be Algeria’s fifthWorld Cupfinals appearance but first since Brazil in 2014.GhanaMohamed Kudus got the winner at home to Comoros as Ghana celebrated qualification in October. Ghana have now reached five of the last six World Cup finals but their manager, Otto Addo, has played down expectations, claiming the current crop of players are “nowhere close” to the team that reached the 2010 quarter-finals.Cape VerdeThe Blue Sharks willmake their World Cup debut at the 2026 finalsafter topping Group D with a 3-0 home win over Eswatini in October, leaving Cameroon in second place. Having only taken part in qualifying since 2002, Cape Verde will be the second-smallest nation by population to play at a men’s finals, after Iceland in 2018.South AfricaSouth Africa overcame a three-point deduction in their qualifying campaign to finish top of Group C after beating Rwanda 3-0 at home. Benin, who had a two-point lead going into the final round of games, fell from top to third after losing 4-0 to Nigeria, with Victor Osimhen’s hat-trick ensuring the Super Eagles secured second spot to advance to the playoff round in November. It is the first time South Africa have qualified for the finals since hosting the tournament in 2010.SenegalThe Lions of Teranga cruised to a 4-0 victory over neighbours Mauritania in October to finish top of their qualifying Group B. Former Liverpool forward Sadio Mané scored two of the goals, with Everton’s Iliman Ndiaye also on the scoresheet.

Iran first reached the finals in 1978 but in six tournaments have yet to venture beyond the group stage. Their finest hour thus far came against the USA in Lyon at the 1998 finals, a 2-1 victory sparking delirium in the streets of Tehran. They met again in Qatar, the group match ending 1-0 in the Americans’ favour after a goal from Christian Pulisic in the 38th minute.JapanThe Samurai Blue cruised through their qualifying campaign, sealing their ticket with three group games to spare. Japan became the first nation to book their place through qualifiers by beating Bahrain 2-0 in Saitama after Daichi Kamada and Takefusa Kubo scored in the second half. They will compete in their eighth successive World Cup. In Qatar, Hajime Moriyasu’s side reached the last 16 only to lose to Croatia on penalties.JordanAli Olwan’s hat-trick triggered jubilation in Jordan as the 2023 Asian Cup runners-up qualified for their first World Cup finals on 5 June after beating Oman 3-0 in Muscat as South Korea beat Iraq 2-0. Jordan’s ruler, King Abdullah II, was pictured wearing a national team jersey as he watched the game from the Jordan embassy in London, where he was on a visit.South KoreaKorea reached their 11th consecutive finals with victory over 10-man Iraq at Basra Stadium on 5 June for what is expected to be Son Heung-min’s swansong. The Tottenham great and Taegeuk Warriors captain will turn 34 during the finals and has said it will be his last tournament. Korea’s formidable qualifying record is bettered only by Brazil, Germany, Italy, Argentina and Spain, although their underwhelming exit at the 2023 Asian Cup led to Jürgen Klinsmann being replaced by Hong Myung-bo, who oversaw victories against Oman, Jordan, Iraq and Kuwait in qualifying.UzbekistanWelcome, the White Wolves, who finally reached a World Cup finalssome 2,800 miles from home with a drab 0-0 draw with the United Arab Emirates in Abu Dhabi. The Uzbeks are finally making an impact at senior international level, having reached the quarter-finals of the Under-17 World Cup, last 16 of the global Under-20 tournament and the Paris Olympics. In Abdukodir Khusanov, who made his (albeit shaky) Manchester City debut aged just 20, and the 22-year-old winger Abbosbek Fayzullaev, Timur Kapadze has two burgeoning talents at his disposal.QatarQatar beat the United Arab Emirates 2-1 in the fourth round of Asian qualifying to seal a spot at next year’s finals. It will be a second straight appearance at the finals for Qatar, who hosted the last edition in 2022.Saudi ArabiaThehosts of the 2034 tournamentclaimed a 0-0 draw with Iraq in Jeddah to seal qualification. The result meant Hervé Renard’s side won Group B of the fourth round of Asia’s qualifying, finishing level on four points with Iraq but ahead of their neighbours on goals scored after a 3-2 win over third-place Indonesia in the three-team group.See the full AFC standingshere.EuropeA total of 54 nations (Russia are suspended) have been slugging it out for a place at next year’s finals. The winners of 12 groups qualify, while the four remaining places are secured via a playoff system featuring group runners-up and Nations League group winners. Despite failing to make the top two in their groups,Northern Ireland,Romania,andGraham Potter’sSwedenhave playoff spots due to winning their Nations League groups, albeit with a tough draw in store. Wales or North Macedonia will have the final playoff spot via the Nations League route.

The 2018 champions will make their eighth consecutive appearance at the World Cup.CroatiaThe 2018 finalists completed a 3-1 comeback win over the Faroe Islands at home on Friday – with 40-year-old Luka Modric still pulling the strings in midfield – to become the third European nation to secure their place, as the second-placed Czech Republic can no longer catch them in Group L.PortugalPortugal qualified on Sunday with a 9-1 hammering of Armenia that included hat-tricks from both Bruno Fernandes and João Neves. The reigning Nations League champions were forced to wait to book an automatic spot after losing 2-0 to Ireland on Thursday in a game where their captain Cristiano Ronaldo was sent off. But Roberto Martínez’s side needed no help from their all-time top scorer in a one-sided match that assured them top spot in Group F with 13 points, giving Ronaldo the opportunity to play at a record sixth World Cup.See the full Uefa standingshere.North America, Central America and the CaribbeanThere are three automatic slots for the winners of the three four-team groups.

New Zealand reached the World Cup for the first time in 16 years by beating New Caledonia 3-0 at Auckland’s Eden Park, the fortress of their 15-player code cousins the All Blacks. The win didn’t come easy, however. Goalless in the first half, Darren Bazeley’s side lost their captain, Chris Wood, to a hip injury early in the second. Only after an hour did Michael Boxall end the stalemate, scoring his first international goal aged 36. Kosta Barbarouses doubled New Zealand’s lead shortly after, before Eli Just wrapped up the result in the 80th minute.See the full OFC standingshere.South AmericaThe six direct spots have all been all filled.Boliviasecured the confederation’s playoff place with a surprise 1-0 win over Brazil in El Alto.ArgentinaThe holders claimed their spot on 25 March when Bolivia drew 0-0 with Uruguay. The big question hovering over Lionel Scaloni’s world champions is whether Lionel Messi will play at the finals. The Inter Miami forward has remained coy about his intentions. “Well, it’s like I’ve said before. I don’t think I’ll play the next World Cup – not because of age, but the most logical thing is that I won’t,” said Messi after helping Argentina beat Venezuela 3-0 last month. The evergreen 38-year-old then backtracked slightly, adding: “It’s about taking it one day at a time, trying to feel good, and above all being honest with myself. When I feel good, I enjoy it. When I don’t, honestly, I suffer, and I’d rather not be there. So we’ll see.”View image in fullscreenLionel Messi celebrates his second goal in the 3-0 win against Venezuela last month.Photograph: Luis Robayo/AFP/Getty ImagesEcuadorLa Trireached the finals – for the fifth time this century – on 10 June, a goalless draw against Peru in Lima enough to assure Ecuador’s place with two matches to spare. Ecuador, who finished second in the standings, beat the team who finished top, Argentina, 1-0 in Guayaquil in a match that ended with both sides reduced to 10 players by red cards. Argentina’s Nicolás Otamendi was sent off in the 31st minute and the hosts capitalised on their numerical advantage when Enner Valencia scored a penalty in first-half stoppage time. Ecuador were also reduced to 10 men when the Chelsea midfielder Moisés Caicedo was dismissed in the 50th minute.ColombiaColombia are a colourful feature of any finals and, after missing out on Qatar 2022, are back after James Rodríguez led his side to a 3-0 defeat of Bolivia on 4 September, Néstor Lorenzo’s side reaching the 2026 tournament with a game to spare.La Tricolorprogressed to the quarter-finals in 2014 and in Luis Díaz boast one of the game’s most compelling talents. The winger scored 30 goals in his last two seasons at Liverpool, helping them win the Premier League, and has been in scintillating form since a summer move to Bayern Munich. One to watch: Benfica’s record signing, Richard Ríos. The 25-year-old has made a dazzling start to life at the Estádio da Luz after his move from Palmeiras.UruguayMarcelo Bielsa, once the toast of Elland Road, guidedLa Celesteto their fifth successive World Cup with an impressive 3-0 victory against Peru at the Estadio Centenario on 4 September. In a mixed campaign Uruguay still managed to beat Brazil in Montevideo and surprise Argentina in Buenos Aires. The 70-year-old former Leeds manager is set for a third World Cup as a head coach. In 2002,El Loco’s Argentina side crashed out in the group stage but he led Chile to South Africa 2010 where they were beaten in the last 16 by Brazil. Bielsa has talent at his disposal, too. Edinson Cavani and Luis Suárez may have gone, but the Real Madrid midfielder Federico Valverde brings the fire. His club manager, Xabi Alonso, has compared him with a peak Steven Gerrard, saying: “Every manager would like a Valverde on the team.”BrazilCarlo Ancelotti’s side extended Brazil’s record as the only team to play at every World Cup by beating Paraguay 1-0 on 10 June to finish fifth in the standings, their lowest qualifying position. The five-time winners will make their 23rd appearance in next year’s tournament but, with limited preparation time after arriving in May from Real Madrid, the Italian coach is relying on team spirit and individual talent. “I think more tactical work is needed to refine game strategy. All of this can be very important, but the most important part is not the strategy, it is the attitude of the players on the pitch. For that, it doesn’t take much time to prepare,” says Ancelotti.ParaguayFor the first time since 2010 Paraguay will participate in the World Cup after a tricky 0-0 draw at home against Ecuador on 4 September. Gustavo Alfaro’s side impressed by holding off their opponents to snare the crucial point they needed. Miguel Almirón, who left Newcastle in January, and the former Brighton midfielder Julio Enciso, now at Strasbourg, are two players familiar to Premier League adherents. Almirón was 16 years old in 2010 and the Atlanta United captain still recalls watching Paraguay’s first match – a 1-1 draw with Italy in Cape Town – with his friends at his home in the San Pablo neighbourhood of Asunción. “That fills you with pride, to see your country in this huge competition,” Almirón said. “You always dream of that.”See the full Conmebol standingshere.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026World Cup 2026 qualifiersWorld CupUS sportsexplainersShareReuse this content"

His reaction when he saw that his number was about to come up after an evening of inconsistency in Tirana was not good enough.It was a challenge to Thomas Tuchel’s authority and was hardly a clever look given that it added to the sense that this is a player who is yet to realise that his immediate international future hinges on embracing the collective.England coach Thomas Tuchel unimpressed with Jude Bellingham’s petulanceRead moreBellingham has to learn. There was no need for a strop. Harry Kane had just putEngland2-0 up in a dead rubber of a qualifier, there were six minutes left and Bellingham, who had not played particularly well, had just been booked for fouling Armando Broja. This was hardly a controversial substitution. In fact it would have been foolish for Tuchel to leave Bellingham on given that there was a risk that midfielder would rule himself out of the opening game of the World Cup by picking up a second yellow card.Yet Bellingham turned the spotlight on himself. There was no disguising the 22-year-old’s frustration when he clocked that he was going to make way for Morgan Rogers. He flung his arms in the air and although he shook Tuchel’s hand after making his way to the touchline it was clear that the head coach was not impressed.“I don’t want to make more out of it but I stick to my words ‘behaviour is key’ and respect towards the teammates who come in,” Tuchel said. “Decisions are made and you have to accept it as a player.”This is the challenge for Bellingham. He congratulated Marcus Rashford for delivering the cross for Kane to head in his second of the night but the rest was self-defeating. It is not as if protesting was going to change Tuchel’s mind. The German has talked so much about respecting team hierarchies and the importance of behaving correctly.Bellingham, left out of last month’s squad, has been under scrutiny after returning to the fold this month. In effect he has been on trial and he has not done himself any favours with his response to being taken off as England rounded off a perfect qualifying campaign by seeing off a feisty challenge from Albania.View image in fullscreenJude Bellingham offered moments of quality in Tirana but also showed flashes of impertinence.Photograph: Francesco Scaccianoce/Uefa/Getty ImagesIt means the jury is out on whether England function at their best with Bellingham in the team. The evidence here was inconclusive. There was experimentation from Tuchel at the start. He has given England structure and clarity in recent months, building with a No 6, a No 8, a No 10 and specialist wingers, but there was a different feel against Albania. Jarell Quansah was handed his international debut, Adam Wharton made his first start at this level and the positioning of John Stones as an auxiliary midfielder meant there was a passing resemblance to Manchester City’s 2023 treble winners.It was nothing if not interesting. England morphed into a 3-2-2-3 system in possession during the first half. There was no No 10. Bellingham was an inside-right with licence to roam. Declan Rice pushed higher than usual. Eberechi Eze was wide on the left but struggled to get involved.The problem was that Albania were deep and compact. England did not create much and there was little sign of a connection between Kane and Bellingham. It took until the 35th minute for them to link up. A quick exchange of passes had Bellingham running at Albania and feeding Jarrod Bowen, who was denied by a good save from Thomas Strakosha.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He made a chance for Eze during the second half but often looked too desperate to impress. There were a lot of rushed, misplaced passes. There was a needless bit of aggro with an Albania midfielder early on. England were ragged for much of the second half. One Albania chance came after Bellingham squandered possession. His booking came after he lost the ball to Broja and fouled the former Chelsea striker.Quick GuidePlay our new game: On the ballShowThe Guardian has kicked off a new chapter in puzzles withthe launch of its first daily football game, On the ball. It is now live in the app for both iOS and Android … so what are you waiting for? Get stuck in!Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.In the end England’s depth made the difference. Tuchel threw on Phil Foden, who seemed better suited to the position in which Bellingham operated during the first half, and Bukayo Saka. Eventually Saka delivered a corner for Kane to open the scoring. It was a reminder that set pieces will be crucial next summer.Still, though, Bellingham was the story. The brilliance of Rashford’s assist for Kane’s header was a little lost in the ridiculousness of the Rogers substitution. At the end, all eyes were on Bellingham. Tuchel walked up behind him and pushed the Real Madrid midfielder towards the travelling England fans. Their relationship is not broken. Tuchel is not willing to give up on Bellingham yet. Yet whether he is willing to give him centre stage remains in doubt.Explore more on these topicsEnglandJude BellinghamThomas TuchelAlbaniaWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersanalysisShareReuse this content"

For the goal Reyna scored in the fourth minute, and the quasi-assist he gave in the 71st of the 75 minutes he played inthe US’s 2-1 friendly win over Paraguayon Saturday. For extending the USMNT’s unbeaten run to four, after victories over Japan and Australia and a tie with Ecuador.Thank you,too, for repaying Pochettino’s faith for something akin to a shock call-up, and an even more shocking start. For not making his manager look silly after he called Reyna “a special player” earlier in the week, when Pochettino had to answer uncomfortable questions about breaking his own rule of only selecting players who are fit and in form. After all, Reyna has played just 150 minutes this season at Borussia Mönchengladbach since joining from Borussia Dortmund in search of, well, more minutes. He hadn’t started a game for the US since their elimination from the Copa América on 1 July 2024.Thank you,certainly, for giving the Americans another attacking weapon. For enabling Sergiño Dest up the right flank and forming a compelling new pairing that provided an offensive pulse when the team wasonce again badly deprived of manpower– absent forwards Christian Pulisic and Tim Weah, midfielders Weston McKennie and Tyler Adams, and defenders Chris Richards and Antonee Robinson. For spotting pockets in the half-spaces, and opening angles and cracks in Paraguay’s low block.Gio Reyna marks USMNT return with goal in 2-1 win over ParaguayRead more“I’m so happy with him,” Pochettino said of Reyna after the game. “He showed why he started. We can see today that he was great, scored, an [unofficial] assist, and [always had] the capacity to read the game and find the free space in between the lines, I think that was a nightmare for Paraguay and he did a very good job.”Reyna had his manager’s trust, a feeling that has eluded him forthe last few frustrating years. “Play with my instincts, be myself, that’s what the coaches have been telling me the last few days,” he told TNT after the game.When the loaded moniker of the “golden generation” first started being uttered about this incarnation of the USMNT, it was because of players just like Reyna, the bewitchingly gifted son of Claudio Reyna, a former US captain. Gio was a player possessed of tools and skills that you could dream on. A difference-maker at the very highest level. Potentially, anyway. Good enough to break into a loaded Dortmund side as a teenager, alongside Erling Haaland and Jude Bellingham.Reyna’s international breakthrough was slow in coming, but come it arrived in that scintillating performance at the 2024 Concacaf Nations League Finals, when he was the player of the tournament as he led the US to a third straight title. There was something magical about Reyna in those two games, taking control of the extra-time win over Jamaica and the comprehensive victory over Mexico.His first appearance under Pochettino came in that same tournament a year later, when the apathetic US caved in on themselves. Reyna, like several teammates, looked entirely disposable. Saturday marked his first appearance since then, and only his second game in the 13th month of the Pochettino era.Reyna is perhaps the program’s most talented player, and certainly its most befuddling prospect, vacillating between effervescent performances, injury layoffs,an icky scandal, and long stretches out of favor for both club and country. He commands the spotlight, or he is booed off the stage; it’s never anything in between.But when he’s on, as he was on Saturday, there is nobody in the player pool like him. “Boy, it’s fun to play with him,” said goalkeeper Matt Freese. “You just get him the ball and things will happen.”His goal was telling. He’s fairly tall, he noted casually, and he’d been working on headers in practice in the last few weeks with Gladbach. He summarily scored his first header as a professional, two days after his 23rd birthday – “A little gift to myself, ” he said. It was also ammunition for the family group chat. The goal, Gio Reyna’s ninth for the US, pushed him past his father’s eight – a fact that Gio said he didn’t know until arriving back in the locker room, after which he texted his dad some light-hearted banter.The second goal was more of a retrograde Reyna item. Diego Luna and Cristian Roldan harried Paraguay into a turnover which rolled to striker Folarin Balogun. He played Reyna through the line, who returned the ball into Balogun’s path. It took a deflection – robbing Reyna of the assist – but fell for the striker, who scored for a third time in four matches.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Dutch-American deployed in the wing-back role in Pochettino’s newish 3-4-3 system, was making only his third US appearance since 2023.You would not conventionally call this a standout game for Dest. He lost the ball a few times. His defending wasn’t noteworthy, since, well, that isn’t a thing he’s particularly good at. Yet he added something intangible. A bonus threat going forward. A bit of flair and pizzazz. A dash of chaos. The eccentric PSV player is as liable tocut inside and score a stonking goalwith untied shoelaces on his bad foot – as he nearly did in the second half when his stinging shot was touched just over the bar, albeit with properly affixed cleats – as he is tolose his cool and get a red card. He is probably the team’s most creative player,an ambulatory tekkers reel. He’s certainlythe most fun.More germanely, he creates overloads with his versatility. “He can play in so many different positions,” said midfielder Brenden Aaronson. “He can be really technical in the pocket. He’s not only a right-back or a right wing-back. He can play in that central role. He’s an amazing player. He offers something completely different from many other players.”Pochettino has been preaching culture and competitiveness and a kind of truculent attitude to anything the team does on the field. But if the Americans are to get anywhere at the World Cup next summer, they will need their best players’ individual gifts to shine through. That’s how the biggest games are won, after all, in thefine flashes when inspiration overcomes difficulty. In those little moments, they will need their Dests and their Reynas.Late on in Saturday’s game, the TNT feed panned to Reyna chatting with Balogun on the bench.

But his victory on Sunday was extra special for the technical specialist who quit the sport before the start of the 2023-24 season following a fall-out with the Norwegian ski federation, only to return a year later to race for Brazil, his mother’s homeland and the one he says helped form his colourful personality.With his fashion statements and DJ appearances on the club scene, Pinheiro Braathen brings his own flair to the traditional world of ski racing and says he wants to help make the sport more culturally diverse.“I would hope that maybe me showing that I can put Brazil on a map in such a sport encourages people from countries that aren’t well represented to dare to go for it,” he said soon after switching to Brazil. “If I can just convince one kid to still go for it, that would make me the happiest person alive.”He made good on that vow on Sunday, and while most Brazilian eyes will still be fixed on next year’s football World Cup, interest in the Winter Olympics may soar on the beaches of Rio de Janeiro.Sunday’s race was a gripping contest and, at one point, it seemed as though unheralded Briton Laurie Taylor might win after a scintillating fastest second run put him in first place. Then Hallberg sparked wild celebrations by going 0.04 seconds quicker than the Brit who ended up a career-best fourth.Noel piled on the pressure in the penultimate run of the day to grab the lead, but the script was already written for Pinheiro Braathen.“If there are kids out there watching, your difference is your superpower – believe in it,” he said.Explore more on these topicsSkiingBrazilUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

McIlroy lost in a playoff against Matt Fitzpatrick in the season-ending DP World Tour Championship in Dubai, having staged a dramatic late fightback with an eagle at the 72nd hole.While his Ryder Cup teammate celebrated a third win in the event, the Northern Irishman clinched the season-long crown to eclipse the late Ballesteros’s tally of six and move one behind record-holder, Colin Montgomerie. McIlroy told Sky Sports: “It’s amazing, I had a conversation with Carmen [Ballesteros’s ex-wife] before I went out to play today and she told me how proud he would have been.Donald Trump’s granddaughter Kai in last after 83 in shaky LPGA debutRead more“He means so much to this tour and the European Ryder Cup team. We rally so much around his spirit and around his quotes and everything he meant for European golf. To equal him last year was cool, but to surpass him this year, I didn’t get this far in my dreams, so it’s very cool.”McIlroy also set his sights on Montgomerie’s mark, adding: “I want it [eight titles], of course I do. I was the first Europeanto win the grand slamand I would love to be the European with the most wins in terms of the order of merit and season-long races.”Fitzpatrick had started the final day among a group of six players who were one shot behind McIlroy and Denmark’s Rasmus Neergaard-Petersen. McIlroy began the final round in style and moved clear at the top of the leaderboard after going four under through the first seven holes.But, as he stumbled, Fitzpatrick put himself in pole position for victory by landing a birdie at the last to complete a bogey-free round of 66 to leave McIlroy and Neergaard-Petersen requiring eagles to force a playoff.While the Dane faltered, the Masters champion sank his putt from about 15 feet to set up the playoff, but it was Fitzpatrick who prevailed after both players missed the green with their approach shots.Fitzpatrick said: “He [McIlroy] is one of only a few where you know you are going to a playoff. You are two clear with one to play and you know you are going to a playoff because he did it again in typical Rory fashion.“I struggled at the start of the year, obviously, and to turn it round in the summer like I did, have the Ryder Cup like I did which is hard to top, but the way I played today – there was one bad shot all day. So proud of myself.”Tommy Fleetwood was in a group of four players, including Neergaard-Petersen, who tied for third place after a final round 67, while Tyrrell Hatton, the only man to start the final day with a faint hope of denying McIlroy the Race to Dubai title, fell away to finish in a share of 14th.Explore more on these topicsGolfRory McIlroySeve BallesterosEuropean TournewsShareReuse this content"

I have to review it. I saw he was not happy. To a certain degree if you have players like Jude who are so competitive they will never like it but my word stands, it is about standards and a commitment and respect to each other. So someone is waiting and we will not change our decision because someone is waving their arms.”Bellingham shook hands with Tuchel as he went off. But Tuchel has repeatedly emphasised the importance of the collective. “Morgan Rogers was for sure not happy when he couldn’t start today because he deserves to play for us and he wants to play all the time,” the German said.“We gave him a bit of a rest because he came with a lot of minutes for his club and played against Serbia.

They were not at their best at Albania but ground out another victory thanks to a late double from Kane, who has surpassed Pelé’s record of 77 international goals.“We just mentioned it in the dressing room,” Tuchel said. “This cherry on top of everything is that he overcomes Pelé today.

To cap a remarkable week in Irish football history, Parrott, the two-goal hero of Portugal’s defeat in Dublin on Thursday, stunned Budapest’s Puskas Arenainto silence, barring the ecstatic scenes among the Irish contingent.Parrott had described Thursday’s defenestration of Cristiano Ronaldo’s team as the best night of his life, only for Sunday to be yet more gloriously dramatic. The former Tottenham trainee, who plays in the Dutch Eredivisie for AZ Alkmaar, would almost certainly not have started Ireland’s double-header had Roma’s Evan Ferguson not injured an ankle.Denmark hit by sickness bug before crunch World Cup qualifier with ScotlandRead moreHis third goal, poked from the grasp of Hungarian goalkeeper Denes Dibusz, came in the sixth minute of injury time, following a deft, falling-leaf finish for his 80th minute equaliser. In the first half, after Daniel Lukacs had scored from a third-minute corner, on 15 minutes Parrott stepped up to coolly slot a penalty, defying a baying, partisan home crowd doing its best to distract him.“I said against Portugal that this is what dreams are made of, but I think tonight, I will never have a better night in my whole life,” Parrott said, after the wild celebrations following his goal and the final whistle. “It is a fairytale. You can’t even dream about something like that. I have no words to describe the emotions right now.”Hungary appeared set fair for the playoffs next March when, in the 37th minute, Barnabas Varga chested the ball down with his back to goal just outside the box, swivelled and unleashed a stunning left-foot half volley.As full time approached, with news of Portugal’s 9-1 defeat of Armenia meaning they will head to North America as Group F winners, tension wracked the home team. Liverpool’s Dominik Szoboszlai was continuing his excellent club form but those around him cracked under the pressure Ireland exacted on them. Heimir Hallgrímsson had opted for the same direct tactics that confounded Portugal though Ireland required Caoimhin Kelleher, their keeper, to play his very best, too.Hungary’s attempts to kill off the contest in the closing stages fell spectacularly flat. “They wasted their own time and that’s kind of funny,” said Hallgrímsson, the Icelander who co-managed his home nation at Euro 2016 and then led them at the 2018 World Cup. “Now we need to use this moment and continue improving.”View image in fullscreenIreland players celebrate in front of their disbelieving fans in Hungary.Photograph: Ryan Byrne/Inpho/ShutterstockAfter the substitute Johnny Kenny was denied by Dibusz during a fraught injury-time period, Parrott stole on to Liam Scales’s flicked header to poke home his winner, before being mobbed by exultant teammates and substitutes.Awaiting Ireland in March are two single-leg playoff games to qualify for the United States, Mexico and Canada next June. Should they be successful, Ireland will play their first World Cup finals since reaching the last 16 in 2002. The draw for those playoffs, to be played against other European countries, will be made on Thursday this week.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersRepublic of IrelandHungarymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

I’m happy to be able to share the pitch with great players and a great team.”Portugal opened the scoring when defender Renato Veiga scored a close-range header in the seventh minute but they were stunned when Eduard Spertsyan converted a cross from Grant-Leon Ranos 11 minutes later. It was only Armenia’s third goal in the qualifying group having failed to score in their previous three games.However, any hopes of an upset were quickly extinguished as Gonçalo Ramos restored Portugal’s lead while Neves added two goals before half-time, including a superb free-kick into the top corner. Fernandes then converted a penalty in first-half added time to make it 5-1 at the break.The second half continued in the same pattern as Fernandes struck again soon after the restart after he was set up by Ramos. A flurry of substitutions followed but Portugal’s pressure never relented and when they earned another penalty, Fernandes completed his hat-trick.Neves then added his third goal of the night with a composed finish after Portugal hit the post while, at the other end, goalkeeper Diogo Costa and the Portuguese defence comfortably kept Armenia at bay.Francisco Conceição then added the icing on the cake with a long-range strike in added time as Portugal completed the rout.Ireland finished second in the group with 10 points to clinch a playoff berth afterthey beat Hungary 3-2with a last-gasp goal in the sixth minute of added time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are in a situation where the doctor is on it. It is the season for such things. You can’t protect yourself 100% but we are doing everything we can and right now our hope and assessment is that we have put a plug in it and that on Tuesday we have 24 men who are fit for a fight and ready to play.“Is it a worry ahead of Scotland? Yes, if you ask me if I would have wished that there had been no illness, and that there also will not be on Tuesday, then of course that’s the answer. But that’s natural.“There are many things you don’t know. There are also many things we don’t know about Scotland. It’s the season for such things, and therefore we just have to take it as it comes. There is also a difference between having a little [illness] and being able to play well and lying in bed.“There are many factors here and right now we are assuming that our assessment is that we are ready for Tuesday with all men.

They had an aura’Read moreTheir manager, Carlo Ancelotti, said that Gabriel “had a problem on his adductor” and would be having more tests to determine the extent of the issue. A statement from the Brazilian federation said they had “revealed a muscle injury in his right thigh” and confirmed that Gabriel will not travel with the team for Tuesday’s friendly against Tunisia in Lille, instead returning to his club for treatment.Arsenal are expected to take their time to assess the injury but it is understood that there are fears he could be sidelined for a busy period for Mikel Arteta’s side that begins with the showdown with Tottenham.Losing a player who has played every minute of the Premier League leaders’ campaign so far could be a significant blow to their title ambitions, especially given Gabriel’s importance to a defence that has conceded just five goals in 11 games and had kept eight consecutive clean sheets in all competitions before the2-2 draw at Sunderland.Arteta has options with Cristhian Mosquera having filled in when William Saliba has been absent this season and fellow new signing Piero Hincapié also capable of playing centre-back. Riccardo Calafiori also had to withdraw from Italy’s squad after the manager Gennaro Gattuso revealed “he had a few issues” although his injury is not thought to be serious.But there still are major doubts about when Martin Ødegaard will return despite Arteta hinting before the international break that his captain could be fit to face Tottenham. Ødegaard travelled with the Norway squad to Estonia as they virtually assured World Cup qualification last week but the manager Stale Solbakken admitted “he is some distance away” from playing again.Arteta will hope that Gabriel Martinelli and Viktor Gyökeres can return against Tottenham to boost his attacking options while Kai Havertz and Noni Madueke are also closing in on their returns from long-term knee injuries.“[It will be] a huge boost for the squad to have those players available again after such a long, long time,” Arteta said last week. “Really happy that I think it is going to be very soon. We need to get players back because we are missing seven players in the front line for the last two months.”Explore more on these topicsArsenalBrazilSenegal football teamnewsShareReuse this content"

We did so well last year, that hasn’t just gone away all of a sudden.”Manchester City cruise past United in derby to surge four points clear in WSLRead moreThe Gunners desperately needed a win to maintain any pretence of being title contenders but, despite their dominance at the BetWright Stadium, they could not break through the well-marshalled Spurs defensive structure.Arsenal’s title aspirations were dented last weekend by a frustrating 1-1 home draw with Chelsea, and their Champions League defence took a hit in midweek after a second‑half collapse saw them go from 2-0 up against Bayern Munichto lose 3-2. But results elsewhere across the weekend had fallen kindly with both Manchester United and Chelsea dropping points.The atmosphere at the BetWright Stadium for this north London derby was electric, a record attendance of 6,788 set for Tottenham women at Leyton Orient’s ground.This was the 12th meeting of the two north London sides in the Women’s Super League, with Arsenal claiming nine wins and Spurs just one. But, despite that dominant record, this fixture presented a big test for Arsenal with Spurs thriving under their new manager, Martin Ho, and level on points with their rivals going into this game.That aided the intense environment, the stand of Arsenal fans behind Daphne van Domselaar’s goal embarking on a loud rendition of the anthem North London Forever shortly after kick-off before the home support attempted to drown them out. It felt like a derby of consequence, for perhaps the first time.“If we want more fans to come and watch our games then we have to put in more performances like this,” Ho said. “The fans won’t ask for perfection, but they will ask for a team who work hard and play for the badge.”The home team edged possession in the first half but Arsenal created more chances, though none were gilt-edged. Changes came for the visiting team at the break, earlier than usual, Beth Mead and Katie McCabe switched out for the summer signings Taylor Hinds and Olivia Smith.Smith’s impact was instant, her pace troubling the left‑back Amanda Nildén and her powerful strike from a tight angle testing Lize Kop in goal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Five days later, the 21-year-old Arsenal academy graduatetragically lost his lifedue to a “significant brain injury”. While the official cause of death remains unconfirmed, it is expected to be attributed to the on-field collision.The incident prompted an outpouring of grief and anger across the sport, with theFootball Association launching “an immediate review… that will focus on the safety of perimeter walls and boundaries around pitches in the National League System” – from the fifth to the 10th tier. A fundraiser for Vigar’s family, set up by one of his Chichester City teammates, has raised more than £18,000.Floodlights were required to illuminate the late autumn gloom well before kick-off on football’s return to the scene of sporting tragedy. More than 300 spectators were in attendance for Saturday’s visit of Lewes to north London – significantly higher than average for one of the lowest-watched clubs in the division.View image in fullscreenMore than 300 spectators were in attendance at Maurice Rebak Stadium.Photograph: Andy Hall/The GuardianIn the immediate wake of Vigar’s death, Wingate & Finchley hastily confirmed there was “currently no appetite” for football at their stadium. Home matches were switched to away, and the team played their next seven league games on the road, improbably going unbeaten in all of them.Significant alterations were made for Saturday’s return. Although the ground had always met stadium regulations, the offending perimeter wall was knocked down and replaced with the type of rebound mesh fencing commonly seen around sports pitches nationwide. Players have been provided with extra runoff space on the touchline. There are, says Sharpe, “mixed feelings” about a playing return the club had been careful not to promote or celebrate in any form.“It’s really important never to forget what happened, and what will hopefully never happen again at any club,” he says. “It’s obviously been difficult for us, but first and foremost we have to bear in mind that a young man lost his life. His parents have lost a son, and his family and friends, and everyone in football, are devastated about what happened. When you put it into perspective, football doesn’t mean much.”In these lower reaches (the seventh tier) of the English football pyramid, clubs such as Wingate & Finchley operate entirely on the goodwill of the volunteers who run them. Outside the first team’s players and coaches, none receive payment, nor do they ever expect to deal with global coverage of such a tragedy occurring on their watch; some of the more persistent sections of the media attempted to use telephoto lenses to see over the ground’s locked gates after Vigar’s death.View image in fullscreenExtra runoff space has been provided down the touchlines.Photograph: Andy Hall/The Guardian“You can see there’s not many people here, so to see our club’s name in the news was strange,” says a supporter, Luke Tebbutt. “The fact that it’s a club everybody knew the name of was very odd. It was an awful event. A real tragedy.”In such a context, it is perhaps understandable that those at the helm harbour a reticence to discuss the specifics of an incident that has left its mark on all who witnessed it – the efforts of medically trained fans who hurdled the wall to help Vigar, the speed of the first paramedics to arrive, and the air ambulance that landed on the pitch. “For those of us there that day it’s something we have to live with for ever,” says one Wingate & Finchley supporter, likening the sound of the offending collision with the wall to a shotgun going off.The Professional Footballers’ Association swiftly held a workshop with players involved in the match, while Wingate & Finchley offered private counselling to all staff members who required it.That Vigar’s Chichester City teammates did not lose any of their next five league games was little short of remarkable, while Wingate & Finchley’s 3-0 homecoming win over Lewes on Saturday extended their unbeaten league run to nine matches. Tragedies can unite, but Sharpe is determined not to lose sight of priorities.“It’s not about Wingate & Finchley,” he says. “It’s about the lasting memory and legacy of Billy. It’s important that it never happens again to any player.”Explore more on these topicsFootballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Both of those finals – against Manchester City and QPR respectively – went to replays, and Galvin started all four matches. The replay against City was settled by Ricky Villa’s stunning famous solo dribble and shot, but it was an attacking passage of play that began following a trademark Galvin charge down the left wing.Parrott hat-trick sickens Hungary as Ireland grab World Cup playoff spot in wild winRead moreHe also started both legs of the1984 Uefa Cup final against Anderlecht, which finished 2-2 on aggregate and went to a penalty shootout, which Spurs won 4-3 after Galvin had been substituted in the second half.Despite being an England schools player in his younger years, Galvin won 29 caps for the Republic of Ireland and played all three group matches under Jack Charlton at Euro 1988, including his side’s much-celebrated1-0 victory over England.He signed forSheffield Wednesdayin 1987, leaving in 1989 to play under his former Spurs teammate Ossie Ardiles at Swindon. Galvin later served as assistant to the Argentinian at both Swindon and Newcastle.Spurs posted on X: “Everyone at the club would like to extend their thoughts and best wishes to Tony Galvin, our 1984 UEFA Cup and 1981 & 82 FA Cup winner, who is now recovering following a stroke.

All I want to do is get you in a straight bloody line. What do I have to do?” Gerald asks. So Horse says: “It’s theArsenaloffside trap, isn’t it?” Lomper here becomes Tony Adams, and Cristhian Mosquera starts to laugh.The Spain Under-21 international is sitting at a table in the team hotel in Lugo, Galicia. Through the window, the sound of rain falling; in front of him,the famous scene from The Full Monty, cinematic representation of a defence so perfect, so instantly identifiable it became part of popular culture; a backline never to be bettered. Until now?Last Saturday, something strange happened: Arsenal let in a goal. In fact, they let in two. “If you’ve gone loads of games without anyone scoring, when they do it’s like it [hurts] more,” Mosquera says. “But the other team plays too and it’s hard to keep that statistic going.”Witnesses of Neymar’s sad decline hope for one final twist in his career’s brutal narrative arc | Barney RonayRead moreUntilBrian Brobbey’s 94-minute equaliser for Sunderland, Arsenal had won eight consecutive games, keeping a clean sheet in all of them. Thirteen and a half hours had passed, like something from another time, something else for their new centre-back to embrace.“I didn’t know Arsenal had that identity in the 1980s and 1990s but I like that, yeah,” Mosquera says. “It’s good and you see that now as well: a team that’s like a rock, that’s making it very hard for opponents. To win games you have to generate danger too, your forwards need chances. The key is balance: it’s not just defending, and that’s not just the defenders. But people talk about the defensive part because of the stats, and it is fundamental teams don’t score against us. And the numbers are crazy.”His numbers too. Starting with the fee: £13m which, he says, “you never really contemplate but when you stop to think about, is actual money, a lot of money”. David Gordo, Mosquera’s under-21 coach, calls it a bargain. While he is biased, in north London everyone agrees.If Mosquera was signed from Valencia as backup or for the future, an unknown unlikely to play, it hasn’t shown. He is the embodiment of thestrength in depth Mikel Arteta prioritised, and much as he insists “I won’t get desperate; I’m calm, I can wait for my time”, he has made 12 appearances. In his 10 hours on the pitch, Arsenal have conceded three.View image in fullscreenArsenal have conceded only three goals during the 10 hours Cristhian Mosquera has been on the pitch.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/Reuters“Lots of people didn’t know me, hadn’t really seen me,” Mosquera says. “I don’t know about the money, about ‘bargains’, and I don’t look at social media, but it’s true that things reach you and I’ve heard quite a lot about it being a good deal. The people around you, at the club too, say: ‘Listen, they’re very happy with you.’ And that’s what it’s about: coming here and leaving a mark.”It started at Anfield in August. Mosquera replaced William Saliba after five minutes, and althoughArsenal lost 1-0to an astonishing late Dominik Szoboszlai free-kick, he was flawless. Above all, he was fearless; listening to him, he genuinely doesn’t seem to get the fuss. “That’s something that people ask a lot: ‘Don’t you get nervous in front of so many people?’ I always say no. I’ve never had those nerves, butterflies. It’s not easy to manage your head in that situation but that’s a quality I have: to be calm, relaxed. That’s what you saw that day. The manager just said to be myself.”Mosquera has always been cool. He is eloquent and engaging, in no hurry. Easy company, he is not only interesting but interested, as happy listening as talking. “As a kid, I was very, very calm. Most kids want to go round to their mates’ houses but, I don’t know why, I wasn’t really drawn to that. I have my little brother now. He plays too. [Yulian, 14, is in Valencia’s academy]. He’s more lively, I’m still the calm one.“My parents came from Colombia in the early 2000s. It’s funny; the question always comes up: ‘Which do you love more?’ But I don’t think it’s hard to have two cultures, both identities. I feel satisfaction at being a symbol of a new [Spain], a new generation. My family in Colombia are super proud and I try to be an example. My mum and dad came looking for work, stability. There were more opportunities then but they were young, came with family, and it wasn’t easy. My dad would do what he could: a month on a building site, wash dishes in a restaurant. Mum would clean houses.”Mosquera, meanwhile, played. Born in Alicante, first it was basketball. Then a cousin got him to play for hisfútbol salateam: “I would be about five and I played all over the place, but I’ve always been the tallest and I think that played a part in coaches putting me in defence.” Seen by Hércules first, he soon joined Valencia’s academy, leaving for their residency 160km up the coast, then making hisdebut at 17. ‘My parents sacrificed a lot and I feel I made sacrifices too, leaving home at 12,” he says. “It’s mad really. When you see a kid who’s 11, 12 and big clubs want them, my mum and I talk about it. Those aren’t easy decisions but that brought me where I am.View image in fullscreenCristhian Mosquera on joining Arsenal: ‘When the call finished with Mikel, my destination couldn’t have been clearer.’Photograph: George Wood/Getty Images“My mum said that if it was up to her, I wouldn’t have gone. For a ‘normal’ person, the idea wouldn’t enter your head: 11, 12, without your parents. And you don’t know if you’ll make it. From my generation, there aren’t many. But there’s a good part too because they look after you, you learn a lot, grow up fast. It could be too fast. That’s good or bad, depending how you look at it. But in the end, I say: I lived it, I had that privilege. I understand it’s not easy but you mature, it teaches you about life. If I had children I’d support them following the same path.”Mosquera’s path took him to London, a month after his 21st birthday. “I always watched the Premier League,” he says. “In fact, my team was Arsenal. The players, the shirt. I saw them as a bit different: they had something, an aura. Before I had decided, someone in my camp said: ‘The moment you speak to Mikel, there’s no way he won’t convince you.’ And that’s exactly how it happened. When the call finished, my destination couldn’t have been clearer.”So is Arteta as intense as he looks? Mosquera smiles. “Yes, totally, totally. He really lives for football, he was raised on it, experienced everything. You see that when he talks. He loves the detail, sees things other eyes might not. I’m so happy with him. He’s an incredible person and he’s helping me a lot. The staff have made it easy. Arsenal is an incredible club.”The opportunities came faster than anticipated; the adaptation was swift too. “I’ve settled super fast, which I didn’t expect before I came but I could see it in the first few days. What I’ve most liked about London is that you get there and the myth about the English being cold isn’t true at all. You’re immediately convinced you’ll settle, not just because of the team and coaching staff but the people at the club who don’t get seen from the outside and are fundamental. I was in a hotel but with their help I’ve got a house.”It’s in St Albans and it looks good. Or at least it will. “Well, that’s the idea,” Mosquera says, laughing. “I studied sports science before but I’ve started an online university degree in interior design. It’s something I’ve always found attractive and I thought: ‘Why not?’“I keep getting visits. We go into London, see the sites. My mum’s the tourist guide. It’s an incredible city. It’s got everything. It’s so cosmopolitan. I love that feeling of how multicultural it is.”View image in fullscreenCristhian Mosquera chats to Sid Lowe in Lugo, Galicia.Photograph: Bruno Penas and Pablo Garcia/The GuardianThe team is too, which helps. “In the first few weeks, you really appreciate having so many Spanish speakers but I’m doing well with my English,” he says. “I’m taking a lot of classes. I understand almost everything and I get by quite well speaking. I spoke a bit from school and studied more the last few years, so I didn’t come as raw as I might have. The team talks are always in English. We’re in London and this is Arsenal. Anyway, with football language, it’s easier.”As for the actual football, that’s different? A puff of the cheeks, a grin, and Mosquera says: “Mucho. Above all, it’s the pace of it: back and forth, more direct. I love it.”Something in the culture has won him over too: the noise, the commitment, the way challenges are greeted like goals. Especially in this team, connecting them to the days of one-nil to the Arsenal, Arteta embracing the association with the success of the George Graham era, an identity so deep in the country’s conscience The Full Monty put it on screen. A smile sweeps across Mosquera’s face when he pictures that moment when you make a tackle and 60,000 people roar.“It gives you thatsubidón, a high, a surge of self-esteem,” he says, beaming. “And that’s something the manager and staff tell us: to enjoy defending. Those typical actions where you make a tackle or a block: celebrate them. That gives life to the team, brings energy. That’s important and this group has it. Look at those moments when the entire team is running back. That’s a fundamental part of this season.”Some season. Top of both tables, league and Champions League. Favourites to win a domestic title that has evaded them for 21 years, two months before Mosquera was born. Favourites to win a European title that has evaded them for ever. A relentlessness about them. Thirteen clean sheets.“We’re very, very aware of what we have to do,” Mosquera says. “The goal is our house and no one is allowed in, no one is allowed near our area. Then be dangerous in attack. There’s a tactical element of course – the movements – but I think a lot of it is a mental thing, attitude. Our house: do not enter. Inside the dressing room, we believe in ourselves. We know what we’re capable of, we know where we can go.”Explore more on these topicsArsenalSpaininterviewsShareReuse this content"

Final Demand, one of the best novice hurdlers last season, made a flawless debut over fences and suddenly Mullins’s squad for the Grade Ones at the festival back here in March is beginning to take shape.The style and strength of his 13-length defeat of Wingmen – also a useful novice hurdler last year – was such that he is now just 6-4 for the Brown Advisory Novice Chase at the festival.Panic Attack’s Gold Cup victory at Cheltenham a boost for Skelton’s title hopesRead more“He was just so natural, wasn’t he?” Mullins said afterwards. “Jumping down the back, taking fences in his stride. I got a little worried coming to the third-last that he was getting a little tired, and I thought Jack [Kennedy, on Wingmen] was getting a little closer. When they were over the third-last, Paul just gave him a squeeze and a shake, and next thing he just started opening up again. His jumping was so natural, it was fantastic.”The final day of the November meeting is as close as Cheltenham gets to a “family” day – there was even a mascot race to keep the crowd entertained – but there was a distinct hint of quality about the way Joe Tizzard’s Alexei accelerated six lengths clear of the runner-up after the last in the card’s feature event, the Greatwood Handicap Hurdle.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Monday tipsShowPlumpton12.50 Fountains Blenhein 1.20 Clear Storm 1.50 Alto Alto 2.20 Listentoyourheart (nap) 2.50 Final Straw 3.19 Ballyfinn 3.50 BelcamoLeicester1.10 Maccarellu 1.40 Mind Hunter 2.09 Trad Jazz 2.40 Little Venice 3.10 Island Bridge 3.40 Wind Your Neck InExeter1.30 Harry Lowes 2.00 Lulamba 2.30 A Path To Ronda 3.00 Denemethy (nb) 3.30 Mythe Bridge 4.00 Jakar Du MoulinNewcastle3.35 Savvy Victory 4.10 Ilraawi 4.40 Light The Night Up 5.10 Parole Officer 5.40 Applesandpears 6.10 Maelstrom 6.40 La Scanderbeide 7.10 J StreetWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.A scattering of subsequent Grade One winners, both over hurdles and fences, have won this race in the past and the German-bred Alexei even received a 40-1 quote for next year’s Champion Hurdle after following up a win at Ascot earlier this month, though his trainer is taking it one race at a time.“I thought this was the best I’d had him but this was a step up again”, Tizzard said. “I’m just enjoying what he’s doing at the moment.

The 18-year-old’s ascent to the top of the rankings was confirmed with his semi-final win against Danny Noppert earlier on Sunday.That victory set up another titanic battle in the final with his great rivalLuke Humphries, who he replaced at the summit. Littler flexed his muscles with a 16-11 triumph to become just the fourth man to defend the title in Wolverhampton.Sports quiz of the week: Ashes, All Blacks and a big payday in tennisRead moreLittler’s position at the top of the rankings has seemingly been a foregone conclusion ever since he burst on to the scene with his record-breaking run to the final of the2024 world championship. He became theyoungest world championa year later and has gone on to become a global star, transcending the sport.Littler is now officially the youngest best player in the world, beating the record of the previous youngest Michael van Gerwen, who was a relatively senior 24 when he first topped the rankings in 2014.Speaking after reaching the final, Littler said: “It’s not even been two years, I have not even spent two years on tour and I am already world No 1. “That is job done, now I am world No 1.“I am the best in the world. I have said it throughout the year. Luke Humphries has been the best in the world. It doesn’t matter if you go out in the first round or second round, if you’re No 1, you’re the best in the world.”He added after beating Humphries in the final: “No one, me, Luke, we’re never ever going to run away with anything. It’s always going to be close.”This rivalry is up there with Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner in tennis or golf’s Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy in terms of being so clear of everyone else in their sport. And they delivered another epic major final – their fourth of the year – on Sunday evening, with Littler emerging victorious.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The teenager did not look back as he raced to his fifth major of the year.Humphries, who earlier beat Gerwyn Price to reach the final, can regain top spot at the world championship, which gets under way next month, if he wins and Littler goes out early.“This is the last day as No 1, I’ve been so happy and proud of myself,” Humphries said during his on-stage interview. “When it gets to the worlds, I’ve got one opportunity to take it back from him.

Investigating possibilities. One might even use that loaded word: experimenting.On a chilly fall night outside Philadelphia, at least one of those experiments yielded a possibility, an option, a long-awaited light at the end of a dark period for one of the most mercurial talents ever to wear a US jersey.Gio Reyna’s return to the national team at all was noteworthy enough. That he started in Saturday’s friendly against Paraguay was somewhat surprising, given his lack of game time and recent injury at Borussia Mönchengladbach. That he scored within five minutes, continued to operate effectively well into the second half, then set up the decisive goal in a 2-1 win stands as a potentially –potentially!– crucial moment in the host country’s preparations for the world’s stage. If Reyna is happy, healthy, and comfortable with a role to play with the US, head coachMauricio Pochettinohas a very intriguing attacking option at his disposal that could raise the US team’s ceiling next year.USMNT’s Pochettino admits he misses Premier League and would like to return in futureRead moreThe Borussia Mönchengladbach midfielder is unquestionably one of the most talented attacking midfielders of his generation, but much of his time since the 2022 World Cup has been spent traveling from one controversy to another, one injury to another, one unimpressed club coach to another, and now this summer, one club to another in search of the game time he needed to get back in the US picture.He hasn’t quite found that time at Mönchengladbach, but Pochettino admitted he was called up to the US for this window because it is one of the last chances the head coach will have to assess Reyna’s fit with the team before the pool gets culled considerably ahead of the March 2026 international window – the last before the World Cup roster will be named.The impressions were positive in camp, and even more positive early on againstParaguay. Reyna’s fourth-minute goal came on a rare header for the attacking midfielder, rising to meet a cross from Max Arfsten with a cushioned effort that bounced off the underside of the crossbar and over the line. Reyna wheeled away, seemingly doing everything in his power not to acknowledge the personal momentousness of the goal. With no histrionics, he pointed to the US badge, acknowledged his joyous teammates and returned to the center circle.The US, of course, have concerns far broader than Reyna. Among them is the team’s ongoing adaptation to a three-man backline look that has brought the team the most success in 2025 – with three center-backs and two attacking wingbacks (On Saturday, Sergiño Dest on the right and Arfsten on the left) to push forward and join the attack at will.While the US attack was missing big talents in Christian Pulisic and Weston McKennie, the defensive unit had to similarly adapt without key stars – Crystal Palace center-back Chris Richards and Bournemouth defensive midfielder Tyler Adams, both of whom missed this camp after picking up knocks at club level.As such, Saturday’s backline also featured a reintroduction: Reyna’s Mönchengladhabch teammate Joe Scally. Pochettino had decided against calling in the Borussia Mönchengladbach defender ever since a below-par display at March’s Nations League finals, but he returned to camp this week and appeared on Saturday in a new role for the US – as the right center-back in that three-man backline, which shifted to a back four when the US was out of possession with Scally shifting over to his natural right-back position.The adapted backline defended well when called upon, with the notable exception of Alex Arce’s 10th-minute equalizer, as a simple long ball set the US on the back foot and gaps between the back three were so large and inviting that the 30-year-old wasn’t within five yards of pressure when applying the finish from around the penalty spot.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At various points, all three of Tim Ream, Miles Robinson and Scally were caught napping in possession, unaware of pressure that forced desperate passes that were picked off in midfield, which were quickly followed by fouls and set pieces that Paraguay failed to capitalize upon. There were also occasional issues with positioning when the ball was upfield – Robinson picked up a yellow card in the 26th minute after Paraguay turned the US over and sprinted forward, leaving him in no man’s land where he made a tactical foul with other defenders around him to stop the break.Those small lapses, though, were not representative of a larger pattern. The US’s solid defending allowed them to stay in the game, probing Paraguay consistently until Reyna popped up to provide the breakthrough. Playing a nice 1-2 with Folarin Balogun, Reyna picked his head up on the way to the endline and fired in a low cross that caromed off a couple Paraguay defenders before finding Balogun, who finished with ease. Reyna pumped his arm as Balogun sprinted away. Reyna was removed not long afterward.The 75 minutes he played on Saturday stands as the most since the United States’ 2-1 loss to Uruguay in the 2024 Copa América, a loss that ended their tournament and the tenure of Gregg Berhalter as the team’s coach. The US meet Uruguay again on Tuesday in Tampa, Florida, once again in possession of an attacking option that they hope will lead to a better outcome.Explore more on these topicsUSAParaguayFriendliesUS sportsMauricio PochettinonewsShareReuse this content"

No NHC forecaster had ever issuedsuch a bold forecastfor rapid strengthening.But Papin had an ace up his sleeve: artificial intelligence in the form of Google’s new DeepMind hurricane model – released for the first time in June. And, as predicted, Melissa did become a storm of astonishing strength that tore through Jamaica.Forecasters at the NHC are increasingly leaning hard on Google DeepMind. On the morning of 25 October, Papin explained in his public discussionand on social mediathatGoogle’s model was a primary reason he was so confident: “Roughly 40/50 Google DeepMind ensemble members show Melissa becoming a Category 5. While I am not ready to forecast that intensity yet given the track uncertainty, that remains a possibility.‘We need help’: devastated Jamaican communities still await aid after Hurricane MelissaRead more“It appears likely that a period of rapid intensification will occur as the storm moves slowly over very warm ocean waters which is the highest oceanic heat content in the entire Atlantic basin.”Google DeepMind isthe first AI model dedicated to hurricanes, and now the first to beat traditional weather forecasters at their own game.Through all 13 Atlantic storms so far this year, Google’s model is the best – even beating human forecasters on track predictions.Melissa eventually made landfall in Jamaica at category 5 strength, one of the strongest landfalls ever documented in nearly two centuries of record-keeping across the Atlantic basin. Papin’s bold forecast likely gave people in Jamaica extra time to prepare for the disaster, possibly saving lives and property.Google DeepMind has been making weather forecastsfor a few years now, and the parent forecast system from which the new hurricane model is derivedalso performed spectacularly wellin diagnosing large-scale weather patterns last year.Google’s model works by spotting patterns that traditional time-intensive physics-based weather models may miss.“They do it much more quickly than their physics-based cousins, and the computing power is less expensive and time consuming,” Michael Lowry, a former NHC forecaster, said.“What this hurricane season has proven in short order is that the newcomer AI weather models are competitive with and, in some cases, more accurate than the slower physics-based weather models we’ve traditionally leaned on,” Lowry said.To be sure, Google DeepMind is an example of machine learning – a technique that has been used in data-heavy sciences like meteorology for years – and is not generative AI like ChatGPT.Machine learning takes mounds of data and pulls out patterns from them in a such a way that its model only takes a few minutes to come up with an answer, and can do so on a desktop computer – in strong contrast to the flagship models that governments have used for decades that can take hours to run and requiresome of the biggest supercomputers in the world.Still, the fact that Google’s model could outperform previous gold-standard legacy models so quickly is nothing short of amazing to meteorologists who have spent their careers trying to forecast the world’s strongest storms.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It struggled with Hurricane Erin earlier this year, as it was also undergoing rapid intensification to category 5 north of the Caribbean.It also struggled with Typhoon Kalmaegi– which made landfall in the Philippines on Monday.In the coming offseason, Franklin said he plans to talk with Google about how it can make the DeepMind output even more helpful for forecasters by providing additional under-the-hood data they can use to assess exactly why it is coming up with the its answers.“The one thing that nags at me is that while these forecasts seem to be really, really good, the output of the model is kind of a black box,” said Franklin.There has never been a private, for-profit company that has produced a top-level weather model which allows researchers a peek into its methods – unlike nearly all other models which are provided free to the public in their entirety by the governments that designed and maintain them. While Google has made top-level output of DeepMindpublicly available in real time on a dedicated website, its methods have still largely been hidden.Google is not alone in starting to use AI to solve difficult weather forecasting problems. The US and European governments also have their own AI weather models in the works – which have also shownimproved skill over previous non-AI versions.The next steps in AI weather forecasts seem to be startup companies taking swings at previously tough-to-solve problems such as sub-seasonal outlooks andbetter advance warnings of tornado outbreaks and flash flooding– and theyare receiving US government funding to do so. One company, WindBorne Systems, is evenlaunching its own weather balloonsto fill the gaps in the US weather-observing network, which has recentlybeen downsized by the Trump administration.Explore more on these topicsGoogleHurricanesArtificial intelligence (AI)Hurricane MelissaNatural disastersUS weathernewsShareReuse this content"

Proliferation must not be considered inevitableSun 16 Nov 2025 12.30 ESTLast modified on Sun 16 Nov 2025 16.33 ESTShareWhen Eisaku Satō, a former prime minister of Japan, received the Nobel peace prize in 1974 after committing his country to not making nuclear bombs, owning them or allowing them on its territory, heassured the audience: “I have no doubt that this policy will be pursued by all future governments.”Yet last week, Sanae Takaichi, Japan’s new prime minister,declined to saywhether the country that understands the cost of nuclear war better than any other would stand by its commitment – reflecting the bleak broader outlook. Eighty years after the US dropped Little Boyon Hiroshima, incinerating tens of thousands of people, and almost 40 after Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan seriously discussed nuclear abolitionin Reykjavik, the spectre looms once more. Last month, Donald Trump ordered the US militaryto match other countries’ nuclear weapons testing.Vipin Narang and Pranay Vaddi, who worked on nuclear strategy in the Biden administration, warn that arms control has essentially broken down and that the growing risksamount to a “Category 5 hurricane”. Ankit Panda, another noted expert in the field, has publishedThe New Nuclear Age: At the Precipice of Armageddon. Tellingly, the subject has returned to pop culture. Kathryn Bigelow’s new movie A House of Dynamite shows a nuclear attack targeting Chicago.The last nuclear arms control treaty between Russia and the US, New Start, is due to expire in February. For decades the main fear was of terrorists or rogue states such as North Korea; now there is a new great power rivalry. In place of the old standoff between two hegemons comes a more complicated contest, with China massively expanding its capabilities, and broader proliferation. For unsettled US allies such as South Korea and Poland, acquiring their own arsenals is no longer out of the question. The nuclear taboo is wearing thin. The Biden administration believed Vladimir Putincould well follow throughon his nuclear threats in Ukraine.Donald Trumppulled out of the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty, which Russia had been violating, in his first term. In withdrawing from the JCPOA nuclear deal with Iran in 2018, andbombing Iran’s nuclear facilitiesthis year, though it did not have an active weapons programme, he told potential adversaries that the best strategy is North Korea’s: arm yourself as soon as you can. China was content with a relatively modest arsenal for decades after it acquired the bomb; its breakneck expansion reflects its growing global might, but its efforts ramped up after Mr Trump was first elected.Mr Trump’s confusing comments on nuclear tests (prompting counter-threats from Mr Putin) appear toreflect his misunderstandingof Russian systems tests which, though alarming, do not breach the de facto moratorium. A resumption – the US last detonated a warhead in 1992 – wouldprobably be more usefulto adversaries than to the US itself. It would also strengthen suspicions that non-proliferation is window dressing for the maintenance of the nuclear monopoly of a few states, rather than a serious commitment for the sake of humanity.Mr Trump, said totruly fear nuclear war, should instead challenge Mr Putin tomake good on hisproposal of a one-year extension of New Start treaty limits and revive non-proliferation endeavours by championing the comprehensive test ban treaty. The US and China have not ratified it; Russia withdrew ratification. A president aspiring to a Nobel peace prize couldset an examplethat is sorely needed.Explore more on these topicsNuclear weaponsOpinionJapanDonald TrumpUS foreign policyVladimir PutineditorialsShareReuse this content"

A senior White House sourcetoldESPN: “It’s what the president wants, and it will probably happen.”The giant $300m ballroom that Trump is adding to the White House iscalled“the President Donald J Trump Ballroom” on the list of donors to the project, and senior administration officials told ABC the name was likely to stick – though Trump has since said he is not planning to name it after himself.Still, Trump is moving to immortalize himself with his name etched far and wide.This is what fascist dictators have done when in power. Stalin, Hitler and Mussolini built monuments to glorify themselves so they’d be exalted in history.Democracies prefer to memorialize their heroes after they’ve died, and only if the public wants them commemorated.Trump deserves to be remembered – but not as a hero. To the contrary: it is our solemn duty to ensure he is remembered for all he has done and may still do to destroy American democracy.He must be remembered as the president who claimed without evidence that an election was “stolen” from him. Who then instigated a coup attempt that included false electors and was followed by an assault on the US Capitol that resulted in five deaths and injuries to 174 police officers.He should be remembered as the president who, after being re-elected, tried to erase the nation’s memory of what he had done by pardoning1,600 peopleconnected with the Capitol attack and77 who were accusedof trying to overturn the 2020 election. Hecalled the rioters “patriots”.He must be remembered as the president who then usurped the powers of Congress. Who denied people due process of law. Who prosecuted his political opponents. Who violated international law by killing people he labeled enemy combatants. Who sent the military into American cities over the objections of their mayors and governors.We must not allow Trump to erase this history with false tributes to himself, etched into silver, marble or granite.Instead, after he is gone, a monument should be erected to remind future generations of Trump’s treachery and the treachery of officials who supported him.It would be a simple building constructed of iron and cement, containing the records of his attacks on democracy and the names of everyone who aided him.Over its doorway would be the words “Trump’s Treason”.It would be situated on the White House lawn where the Trump ballroom (since demolished) once stood. It would face outward toward Pennsylvania Avenue so that families visiting the nation’s capital – including those commemorating the 500th anniversary of the US – have easy access, and will long remember this catastrophe.Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.

The administration has moved beyond verbal attacks on civil society. It is now deploying coercive force against civic organizations and their leaders. While the attacks may seem contained for now, they are likely to grow. Research on other cases of democratic backsliding suggests that once coercion begins, regardless of how limited at first, escalation follows.In the months ahead, we should thus expect more, not less, government repression. To meet it, pro-democracy organizations, universities and law firms must bravely speak up against abuses of power while building the broadest possible coalition to stand up for fundamental rights. Community, labor and advocacy groups must also train their ranks in strategic nonviolence to resist provocations from the state and make repression backfire.The evidence that coercion has started is abundant. Trump’s campaign promise was to use coercion primarily on undocumented immigrants. Since January, targets have multiplied. The administration began with brazen assertions of executive power to cow universities and law firms. Former FBI director James Comey and the New York attorney general, Letitia James, who tried to hold Trump to account, have been indicted (they areseeking to have the cases dismissed). The administration hasdesignated “antifa”(a nonexistent organization) a “domestic terror” organization. National guard troops and other federal forces have been deployed in cities against the will of governors and mayors, leading to confrontations that become violent. All of this comes in addition to the turbo-charging of ICE, which is now usinghelicopters and chemical agentsto raid communities. US citizens seen as obstructing ICE operations are being detained.These escalations are a dire sign for democracy, which has always been about much more than elections. A healthy democracy protects and promotes civil society – civic associations, PTAs, business associations, universities and more – as a space for public dialogue, policy debate and resisting abuses of power. When the government begins to attack civil society, without due process, it is rolling back democracy.The use of security forces to contain civil society is one of the clearest signs of democratic backsliding and is straight out of the authoritarian playbook.In most cases of democratic backsliding, presidents don’t start out with the intention to repress massively. But they easily end up creating massive repressive machines. Vladimir Putin in Russia, Hugo Chávez in Venezuela and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Turkey are perfect examples. It is important to understand how these repressive machines grow.The cycle typically begins when a leader articulates extreme policy goals designed to overhaul the system wholesale. Many times, these maximalist policy goals also come in a package of threat inflation. The president exaggerates the magnitude of some domestic danger. It could be crime, terrorism, corruption, even the wrong ideology. Suddenly, there is an existential scourge to fight. Extreme policies and threat inflation typically produce societal rejection (and admiration by supporters). The president then begins to see the rejection coming from sectors of society as more evidence of the threat they are obsessed with. The response is to boost the security apparatus even more. That step, of course, begets more societal resistance.At this point, the country enters into an insecurity trap. The president begins to feel increasingly unsafe and more justified in deploying coercion. The state sees itself as the victim of societal attacks, rather than the instigator. A new logic emerges; the president’s goal expands. The new aim is to not only defeat the resistance, but also to protect the country’s own security forces. This leads the president to grant more impunity to his security forces, and of course, expand their mandate. What started out as an ambitious agenda for change escalates into coercive imposition. A machine designed to generate law and order easily morphs into an organization operating under lawlessness.Putin, Chávez, and Erdoğan followed this pattern. All three started out as bold reformers and threat inflators, focusing on corruption and disintegration (Putin), Kurdish terrorism and secularism (Erdoğan), party collusion and capitalism (Chávez). They initially relied on the intelligence and law enforcement agencies inherited from the democratic era. But as power grabs expanded and protests escalated, culminating in the 2011 Bolotnaya protests in Russia, the 2007 student protests in Venezuela, and the 2013 Gezi Park protests in Turkey, plans changed. In Russia and Turkey, the old intelligence organizations (the federal security service and national intelligence organization, respectively) were fortified, personalized, and turned more secretive. In Venezuela, they were shut down (the intelligence agency know as Disip) and replaced with a meaner force (the Sebin). In addition, these regimes created supplementary security forces:Rosgvardiyain Russia in 2016,colectivosin Venezuela in the mid-2000s, and Sadat, a private paramilitary organization that works closely with the state to conduct security operations in Turkey. Soon, the focus shifted: intelligence and security forces were instructed to focus on all forms of opposition.Trump could easily embark on a similar path. The Trump administration has advanced a litany of extreme policies in just nine months, ranging from gutting entire federal agencies and driving out hundreds of thousands of federal government workers toinstalling vaccine skepticsat major health agencies to moving tostrip hundreds of thousands of immigrantsof their legal status and trying to end birthright citizenship, which is guaranteed by the 14th amendment.The attempt to push extremist policies leads to power concentration by the executive branch, along with bullying of institutions. Trump’s first administration moved in that direction, leading to protests. Trump tried to contain protests with democracy-era security institutions, but many of these organizations resisted Trump’s excesses.In his second term, Trump came back with a bolder reform agenda (Project 2025) and a bolder plan to fortify a relatively new security apparatus, ICE. Wielding the threat of an animated base, he cowed party members who would otherwise have resisted these efforts. Even a US senator andfederal judgeshavespoken openlyabout the fear they face.Power concentration and bullying triggers civil society, and so the cycle begins. Protest in 2025 has far exceeded that in 2017, as scholar Erica Chenoweth’sCrowd Counting Consortium has shown. The No Kings march in June may have been thelargest single-day protestin American history at the time. The October follow-up march was even bigger, withmore than 2,700 protestsacross all 50 states.We may be entering the stage where a cycle of repression begets more repression and the government opts to protect the security apparatus first. The most alarming sign is the administration sending troops to American cities with flimsy justification. This type of escalation is exacerbated when leaders empower non-state violent actors, something we saw Trump do most notably with the mass pardons of January 6 insurrectionists. Without a shift in direction, communities across the country could become powder kegs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

Both capitulation and extremism must be avoided. Capitulating can actually be self-harming. When the law firm Paul Weiss capitulated this year, it lost prominent clients andsenior talent, while others that stood firm won their legal challenges and gainednew business. Philanthropy has provided an even more encouraging example, with more than 700 charitable foundations joining together to publicly“unite in advance”of potential attacks on the sector. Actions like this help hold open the civic space that remains.Community, labor and advocacy groups must also inoculate their members and the communities they represent for what’s coming. Most likely, the administrationwillbe sending more federal troops to more cities to provoke more violence. In those cities, communities will need to be trained not just to organize, but also to engage in strategic nonviolence – maintaining the discipline not to be provoked into violence while bearing witness and taking action. We have seen powerful examples of that in Washington DC, where the group Free DC has undertakenbrilliant ward-by-ward organizingto resist military occupation by training thousands of residents in these methods; in Chicago, where educators and parents have organized toaccompany children homewhen federal agents attacked right outside their school; and in Portland, where protesters have usedanimal costumes and dance musicto mock repressive forces. Efforts like these will need to spread rapidly.Now that state repression is here, pro-democracy forces will need to continue to show their courage by speaking out and building the broadest possible coalition – both nationally and in cities and states under threat – to defend institutions and rights. This strong coalition must be complemented by widespread training in strategic nonviolence to effectively resist the provocations of the state.What’s giving me hope nowDaniel: I am encouraged by the tens of thousands of people who have joinedtrainingson nonviolentstrategic actionsince the beginning of the year, both online and in-person.Javier: I am reassured by the many legal organizations and law firms (many of them quite small!) using the courts to try to defend rights and curb executive branch overreach.Javier Corrales is Dwight W Morrow 1895 professor of political science at Amherst College.

Britain is said to have objected to repeated, lethal US airstrikes on alleged smugglers off Venezuela’s coast – which have been widely condemned asillegal extrajudicial killingsamounting to murder.The strikes appear to foreshadow directUS attacks on Venezuelaitself. Trump makes no secret of his wish to topple Nicolás Maduro’s authoritarian, ostensibly leftist regime. Most Venezuelans support this aim, but not the means. Regime change forcibly imposed by a foreign power contravenes international law, unless it is authorised by the UN or undertaken in self-defence as a last resort. Legal or not, it never ends well.The US lacks apersuasive justificationfor war, despite Trump’s fanciful portrayal of Maduro, and Latin American cartel bosses, as“narco-terrorists”with whom he deems the US to be at war. But Trump doesn’t care. He believes that he and his country are above the law, that might makes right. Call it by its name: this is exactly the kind of brash, monarchic imperialism that the New World colonists famously rebelled against.The self-aggrandising, regionally expansionist outlook of the second Trump administration is the most striking recent manifestation of the new eraof state lawlessnessthat has taken hold around the world. The concept of a common rulebook and joint action to tackle shared global problems has been scorned. In Ukraine, Vladimir Putin has taken state lawlessness to new extremes – and no one seems able or willing to stop him.Brutish, bullying, imperialistic: the Ugly American is back | Steven GreenhouseRead moreTwo rapidly developing conflicts may soon drive home the dangers. One is the anticipated US assault on Venezuela, which Trump, as arrogant as any pith-helmeted 19th-century empire-builder, could trigger imminently. The other is the prospective reigniting of the summer’sunfinished Israel-Iran waralongside a renewed Israeli offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon – conflagrations that could be much worse this time.Trump, as usual, has no plan forVenezuela, no thought for the “day after”. Like George W Bush in Iraq in 2003, he seems to think functioning democracy will somehow magically materialise in a post-coup Caracas. In any case, he does not value representative governance per se–nor the security and prosperity of Venezuelans. Of greater interest are the country’s oil, gas and minerals, and scoring an easy win.A questionable precedent, bruited about in Washington, is the1989 US invasionthat overthrew Panama’s dictator, Manuel Noriega – also accused of drug trafficking. Trump should beware. Operation Just Cause was not straightforward. Several hundred civilians, and some US troops, died. Venezuela is a much bigger, less easily subjugated country.I reported first-hand on the Panama crisis for the Guardian. Much went wrong then for the “piranhas” –Noriega’s name for the invaders– and could do so again. As ever, it’s political. In 1989, the newly elected George HW Bush needed a victory in his signature presidential “war on drugs”. Noriega, a former CIA informant, knew too much; Bush, a former CIA director, wanted him silenced. Demonising Maduro helps Trump argue that he, too, is beating the drug barons. And limited military operations in Venezuela could distract attention from his own skeleton in the cupboard: Jeffrey Epstein.Problems of state lawlessness in the Middle East centre principally on Israel and Iran. Forced reluctantly into a Gaza ceasefire (which it is failing to honour), Benjamin Netanyahu’s violence-addicted, peace-averse regime is seeking new targets. Record numbers of mostly unchecked, unpunishedJewish settler attackson West Bank Palestinians, notably on food andwater supplies, recall genocidal Israeli actions in Gaza.View image in fullscreenA screengrab from a video posted by Pete Hegseth shows what the US defence secretary says is a strike on a vessel carrying narcotics in the Pacific on 9 November 2025.Photograph: US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth’s X Account/AFP/Getty ImagesIsrael is bombingsouthern Lebanonagain, too, claiming the Lebanese army has failed to disarm Hezbollah after last year’s truce and that the Iran-backed fighters are regrouping. “The result of this reality is a growing likelihood that at some point in the coming weeks, Israel’s attacks on Lebanon will escalate into a full-scale war once again,” theHaaretz newspapercommentator Amir Tibon warned.Resumed, direct warfare between Israel and Iran is the biggest worry. Trump claimed in June that Iran’s nuclear facilities had been“obliterated”. He lied. Tellingly, both he and Netanyahu have since threatened to strike again. Analysts suggest another Israeli onslaught is inevitable, given unallayed suspicions about Iran’snuclear capabilities, the collapse of negotiations and UN inspections, and the reimposition of tougher sanctions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But their very vulnerability could render Tehran’s mullahs more dangerous. Iran is reportedly building thousands of missiles. If attacked, it may hit back much harder next time.A repeat bout of unprovoked, US-backed Israeli aggression would be another instance of extreme state lawlessness. Yet who would stop it? Not the UN. Not the international courts. Not a cowed Europe, nor Trump-appeasing Arab states. A similarly woeful saga of fecklessness, indifference and impotence could unfold if, say, China were to invade Taiwan. Or ifRussia invaded Moldova, or even Nato member Estonia.This is the world as it is now. Rampant state lawlessness finds ultimate expression in an accelerating global nuclear weapons race unconstrained by arms control treaties or common sense. Trump isresuming nuclear tests; Putin is following suit. Xi Jinping flaunts China’s atomic arsenal; Netanyahu conceals Israel’s. Indian and Pakistani leaders threaten mutual destruction. North Korea’s Kim Jong-un is building nukes like there’s no tomorrow.Which, at this rate, there may not be. They’re all rogue states now.

My word is “gap year” (OK, that’s two words). Was your response word “travel”?As my son prepares to take a gap year (and my daughter finishes first-year university after taking a year’s break), I’m realising just how strongly gap years are associated with travel. Yet, for many school leavers contemplating a year away from study, travel is either well down the list of options, only a small part of their next 12 to 15 months, or not on the agenda at all.Taking a gap year between Year 12 and university seems to be a modern-day phenomenon, yet I did exactly this when I finished school (ahem) nearly 30 years ago. Back then, we called it “defer for a year”.When I finished school, travel was the last thing on my mind, partly because I was only 16 but also because I had exactly zero money. Increasing both my age and bank balance before starting uni seemed like a wise decision. I got a full-time job, continued to consider which university course was best for me (I still made the wrong decision but, hey, that’s life) and enjoyed a year of much-needed social and life-skills expansion.As my son prepares to graduate high school, I’m feeling nostalgic for the many parenting milestones I’ve bid farewell | Vivienne PearsonRead moreI’ve encouraged both my kids to take a gap year for similar reasons plus the fact that their most likely scenario has always been moving from our regional home to study in a city.On hearing about my son’s gap year plans, his dentist cheerfully remarked about how fantastic 12 months of travel would be. At the year 12 graduation assembly, one of my son’s friends told me he wouldn’t be taking a gap year because he didn’t have money for travel. Media articles about gap years often focus on travel too.Though the idea of a full year of roaming around the world might be amazing for social media likes, the only people I can imagine being able to prioritise travel as the main event of their gap year are those from rather affluent families or with connections overseas, and perhaps those with enough bravery to wing low-budget travel combined with managing to find some sort of work while on the move.For many, travel is unaffordable as a gap year option, in particularly in these challenging economic times. Teens who aren’t yet fully adulting are still aware of high living costs, tighter Youth Allowance eligibility criteria, ridiculous rent prices, increasingly insecure work options and the prospect of immense Hecs debts.Gap years can be an essential way for young people to save money to help fund their lives while they study. This is especially important for regional and rural students, for whom government support and scholarships will only form part of their financial puzzle. I hugely appreciate the federal government’s decision,made earlier this year, to include students who have taken a gap year in the eligibility for $3,000-5,000 TAP (Tertiary Access Payments) that are for young people who need to move away from home for study.Gap years also allow young people more time to work out their ideal study direction, just like I tried to do during my deferment. Or to consider that tertiary study is not in fact for them (an increasingly valid option given thesad state of our universities).Then, there’s the maturity factor. I’m looking forward to my son getting some more work experience, taking on a good share of household tasks, keeping up friendships without automatically seeing each other at school and so many other aspects of launching his young adult life.Year 12 exams are coming to a close across the country.So, in the coming days, weeks and months, if you hear of a young person considering a gap year, please ask them about all of their plans rather than only focusing on ideas they have for travel.Vivienne Pearsonis a freelance writerExplore more on these topicsAustralian educationOpinionYoung peopleAustralian economycommentShareReuse this content"

But a country without secure borders is less safe for those who look like meShabana Mahmood is the home secretarySun 16 Nov 2025 17.30 ESTShareI know this country is an open, tolerant and generous place. And I am proud of the fact that we have always offered sanctuary to those fleeing peril.This is, after all, the country thatgave refuge to Ukrainiansafter the Russian invasion and Afghans after the evacuation of Kabul, and honoured our historic commitments to the people of Hong Kong.But the public also rightly expect that we can control our borders, determining who can enter and who must leave.Today, that is not the case. In recent years, the pace and scale of illegal migration has been profound. In an increasingly volatile and more mobile world, huge numbers of people are on the move. While some are refugees, others are economic migrants, seeking to take advantage of the asylum system. Even somegenuine refugees have been passing through other safe countries searching for the most attractive place to seek sanctuary.The pressure placed on local communities has been profound. The burden borne by taxpayers has been unfair.More than 100,000 peoplenow live in asylum accommodation, funded by the taxpayer.Unless we act, we risk losing popular consent for having an asylum system at all. In a country that is seeing division stirred up on our streets, we will not bring unity unless we restore order to our borders.For that reason, I have today set out the most significant and comprehensive changes to our asylum system in a generation.These reforms bear down on illegal migration. They tackle the factors that draw people on to small boats to makeperilous Channel crossings. They ensure that we enforce our rules more robustly, returning illegal migrants who have no right to be here.My goal is to ensure there are legal routes into this country for those who are truly fleeing peril, and for whom this is the first safe country they have encountered.As we restore control to our borders, I will therefore open new, capped, safe and legal routes for genuine refugees. While these will be modest at first, they will grow in time.Crucially, they will make community sponsorship the norm for the resettlement of refugees. Community and voluntary organisations will be able to sponsor refugees to come to the UK and support them when they arrive. This will ensure that communities that have the capacity and desire to accept refugees will be able to do so. As theHomes for Ukrainescheme shows, the British people’s capacity for this generosity is deep.At the same time, we will open new legal routes for students and those in work. We will ensure war doesn’t cut short their chances in life, and we will welcome those here who can contribute to our national life. While refugee status for those who come here will be temporary, those who come via legal routes will have a faster and easier path to becoming permanent citizens.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But it can lead to deeper understandings of the worldSun 16 Nov 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 16 Nov 2025 17.55 ESTShare“Why me?” “Why evil?” and “Why God?”According to theologian and psychologistKaren McClintock, these are the three key questions that a person will ask of their faith in the aftermath of trauma.Normally, a person goes about their life, making meaning of everything that happens to them, slotting it into a world that makes sense. PsychologistBessel van der Kolkexplains that a traumatic event short circuits this process. Trauma overwhelms a person, rendering them unable, in the moment, to integrate the event into their lives.In the context of spirituality, trauma is a hand grenade, exploding two of spirituality’s primary functions: to help a person make meaning and feel at home in the universe. A survivor of trauma has two choices. They can develop a new way of making sense of the world; or live with existential despair, believing that nothing can ever make sense again.Don’t believe everything you see: why Buddhist scepticism is vital in the age of generative AI | Bertin HuynhRead moreFor many years, I opted for the latter. I think of my seven-year-old self, struggling to understand why my sister had been given cancer by a loving God. The cancer was real, ergo God wasn’t. My childhood attempt at making meaning of something as meaningless as my sister’s brain tumour shaped the next 40 years of my life.It’s only recently that I have learned to view my departure from religion through the lens of childhood trauma. PsychologistJudith Hermanwrites that a trauma survivor “stands mute before the emptiness of evil, feeling the insufficiency of any known system of explanation”. A survivor faces the challenge of becoming “a theologian, a philosopher, and a jurist […] to articulate the values and beliefs that she once held and that the trauma destroyed”.ResearchersMaxine Harris and Roger Fallotfirst introduced the idea of “trauma-informed care” in 2001, and described five principles: safety, trust, choice, collaboration and empowerment.Safety includes physical, psychological and spiritual dimensions. Someone who feels spiritually safe feels comfortable to express, explore and yet question their fundamental beliefs and values.Spirituality isn’t rigid dogma. It’s a living, breathing practice that helps make sense of an incomprehensible world | Shadi Khan SaifRead moreI don’t think I ever felt spiritually safe, even before my sister’s diagnosis. I had a child’s understanding of my religion: believe in God, go to heaven; don’t believe in God, go to hell. It was not safe to engage in the questioning and re-framing that the trauma of her illness required.Trauma doesn’t always break a person’s connection to God. For some, it deepens and expands their understanding of their faith. In Leigh Sales’s book Any Ordinary Day,former University of Sydney vice-chancellor Michael Spence explains that the loss of his wife to cancer deepened his Anglican faith. After she died, he maintained a list of the ways in which he felt that God was still looking out for him. Spence’s religious worldview did not shatter; it expanded to include his grief.It’s only in the past 10 years that I have felt spiritually safe enough to find a position closer to, say, Sam Harris than Richard Dawkins. Years of therapy and the good fortune of a loving family of my own have enabled me to engage with the possibility that there might be more to the universe than cosmic chaos.God and I had a pretty acrimonious divorce the first time around. I don’t use the word “god” and I don’t believe in a deity. But I am open to mystery. I am softening towards the idea that the universe may bend towards life. I don’t have to forgive a god if I don’t believe in one. But that doesn’t mean I can’t forgive myself.Jackie Bailey is the author of The Eulogy, the winner of the 2023 NSW Premier’s literary multicultural award.

So why have we utterly failed to prepare?Sun 16 Nov 2025 06.55 ESTLast modified on Sun 16 Nov 2025 13.22 ESTShareAs autumn blurs into winter, the news is once again filling up with a familiar story: overflowing rivers, inundated streets and overwhelmed infrastructure. Since Friday, England, Wales and Ireland have beenhit by the stormthe Spanish meteorological agency has elegantly named Claudia, with grim results. One place in particular massively bore the brunt of it all: the Welsh border town of Monmouth, where the raging River Monnow spilled into the streets, people had to berescued from their homesand drones capturedaerial views of the scene, showing fragile-looking buildings suddenly surrounded by a huge clay-brown swamp.Claudia and her effects made it into the national headlines – but mostly, local and regional floods now seem too mundane to attract that kind of attention. Eleven days ago, Cumbria sawsubmerged roads, blocked drains and over 250 flood-related problems reported to the relevant councils. Railway lines in Cornwallwere submerged; in Carmarthen, in west Wales, there werereportsof the worst floods in living memory. But beyond the areas affected, who heard about these stories? Such comparatively small events, it seems, are now only to be expected.There have recently been reminders of how floods are only going to get more disruptive and dramatic. In mid-October, the insurance giant Aviva published a report titledBuilding Future Communities 2025, which was full of unsettling facts: among them, that over the past 10 years, one in 13 new homes have been built in the highest-risk flood zones; and that by 2050, the number of properties at risk from flooding could rise by 25% to 8m. It was accompanied by a Guardian articlewarning that“some towns may have to be abandoned”, a prospect that might already be flickering to life: in the Worcestershire town of Tenbury Wells, where there have been floods four times in the past six years, the council is already adjusting to the fact that the local civic buildings are nowsimply uninsurable.Last week, I had long conversations with two academics who specialise in flooding and the huge challenges it presents. They mentioned years of underinvestment in flood defences and the £10.5bn the government has recentlyset asidefor improvements between now and 2036, but also talked about the lack of attention paid to the natural protection provided by expanded wetlands, new forestry and the simple imperative to make urban environments as green as possible. They also spoke about what the Starmer government’shousebuilding drive– as and when it materialises – might mean for both the numbers of houses constructed in areas with a high flood risk, and whether new-builds will have decent drainage, and use permeable materials, rather than the concrete and asphalt that make floodingeven more of a danger.Prof Jess Neumannworks at the University of Reading, where she specialises in “flood research leading to policy change”. A fundamental modern problem, she told me, is the fact that builders, local councils and water companies are getting these things “up to a standard that’s fit for today, not for 2070 or 2080, when we’re going to see much more extreme weather”.She then talked about problems centred on the insurance business, and showed me figures for the share of commercial properties in areas at high risk of flooding that have no cover, often because premiums are too high, or insurers refuse to cover more than physical damage, leaving lost trade untouched. Those numbers are astonishing: at the last count, in 2022, 58% of retail space in such places is uninsured, and the same applies to 50% of offices. As flooding gets worse, there is therefore a rising fear that plenty of local economies will just hollow out: “businesses will leave, and places might fall into deprivation”.Homeowners at risk of flooding currently benefit from the Flood Re scheme, which pools risk to make the necessary cover more affordable. But itwill cease in 2039– at which point, to quote from the official blurb, “the insurance market will return to fully risk reflective pricing for flood insurance”. That crystallises the prospect of places simply becoming uninhabitable, which may enter the public consciousness much sooner. “Nobody’s putting pins in the maps and saying, ‘these are places that we think will become uninhabitable – because people won’t be able to get insurance, people won’t be able to sell their houses, and businesses will move out,’” said Neumann. “But I think in the next five or 10 years, it’ll become clear where those places are.”At Brunel University’s Centre for Flood Risk and Resilience,Dr Carola Koenigsounded even more stark. “At some point, some hard decisions have to be made – that certain communities will have to be relocated,” she told me. “Protection becomes so expensive that it’s not worth it, so you have to move communities to safer, higher ground.”Here, though, we collide with a few huge issues. Can anyone imagine such a huge change happening amid a political system as replete with cynicism and climate denial as ours? What about the levels of public spending it would entail? Right now, thinking about this aspect of the future surely prompts another question, about flood defence, protection and resilience: why is there such a huge political silence about these likelihoods, and how all of us might start to prepare for them?Eighteen years ago, I can vividly recall three days I spentdriving along the course of the River Severn, in the midst of the dire floods of 2007. I spoke to people in the Gloucestershire town of Tewkesbury who talked about shoals of goldfish swimming down their street, and the deaths of a father and son who had been killed by the fumes from petrol-powered equipment while they were attempting to pump out the local rugby club. In Gloucester, I remember an afternoon spent on a new-build residential avenue called Cypress Gardens, where a local builder told me that he had passed panicked warnings about its flood vulnerability to the council, only to watch as the development had gone ahead regardless, and then, as a brook that fed the nearby Severn had burst its banks, been hit by a metre of water.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The problem is the rest of us, and how politics and power work to fill us with a completely false sense of security, which flies in the face of one particular part of the climate emergency: the fact that although people living close to rivers and coastlines are particularly vulnerable to inundation, the kind of flash floods that are now a regular event can happen absolutely anywhere.In countries threatened by earthquakes, Neumann reminded me, the public tends to be told about the threats, and readied for action. “But we don’t do that here,” she said. “Our greatest natural hazard is flooding, and we don’t prepare people for it.” As she spoke, she suddenly highlighted all the madness of that everyday fact, and the grave dangers we still seem to be sleepwalking into.John Harris is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsFloodingOpinionExtreme weatherClimate crisisWalesUK weathercommentShareReuse this content"

Just ask Margaret AtwoodRhiannon Lucy CosslettIn a culture of therapy-approved ‘forgiveness’, the author’s new memoir shows how hilarious long-delayed vengeance can beSun 16 Nov 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 16 Nov 2025 12.07 ESTShare“Alot of people have died, so I can actually say these things without destroying somebody’s life. Except for the people whose lives I wish to destroy.” Thus spake Margaret Atwood in arecent interviewabout Book of Lives: A Memoir of Sorts, in a clip that has gone viral. “They deserve it,” she says, of the people she hasn’t said such nice things about. Asked if she likes holding a grudge, she replied: “I don’t have a choice. I’m a Scorpio.”Part of the clip’s appeal is Atwood’s icily sardonic delivery: you can understand why a recent review of her autobiography describes her as “a literary mafia don”, reminding those who have crossed her that she knows who they are, even if they remain unnamed, or pointing out that they may well be dead by now anyway. It reminds me a bit of the writer who once said to me: “If you wait by the bend in the river long enough, the bodies of your enemies will eventually float past”. Not a Buddhist proverb, for obvious reasons.It’s that same wry acknowledgment of the supposed wrongness of one’s own grudge-holding that makes Book of Lives so funny. From Atwood’s response to one hatchet job being the immortal words: “Piss up a rope, wanker”, to her account of hiring an exorcist to banish the possible ghost of her husband’s ex-wife, the woman who unfairly labelled her a “homewrecker”, her vengeance is too hilarious to be judged entirely cold.Though is it revenge, to name and shame those who have wronged us, in the telling of our own stories? There’s a notion that to bear a grudge is somehow petty, and to a certain extent, it is public delight in that pettiness that has made the clip of Atwood take off online. Perhaps it’s the notion that prize-winning, household-name authors should be above such feelings, that there is a certain glee, not to mention comfort in discovering that, like the rest of us, they are nurturing a mental “shit list” of people who have hurt them.I suspect that it’s more than that. In today’s therapy-led culture of forgiveness, closure and moving on, bearing a grudge simply isn’t the done thing. It’s all about processing the crimes that have been done to us and liberating ourselves from the supposed toxicity of our ongoing resentments. We meditate and try to wish “loving kindness” even to those who have been cruel to us. Resentment is unhealthy, supposedly, and makes us bitter. We are supposed to “let it go”. But what if we can’t? Furthermore, what if we don’t want to? What if all this pressure to forgive becomes an additional burden? “I’m trying so hard, but I just can’t forgive her”, a friend said recently, of her narcissistic mother. “Why do you have to forgive her?” I said.Maybe I’m a long way from reaching enlightenment. I don’t think bearing a grudge – which carries a mental load ­– is the same thing as accepting that some things still cause us pain. Besides, it is indeed death, not forgiveness, that liberates the memoirist. Now that they can’t sue you, you can finally have your say, without having to dress it all up as fiction – as Atwood said she did in Cat’s Eye, hermasterful novelabout the lifelong impact of bullying between girls. “It was true that parts of the novel were autobiographical,” Atwood now writes. “I avoided saying so because the chief perp was still alive: she became a teenage friend and we’d kept in touch. But now, she and her immediate family are all dead.” The bully’s name was Sandra.In Cat’s Eye, the bully is Cordelia, and women who have their own Cordelias still break down in tears when they meet Atwood. Such is the legacy of girl-on-girl cruelty, and the recognition that reading Cat’s Eye provokes. My mother gave me a copy of it during my own awful time with bullies. Still, when I think of my first year of secondary school, the image that comes to mind is that of the dark, glacial toilet block in which I’d hide at breaktime, and its blue walls (I have always hated blue walls). I have had many years of therapy. Like Atwood, I understand that the person who bullied me was damaged. Understanding isn’t forgiveness, though, and it doesn’t surprise me that so many people struggle with the latter when their bullies later reach out to them in search of absolution.Atwood may ham up the revenge angle – it’s great fun and excellent marketing. She notes that bearing a grudge isn’t an especially attractive thing in a person (“I struggle against it, but not very hard”). At the same time, her naming of Sandra doesn’t feel petty or gleeful at all. She avoided doing so sooner to avoid hurting her.To be bullied as a child is to feel great shame, and to tell the truth is, I believe, its radical antidote. As someone who has written a memoir herself, I know it’s a process that, when done well, is a continual act of self-interrogation: why am I telling this story? You can always tell when a writer is simply score-settling. In the Book of Lives, something deeper is going on, rooted in the understanding that a long life, even a highly successful one, will always have moments of pain. It doesn’t mean that the pain can’t be funny. Laughing is, after all, all part of the process.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Bode is calling on casting directors to follow Wicked director Jon M Chu’s lead to use disabled actors for disabled roles, and also to cast disabled actors in other roles where the character’s physical ability is not specified.Bode says her experience on the set of Wicked was overwhelmingly positive thanks to the presence of a disability coordinator, Chantelle Nassari, also a wheelchair user, who was tasked with ensuring accessibility on set. “That was one less thing I had to worry about and I could just go in and do the job.” Earlier in her career, Bode says that physical access barriers and a lack of willingness to modify them almost stopped her from performing on stage,“I’ve experienced a lot of inaccessibility in general throughout my life,” she says.However, after the release of the first Wicked film in November 2024, Bode was targeted on social media. Boderesponded on TikToksaying : “Not liking Nessa is OK, it’s totally fine because she’s fictional!” : She added: “Aggressive comments and jokes about Nessa’s disability itself is deeply uncomfortable because disability is not fictional, at the end of the day ... It’s not edgy, it’s not funny.”Bode says she is preparing herself for similar backlash after the release ofWicked: For Good. “Unfortunately, I kind of do expect that [again].” Bode says she hopes that audiences will recognise the character’s motives, her longing for independence, and her desire to be loved. “I understand her deeply, and I wish other people also could see those nuances as well.”View image in fullscreen‘I understand her deeply’ … Marissa Bode as Nessarose with Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba in Wicked.Photograph: Giles Keyte/APAs an indication of progress, Bode points to a key change that the film version of Wicked made to a scene in the stage musical. In the original, Elphaba casts a magic spell on her sister’s ruby slippers, enabling Nessarose to stand up from her wheelchair and walk; the scene has been widely criticised forpromoting the ableist narrativethat disabled people need to be fixed.In Wicked: For Good, the scene underwent a minor change: instead of being able to walk again, Nessa’s shoes give her the ability to float, a feeling she has been wanting to relive since she fell in love in the previous film. “I feel Nessa comes off maybe a little bit more one-dimensional in the stage version,” Bode says. “That [change] is something I really appreciate … I think it just adds so much more humanisation to Nessa.”She adds: “Disabled characters deserve to be complex and deserve to be not just one thing. It is this weird cycle of disability being portrayed as bad or society sees disability as bad, therefore it’s projected on to disabled people.”Earlier this month, Bode receivedthe Christopher Reeve acting awardat the 2025Media Access awards, a celebration of disability representation in the media. The honour aims to support up-and-coming disabled actors. Despite such prizes, unawareness about disability persists in the industry. “I do my best to hold a lot of empathy for those that do get it wrong,” says Bode, “We just don’t have any education surrounding disability or the type of language that is appropriate or that we should use.”To combat this, Bode suggests that people should seek out more information surrounding disability. She credits prominent disabled figures and content creators such asCrutches and Spice,Aariana Rose Phillip, andAubrey Smallswith inspiring her to use her voice and “just be more unapologetic about it”.In the future, Bode wants to see more disabled people making their own art. “I think it’s important that we are telling our own stories a lot of the time,” says Bode, encouraging producers to hire and cast disabled actors, writers and crew. “There’s a great community out there.”Explore more on these topicsFilmWicked: For GoodDisabilityActivismWickedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’d seen Steve Harley on Top of the Pops and liked his look, with the mascara and bowler hat, like Alex from A Clockwork Orange. One day, me and my mates decided to cycle to Salisbury Plain. I had a transistor radio tied to the handlebars and Judy Teen came on. Unfortunately, the batteries ran out when we got to Swiss Cottage [in north London] … and my legs ran out at the same time!The first single I boughtThe Wall Street Shuffle by 10cc, from Woolworths in Camden Town. Later on, we used to pinch records, but I paid my dues for a while.The song I do at karaokeI normally have a go at (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman by Aretha Franklin. It’s a big song, man. But I’m never shy. When I do karaoke, it’s usually like: “Dad, get off, for fuck’s sake.”The best song to play at a partyFor dancing, Teardrops by Womack & Womack. It’s so simple, so uplifting. The wildest party I’ve ever thrown? We once had an end-of-tour party in Australia. All I can remember is our saxophone player chasingDuffy’s backing singers round a gigantic polystyrene volcano in his underpants.The song I can no longer listen toSomeone showed me an interview I did with Smash Hits. And I’d said: “There’s no way I’ll still be playing Baggy Trousers when I’m an old man of 30.” Those words still ring in my ears at 64 years old. But because the band took a long time out, I enjoy it more now.The song I secretly like, but tell everybody I hateWhite Flag by Dido. The lyric is, like, “I’m not going to let this shit sink me”, which is quite moving when you’ve had a couple and Chelsea have lost.The best song to have sex toI’ve heard there are rock stars who listen to their own records. I find that disturbing. Can you imagine popping on House of Fun? For me, the most romantic song is Marvin Gaye’s What’s Going On. That is so sensual, shall we say, without getting too lurid.The song that changed my lifeI heard Prince Buster’s Al Capone in a pool hall on Tottenham Court Road and loved the energy, humour and spirit.

There’s a slinky, strung-out downtown New York theatre trope slipping through the set showcasing her latest release Virgin; subtle nods to Talking Heads’ Stop Making Sense pile up as each song brings a new prop and body to clamber across tabletops in euphoric abandon.Drum machines drop into Royals, then cameras zoom in on analogue synths tangled in patch cables for Broken Glass. Behind Ella Yelich-O’Connor, screens flicker in a fast-paced blur of electric blue, her projection shattered into pixelated 8-bit dots like a Windows screensaver. “You tasted my underwear, I knew we were fucked,” she confides in Current Affairs, stripping down to her grey Calvin Klein boxers.Everything about the current Ultrasound tour is viscerally kinetic, as if someone pressed fast-forward on an early-2000s DVD. One moment, she sprawls on the raised stage, kicking her legs like a teenage girl in bed, the next, she paces on a treadmill, crying into the bouncy ballad Supercut. There’s an emphasis on the body: dancers clasp handheld cameras, filming her midriff wired to the screens, sweat beading under the lights. The lens twists, holding the contours of Lorde’s body in a small reclamation of self. “I’m a little starstruck by you,Manchester,” she shouts.Clearblue stuns. She grips a vocoder to her chest Imogen Heap-style, her duct-tape bra catching the strobes as she performs intimately to an adoring crowd. At the end of the night, an outfit change sees Lorde walk through fans in a luminous bike-reflector jacket, holding on to a member of the audience as he sings David. The live feed glitches between her soft face and a pre-recorded image, a digital echo of tonight’s performance and her past. Lorde truly captures intimacy and nostalgia like no other.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

As ITVX streams every single episode, we look back at its highlightsStuart HeritageSun 16 Nov 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 16 Nov 2025 16.10 ESTShareVery quietly, ITVX is making a case for itself as one of the best streaming services around. All of Lost is there. All of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is there. It’s the only place in the UK to watch every episode ofDocumentary Now, which is quite possibly the best show streaming anywhere. As of last month, you can even use ITVX to watchSpace Live – 4K footage of Earth seen from the International Space Station, a spectacle exactly as stunning as it sounds.And, if that wasn’t enough, now there’s Byker Grove too. Last month it was announced that ITV had secured the rights to the show, which originally aired on BBC One, and as of Sunday it will host all 18 series. If you’re as old and creaky as I am, it will provide you with a near fatal dose of nostalgia.Perhaps you had to be there. But if you were, then Byker Grove was a mainstay of your childhood. A fixture of CBBC, back in the glory days when CBBC aired on BBC One, it was a soapy teen drama about the comings and goings of a Newcastle youth club. If you hadgrown up watching Grange Hill, with its backbone of stern authority, the show felt like a blast of fresh air.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: ITVWhere Grange Hill was always partly about the teachers, Byker Grove – with the exception of one bafflingly bearded manager we’ll come to soon – was all about the children. They mucked around. They came of age. They got into trouble. They had accents that were fun to replicate on the playground the following morning.I was nine when the first episode of Byker Grove aired, and the irreverence of it was palpable. The theme tune was, and remains, a banger. The opening titles were full of iconography – acid-era smileys, skateboard wheels, crushed Coke cans – that showed none of the paternalism often seen in shows of this ilk. And the show itself was full of kids unafraid to talk back to grownups – which is always exciting to watch.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: ITVAnd because it aired after 5pm (the quasi-watershed after which television was allowed to be marginally grittier), it was allowed to deal with serious issues. There were storylines about abuse and abortion and drug addicts being attacked in their squats. There was the first gay kiss ever seen on British children’s TV. And – thanks to one horrific moment that will for ever linger in the hearts of anyone who saw it – there was also a strong message about the need for safety goggles when playing paintball.Plus, people died. They actually died, and in grisly ways too. Car crashes, murders, brain tumours, electrocutions. In the case of Geoff Keegan, the aforementioned manager whose dramatically furry, chinless W-shaped beard became an important part of British iconography, his death in a gas explosion felt like watching one of your parents explode. This was strong fare for children to swallow, and it was all the better for it.Of course, as fun as Byker Grove was, its legacy as a star-maker has long been the thing that cemented it. The number of future celebrities who passed through the show has become legendary. It’s where Ant and Dec got their big break, famously, as PJ and Duncan. But it also gave a leg up to Jill Halfpenny, Donna Air, and Charlie Hunnam, as well as a fleet of actors from Hollyoaks and Emmerdale. Catherine Johnson (who wrote Mamma Mia) and Matthew Graham (who co-created Life on Mars) wrote for Byker Grove. Tom Hooper of The King’s Speech and, less impressively, Cats directed episodes.Obviously you are not going to park yourself down and watch all 344 episodes of Byker Grove. A lot of its early daring has dated hugely by now. What was thrilling when I was nine now often comes off as slow and pondering. But if you want to cherrypick the best episodes, it’s a brilliant resource to have at your disposal.Share your questions for Meera Sodha, Tim Dowling and Stuart HeritageRead moreYou could head to season nine and watch the aftermath of Flora’s death from a brain tumour, which was as harrowing a depiction of grief as children’s television has ever made. If you’re feeling brave enough to endure the generation-traumatising sight of Ant fromAnt and Decbeing permanently blinded in a paintball accident, then go straight to series four episode 20. And if you want to have your mind blown clean out of your skull, allow me to direct you to the finale, in which – and I promise I’m not making this up – the characters come to realise that they do not actually exist and blow up the Grove with a bomb to prove that they have free will.Whatever you choose, though, it’s just nice to have Byker Grove back. If nothing else, those of us who grew up watching it can now show the paintball episode to our children, and continue the generational cycle of trauma.Byker Grove is on ITVX now.Explore more on these topicsChildren's TVTelevisionAnt and DecfeaturesShareReuse this content"

My novel set out to explore these contradictionsAlice JollySun 16 Nov 2025 07.00 ESTShareIn 2015, I decided to write a novel about Dr Hans Asperger, who worked at the University Children’s Hospital in Vienna during the second world war. My interest was sparked by two nonfiction books: NeuroTribes: The Legacy ofAutismand How to Think Smarter About People Who Think Differently by Steve Silberman and In a Different Key: The Story of Autism by John Donvan and Caren Zucker.Reading these stories told about Asperger, you would have thought they were talking about two different people. To Silberman, Asperger was a compassionate and original thinker, whereas Donvan and Zucker depict him as an enthusiastic supporter of Hitler. For a historical novelist, widely differing accounts of the same person are gold dust, and I began to dig deeper.Asperger became famous as the result of a thesis he wrote during the second world war that contains a description of what we now categorise as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). His work was lost for decades but in 1980 it was rediscovered by British psychiatrist Dr Lorna Wing. Asperger was posthumously claimed as “the father of neurodiversity”. As I read about the work that he and his colleagues were engaged in at the Vienna children’s hospital, it was clear that their thinking was years ahead of its time and remains relevant today.Questions were being asked about where the line falls between disease and difference. Diagnosis was rejected because each child was genuinely seen as unique. Everything depended on finding the right educational approach and providing “the best sovereign care”.When Asperger signed the paperwork, he must have known it was effectively a death warrantAt the heart of this work were the words of Asperger’s predecessor Erwin Lazar: “What gift is the child offering us?” All of this sounded so caring and empathetic. It couldn’t be true that Asperger was a Nazi collaborator? I set out for Austria to meet Prof Herwig Czech of the University of Vienna, who has spent years researching Austria’s involvement in the medical crimes of the Third Reich. When we met, he was about to publish a paper proving that Asperger had signed paperwork that transferred children to the notorious Am Spiegelgrund (the children’s ward of the Am Steinhof psychiatric hospital where many were murdered) and that he must have known that this was effectively a death warrant.This was in the early days of social media pile-ons, and the online response to Czech’s paper was frenzied. Keyboard warriors swamped the internet with righteous assurances thattheywould never have supported the Nazis. None of these people seemed to have read Czech’s measured paper, which actually clears Asperger of some of the other accusations against him. The messages were so simplistic and vicious that I wanted to walk away.View image in fullscreenAsperger working with children circa 1940.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyWhat Asperger did is beyond defence. But why did so few want to consider the context? This was heavyweight history: controversial, recent. But I knew I had to continue because I needed to tell the stories of the many who were not heroes. “To know all is to forgive all” – but understanding and forgiveness can be decoupled. When I was growing up in England, simplistic second world war narratives were bolstered by endless films. We were the good guys, we won. Victors’ justice obliterated nuance. But millions across continental Europe were bystanders or active collaborators. Collaboration is not an aberration; it’s the resisters who are exceptional.I had already read plenty of nonfiction books demonstrating that the they-didn’t-know defence does not hold up. So if people knew, why did they not act? I began to feel that the novel form is actually uniquely able to get beyond the binaries of nonfiction and mine those seams of human nature that we would rather ignore.I knew that my novel would be told in the first person and the present tense. I needed a narrator who was peripheral but close to events, able to see and not see. When I read that Asperger had a patient obsessed by collecting 1,000 matchboxes, I knew I had found that all-important back door into the story. My eponymous matchbox collector is the fictional 12-year-old Adelheid Brunner, whose account of events at the children’s hospital is sometimes deadly accurate but more often wildly unreliable – not because she has any particular condition but because she is human.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

In particular, I wanted to celebrate Dr Josef Feldner. One of Asperger’s colleagues, he hid a young Jewish man in plain sight, merely describing him as “my nephew”. Asperger knew the true identity of the “nephew” but kept silent.So, was Asperger a criminal or a meticulous chronicler of brilliant and original ideas? The answer, of course, is that he was both. We have told ourselves enough stories that serve only to reassure us that we are essentially good. The work of the novel now is to remind us of our shared darkness as well as our light and to challenge us to find humility when considering those who have been forced to take decisions that – at least for the moment – most of us will never have to make.The Matchbox Girlby Alice Jolly is published by Bloomsbury.Explore more on these topicsFictionScience and nature booksAutismHistory booksNeurodiversityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On mental health leaflets and in magazine columns, emblazoned on mugs and motivational posters. All this is the result of more than two decades’ research in positive psychology which has found that having a “gratitude practice” (usually jotting down three to five things you are thankful for most days) bringsa host of psychological and physical benefits.I don’t want to seem, well, ungrateful. I’m a sceptical historian, but even I was persuaded to take up the gratitude habit, and when I remember to do it, I feel better: more cheerful and connected, inclined to see the good already in my life. Counting your blessings, whether that’s noticing a beautiful sunset or remembering how your neighbour went out of their way to help you earlier, is free and attractively simple. But there’s the problem. In our eagerness to embrace gratitude as a cure-all, have we lost sight of its complexity and its edge?In positive psychology circles, gratitude is generally defined as awholly good thing, a spontaneous feeling of joyful appreciation. But back in 1923, theHarvard psychologist William McDougallbelieved gratitude – especially when directed towards another person, rather than an experience in the more abstract way of, say, being “grateful to be alive” – was far knottier. Yes, there was awe for the generosity of the human spirit, and tender feelings towards the person who had given up their time to help. But there were also quiet feelings of envy or embarrassment, a sense of the “superior power” of the helper and even what he called “negative self-feeling” but which today we’d call “low self‑esteem”. The Japanese expressionarigata-meiwaku(literally: “annoying thanks”) gets to the heart of what he meant.Arigata-meiwakuis the feeling you have when someone insists on performing a favour for you, even though you don’t want them to, yet convention dictates you must be grateful anyway. There’s a reason all this feels so annoying: being grateful throws off the balance of power and increases feelings of obligation. There’s your benefactor at the top, bathed in a sunshine glow of generosity. And there’s you, at the bottom, doffing your cap.This connection between power and the demand for gratitude reaches into many parts of lifeIt might seem mean-spirited to focus on how being thankful can also obligate, diminish or confuse us. But as #feelingblessed becomes a performative norm, these aspects of gratitude are even more important to understand, particularly for the role they play in how hierarchies are reinforced in our world. One of the bleakest tales about compulsory gratitude I have read is that of the 13-year-old orphanEyo Ekpenyon Eyo II. In 1893, he travelled from his home in British-occupied west Africa to take up a scholarship in a missionary school in Colwyn Bay, Wales. Less than six months after arriving, Eyo wrote to his patron, expressing thanks but begging to return home. The cold weather had made him sick, and he feared for his life, a reasonable worry since three west African pupils had already died at Colwyn Bay.Eventually Eyo did secure a passage home, but not before the British press got hold of the story. In a vicious outpouring, they called him “spoilt” and “ungrateful”, a “little prince”, their language soaked in colonial assumptions about who ought to feel grateful to whom. Not much has changed. InThe Ungrateful Refugeethe author Dina Nayeri describes how, as a child refugee from Iran, she was expected to feel “so lucky, so humbled” to be in the United States. Only later did she understand how this “politics of gratitude” had subtly worked to transform her human right to refuge into a gift, one that had to be repaid by staying submissive and uncomplaining, being a “good immigrant” who stayed in her lane.This connection between power and the demand for gratitude reaches into many parts of life. Whenpeople in high-power positionsare made to feel insecure, for instance by having their failings pointed out, they commonly berate those who they perceive as inferior to them for being ungrateful. It was hard not to think of this as Donald Trump and JD Vance took Volodymyr Zelenskyy to task forfailing to show sufficient gratitudeearlier this year (or in 2023, when then-defence UK secretary, Ben Wallace,made a similar demand).These costs are part of what psychologists now call the “dark side” of gratitude. One common objection to the gratitude movement is that it risks“toxic positivity”, encouraging people to ignore and repress more painful feelings. But feeling thankful can lead to other dangers, too. People aremore likely to transgress moral codeson behalf of someone else if they feel grateful to them. Members of historically marginalised groups, including women and LGBTQ+ people, areless likely to complain about unfair treatmentif they are reminded first how lucky they are compared with the past. And, asstudies with women in abusive relationships show, when people have been gaslit into believing they cannot survive without an abuser, gratitude makes them feel obliged to stay. Should all those coffee cups and motivational posters come with caveats and health warnings?This is a lot to think about while trying to jot down three things you feel grateful for so you can go to sleep. But I don’t think we need to throw the baby out with the bathwater. The lessons of the latest research remind us that, like all emotions, feeling grateful is neither wholly good nor wholly bad. Too little, and we risk being entitled or rude, alienating those who try to help us. Too much, and we may leave ourselves open to exploitation by amplifying the power someone holds over us. Context, as always, is everything.There are strategies that help mitigate the risk. Focusing on circumstances rather than individuals (broadly, feeling gratefulfororthat, rather than gratefulto) can side-step the issue of power. And if you notice a boss, parent, friend or partner expecting more gratitude than you want to give, you might ask yourself why. What might seem like ungrateful behaviour in our hierarchical world may really be an act of self-preservation, even one of political defiance (“How can you thank a man for giving you what’s already yours?” asMalcolm Xsaid).And sometimes gratitude does need to have an expiration date. When I spoke to the artistBrian Lobel, who experienced cancer as a young person and now creates rituals for others as they move into post-cancer life, he said “for all we feel thankful, sometimes we have to release ourselves from the burden, to move on with our lives”. Gratitude is important. But so is paying attention to its limits. Feeling better? You can thank me later.Tiffany Watt Smith is a historian and author ofBad Friend: A Century of Revolutionary Friendships (Faber).Further readingThe Ungrateful Refugeeby Dina Nayeri (Canongate, £10.99)Smile Or Dieby Barbara Ehrenreich (Granta, £10.99)Toxic Positivityby Whitney Goodman (Orion, £14.99)Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingThe big ideaPsychologyMental healthSocial trendsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Benjamin Britten’s Violin Concerto was written from 1938-39, his backdrop; the beginnings of the second world war, Britten – a pacifist – moving to the US with his lover Peter Pears, and the death of the composer’s mother. All these things have found their way into Marston’s piece, Against the Tide, and all for the better.William Bracewell plays the unnamed protagonist, his dancing instinctive as ever, the whorls of his mind played out in the twisting and untangling of his body. Here come military men, with rigid demeanour and clenched fists, and Matthew Ball with satin shirt and seduction; there is Bracewell torn between duty, beauty and freedom. You can feel his torment, it reads like one long dark night of the soul.View image in fullscreenA giant happy sigh … Everywhere We Go by Justin Peck.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe partnering between Bracewell and Ball is beautifully done, endlessly inventive, their bodies on convoluted trajectories that might lead to a fish dive of sorts, or a tender moment nuzzling foreheads. Marston’s choreography is never predictable but always human. Melissa Hamilton appears as the spirit of Bracewell/Britten’s mother. The score brings heightened senses, the astringent sounds of rattled nerves, ominous brass. Chloe Lamford has designed a fantastic set, a grey slate bridge rising across the stage, heavy and hopeful at the same time.Best foot forward: Justin Peck’s Royal Ballet debut – in picturesRead moreThe rest of the programme showcases two American choreographers who were/are very comfortable to just dancing to great music.George Balanchinebuilt his career on it, and Justin Peck, the inheritor of Balanchine’s flame, is following suit. Both delight in the joy of pure dance, at speed, with intricate detail. In Peck’s piece, Everywhere We Go, the dancers repeatedly move on the “and”, ahead of the bar line, raring to go.Peck is the pre-eminent US ballet choreographer of the 21st century, but surprisingly, this is the first time the Royal has performed his work, and they dance it well: preppy, perky, jaunty, tightly drilled, as Peck scrolls through different permutations of dancers to a busily orchestrated score bySufjan Stevens. There are gorgeous interventions for the whole group, as when dancers leap en masse with arms sweeping the sky then fall to Earth, it’s like a giant happy sigh. Marianela Nuñez brings her magnanimity to a slow section, with the music pared back to emotive repetition; puckish Daichi Ikarashi flies through the fast bits with infectious delight.View image in fullscreenDiaphanous … Serenade by George Balanchine.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianBalanchine’s Serenade, from 1935, has one of the most arresting openings in ballet: the charged Tchaikovsky chords, the curtain raised on a stageful of women in long tulle skirts, hands raised to the sky. It begins like a ballet class, but it is both academic and escapist, at best the dancers diaphanous and vivacious – Leticia Dias captures it perfectly. It’s the epitome of Balanchine’s famous “ballet is woman” quote. Although since his death there’s been some reappraisal of Balanchine’s attitudes towards women, and it’s hard to watch the scene where three sylphs let down their long hair and surround lone man Ryoichi Hirano without imagining it as Balanchine’s after-hours fantasy. But there’s no denying it’s very beautiful.At theRoyal Opera House, London, until 2 DecemberExplore more on these topicsBalletDanceRoyal BalletRoyal Opera HouseGeorge BalanchineSufjan StevensCathy MarstonreviewsShareReuse this content"

Now she’s back in the UK to star alongside Bryan Cranston in All My Sons. She talks about the frightening rehearsal schedule, how she’d work again with Mike Leigh in a heartbeat, and why she’s taking up boot-makingSun 16 Nov 2025 05.00 ESTShareMarianne Jean-Baptiste arrives at the rehearsal space in  Southwark, south London, and immediately announces that she’s exhausted. It wouldn’t be surprising if nerves were getting the better of her; she’s seven days into a three-week rehearsal period for a new production of Arthur Miller’s All My Sons, which is brutally short by anyone’s standards. Peeling off unnecessary layers of clothes – it’s not a cold morning – she says jet lag has been messing with her circadian rhythms since she flew in from Los Angeles 10 days ago. “I woke up at 3.17am and was like: fucking hell, it’s early. I lay there for a while, running lines from the play in my head. Then I thought: ‘Just get up and marinate the chicken.’ I made some ginger and lemon tea and finally went back to bed at 5.30am – better to rest and meditate even if I couldn’t sleep.” She was just dropping off when the alarm went off at 7am.These days it takes a lot to lure Jean-Baptiste away from her home in Los Angeles, where she has lived with her husband and two daughters full-time since 2003. She loves coming back to her native London to see family and friends, but LA has a slower pace, optimism, a vast ocean – and, for a long time, it offered better opportunities to work. Her breakthrough role as the optometrist in search of her birth mother in the 1996Mike Leighfilm Secrets & Lies brought a Golden Globe nomination and she became the first Black British woman to be nominated for an Academy Award. She memorably played Doreen Lawrence in the 1999 TV movie The Murder of Stephen Lawrence, but then – nothing much. Most offers of work came from the US.Between 2002 and 2009, Jean-Baptiste appeared in the American police procedural Without a Trace, but we pretty much didn’t see her again on British TV screens till she turned up as the killer’s defence barrister in the second season of Broadchurch in 2015. If you were lucky, you might have caught her in the National Theatre revival of the James Baldwin playThe Amen Cornerin 2013 or in Debbie Tucker Green’sHangat the Royal Court in London two years later. Then, earlier this year, she returned to the big screen with a bang, finally reuniting with Mike Leigh inHard Truths. Watching her raging, resentful yet blazingly funny performance as Pansy reminded us of exactly what we’ve been missing.It was a joy to hear that she was returning to the London stage in All My Sons, a play she admired as a student at Rada but has never seen on stage. The drama revolves round the Keller family: the father, Joe, has been falsely exonerated after selling defective plane parts to the US military, leading to the death of 21 American pilots; the mother, Kate, described by Miller as “a woman of uncontrolled inspirations and an overwhelming capacity for love”, is convinced that her son Larry, MIA, is still alive; their other son, Chris, wants to marry Larry’s former girlfriend, Ann. As an exploration of guilt, loyalty, the destructive nature of capitalism and (coincidentally) secrets and lies, it’s as relevant now as when it was first performed on Broadway in 1947.Yet, when she was sent the offer to play Kate, Jean-Baptiste asked director Ivo van Hove if she could take time to consider. “It’s never easy spending six months away from home,” she says, sipping strong tea. “It has to be worth not being able to paint, garden, cook, write, walk my dogs. But Ivo is a great director, and it was an opportunity to work with Bryan Cranston, who plays Joe. Bryan worked with Ivo onNetworkat the National Theatre, so we met in LA to discuss the process. He told me that Ivo doesn’t talk much; it’s very instinctive. He works with actors who come in with their ideas about the character, which he then moulds and shapes. Whenever I do theatre, I always end up wondering why I said yes to the terror. It’s delightfully terrifying, though.”I love the fact that I care so much. If you don’t feel like that, go home. Do something elseVan Hove, who won a Tony award in 2016 for directing Arthur Miller’s A View from the Bridge, was mesmerised by Jean-Baptiste’s performance as Pansy. “Hard Truths is a masterpiece,” he tells me. “When I saw Marianne doing a merciless impersonation of a woman plagued by demons and in a constant emotional rage, I called our producers and said I found the mother in All My Sons! And I was the luckiest director in the world when she said yes.”Jean-Baptiste may have a reputation as a brilliant character actor, but she works in an industry that doesn’t always understand how to use its talents. When I spoke to her earlier this year for Hard Truths, she said that she has always had to compromise because there’s a lack of multilayered roles for Black women both in the US and the UK. There was so much buzz around her portrayal of Pansy that an Oscar nomination seemed inevitable, but shortly after we met it turned out that the Academy had other ideas, which infuriated critics both here and Stateside (she was also nominated for a Bafta, losing out to Mikey Madison for Anora).View image in fullscreenSons of the stage … Marianne Jean-Baptiste and Bryan Cranston.Photograph: Jan VersweyveldAsked about the snub by Interview magazine, Jean-Baptiste, whose humour is bone-dry, said that “Pansy would’ve burned down the Academy building.” Now, Jean-Baptiste is more phlegmatic. Perhaps still frustrated, but certainly not sorry for herself. “I try to avoid the word ‘should’. Yes, I could have got those nominations and awards. You know what, it might sound flipping sappy, but I’ve had the opportunity to do two films in my life – Secrets & Lies and Hard Truths – which prompt people to stop me on the street to say they decided to search for their birth mother or make contact with their sister after 10 years [Pansy has a fractious relationship with her sister Chantelle, played by Michele Austin]. When you get that kind of validation, nothing can touch it.”Not even an Oscar? “A little gold dolly would be lovely, don’t get me wrong. I grew up on BBC dramas that were about the people and for the people. That’s what Mike does so well.” Jean-Baptiste first worked with Leigh on his 1993 play It’s a Great Big Shame! and says that she would “work with him again in a heartbeat, for nothing. In fact, I’ll pay him!” They met a few days earlier, in fact, for a natter. “I was talking to him about the play, wondering why they picked me. He said: ‘Well, that’s obvious, they couldn’t get anyone else.’ That’s our relationship.”Jean-Baptiste admits that doubt seeps into her mind. Van Hove is known for both his avant-garde productions and a tight rehearsal time of about six weeks, which makes this three-week period for All My Sons feel absurdly short. A week in, Jean-Baptiste is still learning the other actors’ rhythms – alongside Cranston’s Joe, Paapa Essiedu is Chris and Hayley Squires is Ann – and sharing her doubt. “I was telling Hayley that I slipped up on one line and was convinced that they’d have a word with me afterwards and tell me that they were thinking of finding someone else to play Kate. She had exactly the same fear! We were laughing about it, but I love the fact that I care so much. If you don’t feel like that, go home. Do something else.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I’ve got an insatiable appetite for creativity … I've got to be doing thingsThe joke is that Jean-Baptiste very easily could do something else. Growing up in Peckham, south London, in the 70s with an Antiguan care-worker mother and a St Lucian labourer father, Jean-Baptiste attended theatre workshops until taking up a place at Rada. She has wanted to act for as long as she can remember, but the truth is that it’s just one of several creative endeavours. She composed the music for the score of Mike Leigh’s 1997 film Career Girls and sings on the soundtrack (Leigh once told me that she has “a beautiful voice”). She is currently writing a script about grief, which she “has parked” as All My Sons is infused with grief and she wants all her attention to be on the play.She also has a studio in her LA garden where she paints. I ask to see some of her work, before briefly panicking that it might be awful and am then stunned when she shows me a portrait of Leigh on her phone – it’s good enough to hang in the National Portrait Gallery. “I left it in Mike’s trailer in a lovely box as a wrap present at the end of the Hard Truths shoot and he came to me, wild-eyed, saying that it looked just like him. It’s the best compliment I could have got.”Is there anything else she can do, I ask, half joking. She laughs. “Well … I can cook. Garden. Knit. Sew. I’ve got an insatiable appetite for creativity. I’m like: I’ve gotta know how to do this! It’s not like a neurotic energy because I’m very laid-back. It’s about greed; I’ve got to be doing things. I signed up for a boot-making course in a technical college in downtown LA and then the bloody pandemic happened. I’m just waiting for a window to sign up again.”We talk, briefly, about the US. She says that she lives “in a blue bubble where everybody is nice and sane, apart from a few nutters”. She has talked before about the David and Goliath nature of film-making in which indie cinema is the underdog; Trump’s threat to impose 100% tariffs on “any and all movies” made abroad could pretty much destroy indie films.“It’s rough out there for sure,” she says. “It’s very difficult to be an artist in this kind of environment. It’s all about the money and the number of likes something gets on social media. I really love it when a director makes a fantastic film, and the next film isn’t so good because they’re trying to do something different. I’m not sure the movie industry understands that any more.”Mark Kermode on… director Mike Leigh, who mines the comedy and tragedy of lifeRead moreFor now, Jean-Baptiste is focusing on All My Sons. I ask if her friends are all clamouring for tickets and she nods furiously. “Oh my God! I’ve got people here, in Europe, in the States, all asking the best date to come. I don’t know! Or they say the play is going to be brilliant. Don’t say that! We don’t know that yet. Pressure. Pressure. Pressure. Fucking hell! But it’s great people want to come.”I tell her that I can’t wait to see it. “I can’t wait to be in it! Well, I can. I could do with two more weeks of rehearsals. But we did Hard Truths in three months and look how well that turned out. So, you know … it’s all good!” The sun suddenly streams into the room and Jean-Baptiste smiles.All My Sonsis at Wyndham’s theatre, London, to 7 March.Explore more on these topicsMarianne Jean-BaptisteIvo van HoveMike LeighinterviewsShareReuse this content"

We can’t wait to share its story with visitors.”The astrolabe, made of a type of bronze, was found in about 1990 in the wreck of a Spanish ship that sank off Pednathise Head, part of Scilly’s uninhabited Western Rocks. The Scilly archipelago, 30 miles off the British mainland, is infamous for shipwrecks.View image in fullscreenThe Western Rocks of Isles of Scilly where the Pednathise Head astrolabe was found.Photograph: Isles of Scilly MuseumIt is not known what the unnamed ship was doing there but it is thought to have been lost at about the time of the Spanish Armada’s attempt to overthrow Elizabeth I in 1588.The Pednathise Head astrolabe was not complete but relatively few are known to survive worldwide and the intrigue around them helps make them valuable artefacts.Philip Pullman saw examples at theHistory of Science Museum in Oxfordand, in theHis Dark Materialsseries, based the look of themystical truth-telling device the alethiometeron the astrolabe.The Scilly astrolabe was sold and then vanished. It has now been established that at some point it was misidentified as another astrolabe found on a ship called the Nassau, a Dutch vessel that sank off Malaysia in 1606.It is known to have been in the collection of a man from South Australia but was seized by the state when he was convicted of serious crimes.The astrolabe was subsequently mentioned in a chat group by an Australian antiques dealer who said he had paid “peanuts” for it and it was worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.View image in fullscreenLydia Bassett, the director of Scilly Arts & Heritage, with the Pednathise Head astrolabe.Photograph: Isles of Scilly MuseumCuriously, it then found its way into the collection of a car dealer in New Jersey who donated it tothe Mel Fisher Maritime Museum inthe Florida Keys.A US expert on astrolabes, James Jobling, realised it was the Scilly astrolabe. There were two more stops for it – his laboratory in Texas and the National Maritime Museum in Falmouth, Cornwall – before it arrived back in Scilly.It will take pride of place as the centrepiece of a navigation case at the islands’ revamped museum on the most populous island, St Mary’s, next year.Lydia Bassett, the director of Scilly Arts & Heritage, said: “It’s great timing for us because our museum will open next autumn.“The maritime gallery will tell the story of the many shipwrecks on Scilly. We’re so pleased to have the astrolabe back.”Explore more on these topicsMuseumsnewsShareReuse this content"

Score by Ennio Morricone. Wardrobe by Giorgio Armani. If you can forgive Sean Connery’s Irish accent (by way of Edinburgh), this 1987 period crime drama is a classy joint. Brian De Palma’s vaguely true story of how prohibition-era mafia boss Al Capone – a magnetically chilling Robert De Niro – was brought to book features Kevin Costner as treasury agent Eliot Ness.

He is the Candide of the music business, smiling benignly, strumming and singing, seamlessly pausing for selfies and fist-bumps and high-fives; he almost visibly absorbs energy from the saucer-eyed fan-worship shown by gobsmacked passersby and radiates it back at them.Maybe you have to be a Sheeran fan to really appreciate it, but this is another single-take bravura special from film-maker Philip Barantini (who directed Netflix’s searing single-take dramaAdolescence) and his director of photography Nyk Allen. With no cuts (though there’s an allowable fast-forward bit, and the audio might have been tweaked in post-production) they follow the unselfconscious Ed as he completes a late-afternoon soundcheck at the New York theatre where he’s playing a concert later on, and then for the next hour, and with fans pretty much always swarming around him, he wanders through the city with his guitar for various encounters, some planned, some (supposedly) not.At one point Sheeran plays a song when a mate of his proposes marriage to his girlfriend, then he stages an impromptu gig on a tourist bus, then performs at a rooftop birthday party (there is a hilariously uncomfortable scene riding up in the lift in silence with a baffled non-fan businessman) and at a pub where he jams with some more friends. Then he grooves his way on to the subway to play on a train – and then, without a glitch, finds himself back outside the theatre. We follow behind as he glides through the foyer and triumphantly bops through the packed auditorium and up on to the stage to start the concert.As ever, Barantini pulls off some magical camera moves (the same that, during Adolescence, had cinephiles comparing him toRussian camera wizard Sergei Urusevsky). By being passed smoothly from handheld operators to drones and back again, the camera floats miraculously through enclosed interior spaces and out into the wide-open skies. The city streets and the theatre make this look a bit like Alejandro González Iñárritu’s single-take filmBirdman (Or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance), which also may have influenced Barantini a bit. The team of camera operators and crew remain invisible (though I think I glimpsed one on the subway); the production assistants who presumably have to get people to sign release forms are similarly discreet.There are, of course, some moments when the spontaneity looks suspect. At the beginning, Sheeran tries to hail a cab, misses it, and then hails another one which pulls over for him; this cab driver lets the camera into his vehicle without commenting on it. Hmm. Then there’s a purely outrageous scene when Ed happens to chance upon his friend Camila Cabello at the wheel of her car. “What are you doing in New York?” she gasps, a moment that isn’t going to get her any acting nominations. Ed explains and asks for a lift which Cabello gives him, and they have a bit of a James Corden-style carpool karaoke before she drops him off. What a bit of luck to find her! But Sheeran beams his way through it all, inexhaustibly.One Shot: Ed Sheeran is onNetflixfrom 21 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsEd SheeranNetflixreviewsShareReuse this content"

Simultaneously, Jackson also broke records for receiving 116m views in 24 hours for the trailer of a new biopic, Michael, set for release in April.Millions of fans may be excited and primed for a Jackson biopic. For comparison, the trailer beat outTaylor Swift’s Eras tour preview and it will join a procession of recent music biopics about Bruce Springsteen,Amy Winehouse, Bob Dylan, Elvis Presley and Elton John. The most successful of all – the Freddie Mercury and Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody – took in nearly a billion dollars at the box office.But are moviegoers truly ready for Jackson to moonwalk back into their lives? It’s only six years since Leaving Neverland, a Netflix documentary that examined the claims of two men who allege they were abused as children by the singer, and nine since another, Off the Wall, examined his rise as an extraordinary solo performer.Michael: first trailer unveiled for controversial Michael Jackson biopicRead moreJackson, who was acquitted of all child sexual abuse charges after a 14-week criminal trial in 2005, remains a potent force, and his legacy is subjected to opposing forces: one that would celebrate his musical and performing talents, and another that would notate it but caution against further celebration in light of the accusations against him. Jackson and his estate have always denied the claims.“I would not want to bet against people’s love ofMichael Jackson,” says Dan Green, professor of entertainment management at Carnegie Mellon University, pointing to the hit Jackson Cirque du Soleil show in Las Vegas and the hit Broadway musical MJ.“I think there’s going to be a lot of interest around it and I would expect it to do really well.”The Jackson biopic stars Jaafar Jackson, a nephew of the singer and son of Jermaine – proving that showbiz to the Jackson clan was never nothing less than a family enterprise.The film, directed by Antoine Fuqua (Training Day), promises to tell “the story of Michael Jackson’s life beyond the music, tracing his journey from the discovery of his extraordinary talent as the lead of the Jackson Five, to the visionary artist whose creative ambition fueled a relentless pursuit to become the biggest entertainer in the world”.The producer Graham King, who also produced Bohemian Rhapsody, told CinemaCon last year that he would deliver “to the audience a film like they’ve never seen before. When you mention his name, everyone has an opinion.”The $150m production’s release was delayed when the filmmakers were forced to reshoot the last third of the movie after a challenge to a legal agreement with Jordan Chandler, a Jackson accuser who reached an out-of-court settlement with the singer for $23m in 1994, rendering part of what had already been filmed unusable.How far Michael goes in addressing the claims against Jackson, or how far it goes in addressing the effect of those claims – he died in 2009 of poisoning by the anesthetic propofol administered nightly so he could sleep – is unclear.“I think we’re being asked to bifurcate,” says Green. “So many of us live in our own echo chambers, we’re going to keep planning for our own aspects of it. The Jackson estate isn’t doing this because it needs a few extra bucks. It’s doing it because people still want to see this.”Jeff Jampol, who manages legacy rock estates including those of Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin and Charlie Parker, and acts as a consultant to the Jackson estate, points out that a theatrically released biopic is the “best possible vehicle” for boosting an artist’s cultural legacy – regardless of any profit or loss.“Remember, we wear a different hat to the film-maker. They’re looking to spend $20m to make $40m. We’re looking to connect a legacy to future generations. Even if the film makes no money theatrically, the resultant buzz, talk and publicity is more than worth it,” he said.In that sense, the job of an estate manager or adviser is to identify what made that artist or act popular in the culture in the first place “and put it back into the pop culture conversation in a way that’s meaningful, credible and authentic to 11-to-30-year-olds”, Jampol says. “They then pick it up and the legacy moves forward. Remember, Light My Fire is a brand-new song to a 12-year-old.”Jackson fans, he adds, “are so connected, fanatical and devoted. They still organize flash mobs to this day. Michael’s legacy was never about merely being ‘cool’, per se; it was about his artistry and his connection to people. He was unique, and he wore his heart on his sleeve.”Ultimately, Jampol says, when managing an artist “with a lot drama or swirling accusations” around them, a biopic is still valuable.“But what story does the director of the Michael Jackson biopic want to tell?” he asks. “And in telling that story, will it include any allegations, will it include his relationship with his father? Will it include his death, or his doctor, Conrad Murray? I don’t know. We will find out.”Explore more on these topicsMichael JacksonBiopicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The revamp was intended to capture the spirit of bygone Kraków, especially the cafes and restaurants that proliferated between the first and second world wars. The aesthetic is also inspired by two legendary midcentury hotels, Cracovia and Forum, and Kino Kijów, a cinema that is still open today. There is lots of pale oak panelling, natural stone, handmade glass and ceramics, and local art. Rooms have retro radios and Bauhaus-inspired furniture.

Food styling: Natasha Piper.Felicity Cloake's masterclassFoodHow to make risotto alla milanese – recipeJust like Italy’s fashion capital, this saffron-hued dish is elegantly simple and very richFelicity CloakeSun 16 Nov 2025 08.00 ESTShareRisotto alla milanese is, like the city it calls home, elegantly simple, but very rich. The saffron that gives the dish its striking colour is rightly expensive (it takes about 150 flowers to produce a mere gram), but you don’t need much and, though it’s often served alongsideosso buco, I think it makes a fine meal on its own with a bitter-leaf salad.Prep5 minCook30 minServes41 onion75g butter, or 15g butter plus 60g bone marrow350g risotto rice(carnaroli, arborio, vialone nano)1 litre beef stock, or chicken or vegetable stock75ml dry white wine(see step 4)1 level tsp saffron threads75g finely grated parmesan, or grana padano or a vegetarian alternative1 Chop the onion very finelyPeel and finely chop the onion; the aim is for it almost to disappear into the dish, rather than remaining as distinct chunks, so take your time over doing this (you could substitute two shallots, if you prefer – their sweetness works particularly well with the flavour of the wine and cheese).2 Soften the onionView image in fullscreenMelt a generous tablespoon of the butter in a frying pan set over a medium-low heat, then fry the chopped onion until soft, golden and limp, but not coloured.Turn the heat up to medium-high, add the rice and fry, stirring constantly, until the grains are hot and starting to turn translucent around their edges.View image in fullscreen3 A note on the stockMeanwhile, bring the stock to a gentle simmer on the hob. Beef is the traditional choice with osso buco, but you may prefer to use a chicken or vegetable-based example, or simply water down the beef stock for a slightly lighter dish. Conversely, for a beefier result, substitute some of the butter with bone marrow from the butchers.4 Add the wineOnce most of the rice grains are semi-translucent, pour in the wine (it should hiss when it hits the pan) and leave to bubble away until it’s almost all evaporated. You could also use dry vermouth or sherry here, if that’s what you have to hand, or indeed leave out the alcohol altogether, as many local Milanese recipes do.5 Start adding stock bit by bitView image in fullscreenStir in a ladleful of hot stock, then leave to cook until it’s all been absorbed (there’s no need to stir at this point). While you wait for that, lightly crush most of the saffron threads in a mortar (keep a few back to use as a garnish later), then pour in a little of the hot stock and leave to steep and infuse.View image in fullscreen6 Keep adding stockKeep adding ladlefuls of hot stock for about eight minutes, waiting until each one is absorbed before adding the next, and begin stirring the rice as you do so. Keep going until the rice is just a little al dente for your taste; classically, it should still have some bite in the centre, but that’s up to you. If you run out of stock, switch to hot water.7 Flavour with the steeped saffronView image in fullscreenStir in the saffron-infused stock. Risotto should have a loose texture that’s more like porridge or a loose rice pudding than anything capable of holding its own shape; if yours feels a little on the stodgy side, stir in a little more stock or water as your taste dictates (try it before deciding, though, because you might find it rich enough as it is).8 Add butter and cheeseView image in fullscreenAdd the remaining butter or bone marrow to the risotto, along with the grated cheese; grana padano is the local option. Cover and leave to sit for a couple of minutes, then vigorously beat the risotto until it turns creamy. Season to taste (you may well not need any more salt), garnish with the reserved saffron and serve at once in hot shallow bowls.9 A note on getting aheadAlternatively, to get ahead, after the first eight minutes of cooking the rice in stock, spread out the rice in a single layer on a large baking tray. Leave it to cool, then transfer to a suitable container, cover and chill. When you’re ready to eat, simply return the rice to the pan, heat both it and the stock back up and continue with the recipe as written.Explore more on these topicsFoodFelicity Cloake's masterclassRiceCheeseItalian food and drinkWineHerbs and spicesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Yoga trousers and a smart hoodie, but PE kit nonetheless. And, once I arrive at2210 By Natty Can Cook, I realise I am severely underdressed.When chef Nathaniel Mortley announced that he was opening a restaurant that aimed to celebrate Caribbean culture “in style” and to win a Michelin star, his loyalInstagram following, as well as their families and friends, took the brief and dressed accordingly. As fancily plated ackee and saltfish spring rolls passed by, as well asa lotof rum punch, I rustled in my handbag for some bigger earrings and more makeup. “This isn’t dinner, it’s an occasion!” I hissed at Charles when he asked why I was off to the loo to put on some lippy, leaving him with a menu filled with the likes of confit pork belly with scotch bonnet mayo, lobster rasta pasta and carrot and plantain bhajis. By the time I got back, a plate of thin, crisp roti with a highly addictive scotch bonnet butter dip had appeared. One shouldn’t drink butter, but in this instance it’s excusable.View image in fullscreen‘A crispy beast’: 2210 by Natty Can Cook’s ackee and saltfish spring roll.This new restaurant is a natural progression of Mortley’s recent stint atthe Greyhound pubopposite Peckham library, where his red snapper with corn salsa and jerk chicken with brown butter mash quickly earned him a loyal audience. Mortley began cooking as a teenager – his mother’s an accountant and his father a businessman – and he went on to work at the likes ofOblixand Jason Atherton’sCity Social, but then circumstances led him to spend some time at Her Majesty’s Pleasure in Brixton HMP.Dwelling on this prison stint may seem a bit churlish, not least in light of quite how utterly classy 2210 is, but those jail years are a pivotal part of Mortley’s origin story. All cool restaurants these days open with an idyllic, flowery tale about Chef Tarquin floating about Thailand or India, gap-yearing and stealing inspiration, so by contrast, when Mortley speaks about his time atthe Clink, the charity-led, prisoner-run restaurant at Brixton prison, a food writer’s ears are bound to prick up. The Clink, which I frequent from time to time, is a funny old restaurant: you make a booking at least a week in advance, gather in a Portakabin for security checks, and are then escorted into the intimidating womb that is Brixton prison. If you’ve ever watchedPorridge, which was filmed between 1974 and 1977, well, Brixton doesn’t feel much different now, and an atmosphere of hopelessness hangs heavy in the air. Until, that is, you step into a discreet outbuilding where a semi-formal restaurant serving a modern European menu is in full swing. Prisoners cook, prisoners do front of house and, inside these doors, at least, some hope prevails.Mortley threw himself into life at the Clink, and in doing so asked himself some big questions about how he’d ended up locked in a cell, rather than rising to the top of the Caribbean cooking game. Now, umpteen residencies later, he must look out of 2210’s service hatch when service is in full swing and pinch himself at how far his life has turned around.View image in fullscreen‘Elegantly flavoured’: 2210 by Natty Can Cook’s jerk chicken supreme with fried allspice terrine, charred spring onion and mango and pineapple salsa.Charles, my longsuffering dining partner, says 2210 is the best meal out we’ve had this year; for me, it’s definitely up there in the best-of list. That ackee and saltfish spring roll, for example, is a crispy beast filled with rich, moist fish, served on a red pepper velouté and drizzled with a spring onion emulsion. Next up, a lamb belly skewer strewn with a masala reduction and tomatoconcasse. The jerk chicken, meanwhile, is elegantly flavoured with thyme, garlic and cinnamon and comes with a good, sharp mango and pineapple salsa. A particular stand-out is the seared pimento duck breast that’s served with confit duck leg croquette and pumpkin puree.View image in fullscreen‘Highly recommended for your own sense of wellbeing’: Natty Can Cook’s deep-fried apple crumble.Sure, 2210 isn’t by any standards cheap – starters are about £12 and mains hover around the £30 mark – but there’s an attention to detail in every dish that makes this place more than fit for a special occasion. There are only two desserts on offer right now: plantain cake with white chocolate ganache, which is a hunk of sponge with “chocolate snow” and the more humble of the two. Treat that as your starter pudding, then move on to the deep-fried apple crumble, which is large hunks of pickled apples with apple gel and caramelised pecans, all deep-fried and served with coffee chantilly and a split basil creme anglaise. Calories-wise, this is, of course, entirely unnecessary, but for your own sense of wellbeing, I highly recommend it.2210 by Natty Can Cook is much much more than just posh jerk chicken at fancy prices.
